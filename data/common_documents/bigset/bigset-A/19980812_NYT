   WASHINGTON _ Several U.S. embassies have temporarily closed down
routine operations in response to threats made after the terrorist
attacks on the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, State Department
officials said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The officials, speaking on condition that they not be named,
said that the affected embassies included those in Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia and Kampala, Uganda. The embassy in Mbabane, the capital
of the southern African nation of Swaziland, was evacuated for
several hours on Tuesday after a bomb threat. In West Africa, the
U.S. Embassy in the Ivory Coast said it had cut back its business
hours while security was reinforced.
</P>
<P>
   The Cairo office of the Agency for International Development was
also shuttered and its employees moved into the well-fortified U.S.
Embassy in the Egyptian capital.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department also said Tuesday that it had received
informa- tion about possible threats to U.S. targets in Egypt,
Malaysia and Yemen. ``This could include attacks on buildings,''
the department said. The embassies in those places were continuing
to operate, though in some cases at reduced levels. The department
said Americans in those countries ``should exercise caution'' but
it did not issue travel alerts.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they could not recall a similar instance in
recent years in which several U.S. diplomatic installations, which
often get threats of violence, had suspended operations
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has announced a worldwide alert for embassies
and other diplomatic installations after the terrorist attacks last
week. The State Department and Congress have faced criticism since
the attacks that they failed to provide sufficient security for
embassies abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the U.S. diplomatic missions were not given the upgraded
security recommended by a independent commission after the bombing
of the U.S. Embassy and Marine barracks in Bierut in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick F. Kennedy, the assistant secretary of state for
administration, said that the United States was ``not shutting down
embassies in a permanent sense.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that since the bombings last week, the Department and
its overseas posts had received between one dozen and two dozen
threats, including some considered ``copy cat'' threats of
terrorist attacks mimicking those in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not leaving,'' he said. ``We are taking, in effect, a
brief time-out in order to make the security adjustments that are
necessary to be responsive to a threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Another State Department official, speaking on condition that he
not be identified, said that, ``where prudent, we're reducing
staff, we're moving from one building to another, we're reducing
hours.''
</P>
<P>
   But he insisted that Americans living or traveling abroad would
be able to obtain emergency services from all U.S. embassies,
regardless of terrorist threats. ``You will always be able to get
an operator at the embassy and be connected to an a duty officer _
24 hours a day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The department refused to provide a formal list of the shuttered
embassies out of concern that it might be used by terrorist groups
to identify future targets for attack.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I'd prefer not to go into identifying specific embassies,''
Kennedy said at a news conference. ``I think that just probably
leads to more copycat calls.'' The closings, he said, had occurred
in ``several regions'' of the world.
</P>
<P>
   He said the embassies had been closed at the request of
ambassadors or, in their absence, the highest-ranking local U.S.
diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always said to our chiefs of mission that they are
responsible to protect the lives and safety of personnel
overseas,'' Kennedy said. ``If the chief of mission feels that
there is information available to him or her that says, `I must
take a particular step, including potentially briefly suspending
operations until adjustments to the security posture can be made,'
then we feel that is absolutely the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not describe the threats that had prompted the decision
to close some embassies, but he said all were being taken
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a call comes in or whatever it is,'' he said, ``each call
is analyzed and measured and then the post, the ambassador, the
regional security officer, the emergency action committee at the
post does what is appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. official at the U.S. Embassy in Kuala Lumpur, speaking on
condition that he not be identified, said that the embassy closed
its iron gates on Tuesday for all but emergency services for U.S.
citizens. The official said it would remain closed Wednesday in
order for the embassy compound to be ``hardened'' against a
possible terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one thinks of Kuala Lumpur as a terrorist target, but we
want to take every precaution to keep our people safe,'' the
official said. ``I think you'll see additional barricades outside
the embassy later this week, some more barbed wire.''
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials said that the U.S. embassy in Uganda,
which borders both Kenya and Tanzania, was closed Tuesday but was
expected to reopen Wednesday with tightened security measures in
force.
</P>
<P>
   In Cairo, the offices of the Agency for International
Development were closed and its employees moved into the sprawling
compound of the U.S. Embassy, which is considered one of the
best-protected and most security-conscious in the Middle East,
State Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on the embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, has hindered the
conduct of U.S. diplomacy not just in Kenya but across much of East
Africa. The embassy there effectively functioned as a regional
headquarters for the State Department and other U.S. government
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   After the U.S. Embassy in neighboring Sudan was shut down in
February 1996 in response to evidence that the Sudanese government
was harboring anti-American terrorist groups, the embassy staff was
moved to Nairobi, where they worked out of the now-shattered
embassy building. State Department officials said it was unclear
how diplomatic relations with Sudan would be conducted.

WOMEN'S TENNIS NOW A POWER-PACKED SHOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. _ Last weekend at the women's tennis
tournament in Carlsbad, a few of us watched a night-time semifinal
match on TV in the press room, close to our lap-tops. There was
deadline tension until, during a break in the action, a comical
video clip appeared on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   It showed the final point of the 1979 U.S. Open, in which Tracy
Austin beat Chris Evert for the title. They looked ridiculous,
Tracy in her ``Little House on the Prairie'' dress and Chrissy in
her bangs. But that wasn't the funny part.
</P>
<P>
   Austin served. The ball followed the approximate trajectory of
the Gateway Arch. Evert slammed a forehand return. It blooped into
the net. Game, set, match. And doubled-over laughter in the press
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy,'' Austin said sarcastically on TV, where she was doing
the color commentary, ``we really hit the ball hard.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, fans might reasonably have assumed women's tennis was
as good as it could get. At the end of that season, the top five in
the world rankings _ the U.S. Open finalists plus Martina
Navratilova, Evonne Goolagong Cawley and Billy Jean King _ were
once or future No. 1 players, the only time that has happened. And
Andrea Jaeger was on her way up.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, looking back, they were just patting the ball around. Since
that supposed pinnacle, the game has only gotten better. In the
past two decades, no already-prominent sport has changed, just in
the way it's played, as much as women's tennis.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about the glamour and personality of the teen-age ``Brat
Pack,'' widely credited with reviving interest in tournaments like
this week's Acura Classic at Manhattan Country Club. What makes
women's tennis better than ever these days is simply that they hit
the ball so damned HARD.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to appreciate if you only watch on TV. Everything
looks slower from the baseline camera.
</P>
<P>
   Come to a tournament. Get a seat on the sidelines. Be prepared
for the furious back-and-forth to give your neck a full
chiropractic treatment. Watch Monica Seles up close. Say goodbye to
your image of her as a frail kid sister. The woman kills the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The game used to be about waiting for the other woman to
mis-hit. Players could lob their moonballs and slices from the
baseline all afternoon. To cite an extreme example, at a Richmond,
Va., tournament in 1984, pros Vicki Nelson-Dunbar and Jean Hepner
played a 29-minute !ital!point!off!; the ball crossed the net 643
times. Their match took 6 hours, 31 minutes for !ital!two
sets!off!. Who won? Who cared anymore?
</P>
<P>
   They don't play pattycake anymore. Women armed with oversized
rackets and visible muscle serve big, charge the net, hammer
volleys. Women hit topspin. From the baseline they're able to mix
in a dropshot. The sheer variety is splendid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more aggressive, people are more fit, they're hitting the
ball harder,'' said Natalie Tauziat, the Wimbledon finalist who won
her first-round match over Chanda Rubin 6-4, 7-5 here Tuesday.
Tauziat, at 30 the second-oldest in the tournament, has pushed her
ranking back up to No. 11, a career high she first reached in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 11 (the first time), the tennis was easier,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   One difference from the '70s is the rackets _ wider and lighter
and thus more forgiving and powerful. The howitzers that have
turned the men's game into a numbing succession of one-shot rallies
has saved the women's game from a numbing succession of numbing
successions.
</P>
<P>
   Turn back the calendar and give Austin and Evert today's
weapons, and maybe they'd rip the ball too.
</P>
<P>
   That's a question of will as much as technology. The truism on
the tour was that Americans copied Evert's baseline style and the
rest of the world copied Navratilova's power game. But only after
the Iron Curtain came down did tennis fully open up to the rest of
the world. Now eight countries are represented in the top 12.
</P>
<P>
   Navratilova's influence was felt in the area of fitness as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember going to have dinner with Martina,'' said Lee
Jackson, a WTA Tour administrator, remembering Navratilova's early,
underconditioned days, ``and her ordering three kinds of meat.''
</P>
<P>
   When Navratilova toned up, her rivals had to keep up, and the
result was today's superathletic style. Her present-day equivalent,
Lindsay Davenport, is the latest example of what improving your
fitness will do.
</P>
<P>
   As Steffi Graf is discovering after nine months away following
knee surgery, the tour is deeper than it has been in decades. Until
the past two years, when first Martina Hingis, then Iva Majoli,
then Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and then Jana Novotna scored Grand
Slam upsets, it had been 16 years since back-to-back Grand Slams
were won by lower than first or second seeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has played well,'' Tauziat said. ``But the tour is better.
That's why it's hard for her to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   The women's tour is better than ever. It has personality. It has
depth. And most of all, they hit the ball so damned HARD. &QL;

SAME-SEX UNIONS VIOLATE CHURCH LAW, METHODISTS DECLARE
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KELLY ETTENBOROUGH  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A United Methodist pastor who blesses a same-sex union violates
church law, and if found guilty will be removed from the church,
the denomination's Judicial Council said in a ruling released
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling clarified whether a statement in a church document,
Social Principles, was advisory or law.
</P>
<P>
   The line, ``Ceremonies that celebrate homosexual unions shall
not be conducted by our ministers and shall not be conducted in our
churches,'' was added to Social Principles by the denomination's
General Conference in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jeff Procter-Murphy, pastor of Asbury United Methodist
Church in Phoenix, said he was disappointed by the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a United Methodist minister, I celebrate my denomination's
heri tage, theological pluralism and diversity,'' said
Procter-Murphy, whose church is one of 148 United Methodist
congregations in the country that welcome gays and lesbians into
all aspects of church life without seeking to change them.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, I grieve that it wasn't until the 19th century that
we took a decisive stand against slavery, the 20th century before
we ordained a woman, and now we will be into the 21st century
before we truly understand that ` Homosexual persons no less than
heterosexual persons are individuals of sacred worth,' '' he added,
quoting a line also found in Social Principles.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Beard, editor of an evangelical magazine for United
Methodists, was thrilled with the decision, saying it reflects the
view of the majority of the 8.5 million members in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't allow folks to be ordained who are self-avowed,
practicing homosexuals,'' said Beard, editor of Good News,
</P>
<P>
   based in Kentucky. ``Why in the world would we try to recommend
a relationship for something we don't believe in?''
</P>
<P>
   The debate centered on whether Social Principles should be
considered church law and enforced the same as its Book of
Discipline.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jimmy Creech of Ne braska tested the rule and was
brought to trial after he blessed a union between two women. After
his acquittal this spring, several groups within the denomination
requested clarification.
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling, the nine-member Judicial Council declined to say
whether the entire Social Principles is church law.
</P>
<P>
   But the line about homosexual unions was intended to govern a
minister's conduct and ``failure to do so is a disciplinary
violation,'' the ruling said.
</P>
<P>
   Judicial Council members do not comment on rulings.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop William W. Dew Jr., leader of Arizona's 50,000 United
Methodists, was on vacation and could not be reached for comment
Tuesday. He has said previously that he believes Social Principles
are instructive standards for leading a Christian life. He would
investigate any complaint brought against a pastor for blessing a
same-sex union in an Arizona church, he said, and would uphold
church rules. There have been no complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The prohibition on same-sex unions may be moved to the Book of
Discipline, Methodists predict, at the next General Conference in
2000. The General Conference meets every four years and is the
church's legislative body. &QL; tagKelly Ettenborough can be reached at

ANGELO ZUCCOTTI, 89, ARTIST OF THE VELVET ROPE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Italy)   (bl)  
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Angelo Zuccotti, who wielded the velvet rope at El
Morocco with such authority and finesse that he helped define the
very line between cafe society and social Siberia at New York's
most storied supper club, died Aug. 9 at his home in Cooperstown,
N.Y. He was 89 and had operated a bed and breakfast there for the
last eight years.
</P>
<P>
   If you were out on the town in the 1950s and 1960s and remember
Zuccotti as a warm and gracious man, almost a cherished friend even
though you never exchanged more than a few polite words at a time,
it is a safe bet that you were invariably seated at one of the
better tables, next to the tiny dance floor, perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe even to the right of the entrance at one of the famous
zebra-striped banquettes, the signature backdrop of hundreds of
magazine and newspaper photographs of visiting Hollywood stars,
European royalty and hometown socialites beginning in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you recall him as an icy and forbidding
presence whose piercing blue eyes seemed to look right through you
without a glimmer of recognition before he seated you, if he seated
you at all, at a table at the left rear, the section known
(shudder!) as Siberia, then, as you look back on it, perhaps you
WERE a bit pushy in those days or otherwise failed to live up to
Zuccotti's exacting standards of wealth, beauty and social grace.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly you were not a Bing Crosby, a Cary Grant, a Maurice
Chevalier or one of the dozens of other El Morocco regulars
Zuccotti recalled fondly as special favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their experience, those who saw Zuccotti as he presided
grandly at the El Morocco reservations desk would undoubtedly have
been surprised that the tall, slender, distinguished-looking man in
white tie and tails who dealt easily and efficiently with the
well-dressed throngs emerging from the limousines lining East 54th
Street had ridden the subway to work from his home in Greenwich
Village and dressed for the evening alongside waiters and bus boys
in the basement locker room.
</P>
<P>
   He may have been a working stiff, and Zuccotti _ who was on duty
six nights a week and was so devoted to work that his idea of
retirement was to operate a rooming house, could hardly deny it _
but he also saw his work as an art, one he had been perfecting for
years.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Bosco Marengo in the Piedmont section of Italy,
Zuccotti, who came to the United States at age 15 in 1923 and
immediately found work in New York's bustling, and often illicit,
restaurant industry, was on the El Morocco staff when John Perona,
also a Piedmont native, opened it as a speakeasy in 1931.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he succeeded Frank Carino as maitre d'hotel a couple
of decades later, Zuccotti had mastered the formula that had made
El Morocco so successful: the creation of social electricity by the
adroit and often inspired mixing of disparate people throughout the
room.
</P>
<P>
   Perona likened it to a chef making a sauce. Zuccotti, who made
it a point not to assign tables until customers with reservations
actually arrived, had another metaphor.
</P>
<P>
   As he told Frank Borsky for a 1969 article in New York magazine,
when he opened El Morocco's walnut doors at 7 p.m. he regarded the
room as an empty canvas: ``I am the artist and the people are my
oils,'' he said, describing how he would put beautiful women at the
front tables next to the dance floor, where they could been seen,
while seating celebrities at the banquettes where they would have
the pleasure of being recognized.
</P>
<P>
   A master at juggling customers with sometimes outsized and
competing egos, Zuccotti, who was careful to seat divorced couples
far apart, could also be relied on for his discretion. Men arriving
at El Morocco with girlfriends would be grateful for a whispered
warning that their wives were present.
</P>
<P>
   After Perona died in 1961 and the restaurant was moved from 154
E. 54th St. to 307 E. 54th St., Zuccotti stayed on, providing a
measure of social continuity even as cafe society declined and
customers would sometimes arrive wearing sports jackets.
</P>
<P>
   After El Morocco closed in 1969, Zuccotti worked for a while at
a resort in the Bahamas, then returned when El Morocco reopened a
few years later, the first of a succession of reincarnations.
</P>
<P>
   Zuccotti, whose first wife died in 1990, is survived by his
wife, Laura; two sons, John, a former first deputy mayor of New
York, and Andrew, a lawyer in Seattle; and five grandchildren.

EDITORIAL: THE GERMAN CONSENSUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editoril for Wednesday, Aug. 12:
</P>
<P>
   Gerhard Schroeder, the German Social Democrat who may put an end
to Helmut Kohl's chancellorship in elections next month, came to
Washington last week to see and be seen with President Clinton.
Along with trying to assure Germany that strong ties to America
will continue, Schroeder is reinforcing parallels with a politician
he admires. He paints himself as a tough and energetic reformer
running against a stodgy incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   The comparison of himself to Clinton is misleading. Germany has
rejected the kinds of economic reforms now taken as gospel in
Britain and America. The generosity of the German welfare state
sometimes verges on parody. But Germans strongly believe society
should take care of all its members. Even after 16 years of the
conservative Kohl, benefit deductions average 42 percent of
workers' salaries, a record. Employers have won more flexible work
hours, but labor costs remain among Europe's highest.
</P>
<P>
   At 54, Schroeder may be relatively young and energetic, but he
is unlikely to depart from the German consensus. With unemployment
at 10.7 percent, slightly down from a postwar high, Schroeder's
main issue is job creation. But his ideas are vague and
contradictory. What he could do depends on the coalition the Social
Democrats could form _ and on the party's chairman, Oskar
Lafontaine, who advocates wage hikes.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, who favors a tax cut, also wants the government to
pick up some expensive benefits now paid by employers. He wants to
turn low-wage temporary jobs into ``real'' jobs, which could
exacerbate unemployment. While he is one of the most pro-business
members of a party with a union base, he advocates little that the
unions could oppose.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl was the architect of German unification and is now the
chief advocate of European integration. Schroeder, once a skeptic
about Europe's single currency, now says that even if he governs
with the Green Party, there will be no change in any major aspect
of foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   It is still very possible that Helmut Kohl will win a fifth term
as chancellor. But it is a mark of Kohl's influence on modern
Germany that even if he loses, his policies are likely to live on.

 &HT;    Methodist court upholds ban on marrying gays
 &HT;    By Kim Sue Lia Perkes
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ United Methodist Church pastors who conduct
same-sex weddings and other union ceremonies can be defrocked, the
church's highest judicial court ruled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling pulls the nation's second-largest Protestant
denomination, with some 8.5 million members, back from the brink of
schism. Conservative Methodists had threatened a mass exodus over
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is the second in a week in which a major religious
body has dealt a setback to wider acceptance of homosexuals in
church circles. Last Wednesday the world's Anglican bishops,
meeting in Canterbury, England, passed a resolution declaring
homosexual activity ``incompatible with Scripture'' and advising
Anglicanism's 37 church provinces, which include the Episcopal
Church in the United States, against ordaining homosexuals as
priests.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by the United Methodist Church Judicial Council,
which came after a two-day hearing in Dallas, also called into
question whether other Methodist Social Principles _ the church
opposes capital punishment and supports choice on abortion, for
example _ can be interpreted as church law. Retired Washington
State Bishop Jack Tuell the high court did not intend for the
ruling to have broader implications, but church members may
interpret it that way. ``Somebody might get the idea they want to
make a point about this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some church critics say, that's exactly what will
happen. Charges for violating church laws can be filed against
clergy and laity in the church, but usually it is clergy who are
held accountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of this ruling, it's going to encourage people to file
charges against pastors and other laypeople who violate other
Social Principles,'' predicted the Rev. Jimmy Creech. ``The ruling
seems to imply a (social) position taken by the church can be
upheld as the law of the church.''
</P>
<P>
   Creech was acquitted of violating a church stance against
same-sex unions in a Nebraska church trial six months ago. He
argued before the Judicial Council that if the gay marriage ban was
made church law, rather than a social position, then Gov. George
Bush's church status could be in jeopardy because he supports
capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   But in its ruling, the Judicial Council said it was only dealing
with one Social Principle, and more specifically, one sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Sue White, pastor of Parker Lane United Methodist
Church in Austin, said the sentence is clearly binding because it
says, ``You shall not as a clergy perform a same-sex marriage.''
Other Social Principles, she added, do not use such direct
language.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time the high court has ruled on one of the
church Social Principles, generally considered to be guidelines and
not church law.
</P>
<P>
   Tuell said clergy ban on gay marriages is unique because of the
language and because it is the only Social Principle the church has
control over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of another place in the Social Principles where
United Methodist ministers are directed to do something,'' Tuell
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the governing body of the United Methodist Church
approved placing the ban on same-sex marriages in the Social
Principles. The same body rejected five attempts to place the ban
into church law.
</P>
<P>
   The United Methodist Church has been in turmoil since the 1996
General Conference. The issue escalated in March when Creech was
acquitted in a church trial after he joined together a lesbian
couple. Since then, conservative church leaders have taken the
denomination to the brink of schism. Some regional conferences
threatened to withhold contributions to the denomination, and
churches threatened to leave. At least one pastor and church did.
Conservative leaders, including the Rev. Bill Hinson, the Houston
pastor of the largest Methodist congregation, and some bishops
demanded a special national conference to deal with the issue once
and for all.
</P>
<P>
   Then the College of Bishops of the South Central Jurisdiction,
which includes Texas, asked the church's Judicial Council to take
up the matter. The council called a special session to hear
arguments on the issue Friday and Saturday in Dallas. Bishop Ray
Owen of the Southwest Texas Conference, which includes Austin,
could not be reached for comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Most mainline denominations openly welcome gays and lesbians as
members but are struggling with the idea of gay marriages and
ordinations.
</P>
<P>
   The Presbyterian Church (USA), for example, said earlier this
year that ``chastity in singleness and fidelity within the covenant
of marriage between a man and a woman'' are the standards for
ordination, virtually eliminating any chance for homosexuals to be
ordained in the church.

 &HT;    U.S. to pay Texas family for gunning down son
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Without explanation or admission of fault, the
federal government has agreed to pay $1.9 million to the survivors
of a West Texas teen-ager gunned down by a Marine patrolling the
border, the family's lawyer said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Tuesday, the third grand jury to review the case reached
the same conclusion the others had: No crime was committed when
Marine Cpl. Clemente Banuelos shot Esequiel Hernandez in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was enough evidence to support an indictment,''
said District Attorney Albert Valadez of Presidio. ``But, I'm not
going to persuade a grand jury with my opinion. And, I couldn't
persuade them with the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, 18, was herding his goats in Redford, about 200 miles
southeast of El Paso, when he was shot after crossing paths with a
four-man Marine patrol doing drug surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials said Hernandez shot twice at the Marines with
his .22-caliber rifle. He was shot, they said, when he raised the
weapon again. The explanation has never satisfied Hernandez'
family, some area residents and U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, R-San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The civil-suit settlement was announced Tuesday by Pecos lawyer
Bill Weinacht, representing the Hernandez family.
</P>
<P>
   While the money will help, Weinacht said, his clients got what
they really wanted in February when they met with a justice
department official.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told the family that what happened to their son was
wrong,'' Weinacht said. ``That's what they really needed to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Magarito Hernandez, Esequiel's older brother, said the
settlement is confirmation of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they accepted the deal, they accepted it was a wrong thing
that happened,'' he said. ``Nothing is going to bring him back. But
at least it will help my parents.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest grand jury decision, coincidentally, came several
hours after the lawsuit settlement was announced. Valadez, who
presented the case to another grand jury last year, quietly brought
the matter before a new grand jury after getting materials
collected by federal investigators looking into a possible civil
rights violation case.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury in February returned no indictments in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Valadez began presenting the case to the second local grand jury
in July. He said the federal probe produced almost 5,000 pages of
evidence, compared with 200 he had last time.
</P>
<P>
   Grand jurors had the option of indicting Banuelos for murder,
manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Valadez said he accepts the grand jury decision, and, barring
new information that he does not believe is out there, the case is
closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm satisfied I made every effort that I can humanly make to
present all the facts. Their decision is final in my book,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Houston lawyer Jack Zimmerman, who represents Banuelos, said he
was not surprised by the grand jury no bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three grand juries determined there was not enough evidence to
present a charge,'' Zimmerman said. ``Corporal Banuelos was
completely justified in his actions under the law. The case is
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinacht said the family's civil claims against the U.S.
Department of Justice and U.S. Navy also are now over.
</P>
<P>
   The money will be ``structured with an expected payout to the
family of $1.9 million,'' he said. A source familiar with the
settlement said it would be paid over 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Watney, a justice department spokeswoman in Washington,
confirmed that a settlement had been signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Military Claims Act permits components of the federal
government to settle claims caused by their activities without a
showing of fault on the part of any person, so long as the injured
person or claimant was not at fault,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the no-fault claim by the government, some Redford-area
residents saw the settlement as proof of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't just hand out money if there is no reason to hand
money out,'' said The Rev. Melvin LaFollette, a longtime friend of
the Hernandez family.
</P>
<P>
   But Weinacht said the Hernandez family never was driven by a
need to explore the full details of what led to the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning, we had to fight off people with other
agendas,'' he said. ``My only concern was what the Hernandez family
wanted to do. What they wanted was some type of compensation for
the loss they suffered.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio and chairman of the House
immigration subcommittee, remains convinced the whole truth about
the incident has not yet been heard. In May, Smith's panel
subpoenaed records from the justice and defense departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``His focus from the beginning has been on getting answers,''
spokesman Allen Kay said. ``He has promised a public accounting of
this tragic death, and he intends to deliver one.''

 &HT;    Pirates, Reds go to battle for last place
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ The Battle for the Bottom did not start well
Tuesday night in Cinergy Field for the Cincinnati Reds _ unless
they want to finish last in the National League Central.
</P>
<P>
   They began the night in fifth place, one game ahead of the
last-place Pittsburgh Pirates, but they never even raised their
fists to defend themselves while bowing meekly, 7-0, on a
six-hitter (all singles) by Francisco Cordova.
</P>
<P>
   So, when the two teams test each other again tonight, they will
do so tied for last place _ 53-66 and 19 games behind first-place
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing Reds' fans among the 16,399 found worth watching
were the Cincinnati debuts of outfielder Jeffrey Hammonds and
pitcher Jason Bere.
</P>
<P>
   Hammonds, obtained Monday from Baltimore in a trade for Willie
Greene, started in center field and contributed singles in his
first two at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Bere, activated off a minor-league contract, made his debut in
relief in the eighth and went 1-2-3 on nine pitches. His second
inning, the ninth, was ugly _ double, wild pitch, hit batsman, walk
(to the pitcher), 22 pitches. . .and got out of it with one run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't exactly consider it a good one or a bad one,'' Bere
said of his appearance. ``It was kind of a necessary outing. It's a
start. Now we'll go from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Hammonds began his Reds career on a quick upper and a quick
downer.
</P>
<P>
   On his first at-bat, he pulled a 2-and-0 pitch into left field
for his first National League hit. Mere moments after they rolled
the baseball into the dugout as a keepsake memento, Pittsburgh
pitcher Francisco Cordova picked Hammonds off first base.
</P>
<P>
   On his second at-bat, he used his feet to beat out an infield
hit to third base to make him two-for-two in the National League. .
.and he didn't get picked off base.
</P>
<P>
   Hammonds didn't take batting practice after arriving at 4:40,
even though he had time to dress and do it. He said he didn't need
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The adrenaline I'm running on right now can't be matched,'' he
said. ``It has been a while since I've been this excited about
playing a game. I was told (Monday) to get here because I was going
to start, so I was anxious to get here and get this party
started.''
</P>
<P>
   Hammonds said he heard the rumors of his trade to the Reds for
Willie Greene on Saturday, ``But I made light of it, didn't think
much of it. When I got the call Monday that it happened, it was a
shock of sorts. I didn't know how to act at first, but it didn't
take long to get excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a chance to start over,'' he said. ``I realize it was
time for a change, time to move on. I harbor no ill feelings toward
the Orioles. It was time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys they're bringing in here, they're trying to find
something,'' Hammonds added. ``I feel very privileged more than
anything that they would to find me to come in and try to shore up
center field.''
</P>
<P>
   Hammonds was Baltimore's No. 1 draft pick (fourth overall) in
June, 1992, and played nowhere else but in the Orioles system and
for the Orioles until Monday's trade.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, Hammonds was the principle of a bizarre play in the
seventh inning. With Lou Collier on first, Tony Womack lobbed a
shallow fly into center. Hammonds tried for a sliding catch and
missed. But as he slid, he kicked the ball toward the infield,
where second baseman Bret Boone was able to pick it up and throw to
shortstop Barry Larkin to force Collier at second.
</P>
<P>
   Reds starter Brett Tomko, who has only one victory in his last
five starts, gave up a little bit of everything in absorbing his
eighth loss _ four runs, five hits, two wild pitches, a hit batsman
and a home run.
</P>
<P>
   But it was only 4-0 when manager Jack McKeon pulled him for a
pinch-hitter after five innings, a move to which Tomko reacted by
going into the tunnel behind the dugout and screaming some
expletives.
</P>
<P>
   ``They left me in there to take a beating in Atlanta in my last
start (nine runs, eight hits in 5.1 innings), then they take me out
against the Pirates when it is only 4-0. I've been throwing the
ball well for about a month-and-a-half. This wasn't my best, but I
located well and was getting a lot of ground balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Cordova nearly didn't start Tuesday. His hand hurt after his
last start. The Pirates took X-rays and discovered some healed
broken bones in his pitching hand that may have occurred up to four
years ago. Treatment with a lot of ice enabled him to put the big
chill on the Reds for his fourth career shutout, the sixth time the
Reds have been shut out this year.

CONNORS HINTS HE MAY NEAR END OF HIS CAREER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JACK CAVANAUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ Sounding very much like a player nearing the
end of the line, Jimmy Connors strongly indicated Tuesday that he
might be in the waning days of his Hall of Fame tennis career.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours before he defeated John Fitzgerald of Australia, 6-4,
7-6 (7-3), in a first-round match of the $150,000 Citibank
Champions tournament for players 35 years and older, the
45-year-old Connors said that his competitive fires _ long the
hallmark of his game _ were flickering.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're down to embers now,'' said Connors, who is seeded No.
1 in the 16-player event that runs through Sunday at Manhattanville
College.
</P>
<P>
   John McEnroe, seeded No. 2, plays his first match Wednesday
night against Shlomo Glickstein of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   As the dominant player on the Nuveen Tour, Connors has won three
of the eight tournaments played this year and 32 of the 63 that
have been held since the 35-and-over circuit was started in 1993 by
Connors and Ray Benton, a veteran tennis promoter and sports
marketer.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks Connors has been hobbled by an injured right
foot that forced him to default a semifinal match in Boston last
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It hampered him noticeably in his victory tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The injuries heal a lot slower nowadays,'' said Connors, who,
approaching his 46th birthday on Sept. 2, is the oldest player on
the Nuveen Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started this, but it's tough for me to carry them anymore,''
he said. ``I'm getting too old for that.'''
</P>
<P>
   Connors did say that he would fulfill a commitment to the Nuveen
Tour that runs through 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, I don't know what I'll do, although I'll probably
stay involved with tennis, at least on a part-time basis'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But first I may just put my feet up and take a year off.''
</P>
<P>
   Connors, who was inducted into the Tennis Hall of Fame last
month, said he thought his slashing style and overall game had not
changed appreciably since he left the regular tour after he turned
40.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can strike the ball better now than I could 15 years
ago,'' Connors said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think I anticipate better than I did in the past. But
the foot injury has slowed me down and my game depends on how I'm
moving. Also, I don't see the ball as well I used to, and wear
glasses now.''
</P>
<P>
   Connors was asked whether he would miss the adulation once he
retires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' he said. ``I don't need it and I don't want it.
I don't want people seeing me at the U.S. Open or at Wimbledon and
saying, `That's Jimmy Connors.' And when I do leave tennis, it will
be on my own terms.''

 &HT;    Padres capture series opener
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ It was only last month the Atlanta Braves called San
Diego to see if Joey Hamilton was available for trade. He was not.
And Tuesday night, the native Georgian returned the compliment.
</P>
<P>
   Dousing the hot-hitting Braves, Hamilton pitched the Padres to a
3-1 victory in the first of three games between the two leading
clubs in the National League. Hamilton (10-9) halted the Braves'
four-game win streak by limiting the Braves to one run, only the
fifth time since the All-Star break the Braves had scored once or
less.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Denny Neagle (11-10), he has been Atlanta
starting pitcher in three of those games and lost for the fourth
time in his last seven starts. Only two of the three runs he gave
up were earned, after he allowed six hits and one walk while
striking out four in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Finley homered for the Padres, who also used a pair of
Braves error for the deciding run in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Braves have won every series played in San Diego
since 1989, the Padres are redefining the joint this season. The
victory left them 43-13 at Qualcomm, the best home record in the
majors after the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves tried rally in the eighth, after pinch hitter Greg
Colbrunn walked and Ozzie Guillen singled to chase Hamilton. Newly
acquired left-hander Randy Myers struck out Tony Graffanino and
retired Chipper Jones before Dan Miceli retired Andres Galarraga on
a long fly to center to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Hoffman came on in the ninth and quickly closed out the
Braves on two strikeouts and a weak grounder.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego doubled its way into a 3-1 lead in the fifth. After
Carlos Hernandez opened the inning with a double, Neagle retired
the next two batters, but after he threw three straight balls the
Quilvio Veras, the Padres shortstop doubled into center, scoring
Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Klesko waited until the 119th game of the season to make
his first error, but the Braves left fielder made it count. With
Ken Caminiti on first with one out, Neagle appeared to have gotten
out of the fourth inning when he induced a routine grounder to
third from Greg Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   But Chipper Jones lost the ball off the heel of his glove,
giving Caminiti third base, and Vaughn set off for second. Klesko
charged well enough but made a clumsy sliding stop and uncorked a
wild throw past second and backup man Andres Galarraga, allowing
Caminiti to score for a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jones had tied the game 1-1 in the third with an RBI single
through second base, giving him six straight hits and eight RBIs in
12 at-bats.

 &HT;    Panthers agree to terms with forwards
 &HT;    By Brian Biggane
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The Florida Panthers moved closer to
their goal of having all their players signed before the Sept. 12
start of training camp Tuesday when they announced forwards Ray
Whitney and Viktor Kozlov had agreed to contract terms.
</P>
<P>
   The deal with Whitney, a two-year package worth about $2.8
million, cancels what would have been only the team's second
arbitration case ever. The two sides were scheduled to appear
before an arbitrator Friday. Whitney made $300,000 last season.
</P>
<P>
   Kozlov signed a one-year deal worth $1 million plus incentives.
</P>
<P>
   The deals leave only five players unsigned, all of whom are
restricted free agents: goaltenders Kevin Weekes and Todd
MacDonald, and forwards Radek Dvorak, Steve Washburn and Chris
Wells.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to avoid contract issues when camp starts,''
Assistant General Manager Chuck Fletcher said. ``We want to give
(first-year coach) Terry Murray a chance to bring everybody
together and get off to a good start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there are too many players who can look
themselves in the mirror and say they had a great year.'' Florida's
24-43-15 record last season ranked 25th among the league's 26
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney, who tied the team scoring record with 32 goals after
being acquired on waivers last Nov. 6, had filed for arbitration
last month. Whitney reportedly was seeking about $2 million, while
the Panthers were offering $1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was important to both sides to avoid arbitration if
we could, to keep the relationship very positive,'' General Manager
Bryan Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously Ray wanted badly to be here and get it done. He's
real happy with it; with incentives, he can make considerably more,
so it's a positive deal for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Kozlov was the team's best player down the stretch, scoring
eight goals in his last 14 games and showing star potential the
last half of the season. But he has totaled just 41 goals in his
four NHL seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw a guy starting to emerge who can be a real force,''
Murray said. ``But we want to find out where he's going to be in
the future.
</P>

 &HT;    Bullish run may not have stopped, but correction has begun
 &HT;    By Danielle Herubin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The signals are growing stronger that U.S. stock markets are
nearing the end of a historic six-year bull run. One thing is
certain: A correction is under way.
</P>
<P>
   Just a week after losing 299 points in its third-worst loss
ever, the Dow Jones industrial average, buffeted by bad economic
news worldwide, dropped 258 points at its low point Tuesday, then
recovered to close 112 points down at 8,462.85.
</P>
<P>
   That means the market has plunged 875 points since its historic
high of 9337.97 just 3 1/2 weeks ago. And that translates to a 9.3
percent fall in stock value _ a loss in paper wealth of about $3.3
trillion (that's a 3 followed by 12 zeroes), according to Daniel
Morgan, an analyst at Boca Raton-based Noble Financial Group.
</P>
<P>
   How big is $3 trillion? That's the equivalent of a $30,000
salary paid to each of 100 million workers.
</P>
<P>
   The good news, and there is some good news: The market still is
up 6 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a correction. It could be a little more,'' said Donald
Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting center at Georgia
State University in Atlanta. ``We have fundamentally ignored the
rest of the world, saying, 'Things are OK here. What's it matter in
the world?' Now we're saying, 'Maybe it does matter.' ``
</P>
<P>
   The sell-off was triggered by a series of factors:
</P>
<P>
   Investors and economists are concerned about Japan's weakening
currency, the yen, and $500 million to $1 trillion in bad loans.
</P>
<P>
   Other Asian economies are suffering currency problems, which
have touched off market slides throughout the continent.
</P>
<P>
   Latin American markets, skittish because of weak currencies and
Asia's problems, began falling as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department reported Tuesday that the United States
suffered its first drop in worker productivity in more than three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Federal court officials said Tuesday Americans are filing for
personal bankruptcy at a record rate.
</P>
<P>
   Trade and economic pressures abroad are expected to continue to
damage earnings of U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   The damage to U.S. stock markets most likely is already hurting
you. Pension plans tied to markets and 401(k) plans have lost
value. Economists are predicting job losses in technology and
retail manufacturing because Asia's sliding currencies will mean
cheaper imports.
</P>
<P>
   And business deals such as bank mergers could be in jeopardy if
they involve stock because such deals usually include triggers that
block the transactions if the affected companies' stock prices fall
too low.
</P>
<P>
   In West Palm Beach, Republic Security Bank's deal to buy First
Palm Beach Bancorp for $256.9 million has such a trigger, but
Republic Security Chief Executive Rudy Schupp said the transaction
could be renegotiated if there is a problem with the stock price
toward the end of the year, when the deal is to close. Republic
stock (Nasdaq: RSFC) dropped 6 cents Tuesday to close at $10.19.
First Palm Beach shares (Nasdaq: FFPB) closed at $38.94, down 31
cents. There is some short-term good news for consumers, however.
NationsBank economist Lynn Reaser said that consumers can expect
cheaper gasoline prices because Asian countries are not consuming
as much energy, meaning more supply and less demand.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty over Asia, with banking and currency problems in
Japan, China and elsewhere, rippled around the globe. Stock markets
across Europe and Latin America retreated. In Russia, trading was
halted temporarily Tuesday during a sharp selloff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw a similar round of currency attacks and stock market
declines last October,'' NationsBank's Reaser said. ``This is a
repeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Worried investors swamped brokers and money managers with calls
Tuesday. Morgan, with Noble Financial Group, said his phone was
busy. While his assistants handled the nervous clients, he spent
the day trading. His advice was to move portfolios into safer
sectors.
</P>
<P>
   For a lot of investors, repositioning meant getting out of
stocks and into bonds and money market funds. Investors are
starting to move money out of stock funds, according to
Trimtabs.com, a firm that tracks 3,400 mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 4, the day the market fell 299 points, investors
withdrew $1.1 billion from stock funds. Money flowed back in last
Wednesday and Thursday, but at the end of the three days, the net
result was a $129 million drain. That compares with a daily average
inflow of $900 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not buying, which means they're worried,'' said Carl
Wittnebert, the Santa Rosa, Calif.-based company's director of
research. ``It gives me the feeling that they're waiting for the
market to stabilize.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no clear consensus about whether the market is going to
rise or fall from here. Ralph Acampora, Prudential's chief analyst,
said on the CNBC cable network Tuesday that he thinks this
correction is going to be bigger than he originally thought.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been saying that the secondary stocks are already in a
bear market, and my call . . . is that the blue chips will also go
into a bear market,'' Acampora said. ''It's a bear call.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Hanna, president of Frost Hanna Capital Group in Boca
Raton, said the bull isn't dead.
</P>
<P>
   Hanna argues the dollar is showing strength against foreign
currencies, the U.S. government expects budget surpluses, and
interest rates are low. All are good signs that the economy is
strong, and Hanna's still buying stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Those choosing to stay in the market are looking for safe
havens. Banking, technology and aerospace have been hit hard by the
declines in the past month.
</P>
<P>
   Although NationsBank's Reaser said she does not believe the
banking industry will be affected, Noble's Morgan said brokers he
knows are backing away from the financial-services sector.
</P>
<P>
   ''(The big banks) all have huge exposure to Asia,'' Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   United Technologies (NYSE: UTX, $87.69), parent of Pratt &AMP;
Whitney, is on a cost-cutting program, partly because of Asia.
United Technologies sells air conditioners, elevators and aircraft
engines in Asia, where sales represented about 12 percent of the
company's revenue in 1997. Shares in United, whose Pratt subsidiary
has 4,900 employees in northwestern Palm Beach County, fell $2.94
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola, with 3,200 employees in southern Palm Beach County,
also has been hammered by the collapse of Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
   Some businesses appeared to be unaffected, but were watching the
stock market warily.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Rim countries represent emerging markets for Florida
citrus sales, said Andy Taylor, controller for Caulkins Indiantown
Citrus Co., which grows citrus on 16,000 acres in Martin County.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're more concerned about . . . the ability of those
customers to buy citrus products,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for retail and real estate interests said they don't
think their businesses will suffer even if the markets continues to
drop.
</P>
<P>
   Retailer Office Depot Inc. (NYSE: ODP, $31.38), which employs
about 1,800 at its headquarters in Delray Beach, said its $600
million in available cash and credit means the stock markets won't
affect its plan to open 90 stores this year. Its stock was down
$1.19 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not dependant on the market for capital,'' said Chief
Financial Officer Barry Goldstein.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial real estate brokers and home builders said interest
rates, not stock markets, drive real estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The life cycle of the real estate market is different than the
stock market,'' said Neil Merin, a broker at NAI Merin Hunter
Codman in West Palm Beach. ``If the Federal Reserve said they were
going to raise interest rates, that would certainly have a negative
effect. It would take a 2- to 2 1/2-point increase in interest
rates for the real estate markets to start shutting down.''
</P>
<P>
   But real estate investment trusts already have been hit, mostly
because of risky derivative investments tied to Asia. That could
slow down the domestic building boom.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Page, director of operations for Fort Lauderdale-based
Stiles Corp., a commercial developer with projects planned for Palm
Beach County, said that if REITS slow their investing, Stiles will
have ''second thoughts'' about building.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Lehman, executive director of the Palm Beach County
Tourist Development Council, said stock market volatility might not
affect some of the bigger hotels, which nail down bookings two to
three years in advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think a loss in confidence in the stock market will
cause people to have second thoughts about whether to spend as much
for a vacation,'' Lehman said. ``Will they eliminate vacations
altogether? I don't think it's gotten to that point.''

 &HT;    Appleby's sorrow shows in his return to golf
 &HT;    By Craig Dolch
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Stuart Appleby was in mid-sentence when the
words suddenly stopped. He rubbed his moist, red eyes. He tried
again. Nothing. He wiped away a tear. Finally, after another long
pause, he was able to continue.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most emotional press conferences in recent golf
history, Appleby spoke publicly for the first time Tuesday since
watching his wife, Renay, die in a car accident in London 19 days
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like she was the first prize of a raffle in life and
picking partners,'' Appleby said, ``and I was lucky enough to win
her.''
</P>
<P>
   But she was lost July 23 when she was hit by a taxi outside
Heathrow Airport. She went to retrieve a bag when another car, the
driver not realizing he was in reverse, struck her and crushed her
between two cars. She never regained consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Renay, 25, and Stuart, 27, were about to fly to Paris for their
second honeymoon. The Australian couple had been married since
December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   They shared a life inside and outside the yellow ropes. They had
met in 1992 when both were junior golfers touring the United
States. They even played together as a team on the trip before they
eventually fell in love.
</P>
<P>
   She caddied for him for several months in 1997, when his career
on the PGA Tour was starting to take off. He has won two titles,
including the 1997 Honda Classic, and more than $2 million. Renay
was a fixture in his gallery after letting someone else carry his
bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm walking around the course and I see no one,'' he said.
``She's not there walking, not helping me when I need help. The
things I will miss about her aren't the big things. It's all the
little things that add up and make someone's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not an hour that goes by that I don't think of her,
not an hour. And that's OK. You just wish things were different.''
</P>
<P>
   Appleby, who's usually clean-shaven, showed up for the press
conference with a beard, still wearing the wedding ring on his left
hand. He stopped on his way to the media room to chat with Davis
Love III, who lost his father in a plane crash several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Appleby said he made the difficult decision to return to
tournament golf at this week's PGA Championship because he said
that's what Renay would have wanted and because this is what he
does for a living. This represents another step he must take. Other
steps, such as returning to their American home near Orlando, have
to wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two options I can take,'' he said. ``One, is to to dig
myself into a hole and really begin to feel how deprived and
unllucky and ripped off and angry I could be. Or I can say, hey, I
was lucky that I got to know her for the years I had.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know she would want me to come back. She obviously would
understand this is obviously not a very easy time for me, so I've
got to let her memory steer me in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Allenby, a fellow Australian who's one of Appleby's
closest friends, is among the pros who have tried to help him
during this difficult time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be very tough on him, but I think he's doing the
right thing coming back out here,'' Allenby said. ``You can't just
sit around and think about it all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the other players don't know what to say. They instead
show their emotions with hugs and handshakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's a very sad time,'' said Tiger Woods, a
neighbor of Appleby's in Isleworth. ``I saw him (Monday) for the
first time and I almost teared up on the spot. Even now I get
choked up talking about it. But he knows we're always there for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the players have admired Appleby's courage in returning
to golf so quickly. They hope that's a sign he'll be able to deal
with this tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still has a positive outlook on life,'' said Jupiter's
Jesper Parnevik. ``It's not like it's over. He just has to live it
differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Appleby said he's not concerned how he does this week. Just
making it to the first tee Thursday will represent another of those
steps he must get through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not even worried what I do here,'' he said. ``I'm just
going to take it as it comes. Days are more important than
scores.''

SAMPSON LOOKS BACK _ AND AHEAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ If Steve Sampson had it to do over again --
if he could go back to before the 1998 World Cup and prepare for
France knowing what he now knows _ there is only so much he would
do differently.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Lassiter, who has become Major League Soccer's most-feared
scorer since joining D.C. United, would be heading to the Cup, and
a few veterans -- Alexi Lalas, Tab Ramos, Eric Wynalda _ would join
John Harkes at home.
</P>
<P>
   Hindsight makes some things apparent, it is true, but the former
U.S. national team coach, who resigned in the wake of the
Americans' last-place finish in France, would only change so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'd been given a year ago the confidence and assuredness
that I'd be the World Cup coach in France, I probably could have
begun the process of transition into a much younger national
team,'' Sampson, who prefers to look forward, said last week. ``But
without the confirmation (as coach) until December of '97, I could
not begin to make those kinds of changes. Maybe January '98 was too
late.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believe I began what was the right process for the
future of soccer in the United States, exposing a Brian Maisonneuve
and a Frankie Hejduk and a Brian McBride to the international
level.''
</P>
<P>
   That decision was, it turned out, at the heart of the problems
that dogged the Yanks in the World Cup, but there is little doubt
it was the right choice. McBride scored the Americans' only goal,
and Maisonneuve, Hejduk and naturalized Frenchman David Regis were
three of the U.S. team's finest World Cup performers.
</P>
<P>
   That they were seeing significant playing time at the expense of
others -- Lalas, Wynalda, Jeff Agoos and Marcelo Balboa _ led to
turmoil that surfaced after the loss to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Sampson, who gathered at a Beverly Hills news conference last
Wednesday with Iran coach Jalel Talebi, says he knew there was
trouble after the 2-0 loss to Germany in the opener. The dissidents
were Lalas, who didn't see a minute of Cup action; Wynalda, who
struggled against the Germans and saw his playing time trimmed; and
Ramos, who played a far less significant role in France than he'd
hoped to.
</P>
<P>
   They immediately voiced their displeasure, then went public
after a 2-1 defeat to Iran eliminated the Yanks from second-round
contention. Sampson, heavy criticised by the trio, admits he felt
betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt their reaction was unwarranted, very disappointing and
unprofessional,'' he says. ``From that standpoint, especially when
you hold a position open for someone (Ramos, recovering from knee
surgery) for eight months and they react the way they did, it was
very hurtful and disappointing. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time Alexi Lalas was at his lowest, I supported him. At
the time Tab Ramos had no international future because of his knee
injury, I supported him, I gave him confidence, and I left a spot
open for him. And Eric Wynalda _ no one has supported him more over
the last two or three years, and under sometimes very difficult
situations. I have supported him and believed in him. The way they
reacted was unwarranted and disrespectful.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, there is little Sampson could have, would have, done
to alleviate their concerns. They wanted to play, but Sampson
believes he had better players. They wanted their friend Harkes,
dropped from the squad in April, with the team in France, but
Sampson insists he made the right decision. They wanted the
veterans who have provided the backbone of the team the past few
years to play the key roles, but Sampson went with what he believed
was a better lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``As national team coach,'' he said, ``I have to make a decision
based on what's best for the team or on what's best for the
individual. Always the answer must be to do what's best for the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Lalas, Balboa and Agoos were key defenders in the build-up to
the Cup, but the switch from a four-man zonal defense to a
three-man man-to-man system _ meant to shore up problems in the
back _ cost them their roles. It's hard to argue with Regis and
Eddie Pope in place of Lalas and Agoos, and Sampson admits that
Balboa, who never complained, might have had a beef. Balboa might
have been a more effective sweeper, Sampson acknowledges, than
captain Thomas Dooley, who was slowed by injury.
</P>
<P>
   The most controversial move was dropping Harkes, the U.S.
captain. ``I think there were two or three individuals who were
still very upset that John was not part of the team, and they did
not understand or accept the reasoning behind his removal ...,''
Sampson told Soccer America. ``I would make the same decision today
... it was the right decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a deterioration of trust between myself and John. I
called into question his off-the-field leadership, and it was a
series of events -- whether it was missed plane flights or the last
one in the meetings or staying up 'til all hours of the evening
drinking -- that forced me to make a decision that this was not the
type of leadership that we needed going into a World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``On top of that, there were issues about John's unwillingness
to play a different (defensive) role on the team -- a role that I
wanted him to play. Even though he stated publicly, after I had
decided not to take him to France, that he would be willing to play
any role whatsoever, that was not the case in my private
discussions with him. He was adamant about playing a significant
role in midfield and was unwilling to play as an outside back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans' failure in the Cup turned on the loss to Iran, in
which the Americans hit the posts or crossbar three times. A
victory in that match would have left the Yanks in position to
advance heading into their first-round finale against Yugoslavia,
and that is all that was expected of the team.
</P>
<P>
   But expectations, Sampson says, hindered the team. ``I seriously
believe we were a victim of our own success,'' he says. ``I believe
the reaction to a 2-0 loss to Germany was an overreaction. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ludicrous to believe we are the 32nd-best team in the
World Cup. Statistically, yes -- we had the fewest points. But our
group was very difficult and the quality of play we demonstrated
has grown. It's very clear we have to become a much more dominant
team physically, that the team must have much greater technique ...
and we have to have much greater precision and poise in
goal-scoring opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   It's something, Sampson says, that needs to be addressed while
identifying and developing players for the future, something he'd
like to do as head of Project 2010, the program designed to make
the U.S. squad true World Cup challengers within 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if it's realistic or not,'' he says. ``The
fact is we are making the statement that we want to be the best in
the world. If it happens in 2010, great. If it happens in 2014 or
2018 ... we've made our statement and we are investing in our youth
and our coaches and putting together a program that will allow us
to do so. That's the most important thing.''

RANGERS HOLD OFF INDIANS, 2-1
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ General manager Doug Melvin's July acquisitions
supplied the Rangers with a tool necessary to seize the American
League West.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Esteban Loaiza and shortstop Royce Clayton _ two of
the four players Melvin acquired before the July 31 trade deadline
_ last night demonstrated how their talents will benefit the
Rangers' glaring deficiencies in low-scoring games.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' 2-1 victory against the Cleveland Indians at Jacobs
Field accentuated that point. The triumph also kept the Rangers
11/2 games ahead of the second-place Angels, who beat the Tigers,
5-4, in 11 innings last night in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can play a low-scoring game now and win,'' Rangers manager
Johnny Oates said. ``We couldn't do that earlier in the year. We
can win 4-3 and 2-1 ballgames now.''
</P>
<P>
   Last night represented the Rangers' third victory in four games
this month when scoring four or fewer runs. The Rangers went 13-35
in those games before July 31.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: starting pitching and defense.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin improved those areas with the acquisitions of
right-handers Todd Stottlemyre and Loaiza, Clayton and third
baseman Todd Zeile.
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza (1-2) surrendered only seven hits and one walk during his
86-pitch, 71/3-inning appearance, and the Indians managed their run
on an eighth-inning home run from third baseman Jeff Manto.
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza, who pitched brilliantly for the third consecutive
outing, benefited from a defense that converted three ground balls
into double plays with Clayton involved on each occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you want do is make sure you give the other team 27
outs,'' Clayton said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers appear better equipped now to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no defeat typified the Rangers' inability to win
low-scoring games more than their 1-0 setback July 30 against the
Blue Jays at SkyDome.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers wasted a brilliant performance that evening from
Loaiza, who recorded a career-high nine strikeouts and surrendered
one run on four hits during that eight-inning performance.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays scored the game's lone run on a two-out,
fifth-inning single by center fielder Shannon Stewart. Loaiza's
94-mph fastball on the inner half of the plate broke Stewart's bat,
yet the ground ball rolled through the middle of the infield.
Former shortstop Kevin Elster, who did not possess great range,
chased the ball behind second base and made a sliding attempt to
prevent it from reaching the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   Elster's range failed him, and the ball rolled into center
field. Catcher Darrin Fletcher scored from second base without a
throw.
</P>
<P>
   That served as the first of three starts in which Loaiza
received a loss or no-decision despite a 2.91 earned-run average
during that span. The Rangers managed only seven runs during those
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I joked with him after the game that I didn't want him to hear
him saying that we don't score runs for him,'' Oates said. ``We got
him two tonight and got him a win.''
</P>
<P>
   Reserve outfielder Mike Simms, who replaced the injured Juan
Gonzalez in right field and as the cleanup hitter for the second
time in as many games, gave the Rangers a 1-0 lead with his
fourth-inning home run on a 2-1 fastball from right-hander Steve
Karsay (0-2).
</P>
<P>
   The start represented only the second this season for Simms
against a right-hander, and he hit a home run in each with Gonzalez
absent from the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at it this way: I just want to go up there and have
productive at-bats,'' said Simms, who is hitting .370 (10-for-27)
in limited at-bats against right-handers. ``I don't look at it as,
`Here's my opportunity to prove I can hit right-handed pitching.'
That's not my role on this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Tom Goodwin drove home the other run with a
fifth-inning double, and that would be enough.
</P>
<P>
   It once was not.

COWBOYS' RECEPTION AT NO. 2 WIDEOUT REMAINS FUZZY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHREVEPORT, La. _ After more than three weeks of training camp,
Cowboys receiver Ernie Mills is positioned as the probable starter
opposite Michael Irvin at wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Mills lined up that way in the Cowboys' two preseason games
against the Seattle Seahawks and Oakland Raiders. And he opened
with the first team in the scrimmage against the New Orleans Saints
at Independence Stadium last night.
</P>
<P>
   Though he had no receptions in the first two games, Mills, an
eight-year veteran, has looked solid in practice, and his knowledge
of Cowboys coach Chan Gailey's offense seems to have given him an
edge over Billy Davis for now.
</P>
<P>
   But when Davis signed a multimillion-dollar contract in the
off-season, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones anointed the former
special-teamer as the starter opposite Irvin. And he has bettered
Mills in the preseason by exactly four receptions.
</P>
<P>
   So with less than a month before the season opener against the
Cardinals, neither Mills nor Davis has offered proof that he will
become a consistent threat opposite Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd like someone to distinguish themselves,'' Gailey said.
``That hasn't happened yet.''
</P>
<P>
   And it was more of the same last night against the Saints.
Neither player had a reception.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way the games have gone,'' Davis said. ``I wish we
could have done better, but the reads haven't come our way. We want
to make plays, that's why you play.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first two preseason games, not only have Mills and
Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman yet to connect in a game, Mills has
not even had a ball thrown in his direction.
</P>
<P>
   Mills said he is not worried. He said he'll only be concerned if
the drought continues in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said he's not alarmed and that the passes will soon get
to Mills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those situations, where the reads are not taking
Troy that way,'' Gailey said. ``It's not like we're not looking to
him to throw the ball to him. It could happen in the next game
three or four times. Who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   And to think, the receiver quandary was a question the Cowboys
came into training camp hoping to answer. They were looking for a
replacement for Anthony Miller, who caught 46 passes last season.
Now the leading candidates for his replacement have career
season-best totals of 39 (for Mills in 1995 with the Steelers) and
three (for Davis last year) and haven't shown to be an upgrade from
Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, however, is still an unknown quantity in the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey even admits as much. However, he remains confident that
Davis has the goods to make an impact at wide receiver and that
between Davis and Mills, the Cowboys will find a complement to
Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   And so far during the preseason, Mills and Davis have nowhere to
go but up.

 &HT;    Henry means business in bid
 &HT;    By Joe Capozzi
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ John W. Henry, who might just value his
privacy more than the millions he's earned as a commodities trader,
made a rare public appearance Tuesday to say: ``I would like to be
the next George Steinbrenner.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the first thing Henry offered _ to 20 reporters
invited into his inner sanctum on the second floor of the
black-glassed Northern Trust Building on Yamato Road _ was a
disclaimer about his latest deal-in-the-making:
</P>
<P>
   ``I am here to say I am very serious about attempting to
purchase the Florida Marlins.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, looking a bit startled as a turret of cameras popped and
whirred in his face, he fielded questions for 30 minutes about
several topics, including his desire to own a big-league team in
his ``back yard,'' plans to build a new stadium (with his own
money, if necessary), and a proposed holding a ``town meeting'' if
he gets the team, allowing fans to offer suggestions on how to
bring the World Series back to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The only question that went unanswered was perhaps the most
important: How serious is H. Wayne Huizenga about selling the
Marlins _ to John W. Henry, Don Smiley ... or anyone else?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Henry said. ``If the seller doesn't want to
sell, you can't get to the negotiating table.''
</P>
<P>
   Huizenga was in Europe on vacation Tuesday. ``We simply don't
negotiate through the media,'' said Huizenga spokesman Stan Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Henry, 48, is ``surprised'' Huizenga has not responded to a
$150million cash offer he made two weeks ago. This after it
appeared Smiley's yearlong effort to meet Huizenga's $165million
asking price had failed.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, Henry agreed to join a proposed ownership
group headed by Smiley, the Marlins president and a Huizenga crony.
Henry, who owns 1 percent of the New York Yankees, said he was set
to chip in $10 million ``as a good South Florida citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   But Henry said he eventually dropped out because Smiley was
unable to persuade Major League Baseball to relax a rule that
prohibits a person from owning interest in more than one team. At
the time, Henry was not willing to give up his Yankees share in
exchange for holding a limited share of the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   After he dropped out, Henry said he started learning details of
Smiley's plan, including the possibility the Marlins may leave
Florida. After waiting a year _ ``out of respect for Don Smiley and
his bid'' _ Henry said he recently made his own offer of
$120million to $130million to Huizenga's representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Henry called that ``a generous offer'' because the Minnesota
Twins are asking $120 million and the Kansas City Royals are asking
$75 million.
</P>
<P>
   He was rejected, but two weeks ago, ``I offered $150 million
because (the team) is in my back yard. I'd be willing to pay a
premium for that.'' And he also was willing to part with his
Yankees share in exchange for assuming sole ownership of the
Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   But, Henry said, ``The reaction was, ``Let's talk about it
later.'''
</P>
<P>
   Henry tried pushing the process, calling Major League Baseball
about approving him, which he figured would be a formality because
he had gone through a similar review before retaining his Yankees
interest in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   But he was told that baseball rules call for the seller to
submit the name of a prospective buyer _ something that Huizenga
has not done.
</P>
<P>
   Does Henry believe Huizenga is reluctant to field offers?
``That's my feeling,'' he said. ``But it's summer. There could be a
number of reasons they're not overly anxious to sell the club.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he has ``no way of knowing'' the status of Smiley's
bid, which has been endorsed by key baseball executives and was
approved in a handshake deal with Huizenga last month on the
condition that baseball approve ``certain documents.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Smiley deal hinges on a complicated four-way agreement
involving the sale of Huizenga's interest in SportsChannel to
Charles Dolan of Cablevision, who would sell Marlins TV rights to
Barry Diller of USA Broadcasting. Diller would then join Smiley's
investment group, which could include Huizenga retaining $50million
in interest.
</P>
<P>
   Henry, who said he'd welcome Huizenga as a minority partner, has
been given no timeline on a response to his bid.
</P>
<P>
   While his personality is different from Yankees owner
Steinbrenner, Henry said they share a trait that would encourage
Marlins fans who have seen their championship team dismantled.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least he fields winners,'' Henry said of Steinbrenner. ``In
spite of what the media says about him, I have learned a lot from
him. No one is more committed to winning than he is.''

 &HT;    Miami recruit roams secondary
 &HT;    By Jorge Milian
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORAL GABLES, Fla _ Normally, Mike Rumph likes to wake up at
noon or 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday was not a normal day for Rumph, the former Atlantic
High School star, who arose from bed at 5:45 a.m. to join nearly 30
other University of Miami newcomers for the first day of freshmen
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's early for me,'' said Rumph, a solidly-built 6-foot-2,
196-pound defensive back.
</P>
<P>
   Rumph appeared wide awake at Tuesday morning's workout, earning
quick praise from UM coach Butch Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He practiced like a veteran,'' Davis said. ``He's a guy that
we'd like to count on.''
</P>
<P>
   While it may be too early to tell whether Rumph will contribute
as a first year freshman, chances are that he will.
</P>
<P>
   Among the four returning players competing at free and strong
safety, only Jeff Popovich has starting experience. Rumph will also
get a look at cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you count on freshmen to contribute, you're usually
reaching, but first indications on Mike are outstanding,'' said UM
defensive coordinator Bill Miller. ``He looks great on the hoof.''
</P>
<P>
   Rumph says he was a Hurricane long before he put on the uniform.
Growing up in Delray Beach, Rumph followed UM religiously and
repeatedly watched highlight tapes of the school's four national
championship teams. In high school, Rumph wore No. 4 in honor of
former UM defensive back Earl Little.
</P>
<P>
   When it came time to decide where to attend college, Rumph had
little thinking to do. He orally committed to UM after his junior
season and stuck by his decision despite prodding from many of the
nation's top football programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always knew I was coming,'' Rumph said.
</P>
<P>
   Rumph says he spent the entire summer preparing himself for
Tuesday's first practice. Lifting weights added 12 pounds of muscle
to his frame. Running sprints regularly with Atlantic secondary
coach Chris Bean kept him lean.
</P>
<P>
   Still, waking up extra early and working out under the hot South
Florida sun on Tuesday wasn't easy for Rumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running agility drills kill you first thing in the morning,''
Rumph said.
</P>
<P>
   But he wasn't complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost like a dream being on the field today,'' Rumph
said. JOSEPH WANTS TO RETURN
</P>
<P>
   Carlo Joseph, who applied for the NFL Draft in April but was not
selected, has appealed to the NCAA to have his eligibility
restored.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph started eight games at fullback last season as a junior,
but decided to skip his senior season to turn pro.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph's appeal is unlikely to be granted by the NCAA because
the Pompano Beach native signed with an agent following the 1997
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a longshot,'' Davis said about the possibility of Joseph
returning to the UM squad. ``But it's an option Carlo should
explore.'' MISCELLANEOUS
</P>
<P>
   Davis says he has ``no idea'' whether back-up quarterback Steve
Kelly will report with the rest of the varsity today. Several UM
sources say Kelly will remain home in Texas. ``We certainly would
like to encourage him to come back, but this football program is
moving forward,'' Davis said...Matt Walters, a freshman defensive
lineman from Melbourne, will miss 2-3 weeks because of a broken
left foot sustained in the Florida-Georgia high school game earlier
this summer...Linebacker Dan Morgan is one of 68 players selected
as Butkus Award nominees.

DODGERS EARN CHORUS OF BOOS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Dodgers were talking about the meltdown, not
the comeback.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-August, scoring five runs in the ninth doesn't matter.
Losing 8-6 to the last-place Florida Marlins on Tuesday afternoon
did.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter how many ex-Marlins are in the Dodgers'
lineup. None of them are hitting.
</P>
<P>
   Forget that the Dodgers have a $61 million payroll and that the
stripped-down Marlins' is $6 million. The only reason the Dodgers
were in a position to win at the end was Florida's bullpen walked
six batters, including three with the bases loaded that forced in
runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We badly need an eight- or nine-game winning streak to take a
run at this thing,'' said Bobby Bonilla, knowing his new team
hasn't won three straight in three weeks and has done it only twice
in three months.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' pitching allowed a season-high 17 hits to the
second-worst hitting team in the National League. Until the eighth,
no Dodgers runner had reached third base against the league's
second-worst pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Add it up and the Dodgers are now only a game over .500. A much
kinder judge of their season, the National League wild-card race,
has them five games from the final playoff spot with 43 games left.
But the harshest critics were the fans, who hopped on every Dodgers
misstep with loud booing.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 35,270 represented the amount of tickets sold, but
was it about 12,000 more than the actual attendance Tuesday. The
fans know that, since salvaging a split nine days ago with the Mets
at Shea Stadium, the Dodgers have gone 2-5 against teams that have
lost 69 games more than they have won.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone is happy with the way we've been playing the last
seven games, they're an idiot,'' said Eric Karros, who lined out
with the bases loaded to end the game. ``Were not hitting, we're
not pitching. Our 3-4-5 hitters aren't doing anything. We're
getting beat by guys we have no right losing to.''
</P>
<P>
   Since blowing a four-run lead in the eighth inning to Montreal a
week ago, the Dodgers have lost to a ``Who's Who'' of Carl Pavano,
Jay Powell and Chris Peters. Tuesday, rookie left-hander Jesus
Sanchez (6-6) joined the gang, limiting the Dodgers to five hits
and no runs in 61/3 innings. That makes it three rookies and one
second-year pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first loss against Montreal, No.3 hitter Raul Mondesi
is 3 for 18 with two RBI. Cleanup hitter Gary Sheffield is 2 for 15
with one RBI. Karros is 5 for 25 with two RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Mondesi missed two games with a sore lower back and
Sheffield was suspended for three games. But they still have not
returned.
</P>
<P>
   And the Dodgers' pitching also has struggled. Darren Dreifort
(6-11), who has one victory since June 30, allowed 11 hits and five
runs in five innings. He gave way to Darren Hall, who immediately
gave up a home run to Todd Dunwoody.
</P>
<P>
   Dunwoody was the scourge of the Dodgers all day, adding a double
and two-run single. And there were others. Derrick Lee had a
two-run double in the eighth that made it 8-0. But Lee's most
memorable at-bat came in the third, when his bloop single to left
dropped in front of Bonilla.
</P>
<P>
   A tender left Achilles tendon limits Bonilla's mobility, but the
play looked bad and the fans let him have it. When Bonilla failed
to come up with Greg Zaun's double into the corner during Florida's
three-run fourth, the boos just kept on coming.

 &HT;    Commentary: Dolphins' reality check: Jaguars, Bucs

<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A few S(t)oda crackers to snack on as
summer's dog days reach full yelp:
</P>
<P>
   Sports Illustrated, in its pro football preview issue, picks
Jacksonville over Tampa Bay in Super Bowl XXXIII in Pro Player
Stadium. How would that scenario, if it plays out, stand as the
ultimate insult to the Dolphins?
</P>
<P>
   Don't know who's going to be named 1998's Female Athlete of the
Year. But the winner among the guys is Jeff Gordon, and the
checkered flag has fallen on that race.
</P>
<P>
   Everything that's out of whack in the link between television
money and sports is demonstrated, now and forever, by the reported
$600 million proposal from Disney (read: ABC and ESPN) for NHL
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, the ragamuffin United States hoops team did no better than
a bronze medal in the World Championships. But, even if you weren't
paying close attention, weren't you secretly pulling harder for
those CBAers and European Leaguers than you ever did for the Dream
Teamers?
</P>
<P>
   Michael Irvin gets into a fight with Everett McIver, allegedly
cuts him on the neck with a pair of scissors and then _ facing a
possible prison sentence if discovered to have violated terms of
probation stemming from a no-contest plea to felony cocaine
possession in 1996 _ reaches a financial agreement with McIver,
reportedly brokered by Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, to buy
silence. That's called hush money, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   PGA Tour. Union. Spare me.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter what those silly tennis rankings indicate on
any given weekly flip-flop. Marcelo Rios is not the No. 1 men's
player in the world. That would be Pete Sampras, who will prove the
point _ again _ next month at the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   There's a simple formula for computing the probability that Jim
Leyland will not manage the Florida Marlins next season. Take the
number of Marlins losses, and put a percentage sign behind it. By
the end of the year, Leyland should be, oh, 103 percent gone.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad Ali's recent short-term involvement with the
magnetic-wave machine for regeneration of nerve cells as an
experimental treatment for his Parkinson's disease seemed sadly
desperate and desperately sad.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa and Ken Griffey Jr., through games
played Monday night, had combined for 133 home runs ... and 313
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about a state of conFusion. What's the big deal with this
Valderrama guy?
</P>
<P>
   The guess is that Florida State, Florida and Miami will lose six
regular-season games as a group. Do your own applications. And
nobody among the Seminoles, Gators and Hurricanes has the best
college quarterback in the state. Not even close. The rumor mill
has 6-4, 240-pound Central Florida senior Daunte Culpepper as a
possible No. 1 _ that's overall _ pick in the next NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs in cycling. Drugs in swimming. Drugs everywhere. It's not
competition, anymore. It's pharmacology.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't matter how careful the coaches are. These long high
school practices in the sweltering heat of South Florida's
summertime scare me.
</P>
<P>
   A basic question concerning the capital-H Heat, if the NBA
actually gets around to playing a 1998-99 schedule: Are they on the
way up or down?
</P>
<P>
   This rivalry, finally, between Coronado's Quest and Victory
Gallop _ Haskell Invitational and, soon, Travers Stakes _ sure
makes you wish they had hooked up in the Triple Crown gigs.
</P>
<P>
   About those Marlins ... there's no truth to the rumor the
franchise plans to scrap the nickname because it can't afford the
bill(fish).

   MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. _ Last weekend at the women's tennis
tournament in Carlsbad, a few of us watched a night-time semifinal
match on TV in the press room, close to our lap-tops. There was
deadline tension until, during a break in the action, a comical
video clip appeared on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   It showed the final point of the 1979 U.S. Open, in which Tracy
Austin beat Chris Evert for the title. They looked ridiculous,
Tracy in her ``Little House on the Prairie'' dress and Chrissy in
her bangs. But that wasn't the funny part.
</P>
<P>
   Austin served. The ball followed the approximate trajectory of
the Gateway Arch. Evert slammed a forehand return. It blooped into
the net. Game, set, match. And doubled-over laughter in the press
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy,'' Austin said sarcastically on TV, where she was doing
the color commentary, ``we really hit the ball hard.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, fans might reasonably have assumed women's tennis was
as good as it could get. At the end of that season, the top five in
the world rankings _ the U.S. Open finalists plus Martina
Navratilova, Evonne Goolagong Cawley and Billie Jean King _ were
once or future No. 1 players, the only time that has happened. And
Andrea Jaeger was on her way up.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, looking back, they were just patting the ball around. Since
that supposed pinnacle, the game has only gotten better. In the
past two decades, no already-prominent sport has changed, just in
the way it's played, as much as women's tennis.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about the glamour and personality of the teen-age ``Brat
Pack,'' widely credited with reviving interest in tournaments like
this week's Acura Classic at Manhattan Country Club. What makes
women's tennis better than ever these days is simply that they hit
the ball so damned HARD.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to appreciate if you only watch on TV. Everything
looks slower from the baseline camera.
</P>
<P>
   Come to a tournament. Get a seat on the sidelines. Be prepared
for the furious back-and-forth to give your neck a full
chiropractic treatment. Watch Monica Seles up close. Say goodbye to
your image of her as a frail kid sister. The woman kills the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The game used to be about waiting for the other woman to
mis-hit. Players could lob their moonballs and slices from the
baseline all afternoon. To cite an extreme example, at a Richmond,
Va., tournament in 1984, pros Vicki Nelson-Dunbar and Jean Hepner
played a 29-minute !ital!point!off!; the ball crossed the net 643
times. Their match took 6 hours, 31 minutes for !ital!two
sets!off!. Who won? Who cared anymore?
</P>
<P>
   They don't play pattycake anymore. Women armed with oversized
rackets and visible muscle serve big, charge the net, hammer
volleys. Women hit topspin. From the baseline they're able to mix
in a dropshot. The sheer variety is splendid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more aggressive, people are more fit, they're hitting the
ball harder,'' said Natalie Tauziat, the Wimbledon finalist who won
her first-round match over Chanda Rubin 6-4, 7-5 here Tuesday.
Tauziat, at 30 the second-oldest in the tournament, has pushed her
ranking back up to No. 11, a career high she first reached in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 11 (the first time), the tennis was easier,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   One difference from the '70s is the rackets _ wider and lighter
and thus more forgiving and powerful. The howitzers that have
turned the men's game into a numbing succession of one-shot rallies
has saved the women's game from a numbing succession of numbing
successions.
</P>
<P>
   Turn back the calendar and give Austin and Evert today's
weapons, and maybe they'd rip the ball too.
</P>
<P>
   That's a question of will as much as technology. The truism on
the tour was that Americans copied Evert's baseline style and the
rest of the world copied Navratilova's power game. But only after
the Iron Curtain came down did tennis fully open up to the rest of
the world. Now eight countries are represented in the top 12.
</P>
<P>
   Navratilova's influence was felt in the area of fitness as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember going to have dinner with Martina,'' said Lee
Jackson, a WTA Tour administrator, remembering Navratilova's early,
underconditioned days, ``and her ordering three kinds of meat.''
</P>
<P>
   When Navratilova toned up, her rivals had to keep up, and the
result was today's superathletic style. Her present-day equivalent,
Lindsay Davenport, is the latest example of what improving your
fitness will do.
</P>
<P>
   As Steffi Graf is discovering after nine months away following
knee surgery, the tour is deeper than it has been in decades. Until
the past two years, when first Martina Hingis, then Iva Majoli,
then Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and then Jana Novotna scored Grand
Slam upsets, it had been 16 years since back-to-back Grand Slams
were won by lower than first or second seeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has played well,'' Tauziat said. ``But the tour is better.
That's why it's hard for her to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   The women's tour is better than ever. It has personality. It has
depth. And most of all, they hit the ball so damned HARD. &QL;

(mk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Boston Globe gave Mike Barnicle a reprieve Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   After five days of lobbying by supporters of the popular
columnist and after 30 hours of meetings and telephone conferences
among the newspaper's top executives, Matthew Storin, The Globe's
editor, announced at a crowded staff meeting that he would no
longer demand Barnicle's resignation but had imposed a two-month
suspension instead.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Tuesday afternoon, Storin said he had been
``persuaded by the argument that the punishment doesn't fit the
crime.'' Barnicle's offense _ using jokes in an Aug. 2 column that
paralleled the writings of the comedian George Carlin _ originally
brought him a one-month suspension, after he told editors he had
not read Carlin's book.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, a local television station, WCVB-TV, broadcast a
videotape of a June 22 program showing Barnicle recommending the
book as summer reading. The editors in Boston called Storin, who
was on vacation in Italy, he said. The decision to ask for
Barnicle's resignation, Storin said, ``was urged on me and I urged
it on the publisher.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barnicle refused to resign. After he pleaded his case to the
listeners of Don Imus' radio program and to the audience of NBC's
``Today'' show last week, the newspaper was deluged with calls,
e-mail and letters, heavily in Barnicle's favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think ultimately we tried to be fair to everybody,'' said
the newspaper's publisher, Benjamin Taylor. ``To Matt, to the
editors, to Mike and most importantly to the newspaper and the
staff. He added that a well-publicized letter the chief executive
of Staples sent him on Friday questioning whether it was worth
advertising in a newspaper that didn't carry Barnicle's work ``was
not a factor in our decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle, in turn, offered more in the way of public apologies
than he has since the furor erupted last Wednesday, changing his
earlier defiant tone to one of contrition. ``I apologized to Matt,
I apologized to the publisher for putting the newspaper in this
terribly awkward position due to my own personal sloppiness,'' he
said at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the time to be sloppy in the summer of media
introspection,'' Barnicle added. ``I caused great distress for a
great many good people who work hard every single day to put this
paper out.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision left The Globe's newsroom deeply divided.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a happy boy today because I think the management did the
right thing,'' said David Nyhan, like Barnicle an associate editor
at the paper and a longtime member of the paper's staff. ``I am
vastly relieved. I am proud of the publisher and the editor for
reversing a stand that was taken in too much haste.''
</P>
<P>
   But others complained, sometimes bitterly, of a double standard.
Though no one argued that Barnicle's offense was comparable to the
repeated fabrications that led to the forced resignation of the
columnist Patricia Smith earlier this summer, several people argued
passionately that Barnicle got special treatment. Ms. Smith is
black and Barnicle is white.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not solely a racial issue. It is a credibility
issue,'' said Howard Manly, the sports media critic for The Globe.
``The Boston Globe suffered a significant hit as a result of
management's indecisiveness. The paper will require years to
overcome the perception that it is in fact an institution where the
old-boy network flourishes,'' added Manly, who described himself as
``black first, a journalist second.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Barnicle and the paper's editors, Manly said: ``I totally
feel for them. Here was a guy who fought for his job and was
afforded every reasonable doubt. But would that happen to me or any
of the other 300 or 400 or so reporters in the building? No.''
</P>
<P>
   And he added: ``What Pat Smith did was disgusting. But how this
particular case was handled suggests, to me at least, that there
are some people who are larger than one of the oldest newspapers in
the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Storin said Tuesday that in addition to Barnicle's suspension,
the columnist had agreed to cut back on his television appearances.
He currently appears occasionally on MSNBC and the PBS program
``News Hour With Jim Lehrer.''
</P>
<P>
   Management's hard-line stand on Barnicle began to crack during a
meeting on Monday at which, Storin said, Barnicle presented his
editor and his publisher ``with a long letter,'' pleading his case.
</P>
<P>
   Storin then began a series of conversations with his top
editors, including the executive editor, Helen Donovan; the
managing editor, Gregory Moore; the managing editor for news
operations, Thomas Mulvoy Jr., and the managing editor for
administration, Louisa Williams. Storin said that during these
discussions he realized he did not believe that Barnicle's actions
``were reasons for termination or, in hindsight, asking for his
resignation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was left with the question: Was he viable as a columnist
with all of this? And his relationship with the editors here _
which had deteriorated over the years _ could it be rescued? I
needed their answers as well as his.''
</P>
<P>
   The group of editors eventually endorsed the decision after
meeting with Barnicle on Tuesday morning. But some of their remarks
Tuesday afternoon seemed tinged with ambivalence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm never comfortable with this kind of turmoil and
controversy and hurt and pain,'' Moore said. ``But I understand why
the decision was made, I was a part of the decision, and I accept
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Donovan said Barnicle told his colleagues ``he could
understand that people could see him as being bigger than The
Globe. He tried to make the case that he recognized that he
wasn't.'' Asked if she took him at his word, she hesitated, then
said, ``He was clearly aware of what the problems for editors at
the paper have been that have come from his attitude over the
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Around Boston, Barnicle's partisans were relieved. ``He's a hell
of a guy and he always has been,'' said Harvey Glenen, 66, a
freelance writer from Barnstable.
</P>
<P>
   ``He works hard for a living,'' Glenen said, ``and I agree with
some _ but not all _ of what he says.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite the relief in some sections of the newsroom that
Barnicle had survived, some black staff members who expressed
outrage scheduled a meeting Tuesday night to determine what action,
if any, they might take in response.

JUDGE LETS STRIP CLUB REOPEN, WITH DANCERS WEARING BIKINIS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Bronx strip club that was one of the first closed
under the city's new zoning law can reopen, a state judge ruled
Tuesday after the club's owners promised that they would clothe
their dancers in bikinis.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, which came over protests from city lawyers,
suggested that if strip clubs become go-go bars _ clubs that
feature scantily clad, but not nude, dancers _ they may be able to
operate in New York under the Giuliani administration's new
anti-sex shop measure.
</P>
<P>
   Although lawyers for the city predicted that the owners of the
Bronx club, El Coche, were likely to lapse into nude dancing,
Justice Douglas McKeon said they should be given a chance to
operate under strict new guidelines. ``They are entitled to an
opportunity to comply,'' McKeon said.
</P>
<P>
   While approving the reopening of the club, McKeon made it clear
that the new law would be strictly enforced. The judge, who said he
might visit the bar to check on compliance, warned that violations
of the ground rules established in court Tuesday would not be
tolerated. He ordered the club's owner, Jobo Salazar, to post a
$50,000 bond and face potential jail time and fines if any of the
ground rules were broken.
</P>
<P>
   In a six-point proposal submitted by Solomon Kaplan, the club's
lawyer, the club agreed that all dancers would wear bikini bottoms
and tops at all times. Customers would be barred from touching
dancers and performers would be prohibited from simulating sexual
acts.
</P>
<P>
   The club also pledged to hire security personnel to separate
dancers from customers, who would be required to place any cash
tips in a basket to prevent them from touching the women.
</P>
<P>
   If any of the above conditions are violated, the judge warned,
Salazar would be held in contempt of court and face arrest.
Violations could lead to fines of up to $50,000 and result in the
permanent shutdown of the club, McKeon said. Despite the
conditions, El Coche's lawyer called the ruling a victory.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon said that Salazar was trying to post the $50,000 bond
and hoped to reopen the bar in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working on it right now,'' Solomon said. ``They're very
happy.''

   HOUSTON _ Figuring out how far Lynn Bartlett's erector-set grid
of sprinklers can reach as they pivot around his sun-cracked cotton
fields along the Salt Fork of the Red River is really not much of a
chore.
</P>
<P>
   The plants within the irrigated perimeter stand three or four
feet high, thick and bristling with moist green bolls of healthy
cotton, some of them as big as an apricot. Just beyond the water's
reach, though, the plants slouch only a foot above the scaly soil
and most have just two or three dusty bolls, none bigger than a
ping pong ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is basically burnt-up cotton,'' Bartlett said. ``We had a
good planting rain back in May, then a week or so later the tap
just shut off and it's been off ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   While many parts of the country, including the Northeast, are
suffering through dry months verging on drought, the situation is
particularly severe in Texas and Oklahoma. Just two years after a
drought ravaged large swaths of the rich agricultural region, both
states are in the midst of a dry spell that officials say shows
signs of developing into the costliest and most devastating the
region has seen since the Dust Bowl years.
</P>
<P>
   There is not a corner of Texas that is not laboring under severe
or extreme drought conditions. President Clinton has declared each
of the state's 254 counties a federal disaster area, making farmers
eligible for low-interest loans. ``The crops have been lost, the
livestock has been liquidated and there's really no relief in
sight,'' said Texas Agriculture Commissioner Rick Perry. ``I am
starting to hear reports that this is the worst ever.''
</P>
<P>
   During crucial growing weeks from April through June, Texas
received little measurable water at all. South Texas, which has
been hit hardest by the drought, received only 8 percent of its
normal precipitation, the citrus ranchlands of the Rio Grande
Valley only 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma received only two-thirds of its normal rainfall from
June 1 to Aug. 1, and the southwestern corner of the state received
less than a third. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman recently
declared 66 of Oklahoma's 77 counties _ all but the northeast
corner of the state _ federal disaster areas, and state officials
are hearing the same sort of dire reports about the drought's
effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of agribusiness if very much affected,'' said Oklahoma
Agriculture Commissioner Dennis Howard. ``The ag dollar goes around
Main Street six, seven, eight times, but it's not going around now,
because it's not there. Small town Oklahoma is really hurting.''
</P>
<P>
   But Texas and Oklahoma have changed a great deal since the Dust
Bowl years of the 1930s, growing more urban and more economically
diverse, particularly in the last two decades. So even though the
drought could have a ruinous effect on farmers, cattle ranchers,
small towns and agriculture-related businesses, it could well be
cushioned from leveling the overall economy of the region.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday in Washington, the U.S. Agriculture Department will
release its monthly crop report, estimating how many of the
country's planted acres will be worth harvesting and what they
might be expected to produce.
</P>
<P>
   The news is not expected to be good for Texas or Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Already, officials in Texas have estimated that the drought will
cost farmers and ranchers $1.8 billion, and will result in a $4.9
billion drain on the state's overall economy. In Oklahoma,
officials last week predicted a total statewide cost of $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But both Jared Hazelton, director of the Center for Business and
Economic Analysis at Texas A&AMP;M University, and Bernard Weinstein,
director of the Center for Economic Development at the University
of North Texas, have said that the drought will not have as dire an
effect as some are predicting. That is because, they say,
agriculture accounts for only about 1 percent of Texas' $641
billion economy, even though one of eight acres used for
agriculture in the nation is in Texas. ``The wonderful thing about
the growth in the '90s is it isn't tied to a single-sector
economy,'' Hazelton said. ``There is no dominant industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists say that while the drought will inevitably affect
prices at supermarkets all over the country, it is too early which
products will be affected and by how much.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Oklahoma, where agriculture remains the state's leading
industry, the state's economy has thus far been able to withstand
the drought's impact. ``Now, thank goodness, Oklahoma's economy is
more diversified than it was,'' Howard said. ``The whole state
isn't being impacted like it was during the drought in 1982, when
we really went into a nosedive.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without such a nosedive this year, agriculture officials
say, the drought will still be crushing to those corners of the
region where agriculture remains at the center of life. In rural
Texas and small town Oklahoma, they say, businesses will close,
tens of thousands of jobs will be lost, cattle herds will be
affected for years to come and nervous bankers will refuse to lend
money to more and more struggling farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In metropolitan cities, the impact will be felt in consumer
prices and in those businesses connected to agriculture,'' said
Carl Anderson, an agricultural economist at Texas A&AMP;M. ``But the
real impact will be felt in smaller farm communities, and it's
going to be devastating. They're going to have problems collecting
taxes to keep open their schools. It's going to speed up the drying
up of these small, rural communities.''
</P>
<P>
   A $500 million federal aid package is in a House-Senate
conference committee, but agriculture officials in Texas and
Oklahoma are complaining because half of that money is earmarked
for farmers in the Dakotas and Minnesota. Glickman told officials
during his recent swing through the region that he wanted the total
raised to $1 billion, maybe more.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma organized a Plains
States Rural Crisis Summit meeting meeting in Oklahoma City, where
he and the governors of three other states concerned about the
drought _ South Dakota, North Dakota and Nebraska _ adopted 22
emergency and long-term recommendations, including urging President
Clinton and Congress to act more quickly to pump drought relief
into the region.
</P>
<P>
   Perry, the Texas agriculture commissioner, is pushing a plan to
use some of Texas' budget surplus for a fund to provide aid during
natural disasters. But the Texas Legislature, which meets
biannually, is not scheduled to meet this year, so such a law could
not be passed until 1999 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Truman Zybach raises cattle on 1,700 acres in southwestern
Oklahoma and across the Texas line. On his 900-acre ranch in
Oklahoma, he said, he would normally have 700 head of cattle at
this time of year. But last Friday, with no grass in the fields for
the cattle to eat and little hay available in the markets, Zybach
packed up four truckloads and sold them off, leaving him with only
50 or 60 cows.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no green grass at all,'' Zybach said. ``We're plum out
of green grass.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Feagley, manager of the Farmers Cooperative Society No. 1
in Wellington, Texas, said conditions were as bad in the Panhandle
as he had ever seen them.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Feagley's business comes from the co-op's two cotton
gins. But this year, business has been so bad that the co-op is
trying to sell one gin. The co-op also provides a weighing service
for trucks full of cattle on their way to be sold. ``Normally,
you'd start getting the cattle trucks in September,'' Feagley said.
``But the ranchers are all out of grass out there, so they're
selling early. They have to. I weighed 12 trucks already today.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Davis, an economist at the Texas Agricultural Extension
Service, estimates that Texas cattle ranchers have already lost
$451 million; $126 million from being forced to sell off their
herds early and $351 million from buying expensive feed in a vain
effort to keep the herds going. If there are no rains in August,
the year's loss figures could double, said Larry Boleman, a cattle
specialist at Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   In Oklahoma, the story is similar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dry land cotton is gone,'' Howard said. ``Irrigated cotton is
very stressed. Much of it won't make it. The watermelon crop is
three-fourths off. The pecans, they're pretty well wiped out. Hay
crop is 70 or 80 percent off. The horticulture industry is feeling
it. People aren't buying shrubs and trees. If we don't get rain
very quickly, we are not going to have any wheat pasture this fall.
Corn is 80 or 90 percent gone. Soybeans are something like 70
percent gone. My dairy farmers tell me that because of their heat
the cows are just off their feed, off their milk and production is
down a third or a half. I know how the cows feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett walked through his field near the Salt and watched a
neighbor's tractor kick up reddish dust. ``I've heard of these
droughts, but I've never been through one,'' Bartlett said.
</P>
<P>
   On his own dry land, Bartlett said, he would normally expect to
get 300 to 400 pounds of cotton per acre. This year, he will get
only 50 to 100. ``The irrigated cotton is close to normal,'' he
said, ``but it's costing me $50 more an acre in watering. That's an
expensive crop I've got in the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well from now until the harvest, he expects to lose
about half of what he would have earned on a normal crop.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may well be a few less farmers around here next
season,'' Bartlett said. ``Who knows? I may be one of them.'' He
tossed a shriveled cotton boll back into a crusty furrow. ``No, I
don't really think so. I'll make it. But it all depends on how
understanding your banker is. The bankers have their rules and
regulations, too, I suppose. It's just life, I guess.''

MARINERS FALL, NEED LIFT FROM GRIFFEY

<P>
   TORONTO _ Ken Griffey Jr.'s single into left field Tuesday night
came too late to do the Mariners much good. But hitting coach Jesse
Barfield senses the end of an August drought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting that knock will help and it's just a matter of time
before he breaks out,'' said Barfield of the Mariner center
fielder. ``You can keep him down for a few days, but not much
longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, who sizzled in July (.351 with eight homers and 21
RBIs), went 1-for-4 in the Mariners' 7-4 loss to the Toronto Blue
Jays in front of 33,137 fans at SkyDome. The loss, ending Seattle's
four-game winning streak, went to starter Jeff Fassero. He carried
a 2-1 lead into the seventh inning, compliments of solo homers by
John Marzano in the second inning and Jay Buhner in the fourth, but
the Blue Jays took advantage of a questionable call by plate umpire
Joe Brinkman to score six runs in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey still leads the American League in home runs with 41,
but he hasn't hit one in 10 games this month. In fact, he hasn't
been getting many hits of any kind _ 8-for-37 with five RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been overanxious,'' said Barfield.
</P>
<P>
   That was demonstrated again in the first inning when Griffey
came to bat against Blue Jay starter Chris Carpenter with two on
and none out. Carpenter struck out Griffey, retired Edgar Martinez
on a line drive to third baseman Tony Fernandez and then got David
Segui to hit a routine fly to left field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to make good pitches on him (Griffey) and I
did,'' Carpenter said. ``I got lucky with the line drive Edgar hit
to Tony and was able to work myself out of the inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassero, working on three days' rest, pitched his usual game
against the Blue Jays ... until the fifth inning, when Toronto
sliced a two-run deficit in half. Sammy Stewart doubled over
Griffey's head in center field, scoring Craig Grebeck, who had led
off with the second of his three singles. Fassero, 3-0 with a 0.75
ERA in three previous career starts against Toronto, didn't survive
the seventh inn

CHURCH SAYS BURGLAR SOUGHT ITS ICON
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Queens detectives dusted for fingerprints Tuesday
around the altar of St. Irene Chrysovalantou Greek Orthodox
Cathedral in Astoria, where church officials said they were once
again the victims of an attempt to steal their most precious
treasure: the icon of St. Irene that, the faithful maintain, wept
on the eve of the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, the icon was left safe in its case to the
left of the altar, and the burglar was apparently frightened off by
an alarm system the church installed after its last brush with
crime in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, church officials said, a group of armed bandits
took the icon, only to return it five days later in the mail,
intact but without frame heavy with gold and jewels.
</P>
<P>
   It was a case that ultimately widened a rift between rival
factions of the Greek Orthodox Church. There were accusations that
the theft was a hoax, and a lawsuit filed as a result of those
accusations was only recently resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's scenario was all too familiar to worshipers. ``You
mean they tried to steal it again?'' asked Joseph Perez, a
cafeteria worker who said he often prayed before the icon. ``It's
terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Vikentios of Avlon, the spiritual leader of St. Irene's,
said he was called shortly after midnight Tuesday by a nun who
heard the church alarm. The burglar apparently entered from the
roof, shattering a window 30 feet above the altar and lowering a
rope, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The burglar was apparently cut by the glass, the police said,
since there was a trail of blood.
</P>
<P>
   The church had just finished a four-day celebration of the feast
of St. Irene, during which the icon was carried through the
neighboring streets in a solemn procession. Bishop Vikentios
speculated that the icon _ which is always bedecked by gold
watches, diamond rings, pearl necklaces and other valuables left by
supplicants _ may have attracted the attention of the burglar then.
``It's the treasure of the church,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After worshipers reported that the icon started weeping just
before the Persian Gulf war _ St. Irene had lived in the ninth
century in what is now Turkey _ thousands of people started going
each day to the small but ornate church.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As Christmas neared that year, church officials announced that
bandits who were masked and armed had invaded the church and taken
the icon.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the robbery deepened the break between St. Irene
Chrysovalantou _ the headquarters church of a dissident group
within the Greek Orthodox Church _ and the Greek Orthodox
Archdiocese of North and South America. The two groups were divided
by 13 days, the difference between the Julian calendar used by St.
Irene and the 30,000 members of the Old Calendrist group, and the
Gregorian calendar followed since 1924 by the 1.5 million members
of Greek Orthodox Church.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese cast doubt on the
icon's weeping and suggested that its theft and recovery were
hoaxes. Officials at St. Irene's responded with a $30 million libel
suit against the archdiocese and two local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   But after the dispute, there was a rapprochement. After
Archbishop Spyridon was appointed leader of the Greek Orthodox
Archdiocese of North and South America, he opened discussions with
Old Calendrist churches, and in April the Old Calendrists were
welcomed back into the mother church, as both sides agreed to
disagree on which calendar to use.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Archbishop Spyridon attended some of the festivities
over the weekend for the feast of St. Irene, and Tuesday afternoon
he visited the church and surveyed the bloodstains and the
shattered case of the icon of the Virgin. This time there were
words of consolation, not consternation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows a lack of respect for the religious beliefs of
others,'' Archbishop Spyridon said as he stood by the icons. ``I
can only hope that this will not be repeated.''

A NEAR-PERFECT NIGHT FOR WELLS AND THE YANKEES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ His perfect game created a cottage industry for David
Wells, whose locker is now stuffed with memorabilia requiring his
signature. There will always be another Beanie Baby or ticket stub
or baseball for Wells to scrawl across.
</P>
<P>
   The perfect game, too, heightened general expectations of Wells
_ and, others believe, Wells' expectations of himself. Regarded as
undisciplined in the past, Wells marches onward toward his first
20-victory season. Tuesday night, in his first game against
Minnesota since he pitched the perfect game on May 17, he held the
Twins to four hits and faced just three batters over the minimum of
27 in a 7-0 victory at Yankee Stadium. The shutout raised Wells'
record to 15-2.
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes for the Yankees, who have won the first six games
of their current homestand, outscoring their opponents by 48-12 and
trailing in only three and a half of 54 innings. They have won nine
of their last 10 games, for an unthinkable record of 86 victories
and 29 losses. They are 57 games over .500 for the first time since
Sept. 10, 1939. They are unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   Wells has won 15 of his last 16 decisions since losing his first
start of the year, and with perhaps nine starts remaining for a
team that loses about every week or 10 days, the chances of him
realizing 20 victories are excellent. After sparring with managers
and coaches over the years over his conditioning or other alleged
violations, Wells seems concentrated and focused, like those around
him.
</P>
<P>
   The perfect game, Yankees Manager Joe Torre said, ``called a lot
of attention to him.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``That could be the reason why he's so consistent.''
Wells is permanently on notice, in other words; if he has the
ability to pitch a perfect game, he has the ability to win.
</P>
<P>
   Wells was terrific before the perfect game, and has been even
better since. Going into last night's game, Wells was 9-1 with a
2.82 ERA after the perfect game. Over his last seven starts, dating
to June 20, opposing batters have just 1 hit in 35 at-bats with
runners in scoring position. Torre mentioned that on those nights
that Wells did not have his great stuff _ if his curveball was
missing, if his fastball did not have its usual zip _ he fought and
battled and found a way to win.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Twins and typical of the Yankees, Wells
did have his great stuff Tuesday night. Great fastball. Good
curveball, a changeup.
</P>
<P>
   Brent Gates quickly ended the question of whether Wells would
throw back-to-back perfect games against the Twins: The second
batter of the game, Gates bounced a chopper down the third-base
line, the ball kicking past Scott Brosius for a double.
</P>
<P>
   Wells otherwise shackled the Twins, facing just one batter over
the minimum for five innings as his teammates hammered the former
Yankees prospect Eric Milton.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill slugged a two-run homer in the first inning, Jorge
Posada's run-scoring single capped a three-run rally in the third,
and Milton _ nursing a sore shoulder _ was gone by the fifth
inning, when Posada smacked another two-run double.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Torre watched from the dugout, stoic as ever, on a milestone day
for him. He was managing the Mets on Aug. 6, 1977, when the San
Francisco Giants beat them, 7-3. Felix Millan had three hits for
the Mets, Ed Kranepool went 0 for 4, Willie McCovey played first
base for the Giants. Pat Zachry _ an unusual and talented pitcher
of his time, as Wells is unusual and talented _ suffered the defeat
that reduced Torre's managerial record to 31-31, .500.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' victory Tuesday night improved Torre's career
record to 1,168 victories and 1,168 losses, the first time he
reached .500 since that night more than 21 years ago; after leaving
the Mets, he managed Atlanta and St. Louis, before joining the
Yankees prior to the 1996 season.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Torre, his brother, had mentioned to Joe before this
season that he might have a chance to reach .500 again. But neither
had an inkling, Torre acknowledged, that it could be done this
summer. Nobody had an inkling the Yankees could be so good.

METS KNOW THE SCORE AFTER BEATING ST. LOUIS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Whether he lets on or not, Manager Bobby Valentine
is obviously keeping close track of where his Mets stand in the
National League wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   As he walked through the tunnel to the Busch Stadium field while
the Mets took batting practice Tuesday afternoon, Valentine could
be overheard updating himself after he had watched the end of the
Chicago Cubs' 8-7 loss in San Francisco. All even in the standing,
two up in the loss column, was the gist of what he was saying.
</P>
<P>
   Then Bobby Jones went out and led the Mets to an 8-3 victory
over the St. Louis Cardinals with his arm and bat Tuesday night.
That leapfrogged the Mets (64-53) over the Cubs (65-55) and pulled
New York into the NL wild-card lead for the first time since June
1.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the two Mets who seemed most interested in the
Cubs' game were Valentine and Jones. And even though Jones (8-7)
surrendered a mammoth home run to Mark McGwire _ the St. Louis
slugger's major-league leading 47th _ he limited the Cardinals to 3
runs and 8 hits in 7 innings, and drove in the game's first two
runs with a second-inning double. It was Jones' first victory in
more than a month.
</P>
<P>
   It also was the Mets' 16th in their last 23 games and pulled
them a season-high 11 games over .500 for the fourth time this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Jones had not won since July 2, a span of six starts. But if the
28-year-old right-hander felt any pressure knowing that he had the
chance to help the Mets overtake the Cubs, it did not show.
</P>
<P>
   Jone allowed three bases-empty homers, but only McGwire hit him
hard with any consistency. McGwire rifled a vicious one-hop double
off third baseman Edgardo Alfonzo's glove in the first inning, hit
a 464-foot homer in the fourth, hit a fly out to the warning track
just right of center in the sixth and, for the second consecutive
night, was struck out by Turk Wendell in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's homer came with the Mets already up, 4-0, thanks to
their second-inning outburst, which was keyed by Jones' two-out hit
of Kent Mercker (8-9) after an intentional walk to Rey Ordonez.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' eighth hit in 33 at-bats this season doubled his runs
batted in total to 4. It was not cheap either. Jones drove
Mercker's first pitch past the outstretched glove of Willie McGee
in the left-center field gap to score Brian McRae and Ordonez.
</P>
<P>
   McRae had doubled to open the inning, before Todd Hundley and
Luis Lopez struck out. After Jones' double, Jermanine Allensworth,
playing his first game for the Mets a day after being acquired from
Kansas City, singled the pitcher home, then took second on an error
by McGee.
</P>
<P>
   Edgardo Alfonzo followed with a single to score Allensworth. And
Jones had a four-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   After McGwire homered to make it 4-1, McGee drilled a one-out
double in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones stranded him and did the same to Ray Lankford after a
two-out double in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets rallied for runs in the fifth and the seventh to give
their starter a cushion. Mike Piazza drove in one with a
fifth-inning sacrifice fly, following a lead-off double by Alfonzo
and a single by John Olerud. Hundley, who struck out three times
batting right-handed against Mercker, singled home the other run
batting left-handed against Mark Petkovsek to give the Mets a 6-1
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Those runs came in handy in the Cardinal seventh because Jones
allowed homers _ one batter apart _ to Fernando Tatis and
pinch-hitter Tom Lampkin, as the home team closed to within, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets came right back with 2 runs in the eighth. And for
the first time in more than two months, they left a ball park in
the lead for the fourth post-season spot.

STATE EXAMINING EXPENSES OF OFFICIAL OF BATTERY PARK CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SELWYN RAAB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ State investigators disclosed Tuesday that they were
looking into allegations that the top executive of the mammoth
Battery Park City complex improperly used his expense account to
pay for a private trip to California and for hotel stays in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry, by the state inspector general's office, also
concerns $18,000 in raises that the executive, John LaMura, awarded
to his chief administrative aide without approval from the
three-member Battery Park City Authority, which oversees the
development of the complex.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators and former employees of the residential and
commercial complex in lower Manhattan said that the inquiry had
brought into the open and intensified rising friction between
LaMura, the authority's president and chief executive, and James
Gill, chairman of the authority's board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friction is an understatement,'' Martin Begun, a director,
said Tuesday. ``It's gotten hostile.''
</P>
<P>
   In a terse statement issued Tuesday, LaMura called the charges
false. Investigators and former employees said that LaMura had
privately blamed Gill, an influential lawyer and adviser to Gov.
George Pataki and other Republican officials, for igniting the
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   At stake in the investigation and the dispute between LaMura and
Gill are future policy decisions on developing the 92-acre site,
which includes luxury and middle-income housing for 7,600 residents
and office space for more than 40,000.
</P>
<P>
   Stretching from the northern tip of Battery Park to Canal Street
along the Hudson River, the uncompleted complex includes a yacht
basin, a 1.2-mile park esplanade, the Mercantile Exchange, the
World Financial Center, Stuyvesant High School and the Holocaust
Memorial and Museum of Jewish Heritage.
</P>
<P>
   LaMura and Gill did not return telephone calls Tuesday to their
offices for comment concerning their disagreements. But in separate
written statements, both men alluded to their feud. ``In any
organization as large, active and complex as Battery Park City,''
Gill said, ``one of the main challenges is not to let differences
that typically arise interfere with objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the allegations that led to the investigation, Gill
said that they were brought to his attention by an employee and
that he passed the complaint along ``to the appropriate people.''
</P>
<P>
   LaMura, a Republican and the former supervisor of the Long
Island town of Brookhaven, was recommended for his $129,837-a-year
job by Pataki and was appointed to head the agency in October 1996
by Gill and two other members of the authority's board.
</P>
<P>
   Gill, a Democrat, was placed on the board in 1995 by Pataki
after he had supported Pataki's election bid and the re-election of
another Republican, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, LaMura said, ``False allegations of a personal
nature, are, unfortunately, a risk of being part of the public
sector.''
</P>
<P>
   He expressed confidence that he would be cleared of any
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Adler, LaMura's lawyer, said ``personality differences''
had developed between his client and Gill. Adler insisted that
LaMura had the discretionary authority to grant raises and that
``his expense account expenditures were within the correct
standards.''
</P>
<P>
   The complaints against LaMura focus on a trip he took to San
Francisco, several overnight hotel stays in New York City and
raises he gave this year to his executive assistant, Alice Kent,
that pushed her salary to $59,000 from $41,000.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Del Giacco, a spokesman for Roslynn Mauskopf, the
state's inspector general, said Tuesday that ``an investigation of
these matters is under way.'' He declined to provide details on the
amount of expense account payments in question.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that,
at most, the expenditures amounted to several thousand dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Begun, an authority director for the last seven years, said that
the board had not been informed of Ms. Kent's raises, which he
described as excessive. The board, he added, did not review expense
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kent did not return telephone messages left for her Tuesday
at her office. But investigators said she had told them the salary
increases were justified since she was filling two jobs: executive
assistant to LaMura and the agency's assistant director of special
events.

N.J. MAN DENIES LINKS TO WORLD TRADE CENTER BLAST
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ A New Jersey man and native of the Gaza Strip who
has been detained for the last five months based on classified
allegations that he is linked to the World Trade Center bombing
denied those charges Tuesday in deportation hearings here.
</P>
<P>
   Hany Kiareldeen, 30, called the allegations that he was a
Palestinian terrorist ``total fabrications'' and repeated the
charges of his lawyer that it was his ex-wife, Amal Mohamed, who,
out of vindictiveness, had told the FBI the stories that led to his
being detained.
</P>
<P>
   He has never been formally charged with a crime and was detained
in March for having a lapsed visa. Tuesday, in Immigration Court,
he got his first chance to speak in court on the charges.
</P>
<P>
   One of the allegations reported in a government summary of
classified and confidential informer reports was that Kiareldeen
had met with a convicted World Trade Center conspirator, Nidal A.
Ayyad, and other terrorists at his home in Nutley, N.J., a week
before the 1993 bombing. The other allegation was that he had
threatened to kill Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Kiareldeen answered questions Tuesday from his lawyer, Regis
Fernandez, in a small courtroom where the eight guards outnumbered
the spectators. Kiareldeen said he lived in Garfield, not Nutley,
at the time that the FBI informer said he had been host for the
meeting of terrorists. He also said he did not even know who Janet
Reno was until he was told in April that informers had accused him
of threatening her life. At the time of the World Trade Center
bombing, Kiareldeen said, he was a delivery man for a pizza parlor
in Hackensack, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Weber, assistant district counsel for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, sought to undermine Kiareldeen's
credibility by questioning his tax returns and showing that he had
often listed different and nonexistent addresses on his immigration
applications and other documents, from school tuition receipts to
auto club memberships.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing is to continue Wednesday, when Kiareldeen's ex-wife
is scheduled to appear.

   But also forever changed.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, Appleby's wife, Renay, died from injuries she
suffered in a freak traffic accident at Waterloo Station in London.
Renay was 25 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sort of tough to decide on whether I was going to come
back, and how quickly,'' Appleby, 27, said. ``I wanted to come
back. I was drawing a lot of positives out of coming back.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's just a million little things that I'll miss. So
many small, little things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I'm walking around the course _ I see no one. She's not
there walking, not helping me when I need help. Simple, simple,
simple things. It's not the big things. It's all the little things,
and they all add up. They make someone's life.''
</P>
<P>
   The day that Appleby's life changed started out with such
promise. It was July 23, just after the British Open, and the
Applebys were headed on a vacation. They pulled up at Waterloo
Station in London in a cab and were unloading their luggage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were two parked cars, separated apart, and we were sort
of double-parked next to another car,'' Appleby said. ``We were
getting luggage out. I was just finishing getting the last items
out of the car and paying the cab when the driver, which was sort
of opposite us, parked in the parking lane, reversed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sort of felt as though Renay was near me. You know you have
the presence and feeling of someone's near you. And then the car
backed up and hit her, and I turned to see the car still reversing.
Then immediately the car stopped when it hit the other car.''
</P>
<P>
   What followed seemed almost unreal to Appleby. He and another
man tried to do CPR and heart massages while waiting for the
ambulance, but through it all Appleby said he remained calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not that scary at the time,'' he said. ``I didn't feel
very upset. I knew it was a very serious situation, but I felt like
I had it under control. It was just weird.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see these things on TV. It didn't seem real. Then the
ambulance came, and we went to the hospital. And I knew this was
not a simple thing. I knew it was very serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Renay died shortly after arriving at the hospital. The funeral
was July 31 in the couple's native Australia, and Appleby was left
trying to pick up the pieces of his life and his career.
</P>
<P>
   Appleby was having a solid year on the PGA Tour. He had won the
Kemper Open this season and was No. 26 on the money list with
$678,562. Appleby was regarded as one of the up-and-coming young
foreigners in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Appleby maintains he hasn't lost his passion for the game, but
it is now only that. A game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to look at it from what would Renay really like
me to do,'' Appleby said. ``What would she want me to do?
</P>
<P>
   ``She loved being with me on the road. She would want me to get
back on, like falling off your bike, and get back on with the right
frame of mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you don't forget someone like Renay, someone who means so
much to you. She's going to steer me in the right direction. And
that's what I've got to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tournament and I'm going to take it, each round,
each day, for the moment. Days are more important than scores, more
important than anything. This is bigger than any good or bad round
I can have.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least it put some perspective back in what I'm trying to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Appleby said the support he has received from his fellow touring
pros and the golf community has been amazing.
</P>
<P>
   Recent winners Billy Mayfair and Nick Price dedicated their
victories to Renay. Other players have made a point of talking with
Appleby and offering to help in any way they can.
</P>
<P>
   The fans have also responded, sending flowers, cards, faxes and
e-mails by the thousands to Appleby, who was overwhelmed by the
outpouring at Renay's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   But he knows some of the toughest moments have yet to come. He
hasn't returned to the Florida home where the couple lived for much
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's another one of the steps I have to take,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Getting through this week's PGA Championship is another. And
Appleby is counting on the one person who was always there for him
to see him through this time as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to talk about the person like they're still
there,'' Appleby said. ``You never have to fear to mention their
name. You laugh about things and the jokes that you might have told
them. You just feel as though that person is still there. You don't
feel as though that person is gone. Physically, yes, she's never
going to be there again. But mentally she'll always be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just got to imagine that she's here and she's helping me
and everything will be OK. She's going to help me. It will just
take patience.''

MOSS, A FIRST-CLASS PLAYER, FLIES COACH THESE DAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHENEY, Wash. _ Winston Moss has been called a lot of things in
his NFL career.
</P>
<P>
   Tenacious. Intense; even dirty. A leader. A leading tackler. A
role model. But coach? That's one he wasn't expecting, and
definitely not this early in his life.
</P>
<P>
   But here he is at the Seahawks' training camp, helping coach the
position he was playing just eight months ago. Moss, 32, is a
volunteer assistant. He has the title of defensive quality control
coach, but his job is to help new assistant coach Jim Johnson work
with what is the best collection of linebackers in club history.
</P>
<P>
   Moss would rather be one of them. Instead, he is working with
all of them because he was forced to retire after fracturing a
vertebra in his neck last December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I wish I could still play. I still wish I could get
out and hit some guys and cause some problems and have some fun,''
Moss said Tuesday. ``But that's not in the works anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Coaching occasionally crossed Moss' mind during the 10 weeks he
spent in a halo brace so his neck could mend, but the thought never
lingered that long. He was too busy coping with the present to deal
much with the future.
</P>
<P>
   If it is difficult for Moss to adjust, think about those players
who were his teammates a year ago but are now playing for coach
Moss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of tough to say coach Moss,'' offered linebacker
Chad Brown, who still calls his coach Winston.
</P>
<P>
   Moss doesn't have this job just because he's a former player
whose career was ended by an injury. Or because he played for
Seahawks coach Dennis Erickson at the University of Miami. Or
because he has a glare that can melt face masks.
</P>
<P>
   Moss was hired out of respect and because of respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winston is a high-character individual who I've always had a
lot of respect for and the players have a lot of respect for,''
said Johnson, who joined the Seahawks in February after being the
defensive coordinator in Indianapolis the past two seasons. ``It's
working out really well.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss isn't just window dressing either. He is coaching. In the
meetings and on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell him, `Hey, if you see something, go coach him up,'''
Johnson said. ``If he was a guy off the street it would be
different. But I've got a lot of respect for Winston.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown is glad Moss is still around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winston has taken some of the burden off the older guys by
coaching the younger guys. He's in their ear so we don't have to
be,'' Brown said. ``I guess he's kind of their guardian angel. It's
kind of cool for me because now I don't have to worry about telling
this guy to do that and make sure he's in the huddle and all those
little things.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss' prot &UR; gfacute &LR; eg &UR; gfacute &LR; es are first-round draft choice
Anthony Simmons and fourth-round pick DeShone Myles. The talented
rookies are ``Winston's draft choices,'' as Brown puts it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winston is playing the game with them in practice,'' Brown
said. ``He's shuffling along the line with them. He throws his hat
down when one of them makes a mistake. I think it shows he probably
misses the game.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no probably about it. Moss had played 11 seasons _ the
past three with the Seahawks after spending four each with the Los
Angeles Raiders (1991-94) and Tampa Bay Buccaneers (1987-90).
Productive seasons. Fulfilling seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But the neck injury did not allow him to walk away from the game
on his own terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the real disappointing thing. I didn't get a chance to
know when my last ball game was,'' he said. ``Every once in a while
I think about being able to have that luxury of knowing the last
time I'm going to play in Denver or the last time I'm going to play
in Oakland. That's special. Not to have that is obviously
disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Walking away from the game is what his wife, Zoila, anticipated
Moss doing _ and at times is probably wishing he had done since she
is expecting their third child in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'd rather have me home,'' Moss said. ``But she understood
that this is something I love to do and enjoy immensely.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss' wife also understands this is another chance for her
husband to achieve the one thing that was missing from his playing
career: The Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we get to the Super Bowl and win that,'' Moss said, ``it
will be able to erase those disappointments. Winning solves all
those little headache and heartaches and all aches.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ British Petroleum PLC announced Tuesday that it would
acquire the American oil giant Amoco for $48.2 billion in stock in
the largest oil-industry merger ever.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would also be the largest takeover of an American
company by a foreign concern.
</P>
<P>
   If approved by regulators and shareholders from both companies,
BP Amoco, as the company is to be known, would be the world's
third-largest multinational oil company in terms of its net income,
after Exxon Corp. and Royal Dutch/Shell Group of Cos.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers in the United States are unlikely to feel any
immediate effects from the deal. Prices at gas pumps are mostly
dependent on world oil supplies, which are currently plentiful. And
while the consolidation of gasoline outlets may slightly decrease
retail competition, the exploration prowess of the combined
companies could eventually result in larger supplies of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
   Oil executives at other companies said the deal benefited both
BP and Amoco. The main strength of British Petroleum, they said, is
the business of looking for and finding oil reserves. But the
company is weak in the business of refining the oil into products
and chemicals and distributing it to consumers, at which Amoco
excels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strength of Amoco is in areas that are lacking at BP such
as the natural gas reserves, which it possesses, and
petrochemicals,'' Andrew Avramides, an oil consultant in London,
said. ``The merger brings these assets into a larger, far more
comprehensive structure, making BP Amoco a true giant with enhanced
structures.''
</P>
<P>
   The merger will allow the companies to consolidate their
spending on exploration, which would exceed that of Exxon and Royal
Dutch/Shell. In addition, officials of both companies said the deal
would allow them to become more competitive in regions like the
former Soviet Union, China and Latin America, where competition has
increased as companies seek new sources of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and dealmakers alike said the announcement could set
off a wave of consolidation in oil companies not unlike that seen
in the financial services and telecommunications industries. Until
now, the major players in the oil industry have relied on joint
ventures, rather than comprehensive acquisitions, to increase
profitability.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that might consider moves now are Mobil Corp., Chevron
Corp. and Texaco Inc., all of which saw their stocks rise despite a
downdraft in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the talks said BP chief executive Sir John
Browne approached Amoco chairman Larry Fuller in late spring about
a possible merger. Sir John believed that consolidation was
inevitable and, said an executive close to the deal, ``Both of
these guys said if we don't pick a partner, we are going to be
last.''
</P>
<P>
   It is expected that the merger will take months to be approved
by regulators, although there are no obvious impediments to the
deal's structure.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department spokesperson said: ``A merger of this
magnitude has to come under review. We will be looking at it.''
</P>
<P>
   The two companies employ a total of 99,450 workers around the
world. Amoco, with 43,450 total employees, expects to cut 5,000 to
6,000 jobs, but none in its Chicago headquarters, Dan Dietsch, the
company's media relations adviser, said. A spokesman for BP said
the company planned to cut about 1,000 jobs in Cleveland when
refining and marketing operations there are moved to Chicago. Other
cuts are expected at Amoco's research offices in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Amoco and BP said Chicago would remain the headquarters for the
new company's North American business of refining, marketing and
transportation, ``and, in due course, the worldwide chemicals
business.'' Amoco is the fourth-largest company in the Chicago
area.
</P>
<P>
   The merger announcement coincides with another significant drop
in oil prices on world markets, which are flooded with supplies.
Producers have been hurt by the economic slowdown in Asian
economies, a mild winter and overproduction by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
   As the deal was announced in London Tuesday afternoon, the
average oil price around the world hit a 10-year low. Average oil
prices around the world stood at about $10 a barrel, which in
today's dollar is lower than the price of oil 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Senior oil executives and analysts alike stressed that the move
by British Petroleum must be looked at as a strategic decision
transcending the fluctuations in the prices of what remains one of
the world's most essential commodities and a vital element of
economic growth worldwide. Avramides said that today's low oil
prices are ``not a permanent condition.''
</P>
<P>
   David Mayhew of Cazenove &AMP; Co., a London brokerage firm, said
that no company can ignore current oil prices, but added that
``this move provides considerable economic and financial benefits
on the long run; it makes a great deal of sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir John, who will head the new company as its chief executive,
said the merger was forced by the need for economies of scale and
by increasing competition in a global economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``International competition in the industry is already fierce
and will grow more acute as new players emerge,'' Sir John said
Tuesday in a press conference. ``In such a climate the best
investment opportunities will go increasingly to companies that
have the size and financial strength to take on those large-scale
projects that offer a truly distinctive return.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview later, he added: ``People always ask me if such
mergers are good for consumers. Competition always is good for
consumers. It is also exciting and challenging. This deal moves us
into the super-league and provides the prospect of real competition
for those already in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir John said that the merger would bring some $2 billion in
savings as the two companies eliminate redundancies and consolidate
their divisions.
</P>
<P>
   The merger ranks as the world's largest industrial company
corporate combination, surpassing the $36 billion acquisition of
Chrysler Corp. by Germany's Daimler Benz AG announced in May, and
it is the sixth-largest merger of any type. It brings together one
of Britain's top industrial companies, founded in 1909, and a major
U.S. company that came out of the Standard Oil of New Jersey
monopoly when it was split up in the early part of this century.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   A senior Kuwaiti oil executive whose country holds about 7
percent of BP shares hailed the deal as a major breakthrough.
``Over the past decade they have gone through a major
rationalization process cutting costs, staffing, increasing their
reserves of oil worldwide and their efficiency,'' the Kuwait
official, who insisted on anonymity, said in an interview in
London.
</P>
<P>
   BP will exchange American depository receipts equivalent to 3.97
of its shares for each Amoco share. BP closed Monday at 7.73
pounds, making the value of the deal worth $48.2 billion based on
964,406 million Amoco shares outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   By the close of trading Tuesday, BP shares had increased 22
pence in London, to 7.95 pounds, raising the value of the takeover
to $49.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   British Petroleum will also assume $4.86 billion in long-term
Amoco debt.
</P>
<P>
   The board of the new company, which will be based in London,
will contain 13 BP directors and nine from Amoco. Amoco must pay
$950 million if it breaks the agreement. BP will have to pay $1
billion if it backs out. Although both companies strove Tuesday to
represent the deal as a merger, analysts tended to look at it as an
acquisition by BP which will control 60 percent of the new company.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company will have 9.2 billion barrels of crude oil
in reserves. Amoco has been struggling recently to refocus its
growth overseas in an effort to move away from the saturated
American market. The company sold about one-third of its domestic
oil and natural gas properties last year. With Amoco, BP also
acquires 9,300 retail gasoline outlets. The new company will also
become the largest natural gas producer in North America. If
completed, the merger would make BP the largest company in Britain,
supplanting the pharmaceutical manufacturer Glaxo Wellcome.
</P>
<P>
   For the first six months of the year, Amoco's net income fell to
$673 million from $1.3 billion a year ago. Revenues fell to $15.4
billion from $17.6 billion. U.S. oil company stocks have been
battered this year because of overproduction by world oil producers
and falling demand from Southeast Asian countries. Amoco's stock,
which was split earlier this year, is down 12 percent over a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   British Petroleum was advised by J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. and the law
firm of Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell. Amoco Corp. was advised by Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter and lawyers Wachtell Lipton Rosen &AMP; Katz.

SHED NO TEARS FOR KINGDOME'S PENDING DOOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ So, the finger is on the trigger. The trigger finger
is itchy.
</P>
<P>
   That's the news from the Kingdome, where the Mariners have
actually set a date for their last game at the ol' concrete cavern.
</P>
<P>
   On June 27, 1999, the M's will bid farewell to the Kingdome _
the nine acres of architectural blunder that has nobly served the
Seattle sporting public for the past 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   Next July 15, the M's will celebrate Opening Day II in their new
stadium, making obsolete the summer home of major league baseball
in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Which reminds me. Isn't this weather fantastic?
</P>
<P>
   Aren't these just the sort of humidity-free, the
bluest-skies-you've-ever-seen-are-in-Seattle days that make you
salivate for the return of outdoor baseball, Randy Johnson or no
Randy Johnson?
</P>
<P>
   The countdown has begun.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime after the 1999 NFL season ends, after the Seahawks play
their Kingdome finale, the sticks of dynamite will be carefully
arranged, the plunger so indelicately pushed and, KABOOM!
</P>
<P>
   You can almost hear Mariner announcer Rick Rizzs making the
call: And it's goodbye, Kingdome!
</P>
<P>
   There is only one thing to worry about _ those seismic studies
commissioned by former Seahawks owner Ken Behring. We're talking
major red herring, because if the tectonic plates under Pioneer
Square are as San Andreas-shaky as Mr. Behring's experts
proclaimed, then our little Kingdome implosion event might set off
one pesky quake.
</P>
<P>
   But what the heck, right? Seattleites pride themselves on
fearing no temblor, so the new millenium will be inaugurated with
the explosion to end all explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Not since Mount St. Helens went up in a violent blur of volcanic
ash will the Puget Sound experience such a landscape-altering
blast.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes you wonder:
</P>
<P>
   As the Kingdome implosion draws near, isn't it about time we
started identifying other annoying, obsolete or nefarious items
that should be in the Kingdome the day the dynamite blows it to
smithereens?
</P>
<P>
   I, for one, have gone to the trouble of starting just such a
list, entitled:
</P>
<P>
   Things to put in Kingdome on Demolition Day.
</P>
<P>
   1) Planet Hollywood, because if we wanted Southern California,
we would have moved to L.A.
</P>
<P>
   2) The KeyArena sign, because that retina-jarring red neon makes
lower Queen Anne look like Aurora Avenue on a bad day.
</P>
<P>
   3) NikeTown, just because.
</P>
<P>
   4) The city of Seattle Animal Control Department, which takes
oppression to a new level. Ever heard of the phrase ``police
state?''
</P>
<P>
   5) The Astro-turf at Memorial Stadium, for making Sounders
soccer more like human pinball.
</P>
<P>
   6) The Miss Bud.
</P>
<P>
   7) The Duck. Have you seen this oversized amphibious tourist
trap now hogging up the roadways through Pioneer Square, Fremont
and other points of Emerald City interest?
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't experienced the Duck yet, you're lucky. If you
have, you know what I mean. The obnoxious disco music. The drivers
who must be trained at the Richard Simmons school of aerobic
roadsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   The Duck is like the ``It's a Small World'' ride at Disneyland
on hallucinogenics.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, regardless of what gets blown up with the
Kingdome, the Kingdome must go. It's all in the name of progress.
</P>
<P>
   For proof that modernizing our local sports stadia is the right
thing to do, all one has to do is look up at the new baseball
stadium, whose entire frame now stands just south of the Dome.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that many concerned citizens are outraged at the $500
million pricetag for this new baseball-only ballpark, especially
since Mariner ownership has made it look as if Mr. Magoo could do a
better job with baseball decisions and Mariner public relations.
</P>
<P>
   (Randy. Randy. Randy.)
</P>
<P>
   But, frankly, as a visitor to our fair city recently commented
as we walked south along Myrtle Edwards Park, gazing up at the
downtown Seattle skyline, the new baseball park is humanly scaled.
It looks good. It fits in rather than overwhelms the majestic
Seattle skyline.
</P>
<P>
   The closer to completion Safeco Field becomes, the bigger and
more obtrusive the Kingdome looks by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   And so to be irrevocably rooted to the Kingdome is like being
rooted in cement. Which is why I hope no one is experiencing any
pangs of remorse.
</P>
<P>
   This is no time for bouts of sentimentality. Our collective
urban will must remain strong, even as the timetable is established
and farewell parties are being planned.
</P>
<P>
   The Kingdome's final days are at hand. Change is on the horizon,
literally, which is a good sign for a city as worldly, as
progressive, as cultured and as caffeinated as Seattle.

   NEW YORK _ Tex, Jack and Sheppard's Go Boy were safely back in
their Pelham Bay Park horse stables Tuesday, their would-be rustler
cooling his boots in a Bronx jail.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Dennis Grimes, 39, a part-time stable hand from New
Jersey, was taken into custody Tuesday after he walked into the
45th Precinct station house for questioning. He was charged with
sneaking into the Pelham Bit Stables last Tuesday, hot-wiring a
truck, then driving the horses to New Jersey to be auctioned. The
charges include burglary, grand larceny and criminal possession of
stolen property.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Grimes had expected to get $1,500 to $2,500 apiece
for the horses, which had been left on consignment at Camelot
Auction Co. in Cranbury, N.J., about 50 miles from New York. But
the scheme began to unravel after the stable's owner, in an effort
to track down the horses, called the auction house on Friday and
said the horses were missing.
</P>
<P>
   As Grimes was led from the precinct house for booking Tuesday,
he denied being a horse thief. ``No, I'm a horse trader,'' he
yelled. Police said Grimes had told them that he bought the horses
in a Newark junk yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I don't know what goes on around Newark,'' Jim Martyn,
owner of Pelham Bit Stables, said, ``I would think that a sale like
that would be pretty rare.''
</P>
<P>
   Martyn was less equivocal about what should happen to the man,
or his possible accomplices, if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should be hanged,'' he said dryly, before wondering aloud
whether someone could easily dig up an old statute on the subject.
``When you steal a horse,'' he said, ``it's more than a monetary
thing. It's taking a part of the family. It's like a dog that the
kids fall in love with. What's the attachment value of the family
dog?''
</P>
<P>
   Martyn's 1998 Dodge Ram pickup truck and his eight-horse trailer
were found in a field in Elizabeth, N.J., shortly after Grimes'
arrest, Sgt. William Larkin said. He said more arrests were
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The horse community is tight-knit and well-networked,'' he
said. ``People know each other and their horses.'' He also said
Grimes had been employed as a part-time horse exerciser and stable
mucker at the auction company ever since he was a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   Tex, Jack and Sheppard's Go Boy spent Tuesday recuperating in
their stalls after a long trip that left them with a few nicks and
scratches, and in need of a cool trough of water, Martyn said.
</P>
<P>
   Jack, a 7-year-old quarter horse, prepared for a trot, though he
remained ``a bit shy'' after his abduction, his owner, John
Sikoryak, said. ``He got a nice bath and we put his feet back
together,'' he said, ``and he's all right now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were frantic because we didn't know if someone was
sacrificing him to some voodoo god or abusing him,'' Sikoryak
added, noting that they also worried that Jack could have turned up
as dog food.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just happy he's back.''

COUPLES: STRAIGHT, NO CHASER

<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Already it seems like the PGA Championship has
been here for a millennium or three. Yet the tournament doesn't
start until Thursday. The visiting golfers continue to be amazed
and annoyed that the amount of newsprint consumed to cover this
thing still has not threatened a single tree on the blasted Sahalee
course.
</P>
<P>
   So far the most entertaining thing to happen in Redmond _ other
than the delivery of another boxcar-load of beauty bark for a
course-side home _ was the pre-tournament interview given by Fred
Couples Tuesday at the media tent.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't as much an interview as a thrill ride: Freddy's
Loop-de-Loop. The more he talks, the more he goes in circles.
Veteran golf writers are long used to Couples' meandering,
contradictory thoughts, but he's such an endearing and popular
figure that it remains a treat to take the Loop-de-Loop.
</P>
<P>
   Part Yogi Berra, part Randy Johnson, part Prof. Irwin Corey,
Couples' ride is harmless, except for the occasions when he bumps
into himself coming around his own quotes.
</P>
<P>
   A few examples from Tuesday, all given straight, no chaser:
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the distractions in playing before the hometown
crowd eager for him to win:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much distractions. It's just the people screaming
and yelling at you.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his sometimes-troublesome back, he said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great.''
</P>
<P>
   Then:
</P>
<P>
   ``I take a few pills and roll around on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   A moment later, describing further the therapy regimen:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Then:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a two-hour workout.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he will play this tournament differently, he said:
</P>
<P>
   ``This course is in my hometown, so it's a little different.''
</P>
<P>
   Then:
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I can't go out there and play differently than I normally
would.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his chances to win, he said, ``I wish I was ready to play
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Then:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'll do very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Whew. As you can tell, Freddy's ride is worth an old Disneyland
E-ticket, although the whiplash can leave a sore neck.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean, however, that Couples isn't capable of a
little reflection on his own thoughts. Explaining what he thinks it
will take to win the championship, he said, ``Your patient guys
that are playing very well are going to do well.''
</P>
<P>
   Then:
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's about as dumb as something you can say.''
</P>
<P>
   But who hasn't spoken the obvious here this week? I mean, the
tourney hasn't started and if I hear one more golfer say, ``You
have to stay out of the trees,'' I will plunge multiple fingers
down my throat.
</P>
<P>
   Couples is nowhere close to dumb. But he is so eager to please
this week, so earnest in his unofficial appointment as Northwest
golf ambassador, he is saying the same things so many times to so
many people that his desire to do everything right overtakes his
oral throttle.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Couples appears to be approaching a bit of a life
crossroads that seems to be creating some fresh questions about his
eventual routing.
</P>
<P>
   His engagement in June to Thais Bren of Los Angeles, the mother
of two youngsters Couples adores, has created a serenity that his
friends and associates rarely have seen in him. Perhaps for the
first time, and especially since the death of his parents over the
past four years, Couples is looking forward to something besides
golf.
</P>
<P>
   On the straight parts of the Loop-de-Loop, Couples mentioned
several times that despite his overall success this year _ two tour
victories and a No. 3 ranking in prize money at $1.5 million _ his
enthusiasm for the full-time grind has dwindled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really have the motivation to go out there and
practice for a full year,'' he said, explaining how his fast start
has faded into a combined 37-over-par in the U.S. and British
opens. ``I kind of relaxed (recently). I'm to the point where I
don't have the energy to do this all year round. To have your last
three tournaments in a two-month period be the three majors is not
really the brightest thing. You don't want to lay back, but on the
other hand you get tired of it. And I just got tired of worrying
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some who know Couples think that while, at 38, he has many years
remaining of quality golf, he's also had one marriage and one
serious relationship go bad. Combine that with a quarrelsome back
and 17 years of the same relentless schtick, and it is not
surprising that Couples might be on the threshold of something
different.
</P>
<P>
   Said one friend who followed Couples Tuesday during his practice
round: ``His first two relationships were like midnight in an
Alaskan winter compared to Thais, who is like the weather today.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of the round, Couples' foursome was followed on the
fairways by Thais' 5-year-old, Oliver, who seemed to completely
occupy the grateful attentions of a state trooper and county deputy
sheriff assigned to the party. Couples periodically stopped to play
with him, as well as chat up the affectionate gallery and sign as
many autographs along the way as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Bliss fairly raged from the scene. It was obvious that Couples
can entertain in more ways than the Loop-de-Loop.
</P>
<P>
   Older women want to mother him.
</P>
<P>
   Younger women want to marry him.
</P>
<P>
   Men feel unthreatened by him.
</P>
<P>
   Kids identify with him.
</P>
<P>
   Last month at the British Open, a Scottish couple began talking
with two Americans at a hotel in Southport. They spent part of
their summer vacations in each of the past 22 years attending the
Open. Without knowing the hometown of their fellow travelers, they
offered up unprompted that their favorite golfer was Couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just think he's wonderful,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some things reach beyond explanation. Especially if Couples has
to do the explaining.

CIVIC LEADERS URGE BETTER SITE FOR MILLION YOUTH MARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A group of Harlem community leaders, concerned about
the possibility of violent clashes with police, urged city
officials and organizers of the planned Million Youth March Tuesday
to keep open the prospect of having the event in Harlem but at a
site other than Malcolm X Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. David Paterson, D-Harlem, and other community leaders
said they were convinced that organizers of the march were going to
go forward on Sept. 5 even though the city has denied them a
permit, and were seeking a pragmatic solution.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders reiterated their opposition to or reservations about
the march's primary organizer, Khalid Abdul Muhammad, but said that
the best course now was to try to minimize the potential for
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sense that this is an event that's going to
happen,'' said Michael Demarzo, a spokesman for the Manhattan
borough president, C. Virginia Fields, who has called Muhammad a
bigot and who issued a statement Tuesday urging the city and
organizers to hold the event in a park, not the streets of Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Supporting or condemning Khalid Muhammad is ceasing to be the
issue,'' he said, adding that the focus now should be on ``managing
the event in a way that protects the community and is respectful of
people in the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad was dismissed by the Nation of Islam as its spokesman
in 1994 after a 1993 speech in which he referred to Jews as
''bloodsuckers'' and made other inflammatory remarks against Roman
Catholics, whites and homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   He and other organizers have billed the Million Youth March,
which is to include pop music stars, as an opportunity for young
blacks across the country to assert unity and to help strive for
the economic, social and political advancement of black Americans.
</P>
<P>
   It is to be modeled after the Million Man March three years ago
in Washington, which was organized by Louis Farrakhan, the Nation
of Islam leader.
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani administration and march organizers have been
deadlocked over when and where the march should take place. The
city has denied Muhammad a permit to hold the rally Sept. 5, a
Saturday, on Malcolm X Boulevard, which city officials say cannot
safely accommodate the 1 million participants the organizers say
they expect.
</P>
<P>
   The city has offered Randalls Island and Van Cortlandt Park in
the Bronx as alternative locations and Sept. 19 as a more suitable
date, to avoid conflicts with parades and other community events
already scheduled for the Labor Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Paterson said that the organizers of the march had a
constitutional right to deliver their message and that the city
should work with them to come up with a mutually agreeable site. He
suggested that officials look into holding the event at Riverbank
State Park or on Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard, places he said
could better accommodate large crowds.
</P>
<P>
   City Councilman Bill Perkins, who represents Harlem, said in an
interview Tuesday that he would organize a ``peace patrol'' of
local clergy members and off-duty police officers to head off
confrontations between marchers and the police should the event
take place on Sept. 5. Perkins said that he had had several
discussions with city staff and organizers, as recently as Monday
evening, but that neither side seemed willing to change its
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is going to be, inevitably, a clash,'' said Perkins, who
opposes the march because of Muhammad's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said Tuesday that he was confident the city's law
department, the office of the corporation counsel, working in
concert with the Police Department, would find an alternative site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the fact is that the corporation counsel will look for
a reasonable alternative for them,'' Giuliani told reporters. He
declined to comment further but has been outspoken in recent days
in his criticism of Muhammad. Lorna Goodman, a spokeswoman for the
law department, declined to comment on the status of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Muhammad nor march representatives returned telephone
calls seeking comment, but the recorded message at the group's
Washington headquarters Tuesday said the march ``will be held
Saturday, Sept. 5, in Harlem, New York City, on Malcolm X
Boulevard.'' The voice emphasized ``will.'' The group's Web site
also gave that date and location for the march.

COURT REJECTS N.Y. PLAN TO REQUIRE SALE OF ELECTRIC CARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In a setback for the nation's fledgling market in
electric cars, a federal appeals court Tuesday rejected New York
state's plan to require that automakers immediately begin selling
thousands of electrically powered vehicles in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, by a two-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals, reverses a lower court decision upholding the state
rule requiring that 2 percent of all vehicles sold beginning last
October be powered by electricity. Under the rule, the quota would
have gradually increased each year until it reached 10 percent in
2003.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling still allows New York to require that 10 percent of
all vehicles sold in 2003 be powered electrically. But because New
York was the only state seeking to require the immediate sale of
electric cars, many experts looked to it to help create a market
that could lead to the cars' mass production at lower costs.
</P>
<P>
   Both California and Massachusetts, under intense pressure from
the automobile industry, scaled back similar plans two years ago.
Those states will not require the sale of electric cars until 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision is disappointing but not devastating,'' said
Jason Grumet, executive director of Northeast States for
Coordinated Air Use Management, which represents air-pollution
control programs in eight Northeast states. ``But the ruling
removes the transitional sales targets that were intended to guide
the introduction of these vehicles into the market.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision disappointed Gov. George Pataki and other state
officials who have long maintained that their plan would help the
state meet tough pollution standards set by the federal Clean Air
Act of 1990. But Michael McKeon, a spokesman for the governor, said
administration officials had not decided whether they would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling pleased automobile industry officials, who said it
bought them time to develop electric cars that would be popular.
The industry has argued that the state's mandates were onerous
because consumers have shown little interest in buying electric
cars now on the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``This certainly provides us needed but not necessarily
sufficient time for the development of vehicles that would meet the
demands of car customers,'' said Mark Slywynsky, a lawyer for the
American Automobile Manufacturers Association, which represents
Chrysler, Ford and General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   The state's regulation was enacted in 1991 under Gov. Mario
Cuomo, who wanted to use amendments to the Clean Air Act permitting
states to impose rules on automobile emissions that were as tough
as California's. That state required manufacturers to sell
increasingly clean-burning cars, culminating with a mandate for
zero-emission, or electric, cars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers challenged that rule in court on three occasions and
lost each time. Then, late last year, after California had
abandoned its plan to mandate the sale of electric cars between
1998 and 2002, they appealed the latest ruling against them. The
companies argued that the Clean Air Act required New York's
standards to be identical to California's.
</P>
<P>
   The federal appeals court, in an opinion written by Chief Judge
Ralph Winter, sided with them Tuesday. Judge Joseph McLaughlin
concurred with the opinion; a third judge had recused himself.
</P>
<P>
   New York officials estimated that the mandate would have
required the sale of 8,000 electric cars in 1998. With Tuesday's
ruling, the sole requirement on carmakers is that they sell at
least 40,000 electric cars in 2003, according to state officials.

SERENA TURNS `VICIOUS'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE STEVENS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. _ An hour before her match Tuesday,
Serena Williams warmed up at center court and put on a show that
brought more style and youth to Manhattan Country Club than the
place is accustomed to.
</P>
<P>
   Selections from Janet Jackson's ``The Velvet Rope'' pumped
through the stadium as Katrina Adams, playing doubles in the
tournament, hit balls to her. Venus Williams, sidelined with
tendinitis in her left knee, shagged balls while wearing jeans and
skateboarding sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   The hip display is typical for Serena Williams. But if you'd ask
her, she'd want you to call her Serena _ Miss Williams, if you're
nasty.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' play was quite nasty to Latvia's Larisa Neiland in the
first round of the Acura Classic at Manhattan Country Club. She
beat Neiland 6-0, 6-0. The warm-ups would have been more
entertaining for fans looking for a close match.
</P>
<P>
   How nasty was Williams? She won the match in 38 minutes. She
dominated Neiland to the point where she once aced her on her
second serve. The first set lasted just 18 minutes. Williams
slammed a ball that landed in the fifth row of the stands on one
bounce and finished the match fittingly, with an ace.
</P>
<P>
   Nasty, however, is not the specific word Williams likes to use.
``I'd say I was very tenacious and aggressive today,'' she said.
``I was vicious.''
</P>
<P>
   And this was Williams' first match since Wimbledon in June. She
took time off to go to summer school and make sure she could
graduate from high school. Originally from Compton, Williams
returned to Los Angeles because she remembers the tournament when
she was growing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty excited,'' she said. ``I wanted to play L.A. so
bad that I wanted to get out there yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   The match between Williams, 16, and Neiland, 32, pitted the
youngest player at Manhattan Beach against the oldest. Youth won
with ease to make Williams one of 17 players left in the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Every first-round match has been completed, except for Mary
Pierce against Yayuk Basuki. Pierce advanced to the final of last
week's Toshiba Classic at La Costa. At Manhattan Beach, the top
four seeds _ Martina Hingis, Lindsay Davenport, Arantxa Sanchez
Vicario and Monica Seles _ have yet to play, receiving first-round
byes.
</P>
<P>
   Williams will face seventh-seeded Sandrine Testud in the second
round. If she pulls an upset, she will face Hingis, if the
top-ranked player also wins her second-round match. But Williams is
focusing on Testud.
</P>
<P>
   Williams started on the women's tour in October. She finished
the year ranked 99th and now is ranked 21st. To an extent, she has
been living in the shadow of her 18-year-old sister, Venus, who is
ranked fourth. But many tennis experts say Serena has more
potential than Venus. Serena is said to be stronger and have a more
aggressive game. Some say she simply hits the ball more crisply.
</P>
<P>
   But such a quick victory over Neiland is unique for Williams
because she did not play junior tennis like her sister, who was
accustomed to fast wins on that circuit. The younger Williams
jumped right to the Corel WTA tour.
</P>
<P>
   However, Serena has made jumps in the tour's rankings more
quickly than her sister. But even with the constant comparisons,
the sisters' rivalry is friendly. They remain close and are doubles
partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're both at the point where we'd each say we're
better,'' Serena Williams said. ``I personally believe that I am
the best player, but everyone has an opinion on that.''

DREIFORT SLUMPING WITH OFF-TARGET SLIDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What's wrong with Darren Dreifort?
</P>
<P>
   He has only one victory since June 30. And since allowing one
hit in eight innings to beat Cincinnati 2-0 on July 20, Dreifort
has three losses, a no decision and a 6.00 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort, who allowed 11 hits and five runs in five innings
during Tuesday's 8-6 loss to lowly Florida, was not around after
the game. But others were.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Glenn Hoffman is aware this is just Dreifort's first
season as a starter. But Hoffman also needs Dreifort to step up now
that Ramon Martinez, Hideo Nomo and Ismael Valdes are no longer
part of the Dodgers' rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still seems to be throwing the ball well, he just isn't
making good pitches when he needs to,'' Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me the difference is his slider,'' pitching coach Charlie
Hough said. ``His command is good, but he just isn't throwing the
slider for strikes. It is something we can work on.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort has been durable, with a string of 16 starts with six
or more innings. He struck out eight and walked one Tuesday. His
144 strikeouts are seventh in the National League.

   __ What a ninth: Matt Mantei opened the inning for the Marlins
and actually retired the first batter, Gary Sheffield. Then he
walked Eric Karros and Bobby Bonilla and allowed a single to Adrian
Beltre to load the bases. He then walked Charles Johnson to score
Karros, but that only made it 8-2.
</P>
<P>
   Marlins manager Jim Leyland turned to Antonio Alfonseca, who
walked pinch-hitter Matt Luke and Eric Young to make it 8-4. Mark
Grudzielanek fell behind 0-2 but singled to center, scoring
Johnson. Raul Mondesi hit a grounder to short, but Edgar Renteria
had no chance for a double play. He rushed the ball and almost
didn't get Mondesi. Luke scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our pitchers just weren't prepared,'' said Leyland, who had
Robb Nen in his bullpen last year. ``When these guys aren't in save
situations, they don't prepare.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers had the tying run at second with Sheffield at the
plate. Leyland intentionally walked his former cleanup hitter to
put the winning run on base with Karros at the plate. Karros fell
behind 1-2 and lined to center to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't disrespect to Karros, it was the ultimate respect
for Sheffield,'' Leyland said. ``Karros has beaten me in a lot of
games. I didn't feel too good doing it, but fortunately it all
worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Quick hits: As expected, National League president Leonard
Coleman denied the New York Mets protest of their July 31 game with
the Dodgers. The Mets claimed Eric Young had not been activated
from the DL in time for the game.... Bobby Bonilla said there was
no added emotion facing the team he helped lead to a World Series
title last season. ``I was only there one year,'' he said. ``I feel
bad for (Leyland). He never got to enjoy the chance to repeat.''...
If you want to say it's not all Dreifort's fault, the Dodgers
haven't scored over 102/3 innings in his past two starts, although
102/3 innings in two starts might be a bigger problem....
Grudzielanek went 3 for 5 and is batting .412 in his past four
games.... Johnson had two passed balls, giving him five for the
year. He had one last season and has 15 in his five-year career.

GARCIAPARRA HOME RUN LIFTS RED SOX IN 10TH 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-ROYALS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when it appeared the Kansas City Royals _ and Mother Nature
_ had conspired to make the first contest of an eight-game
homestand a washout, the Red Sox weathered a 1-hour 25-minute rain
delay Tuesday night and rallied to score a 7-4 victory in the 10th
inning.
</P>
<P>
   After thunder and lightning rumbled overhead for much of the
first eight innings, Nomar Garciaparra treated the diehard Sox fans
among the Fenway Park crowd of 33,290 who refused to leave to a
real thunderclap in the 10th with a three-run homer off Jeff
Montgomery, the shortstop's second blast of the night.
</P>
<P>
   It was Montgomery's first blown save in his last 16
opportunities, the 14th time (11th at Fenway) that the Sox had won
in their last at-bat, and Boston's 35th come-from-behind win of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just shows you the heart and character that this club
has,'' said Garciaparra, who recorded the sixth two-homer game of
his career. ``Everybody is confident and looking (out) for each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra hit a solo shot in the sixth off Royals starter Tim
Belcher to tie the game, 2-2. But it was his 10th-inning homer _
his 24th of the season _ that made a winner of reliever Tom Gordon,
who allowed three hits and a run in 2 1/3 innings to improve to
6-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had two-plus innings and thank God everything worked out
well,'' said Gordon, who allowed the Royals to take the lead in the
ninth, 4-3, after relieving Derek Lowe in the eighth when the game
resumed at 10:58. ``I thought I had good command of my fastball and
I just focused on keeping the ball in the strike zone and giving my
team a chance to win if I went out there and didn't give up
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Sox starter Steve Avery, who was relieved by Jim Corsi after
issuing a leadoff walk to Jose Offerman in the seventh, had his
third no-decision in 15 starts. He allowed two runs on four hits.
</P>
<P>
   After giving up a run on Dean Palmer's single to left in the
third, Avery surrendered a second run when Offerman scored on Sal
Fasano's squeeze bunt in the sixth to give the Royals a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was throwing strikes for the most part, but it just seemed
like every once in a while, I'd have one hitter where I got out of
whack,'' said Avery. ``On the last run, I had the guy picked off
and thought I had him and made a bad throw. Then the wild pitch,
stolen base, and the squeeze; it's the worst kind of run you can
give up, but for the most part, I was happy with my performance
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra got Avery off the hook when he took Belcher into the
Sox bullpen in the bottom of the inning to tie it, 2-2. After twice
battling back to tie, the Red Sox finally surged ahead in the
seventh, 3-2, when Darren Bragg slid home on Orlando Merced's
pinch-hit sacrifice fly to right.
</P>
<P>
   But the Royals came back with two outs in the eighth to push
across the tying run when Jermaine Dye _ after barely beating out a
triple-play throw to first _ scored on Terry Pendleton's double to
center. Then the skies finally parted at 9:33 after threatening all
night.
</P>
<P>
   When the game resumed, Gordon entered the game with runners on
first and second but got Mike Sweeney to pop up to second baseman
Mike Benjamin.
</P>
<P>
   After John Valentin grounded to third to open the eighth, Mo
Vaughn singled sharply up the middle but wound up getting doubled
off on a baserunning blunder. Vaughn was already around second when
Johnny Damon tracked down Garciaparra's fly to center.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Morris, who was shifted from left to first after the
resumption of play, drove in the go-ahead run in the ninth on a
line-drive single to left. Damon, who reached on a base hit and
stole second, beat the relay from Troy O'Leary to Scott Hatteberg,
putting the Royals up.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox loaded the bases in the ninth against Montgomery on
singles by O'Leary, Mike Stanley, and Bragg. However, they managed
to push across only one run when Hatteberg hit into a 4-6-3 double
play. Benjamin came to the plate with two outs and pinch runner
Damon Buford at third but struck out to send the game into extra
innings.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Garciaparra's thunderous hit saved it from being a
wash-out.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people contributed to tonight's game,'' said manager
Jimy Williams. ``The kids just keep fighting and they keep leaving
it out on the field.''

DANCERS REDEFINE JAZZ AT CONGRESS HELD IN PHOENIX
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH LaFAVE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Along Adams Street, they redefined jazz dance.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix Symphony Hall and at the Orpheum Theatre, dancers
from Canada, Japan, England and the United States leapt with blind
abandon into each other's arms, drilled a funky beat into the
floor, flipped across stage with hyperthyroid glee.
</P>
<P>
   At the Jazz Dance World Congress 1998 in downtown Phoenix, jazz
dance was the heavy boots of Anglo-African dancer De Napoli Clarke
slamming to hip-hop; the fleet gymnastic evocation of ancient Ninja
warriors by the Masashi Action Machine of Nagoya, Japan; the
sophistication of Les Ballets Jazz de Montreal's
classical-crossover take on relationships.
</P>
<P>
   And it was MTV, embodied by megastar Paula Abdul, who was to be
given an award by the congress at Tuesday's concluding gala at
Symphony Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the World Jazz Dance Congress 1998 was light-years from
Fred Astaire. But once in a while, you could glimpse the past in
the present of this dynamic art form.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jazz is an accessible art form. We keep contact with the
audience,'' said choreographer, teacher and congress founder Gus
Giordano, addressing a class of more than 50 mostly female, mostly
teenage students in the Phoenix Civic Center Ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   Those students and hundreds of others joined with professionals
and teachers to make up a conference force of about 2,000 jazz
dance aficionados.
</P>
<P>
   Giordano, for decades one of the mainstays of jazz dance,
instilled the accessibility he praised by instructing in proper
technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``In jazz,'' he said to his students, ``the upper body is regal,
and the lower body is hootchy-kootchy.''
</P>
<P>
   If ``hootchy-kootchy'' was an archaic term to most of the teens,
the meaning still got across: jazz lifts the rib cage and frees the
hips. It has ballet's upward mobility with an expressive earthiness
below.
</P>
<P>
   Yet much of the newer jazz dancing, seen in several performances
over the weekend, seemed to be eliminating or de-emphasizing the
regality while fortifying the earthiness, making jazz today a
motley of styles _ or a clash of sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Giordano's own company, Gus Giordano Jazz Dance Chicago,
presented three pieces that point both backward and forward to very
different ways of moving. In Michael Taylor's Just Because, set to
sleek singing by Luther Vandross and others, a gracious lyricism
pervaded, dominated by balletic control; in Randy Duncan's Can't
Take This Away, dancers, decked out in billowing costumes, made the
upper-lower body dichotomy into a spiritual quest, assisted by
gospel music.
</P>
<P>
   But in Chain of Rocks, a Giordano project in three sections,
choreographed by three different artists including Nan Giordano
(Gus' daughter and his company's artistic director), a hip-hop
sensibility came blasting through.
</P>
<P>
   Mia Michaels, a Miami-born choreographer whose move to New York
two years ago was followed by an astonishingly fast rise to
prominence, said jazz today has a responsibility to look ahead even
while glancing over its shoulder, to ``take (Bob) Fosse and add
yourself,'' as she put it in a panel discussion.
</P>
<P>
   This came through in the second of two Michaels works over the
weekend, No Strings Attached, a deft blending of finger-snapping
four-beat jazz that would've put Broadway denizen Fosse at ease,
with the contemporary, street-beat,
</P>
<P>
   two-count feeling of hip-hop. Against the Current, the first
Michaels piece danced by the small company of polished, strong
dancers she calls R.A.W., looked more to the influence of modern
choreography.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Japan, all American things are popular,'' said
choreographer Kumiko Sakamoto, explaining why the company she runs
with Masashi Mishiro, Masashi Action Machine, was part of a
conference of jazz dance.
</P>
<P>
   Lula Washington Dance Theatre of Los Angeles took the audience
to American backwoods and a celebration of rural innocence in Mahal
Dances, a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   From Tucson, members of Quinn Williams Jazz, based at the
University of Arizona, showed that young dancers understand this
vocabulary with an immediacy to be envied by ballet or modern.
</P>
<P>
   And from Palm Springs, solo dancer Sam Watson demonstrated the
laughs inherent in jazz dance _ especially when your costume is a
pair of boxer shorts. &QL;

WOMEN WIN DEMOCRATIC PRIMARIES IN COLORADO 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Colorado Democrats chose women Tuesday as their
candidates for two significant races this fall: Dottie Lamm, a
former newspaper columnist and wife of a former governor, for
senator and Lt. Gov. Gail Schoettler for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Republican voters largely rejected right-wing candidates,
endorsing Ben Nighthorse Campbell to run again for the Senate and
choosing state Treasurer Bill Owens to run for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado Gov. Roy Romer, is barred from running for a fourth
term because of term limits.
</P>
<P>
   With most precincts reporting, Campbell, 65, running in his
first Republican race since he switched from the Democratic Party
in 1995, had 70 percent of the vote, to 30 percent for Bill Eggert,
a Denver lawyer who is himself a former Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lamm, wife of former Gov. Dick Lamm, had 57 percent of the
vote against state Rep. Gil Romero, with 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the races for governor, Owens had 59 percent of the vote in
the Republican primary against state Senate president Tom Norton.
On the Democratic side, Ms. Schoettler had 55 percent, to 45
percent for Mike Feeley, the State Senate minority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's primaries brought several new faces to the fore. Mark
Udall, son of former congressman Morris Udall, will be the
Democrats' candidate to represent the district encompassing Boulder
in Congress. Republicans, seeking to break a 24-year Democratic
lock on the district, chose Bob Greenlee, a moderate who is
Boulder's first Republican mayor in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting a fund-raising dichotomy, the winners had raised
enough money to buy television advertisements. The losers, on
tighter budgets, bought radio advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   In the general election, Democrats face a disadvantage in
statewide races. Republicans are a growing presence in Colorado and
have a registration edge of 5 percent, or 120,000 votes, over the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   With Republicans controlling the State Legislature, Democrats
argue that the election of a Democratic governor is the only way to
stop Colorado from following its neighbors into ``one party''
status. In Kansas, Wyoming and Utah, Republicans control both the
legislatures and governorships. Colorado has had a Democratic
governor since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's election was also stamped by the impact of Colorado's
term limits laws. Twenty-five members of the Legislature sought to
extend their political careers by running for new offices.
</P>
<P>
   In a reflection of the significant migration into Colorado,
natives of New York and natives of California outnumbered natives
of Colorado in the pool of eight candidates for the two top offices
Tuesday _ senator and governor. The lone Colorado native was
Romero, of Pueblo. In the Senate race, Ms. Lamm and Eggert are
natives of the Bronx.

OUTPOURING OF FRUSTRATION OVER DEADLY NEEDLE STICKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM CARLSEN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Tim Ulatowski, a top official from the Federal Drug
Administration, had been speaking for about 15 minutes Tuesday when
a wave of frustration broke over him at a health-care worker safety
conference.
</P>
<P>
   How many hundreds of medical workers need to die from
contaminated needle sticks before the agency bans standard needles
and syringes that are causing the injuries, asked a nursing safety
expert.
</P>
<P>
   When is the FDA going to mandate the use of safety needles, a
doctor asked. Another safety specialist accused the FDA of
``weaseling out'' of its obligations to prevent injuries to workers
from medical devices.
</P>
<P>
   Although such outbursts were rare at the two-day conference on
the hazards of accidental needle injuries, they served to
illuminate the frustration expressed by many health care workers:
Despite more than 1 million needle sticks and four such conferences
in the past 10 years, the government and hospital administrators
have done little to improve safety.
</P>
<P>
   It is particularly urgent matter for many of the participants at
the conference. Needle sticks are responsible for infecting tens of
thousands of medical workers with HIV and hepatitis viruses over
the past decade, as described in a series of Chronicle articles
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  With no solid, comprehensive proposals offered to solve the
problem, Murray Cohen, a former official of the federal Centers for
Disease Control who organized the meeting, told participants at the
end of the conference that ``we must aim for zero injuries.'' But
he left the attendees with no clear outline of how that might be
accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Needle manufacturers who attended the conference had their own
solution, however. More than a dozen of them lined the hallways and
small meeting rooms outside the conference hall at the Marriott
hotel with exhibits _ an array of ingenious designs created to keep
contaminated needles from piercing the hands and fingers of medical
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Ulatowski, speaking at one of the conference's workshops, said
he took great pride in the speed with which his agency is now
approving new safety designs for the market, pointing out that more
than 250 such devices have been granted approval.
</P>
<P>
   But as &UR;  &LR; for mandating the use of safety needles and banning most
standard needles, he said the agency is not even considering that
step. ``We still don't have the ideal mousetrap,'' he said. ``We
cannot regulate the practice of medicine. It's not our job.
Mandatory standards don't work well.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the members of the audience jumped in. ``Is there
any threshold (for the number of medical workers' deaths) before
the FDA will act?'' asked Susan Wilburn, a representative of the
American Nurses Association. She gave several examples of medical
devices that the agency pulled from the market after only a few
reported incidents of injuries to patients.
</P>
<P>
   Outside in the hall, Tom Sutton was seething. As a marketing
executive for Bioplexus, a small manufacturer of safety
blood-drawing needles, he said that FDA was actually penalizing
safe needle makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a perverse form of logic that the makers of safety
needles are required by the FDA to report even the smallest failure
of their devices,'' he said, ``while no reports are required for
the standard needles made by the big manufacturers that are causing
all the needle sticks.''
</P>
<P>
   The other chief frustration repeated throughout the conference
was the absence of health care employers, insurers and hospital
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hospital administrators are missing,'' said Janine Jagger,
one of the nation's leading experts on needle injuries. ``If they
decided that they wanted better technology for their workers, we
could end this logjam and solve this problem tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said that a few hospital executives did show up but he
admitted that most sent their infection control officers. He added
that a consultant from the American Hospital Association did attend
and speak.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Borwegen, a representative for the nation's largest health
care workers' union, the Service Employees International Union,
scoffed at that, pointing out that the hospital association several
years ago disbanded its worker health and safety division.
</P>
<P>
   Borwegen then repeated a refrain heard frequently in the
conference _ that hospital administrators have shown little
interest in needle sticks because they are protected from being
sued by injured workers because of workers' compensation laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're shielded,'' Sutton said, ``so many don't want to be
bothered.''

METHODISTS TIGHTEN BAN ON GAY UNIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DON LATTIN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Northern California's divisive battle over gay rights in the
Methodist church is expected to intensify after a ruling Tuesday
that pastors in the nation's second-largest Protestant church may
be tried and defrocked for performing ``ceremonies that celebrate
homosexual unions.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the highest court of the United Methodist Church
was a major setback for liberal clergy and others asking for
greater legitimacy for gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
   In the ruling issued in Dallas, the Judicial Council of the
8.5-million-member denomination said pastors can be tried under a
1996 resolution prohibiting gay marriage that was adopted by
national church delegates and added to the Social Principles of the
church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conduct in violation of this prohibition renders a pastor
liable to a charge of disobedience to the order and discipline of
the United Methodist Church,'' the nine-member court ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's decision puts Northern California Methodist Bishop
Melvin Talbert between a theological rock and an ecclesiastical
hard place.
</P>
<P>
   Ten Methodist ministers _ including the popular and powerful
leader of Glide Memorial United Methodist Church in San Francisco,
the Rev. Cecil Williams _ are among 150 Christian, Jewish and
Buddhist clergy in Northern California who have signed a
declaration stating, ``I have officiated or would be willing to
officiate at the religious marriage of a same- &LR; ju  &LR; gender couple.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday's ruling, Talbert declined to discipline any
Methodist clergy who performed gay rites, arguing that ``performing
a holy union does not violate the law of the church, even though
such an act does go against the spirit of the Social Principles.''
</P>
<P>
   When he made that statement in May, Talbert said he could
continue to allow same-sex unions ``until instructed otherwise by
our Judicial Council.''
</P>
<P>
   Talbert, who was reached last night while on vacation in
Arizona, said he was ``deeply saddened'' by the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as a bishop of the church, I will abide by the discipline
and action of the Judicial Council,'' said Talbert, the immediate
past president of the National Council of Churches, the nation's
major ecumenical organization.
</P>
<P>
   The bishop said no disciplinary action will be taken against
pastors who have performed same-sex ceremonies in the past, but he
said, ``Now that the law has been clarified, we have to hold people
accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would not take action against pastors for signing
petitions stating their continued support for same-sex ceremonies.
Church law ``doesn't say anything about signing statements,'' he
said. ``It's about performing a same-sex union.''
</P>
<P>
   Talbert said he was hoping for a different outcome in Dallas.
``This is not the first time I have found myself in disagreement
with the church,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Talbert's support of gay rights has caused a revolt by a
coalition of conservative evangelical clergy in Northern
California, the Evangelical Renewal Fellowship. Some have left the
denomination, taking entire congregations with them, and are now
negotiating over the real estate left behind. Others are
withholding funds from the denomination or threatening other
action.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. John Christie, president of the Evangelical Renewal
Fellowship and pastor of Mission City United Methodist Church in
Santa Clara, said his coalition feels vindicated by the court
ruling and will wait to see whether Talbert actually enforces it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball is now in Bishop Talbert's court,'' said Christie.
``Bishop Talbert needs to get back in line and be held
accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Alan Jones, executive director of the United Methodist
Mission in San Francisco, called Tuesday's ruling ``sad news.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those clergy who support holy union will continue to do
them,'' Jones said. ``For me, it's a pastoral issue. Either I
respect the integrity of my sisters and brothers, or I don't. I
don't believe in `love the sinner, hate the sin.' I either love
someone, or I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's ruling by the Methodist version of the Supreme Court
was on an appeal by conservative bishops upset over the acquittal
earlier this year of a Nebraska pastor, the Rev. Jimmy Creech, who
had been charged with violating church law by performing a holy
union for two lesbians in Omaha.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas McAnally, spokesman at the United Methodist Church
headquarters in Nashville, said local bishops like Talbert ``don't
have the authority to overrule this decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Supreme Court,'' he said. ``The decision is
final.''
</P>
<P>
   McAnally said any member of the church could begin judicial
proceedings against a pastor or bishop for violating church law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would go to trial just like the Nebraska trial, which
probably would have gone differently if they had this ruling in
front of them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, the pastor at Glide church in San Francisco, said
Tuesday that he wants to read the ruling and talk to his lawyer
before commenting on the court action.
</P>
<P>
   Other Methodist ministers who signed the interfaith declaration
supporting same-sex marriage include the Revs. Karen Oliveto,
Stephen Lee, Ronald Swisher, John Chamberlin, Gary Barbaree, Kelvin
Sauls, Charlie Lerrigo, Paul Sweet and Phillip Lawson.
</P>
<P>
   The gay rights group that circulated the declaration, the All
Our Families Coalition, plans to hold a worship service in support
of same-sex marriage on September 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clergy are making public stands because of their conscience,''
said Cheryl Deaner, executive director of the coalition. ``That's a
higher authority than the church hierarchy.''

CLINTON VISIT A $3 MILLION BOOST FOR CALIFORNIA DEMOCRAT 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARLA MARINUCCI and JOHN WILDERMUTH  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    SAN FRANCISCO _ With crises at home and abroad swirling around
him, President Clinton focused on political campaigning in San
Francisco Tuesday, bringing a shower of dollars to California's
leading Democrat.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In less than 24 hours, the president raised $3 million at three
events in San Francisco and Los Angeles for Democratic
gubernatorial nominee Gray Davis, members of the lieutenant
governor's staff said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cut short his California trip in response to the U.S.
Embassy bombings in Africa, and he conferred by phone briefly with
economic advisers over the steep stock market drop Tuesday. But he
also accomplished Job One in California: raising big bucks to help
Democrats meet their 1998 election goals.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, he was cheered by a crowd of 1,000 at a
$1,000-a-head lunch. In Los Angeles, he raised a total of $2
million at two exclusive events, one at the estate of real estate
mogul Bruce Karatz and the other a $25,000-a-couple dinner in the
home of SKG Dreamworks President Jeffrey Katzenberg, which drew
stars such as Sharon Stone, Rob Reiner, Diane Keaton and Steve
Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important election. This is a huge deal,'' Clinton
told the noontime crowd at the St. Francis Hotel on San Francisco's
Union Square. ``I think you can make a compelling argument that it
is more important than ever before who is the governor of
California . . . Will it be an administration that makes the most
of every opportunity that we should provide in the next two years
and, hopefully, beyond?''
</P>
<P>
   Although the president is scheduled to testify next week to a
grand jury in Washington, D.C., about his alleged sexual
involvement with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, that
subject was not on the agenda Tuesday. Reporters were kept at a
distance during tightly scripted events, making it impossible to
pose questions to the president.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton only vaguely alluded to his political troubles. ``No
matter what you read,'' he told a Beverly Hills crowd last night,
``every day has been a joy to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, spokesman for the president, acknowledged that
Clinton would probably be meeting with his attorneys in the next
few days, but he declined to give details. Instead, he said last
night that the president was ``in a very positive frame of mind''
during his California swing _ and that Clinton spent his free time
during the trip reading mystery novels and playing cards with staff
members aboard Air Force One.
</P>
<P>
   The apparently relaxed mood about the troubles ahead was also
reflected among San Francisco Democrats like August Longo, who
showed up at the St. Francis to support the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to let any of this Lewinsky stuff sway us,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the hotel, only a few anti-Clinton demonstrators were
among the 500 or so onlookers who waited patiently in the warm
summer weather, hoping to catch a glimpse of the president.
</P>
<P>
   In his lunchtime speech, Clinton pounded home the theme of
Democratic accomplishments and stressed the importance of
November's election in California. And he urged California
Democrats not to get complacent, but to work hard to elect the
entire Democratic ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``California has always been about the future. This is not a
time to relax. . . . We've worked too hard to get this far,''
Clinton said. ``We have to take advantage of it, and the best way
to do it is to elect Gray Davis governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton's California trip was tinged with troubles at
home and abroad. At every stop, the president spoke strongly about
last week's deadly terrorist bombing of U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Americans must send a clear signal to the world that ``we are
not going to back away from our involvement with other people, and
we are not going to back away from our opposition to terrorism,''
Clinton told a crowd of local officials and environmentalists at a
water filtration plant in San Bruno Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Although the country's tough stand against terrorism may make
Americans more inviting targets for international violence, ``now
is the time to bear down, not back up, on that,'' the president
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made the stop at the Crystal Springs water treatment
plant to announce a measure that will require water utilities to
make regular reports to their customers on the quality of their
drinking water. Although California has required similar reports
for some time, ``it's a big step forward for much of the country,''
said Marguerite Young, California director for Clean Water Action.
</P>
<P>
   The president also used the occasion to address Republican
complaints that the growing number of environmental regulations is
hurting the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can never create the 21st century America we want for our
children until we do not think of economic growth as divorced from
the preservation of the environment and public health,'' Clinton
said. ``They must be seen as absolutely part of one, indivisible
effort to create the good life for the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   The president complained that Congress has refused to fund his
Clean Water Action Plan, which he said would help restore ``the 40
percent of our waters that are still too polluted for fishing and
swimming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Safe water for our children is something all Americans agree
on,'' Clinton said. ``This should not be a partisan issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's swing through California was originally planned to
last through Wednesday, but he rescheduled his return and planned
to fly back to Washington late Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to confer with his foreign policy team in Washington
Wednesday and then meet the plane carrying the remains of Americans
killed in the bombing when it arrives at Andrews Air Force Base
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   California Democrats were glad to see Clinton for even a day and
said the president's personal woes will have little effect on his
popularity in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's acceptance by the public here has never been
higher,'' said state Controller Kathleen Connell, who is up for
re-election. ``He's a tremendous asset. He represents the
opportunity for people to see a better future for their children.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Sosnick, one of Clinton's political advisers, emphasized
the importance of California's in the Democrats' national political
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This state is increasingly Democratic; it's a big state for
us,'' he said. ``There are political implications'' far beyond this
election season.
</P>
<P>
   Sosnick stressed Clinton's value to California Democrats, even
with when he is under the cloud of scandals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president has abundantly shown he can raise money
for Democrats,'' Sosnick said. ``They really want him to come out
and campaign for them.''

 WOOD, HERSHISER, SOSA _ 3 NAMES OF THE GAME  &HT;     By BRUCE JENKINS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   August in san Francisco, and those seats in the shade look
pretty inviting. The pennant race is here, steaming and oven-baked
and feeling much like the heartland. Try as the analysts might,
there are no hard baseball truths of any kind. Only Kerry Wood vs.
Orel Hershiser and two teams that won't be dropping out of
contention any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Thank heaven for the good fans of Candlestick Point, who know
these things and don't get overwhelmed by the Big Picture search.
They were loud Tuesday in moments of utter inactivity. They had a
constant buzz going, like jazz enthusiasts before the next act in
Monterey, positively thriving on the act of anticipatory
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   When you get a contrast as delightful as Hershiser vs. Wood,
with a dash of Sammy Sosa, there's an awful lot to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   Wood's face is pure country. It looks like something you'd find
in a stack of 1959 baseball cards. This guy doesn't look like a
beach volleyball player, a Calvin Klein model, David Spade or Andy
Ashby. He looks like baseball. His card would fit nicely between
Bob Purkey and Johnny Callison.
</P>
<P>
   He walks to and from the mound like a highway patrolman on a
114-degree afternoon. He's got you pulled over, and he'll take his
sweet time wrecking your day. There's a raw, naive side to Wood,
but you imagine him laughing at Craig Lefferts, who used to sprint
out of the bullpen like a man fleeing the cops. You figure he's
baffled by the frolicking, leaping Dennis Martinez (who needed,
what, 38 years to break Juan Marichal's record?) because good
pitchers just don't act like that.
</P>
<P>
   They say he's suffering from a ``dead arm,'' whatever that
means, and we're here to discount the fatality. But it isn't the
Kerry Wood we saw in May, either. The radar guns had his fastball
in the mid-90s Tuesday, but the scouts knew better. They didn't
hear the familiar pop in the catcher's glove. They didn't see the
howling insanity he unleashed on the Houston Astros when he struck
out 20. They saw a kid trying to settle for less.
</P>
<P>
   Wood's curveball was all over the map. He hung one to Barry
Bonds: two-run triple in the third. He hung the next one to Jeff
Kent: two-run homer. He threw one to J.T. Snow that missed the
target by nearly two feet. Then, all of a sudden, he was Bert
Blyleven. He froze Snow for a called third strike. He fanned
Charlie Hayes with something straight out of Cooperstown. And then
Brent Mayne went down on yet another deuce. A real clinic _ but
with the score 5-0 against him.
</P>
<P>
   Because Wood is a ballplayer, the way the National League likes
its pitchers, he got a couple of bunts down _ the second time on a
two-strike count against Hershiser. With a bat in his hands, Wood
can deaden a live fastball like kids popping balloons with safety
pins. He was plenty angry about leaving, too. Manager Jim Riggleman
deemed him incapable of dealing with Bonds in the fifth, nobody out
and a man on first, and that just fried the young right-hander.
With Terry Mulholland coming in (about to walk Bonds), Wood fired
his glove against the dugout floor.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser was forced to leave after walking two batters to load
the bases in the sixth, and that was a shame. There's nothing
professional about Julian Tavarez fielding a comebacker and heaving
a force-play throw so wide of the plate, Mayne can't come up with
it. There's nothing even remotely competent about Jose Mesa, who,
unbelievably, walked home the go-ahead run for the third time in
eight days. But there was beauty in Hershiser's performance. His
first two confrontations with Sosa were straight out of the
textbook.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa has been laying waste to the countryside, including two
prodigious homers here Monday night, so Hershiser sawed him off the
first time _ a broken-bat, double-play grounder. And the next time,
with the safety of a 5-1 lead, he hit Sosa. Nothing rude or
life-threatening; just a tailing fastball off the shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa cast a quick, hard look toward the mound and then quietly
took his base. No idiot temper tantrums from this man, because he
knows the deal. He knows all of it. He's not like Mark McGwire, the
Third Rockhead From the Sun. For McGwire, everything is an
annoyance. Batting practice? Major hassle. Way too many people
enjoying it. Chasing the legendary Babe? Big Mac has no idea what
it means. Absolutely can't figure the public's and media's
fascination. He's like an alien who was sent here to hit 538-foot
homers, and he's doing just that, but they messed with his brain.
He wakes up each morning, downs three of Dr. Irritable's pills,
then goes bitterly on his way.
</P>
<P>
   You might be smart to bet Sosa in the three-man pursuit of Ruth
and Roger Maris, because he knows how to have fun with it. And
speaking of players with the right perspective, don't forget to
take Hershiser along for the ride.
</P>
<P>
   As he walked to the plate for his first at-bat against Wood,
Hershiser heard his name being announced by a 5-year-old boy (a
clever, season-long brainstorm by the Giants' marketing
department). Most players just keep on walking. Hershiser stopped
and looked back, his heart melting for just a moment, because he
has kids. Because he  &LR; is  &LR; a little kid at heart and isn't afraid to
show it.
</P>
<P>
   On the first three pitches from Wood, Hershiser started backing
off before the ball was even thrown, as if to say, ``Too much for
me, man. Couple more and I'm out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   And on the fourth pitch, he spanked a clean single to center.
</P>
<P>
   For all of these reasons, and many more, the Giants' fans kept
that buzz going under the glaring sunlight. It was one of those
days when the best stories were told early. The Giants' bullpen has
taken some fun out of pennant-race baseball lately, but people like
Wood, Sosa and Hershiser keep it fresh and alive, a reason to come
back the next day.

 GIANTS PASS A SURVIVAL TEST  &HT;     By HENRY SCHULMAN 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The faithful would no doubt like to hear that all is well with
the Giants after they beat the Chicago Cubs 8-7 Tuesday to snap
their five-game losing streak and tighten the wild-card race. But
that would be inaccurate reporting.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the Giants emerged from battle looking like the winner
of a 120-round boxing match. They blew a 5-0 lead they built
against rookie standout Kerry Wood _ no news there _ and fell
behind 6-5 when reliever Jose Mesa incredibly walked home the
go-ahead run for the third time in eight games.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, the Giants had enough muscle left to tie the
game on Barry Bonds' RBI single in the seventh and take an 8-6 lead
on Jeff Kent's subsequent two-run homer, his second of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the Cubs closed the gap with a run off Mesa in the
eighth, but John Johnstone saved the day by holding Chicago at 8-7.
Robb Nen then pitched an uneventful ninth for his 30th save.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got lucky,'' Bonds said after he drove in three runs to
raise his total to 92. ``We're playing hard, but we've got to stop
the other team from scoring as much. We get out there, and all of a
sudden we're right back in the war zone. This is August. Everybody
is tired. Everybody is doing their best out there. Fortunately,
we're swinging the bats well.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bonds has 23 RBIs since July 31. Kent has 26 since July
24, as well as 10 homers in 18 games. And the Giants have needed
every morsel of that production merely to stay afloat.
</P>
<P>
   The starting pitchers have been the principal culprits. In 31
games since the All-Star break, the rotation is 6-17 with a 5.75
ERA. Kirk Rueter, who pitches Wednesday, is the only starter with
two victories in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Dusty Baker has decided to shake things up by moving
Danny Darwin to the bullpen. Chris Brock will start in his place
Sunday against Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go out there, and go as hard as you can and as long as you
can, but that has not been enough lately,'' said Orel Hershiser,
who could not retire a batter in the sixth inning Tuesday before he
was pulled. ``I felt good. I know I looked like a time bomb waiting
to go off. As a competitor, I wanted to stay in, but the manager
has to make that decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little disappointed in myself that I couldn't go deeper
in the game,'' he said. ``I had a pretty big lead. The bullpen is
carrying a big burden right now.''
</P>
<P>
   It should not have been that way.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants pounded on Wood, hitting for the cycle in the third
inning to take a 5-0 lead. Hershiser started with a single,
followed by Marvin Benard's RBI double, Bonds' two-run triple and
Kent's first two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``No knock on Kerry, but he wasn't at his best today,'' Kent
said. ``You can throw as hard as you want, but if you don't get
your offspeed pitches over you're not going to be able to survive
with your fastball. He was not getting that awesome slider we've
seen on TV over for strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood was done after four innings, but the Giants, as they have
done almost religiously lately, squandered the lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs scored single runs in the fourth, fifth and sixth
against Hershiser _ the sixth-inning run was unearned because
reliever Julian Tavarez threw away a sure out at home _ then three
more off the bullpen in the seventh inning to take a 6-5 lead.
</P>
<P>
   With the Giants still clinging to a 5-4 lead, it came down to
Mesa with the bases loaded again, this time with one out. He
actually pitched well to pinch-hitter Glenallen Hill, but Hill hit
a lucky dribbler 45 feet up the third-base line, tying the game.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler Houston then stepped in and took four straight balls from
Mesa to force home Sammy Sosa, who had been walked intentionally,
for a 6-5 Cubs lead.
</P>
<P>
   At least Mesa did not let the game get away. As 25,065 fans
booed him, he got pinch-hitter Mickey Morandini to bounce into a
force at home, then retired Sandy Martinez on a ground ball to end
the seventh and keep it a one-run game. That enabled the Giants to
storm back to an 8-6 lead on Bonds' single and Kent's homer off
Terry Adams in the bottom of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   When Mesa put two runners on in the eighth, Baker called on
Johnstone. After a sacrifice, Baker decided to walk Sosa
intentionally and face Mark Grace, a .319 hitter. The ploy worked
when Grace bounced into a force. A run scored, but the Giants
maintained the lead. Johnstone then retired pinch-hitter Jeff
Blauser to secure a game which took 3:14 to finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the toughest victories we've had,'' Baker
said, ``and one we probably needed the most. Everybody is just
tired and exhausted. Everybody gave whatever they had today.''

NAMING CHILD CRIME SUSPECTS SPAWNS MEDIA DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOAN RYAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than a week after an 11-year-old boy was charged with
shooting and killing his teenage neighbor in Antioch, Calif., two
months ago, the editors of the local Contra Costa Times decided to
print the name and school photo of the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   And Tuesday, after the boy was convicted in juvenile court of
involuntary manslaughter instead of the more serious murder charge,
the paper ran a front-page photo of him. The San Jose Mercury News,
which is owned by the same company, ran the same photo.
</P>
<P>
   The coverage escalated a difficult and sensitive debate in the
nation's newsrooms over how to write about the burgeoning number of
criminal suspects who look like children but kill like hardened
adults.
</P>
<P>
   The debate rose to the forefront at most newspapers after
virtually every paper in the country, including The Chronicle,
printed the names of the suspects, now 12 and 14, in the deadly
ambush at a Jonesboro, Ark., school in March. The Chicago Tribune,
the Los Angeles Times and the San Francisco Examiner resisted at
first, but they, too, gave in within three days.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, it was ridiculous not to print them because the
names were all over the place,'' said Chicago Tribune ombudsman
George Langford.
</P>
<P>
   The spate of horrific crimes committed by children has tested,
and cracked, journalism's long-standing policy of respecting a
child's right to privacy over the public's right to know.
Increasingly, newspapers are following the trend in the legal
system to treat children more like adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old idea was you don't want to taint someone forever at
such a tender age,'' said Mike Silverman, managing editor of the
Associated Press. ``But in some of these cases, that argument seems
less compelling. I mean, you turn on the TV and the parents of one
of these children is holding a press conference.''
</P>
<P>
   So our policy has evolved somewhat in the aftermath of Jonesboro
and other cases. There are more and more news stories of young kids
doing these horrible things.''
</P>
<P>
   Langford said the Chicago Tribune reviewed its policy about
naming minors after the Jonesboro case, sending reporters out to
elicit opinions from judges, child psychologists, lawyers and
educators.
</P>
<P>
   The Tribune decided to stick by the traditional guidelines used
by most papers around the country, taking into account the child's
age, the severity of the crime, whether the child is being tried as
a juvenile or an adult, and the child's criminal history.
</P>
<P>
   This week, neither the Tribune, the competing Sun-Times nor
Chicago TV stations have revealed the names of the 7- and
8-year-old boys charged in Chicago on Monday with murdering and
molesting an 11-year-old girl. But, as Silverman of the AP bluntly
points out, ``That could change. . . . If the media in Chicago is
using (the names), then probably we would, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Saundra Keyes, managing editor of the Contra Costa Times, said
the decision to use the Antioch boy's name was a ``difficult and
sad'' one but that it passed the newspaper's litmus test. ``All
newspapers have a threshold that has to do with the heinousness of
the crime,'' she said. ``And unfortunately, there are so many more
crimes that rise to the threshold.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's editions, the Times' story and photo were
accompanied by an editor's note explaining that the paper ``does
not normally identify juvenile suspects, (but) we decided to do so
in this case because of the severity of the charge. . . .
Additionally, we decided to publish today's front page photograph
of the young boy in the belief that the image illustrates the
enormity of this tragedy in a way that words alone cannot.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Keyes, ``There's also the broad issue of guns _ the
availability and the tragedy that ensue from that. The photo can
emphasize that more than the story. It's one thing to say an
11-year-old did this; it's another to look at that slight frame,
that face. So many who look at it will attach it to their own
children, to their nieces and nephews.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle generally does not use the names of young
offenders, but that policy is reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
Because of the horrific nature of the Jonesboro shootings, The
Chronicle printed the names and photographs of the suspects, who
were found guilty Tuesday of killing a teacher and four classmates.
The decision was different in the Antioch case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't print the name of the Antioch boy because he and his
family live in our circulation area,'' said Chronicle Executive
Editor Matthew Wilson. ``We didn't want to add to the stigma when
he was not being tried as an adult. The verdict, which was
involuntary manslaughter and not murder, gave us no compelling
reason to change our minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Krim, assistant managing editor at the Mercury News,
said printing the Antioch boy's name was a mistake that slipped by
the editors. The wire services had included the name in their
stories, and the Mercury had used the wire stories without deleting
the name _ which went against the newspaper's policy.
</P>
<P>
   Then when the Mercury sent its own reporter to cover the boy's
conviction Tuesday, the reporter used the boy's name, probably
assuming that it was all right because the paper had already
printed it in at least one previous wire story, Krim said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, it's our policy not to name juveniles,'' he said.
``There's supposed to be a real good conversation among editors
(before naming juveniles), and that didn't happen in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the boy's trial, bailiffs instructed photographers
not to take pictures of the youth as he was taken to and from the
courtroom. Cameras were banned from the courtroom itself.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gagen, the boy's attorney, said that he was troubled that
the Times ran the photo and that he intended to bring the matter up
with Contra Costa Superior Court Judge Lois Haight, who presided
over the trial.

   1. VANESSA WILLIAMS DANCES UP A STORM Vanessa Williams gets down
and dirty with Latin pop star Chayanne In ``Dance With Me.'' She
plays a competitive ballroom dancer and he stars as a Cuban imigri.
Williams talks about the new movie, taking dance lessons for the
role, her career, her family and how she survived the 1984 nude
picture scandal that cost her the crown as the first black Miss
America. By Cindy Pearlman. 1,400 words + photo.
_______________________________________________________________ 2.
THE KARMA CHAMELEON'S NEXT LIFE Boy George has grown up. The
singer, flamboyant personality and leader of '80s British band
Culture Club has been through drugs, therapy and various other side
trips to emerge a thoughtful, still outspoken '90s revival story.
The reunited Culture Club (all the original members) is on tour
this summer. ``It's amazing how you can discover your own music
years later,'' says George, adding that many of the tunes were not
the sugary ditties they were thought to be at that teen-idol time,
but were really ``personal stories'' connected to his now-defunct
love affair with drummer Jon Moss. By Steve Morse. From The Boston
Globe. 1,200 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 3.
VAN CLIBURN'S GHOST APPEARS IN THE SHED Last month, celebrated
pianist Van Cliburn returned to the concert platform, 30 years
after his last performance with the Boston Symphony Orchestra. The
expectancy surrounding the occasion at the Tanglewood Festival in
Lenox, Massachusetts, was all the greater because a thunderstorm
was gathering (the concert was to be held in the Shed, a kind of
hangar half-open to the elements,) and because Van Cliburn was
rumoured to be nervous. Review by Renaud Machart. From Le Monde.
English translation available. 700 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 4.
IS GARY SINISE A MOVIE STAR? After he appeared in ``Forrest Gump,''
(one of the highest-grossing films in movie history,) as Vietnam
veteran Lt. Dan Taylor, Gary Sinise was called ``a mainstream movie
star.'' But is he truly a name, a face, a Travolta, a Cruise? If he
is, someone forgot to tell him. Sinise gets the scripts with
fingerprints on them, reading for the parts that have already been
considered and rejected by other actors. He is also, however, the
kind of actor who makes you pay closer attention to any film,
simply because he's in it. While his name is in smaller type in
advertisements for ``Snake Eyes'' than that of Nicolas Cage, Sinise
is one of the film's most compelling characters. Interview by Renee
Graham. From The Boston Globe. 1,400 words.

   5. BO DEREK BUCKS THE SEX SYMBOL FATE In the 1979 movie ``10,''
Bo Derek was the world's perfect woman, and an instant corn-rowed
sex symbol. Today she is 41, and while men at that age can continue
to be box office icons, her sex symbol movie career is virtually
over. However, still able to slip easily into a bikini, in the
steamy new TV series ``Wind on Water,'' she plays a beautiful widow
with two teenage sons, a strong woman battling to keep her Hawaiian
ranch. It's a kind of ``Dallas'' meets ``Bonanza'' via
``Baywatch.'' Interview by Ivor Davis. (N/A Great Britain and
Australia.) 1,000 words + photos.
_______________________________________________________________ 6.
ALAN ARKIN IS A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS Alan Arkin has been around for
a long time, doing just about everything in show business. The
64-year-old is currently doing an off-Broadway show, ``Power
Plays'' and has a new movie, ``Slums of Beverly Hills'' due out
soon. Arkin talks about his current and new projects as well as his
long-standing versatility in the business. He says he's quite happy
with who he is and has no desire to be a Bruce Willis or Steve
McQueen. By Ian Spelling. 1,300 words + photo.
_______________________________________________________________ 7.
A LOOK BACK AT THE RAT PACK They were hot back then, and they were
cool at the same time. The ``Rat Pack,'' was the Frank Sinatra &AMP;
Co. group that followed the original Lauren Bacall and Humphrey
Bogart crowd, (they got the name from appearing like a bunch of
drowned rats.) A new HBO movie takes a look at this phenomenon and
the 1950s and 1960s when the Rat Pack ruled. Jean Oppenheimer talks
to several of the key players in the movie. 1,400 words + photo.
_______________________________________________________________ 8.
FACE VALUE : LEADERS OF THE PACK - SAMMY, FRANK AND DEAN In this
new cartoon feature, artist Ricardo Castaneda caricatures Sammy
Davis Jr., Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin of the ``Rat Pack.''
_______________________________________________________________ 9.
BEAU BRIDGES GOES OVER THE TOP IN NEW SERIES Director Barry
Sonnenfeld told Beau Bridges and the rest of the cast in the new
series ``Maximum Bob'' to go over the top, but not to appear as if
they were joking. Sonnenfeld should know : he produced two of
Hollywood's most zany movies in recent years - ``Men in Black'' and
``Get Shorty.'' The cast of the show, based on an Elmore Leonard
best-selling novel, seems to get it. Stephen Cole takes a look at
the show. (Colour slide shows Bridges wrestling with an alligator
..... ) From TV Guide. 800 words.

 &HT;    Is school becoming too much of a pain in your kid's back?
 &HT;    By Julie Bonnin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Jayce Gill has a purple canvas backpack. And one
day this summer, the 10-year-old filled it with: A plastic case
stuffed with doll clothes and some pennies. Doll-sized pom-pons and
leg cast. A brochure from a doll company. Jayce's clothes.
Hair-ties. Several pairs of doll shoes. A desktop accessories box
secured with a red bandana. And a doll.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming school year, the contents of Jayce's backpack will
lean more to books and notebooks.
</P>
<P>
   It all adds up to a pretty big load for a 74-pound girl.
</P>
<P>
   As backpacks have become a must-have for schoolkids, concern
about how much they're carrying_ and the way they carry them _ has
become an issue.
</P>
<P>
   Back specialists are hearing sporadic reports of children
developing muscle strains and backaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same as an adult gaining 20 pounds overnight, and
then trying to be as active as their 10-year-old,'' says Dr.
Randall Dryer, a spinal surgery specialist with the Central Texas
Spine Institute. ``It's going to lead to back pain. Little bodies
aren't meant to carry the same kind of weight as adults.''
</P>
<P>
   There are things parents and children can do to prevent backpack
related back strain, which usually surfaces in the lower back or
between the shoulder blades, according to Dryer.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until Jayce complained about her pack hurting during
the last school year, that her dad, Thomas ``Woody'' Gill, realized
he needed to replace the heavy dictionary she was toting around
with a small paperback version.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he says, he'll be more attentive, since the pack is a
constant presence in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't go anywhere without it and she never forgets it,''
Gill says.
</P>
<P>
   Other things parents should be aware of when using backpacks:
Kids should carry the pack on both shoulders to evenly distribute
any weight. Reduce the load. Make copies of textbook materials
children need for a particular day so they don't have to carry so
many books. Choose lightweight notebooks. Substitute paperback
versions of dictionaries or other reference books. Clean out
backpacks periodically to remove unnecessary items.
</P>
<P>
   Restrict backpack use if kids complain about the weight, or if
they've injured themselves during another activity.
</P>
<P>
   If children complain badly enough about the pain and it keeps
them from participating in an activity they enjoy, that's a strong
signal to see a doctor, Dryer says. Other warning signs that need a
physician's attention: complaints for more than seven days, pain
accompanied by fever and chills, numbness or leg pain.

 &HT;    If city manicures, croquet will come _ to South Florida
 &HT;    By Noah Bierman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The wicket and mallet set is hoping a
city park in a mixed-income neighborhood will join the ranks of
Mar-a-Lago and The Breakers.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, love. They're talking croquet in Howard Park,
across the bridge from Palm Beach and down a few blocks. It's a
good deal east of Wellington and quite a bit north of Boca Raton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen the benefits Tiger Woods has brought to golf. We
want the next Tiger Woods to be a croquet player,'' John Curington
wrote in a letter to city commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   Curington is president of the Florida section of the United
States Croquet Association, based in Wellington. His group has
offered to spend $250,000 on five championship courts in Howard
Park if the city agrees to manicure the lawns.
</P>
<P>
   Because the city would have to provide added irrigation and buy
a special mower to keep the 2 acres neatly trimmed, it would cost
taxpayers $82,000 the first year and $61,000 every year after that.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor thinks it's a smashing idea. ``It's the one thing I
might be able to play,'' Nancy Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   But commission approval might prove a bit of a sticky wicket.
``I don't see a lot of kids playing croquet,'' said Commissioner
Howard Warshauer.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Al Zucaro questions whether equal treatment should
be given to area cricket players, who've been asking to use city
park land for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Croquet (pronounced cro-KAY) is a 15th-century French sport that
has largely been dominated by older, wealthier people who play at
exclusive clubs. Prices for a good set (not the $40 barbecue
backyard variety in your grandmother's basement) start at more than
$200. The average income of United States Croquet Association
members is $150,000, according to association data.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget to don those whites on the lawn. Most private
clubs that offer croquet require white clothing from head to foot.
</P>
<P>
   But the croquet association is trying to shake those patrician
roots. By bringing the sport to communities of different races,
incomes and ages, they want to build its popularity. This would be
the second public course in Florida, joining one in Winter Park,
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the players are dying off and they don't have anybody
to play the sport,'' said Laura Schuppert, West Palm Beach's
recreation director.
</P>
<P>
   The croquet association has offered to buy the equipment so the
city can loan it to residents for free. They've also offered to
send a teacher a few days a week to give lessons. And residents
won't have to wear white unless they're playing in a tournament,
Schuppert said.
</P>
<P>
   To lease the land for 10 years, the association needs support
from four of five commissioners later this month. If it gets it,
the association would host national and international tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Local instructor and four-time national champion Archie Peck
said people of all backgrounds enjoy the sport. He called croquet
``a cerebral game'' combining billiards, chess and putting.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent meeting, 21 of 35 area residents agreed to cede two
of the park's 30 acres for croquet, Schuppert said. The land is now
being used for lawn-bowling and a horseshoe pitch.
</P>
<P>
   One of the five croquet courts would double as a bowling lawn,
according to the association's plan. As it is, lawn bowling in
Howard park is played on clay, so the lawn bowlers are ``very
supportive,'' Schuppert said.

 &HT;    Movie aimed at kids may do more harm than good

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It was a perfect night _ just hot enough, not too
hot. We were all in the mood for some good family entertainment,
not too serious, not too stupid. Something to delight every member
of the family from, say, 42 (picking a random number) to 3.
</P>
<P>
   We settled on a drive-in movie _ Parent Trap _ popped our
popcorn, packed our cooler and hit the road. Here indeed was
something for every taste: Dennis Quaid in tight black jeans for
me; Natasha ooh-la-la Richardson for Jim; musical lawn chairs for
Veronica; and slapstick campfire high jinks for Alec.
</P>
<P>
   It was all fun and froth, exactly what we'd been looking for. Of
course, we had to suspend our disbelief and not ask the obvious
questions: Who but a pair of sociopaths would do this to their
kids? How could they be so attractive and likable?
</P>
<P>
   And then there were the tricks you don't want your kids to try
at home. ``What was your favorite part of the movie?'' I asked Alec
afterward. ``When they put rocks in her backpack!'' he chortled.
</P>
<P>
   How would he have reacted if we were divorced? Would the pranks
still be the film's most delightful fantasy?
</P>
<P>
   For Alec there was no subtext to this remake of the tale of
separated-at-birth twins who meet for the first time at camp and
conspire to bring their parents back together. The split-family
theme didn't resonate with me and my pals, either, when we saw the
Hayley Mills original in 1961. Not one of the kids on my block
lived in a single-parent home. Scheming to reunite your folks
seemed as far-fetched as the jet-setting parents.
</P>
<P>
   The fantasy carries a more wistful element for many of today's
kids and complications for single parents: whether to let their
kids see a movie that might foster unrealistic hopes.
</P>
<P>
   One friend said she won't take her almost-teen daughter to see
the film: ``It's been three years and she has felt _ up to the time
her dad told her a few months ago that he was probably going to
remarry _ that we were going to get back together. I think Mrs.
Doubtfire is a much better movie to see, where the parents work out
an amicable resolution to their separateness and redefine family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a movie I'll take my kids to see,'' concurred Kathy
Crews of Vandalia. Divorced since November, she has two daughters,
12 and 6. ``My younger one hints around her mom and dad are going
to get back together. . . . I think the movie ought to carry a
warning for parents who are newly divorced, that your children may
have a recurrence of pain and false hope of getting back together.
And then when you explain that won't happen, it would just bring
more pain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'd have a problem taking them to see it,'' said
Cindy Hochwalt of Centerville, whose children are 5 and 10. ``My
only worry is having them thinking, 'Hey this is maybe something
that could happen to me.' It's a matter of talking to them, helping
them to understand in the easiest, kindest way.''
</P>
<P>
   Donita Garner of Dayton said she might take her son, Joshua, 7,
to the movie to get him to open up. ``He still dreams, but I don't
do anything to discourage the dream other than to say that's not
what the cards are all about. It has been a year since we had that
conversation. I might take him to see where his head is.''
</P>
<P>
   This film from 1961 ``doesn't translate very well into the late
'90s,'' Crews observed.
</P>
<P>
   You can remake careers, slang, wardrobes and hairstyles all you
like, but how do you graft a '60s fantasy about families onto the
reality of families in the '90s?
</P>
<P>
   Looks like somebody fell into a Producer Trap.

 &HT;    At the square, we drove in circles, refusing to yield
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIANA, Ohio _ Let me tell you about this town. It is small
_ 6,000 people. It has the most wonderful park, the most wonderful
old cinema, the most wonderful fall street fair. For $100,000, you
could buy yourself the prettiest house on the
</P>
<P>
   nicest part of Elm Street.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this town's not totally bucolic. You must still
supply the pretty life that goes inside.
</P>
<P>
   When I was growing up here in the 1970s, this is what we did.
</P>
<P>
   We rode around and looked for Mark Harrold.
</P>
<P>
   We rode through the park and we rode through the Dairy Queen
parking lot and we rode around out on old Metz Road.
</P>
<P>
   We rode around after football games and on hot summer nights
after the pool closed.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, my moments of greatest teenage solitude and independence
came inside my father's green Ford LTD, learning the words to a
Karen Carpenter song and looking, always looking, for the cutest
guy to ever fill a Columbiana Clippers football jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The oddest part about this little town, the thing that makes
people really sit up and yak, is The Square.
</P>
<P>
   The Square is this little traffic circle in the center and, of
course, The Square is round, not square. It is also where
16-year-olds in Columbiana are first taught good manners, a little
something people around here call ``yielding.''
</P>
<P>
   Had I married a local boy, I would have never married someone
who zoomed through the square all willy-nilly. In Columbiana, you
are expected to marry a good yielder. And if you don't, everybody
knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did you leave here?'' asked my 7-year-old, the boy who on
previous visits was not interested in any life I had prior to being
his mother. ``College,'' I told him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' he said, ``I like it. It's so old-fashioned.'' And
because mothers are always looking for moments to teach their sons
great lessons, especially when they're driving around in their
small Ohio hometown with nothing but time on their hands, I
proceeded to talk to him about life and leaving and how some things
always look a little better from the outside. But his mind was
already on miniature golf and the Dairy Queen.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his question is one I've asked myself many times,
especially since he was born. Wouldn't it be best for this child if
his father and I raised him in a place like this? A place where
children can ride their bikes out of sight without striking fear in
a parent's heart. A place where families are safe. Indeed, there
have been just three murders in this town since Columbiana Police
Chief John Krawchyk came here as a young officer in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   But I guess my heart knows the answers to all this.
</P>
<P>
   Before I left here, I had never seen a homeless person. Before I
left here, I'd never had a black as a friend or a gay as a
neighbor. Before I left here, the only diversities I knew were the
simple differences of morals that divided one white family from
another.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as with all matters of the heart, I've always believed
that the reasons I love this little town are a complicated
combination of family, sentiment and social standards.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until the other day, 42 years old with a bored child
on my hands, that it all came to me, that it all made sense.
</P>
<P>
   The most marvelous thing about Columbiana, Ohio, is that when
you come home, an old married woman, you can take your kid and
drive out to Ross' Lake Front Miniature Golf Course and play a
quick nine holes for $3.
</P>
<P>
   Then you can stop at Sparkle Market, pick up some coffee and do
all your socializing.
</P>
<P>
   And you don't even have to keep your eyes peeled for Mark
Harrold.
</P>
<P>
   Simple as that.

 &HT;    Taking your child to `Mulan'? Hide the hair shears
 &HT;    By Ricardo Gandara
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ As if you didn't have enough to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by the spirited heroines of two new
made-for-little-girls movies, some youngsters are taking up
scissors and trying their hands at shearing their own locks.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the real parent trap.
</P>
<P>
   Snip. ``Look, Mom, I'm Mulan.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past two weeks, a dozen desperate parents have rushed to
Austin hair stylist Margo Bower, owner of the Hair's Lair, to clean
up the handiwork of their daughters, ranging in age from 3 to 6.
The girls, Bower says, all have chopped their hair just like Mulan
did with a sword to masquerade as a man to defend her family's
honor, or as the high-toned Annie did to look exactly like her
down-to-earth twin sister, Hallie, in ``The Parent Trap.'' All the
parents told Bower their kids got the idea from the movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're cutting clumps of hair here and there, on the side,
their bangs, whatever they can hold up and cut,'' says Bower, who
thinks creatively in approaching her little fashion victims, giving
them a ``nicer-looking haircut to camouflage the damaged area.''
</P>
<P>
   So as not to make matters worse _ Bower says the girls got
enough grief at home _ she did not want to disclose their names,
although two irritated parents confirmed that Bower rescued their
daughters' locks. ``I didn't want them to feel badly for what they
had done,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   A piece of advice, parents: If you don't want to make a 3 a.m.
hospital visit because your kid wants her tonsils out, don't take
her to see ``Madeline.''

 &HT;    'I didn't know we had so many people in our family!'
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE PARK, Fla. _ The Walker family photos are on display.
</P>
<P>
   They are proof of what can go wrong in family photos _ blurs,
thumbs, misfired flashes _ and what can go right in a family.
</P>
<P>
   The boy in the suit at the drum set in the den. The two girls in
their bedroom with pinups of the Jackson 5. The wedding cake. The
Navy portrait. The girl in the pink sweater with ``Teen Angel''
spelled in sequins. The graduate. The playpen. The
clutching-the-wagon-wheel school photo. The party hats. The rose
corsage. The surprised look. The pout.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's me _ Lord, you can't tell!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Go on, 'fess on up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got rid of that sweater last week.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And what's with the Afro?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Sherry. Look at Sherry right here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Reggie? You sure?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Reggie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With a dress on? That's a dress, hon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Reggie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a dress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Magic. Come here and look at Magic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not Pam. That is Sylvia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sharon looks just like herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Family photos for a family of 310. They have to keep a census.
</P>
<P>
   Every two years, a different family member plays host to the
Walker family reunion. Last weekend, it was Dorothy Whigham's turn.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy is 54 and lives in Lake Park, and she thinks she has
spent $2,500 on the whole three-day, $10,000 deal _ banquet at the
Marriott, hospitality suite, fashion show with the kids, all-day
picnic and Sunday service. The reunion T-shirts alone were $600.
</P>
<P>
   And after 31 years of reunions, someone finally thought to pull
out the photos. ``We're trying to do something different,'' said
Latoya Whigham, 19, Dorothy's granddaughter. ``We had kids falling
asleep.''
</P>
<P>
   So while family members recited poems, and family historian Rosa
Jordan, 72, brought everyone up to date, people kept leaving the
banquet hall for peeks.
</P>
<P>
   And with all the camera action, no doubt they'll update those
photos fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``One year, I took 285 photos,'' said Charlie Saffore of Kokomo,
Ind. ``I didn't know we had so many people in our family!''
</P>
<P>
   (ital)
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past two years, we've had an increase of 17 people,''
Rosa Jordan says. (Applause.)
</P>
<P>
   (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   The reunions started with Thanksgiving get-togethers in Orlando,
where the 13 children of Ernest Walker and Annie Mae Morris Walker,
both farmers, grew up. The family outgrew Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, the 13 children started taking turns hosting the
reunions every year in California and across the South. The family
outgrew that schedule and changed it to every two years.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't enough. The family finally started having regional
birthday fellowships every three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found out our grandchildren were going to the same school
and didn't know each other, and started dating each other,'' Rosa
Jordan explained.
</P>
<P>
   Her grandson's cousin started dating a girl, and the grandson
tried to set him straight. ``Go call granny,'' he told the boy.
Turns out the couple's grandparents were sister and brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boy called from school one day and said, `Don't tell me!
Don't tell me!' '' Jordan said. ``That really struck me.''
</P>
<P>
   Annie Ruth Favors has lived in West Palm Beach since 1964, but
it took 10 years to learn she had relatives here.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day, a lady was going to get an address from me and looked
at my address book, and she asked, `Are you any kin to the Favors
on 44th Street?' She took me over there. We were first cousins.''
</P>
<P>
   This was her first reunion. ``You see so many faces you look
almost like,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   (ital)
</P>
<P>
   Rosa Jordan: ``I have five daughters, 10 grandchildren, three _
wait, gotta count, she's got two _ three. Three
great-grandchildren. Yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   The last time the 13 Walker children were together was in 1991,
before sister Emma Terry died. Four brothers couldn't come this
year for one reason or another.
</P>
<P>
   At final count, about 250 people showed up this time.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Whigham is the youngest of the 13. The reunion was
special, she said, because after this, the younger family members
take over as hosts.
</P>
<P>
   And thank God for that. ``I got to bed at 2:30 this morning,''
she said after the Sunday service. ``The last guest leaves on
Wednesday.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that she doesn't love the family reunion. Still, she's
taking the week off.

8:15, and he's already written seven pages of a script for his new
ABC series ``Cupid,'' an offbeat romantic comedy-drama set to debut
in late September.
</P>
<P>
   Holed up in a Chicago hotel while ``Cupid'' is preparing to
begin production there, Thomas, a former high school journalism
teacher and rock and roll musician from Austin, is living a dream _
and a little bit of a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas , who turns 33 on Aug. 15, is executive producer and
writer of his own network series. Two of his four books, ``Slave
Day'' and ``Satellite Down,'' are heading to the big screen in the
next year or so. And that's not all. Dick Clark is interested in
turning Thomas's first book, ``Rats Saw God,'' into a TV series,
and Thomas has been hired to write another movie, ``Next to You,''
starring Melissa Joan Hart, for Fox.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot of success for someone who moved to Los Angeles,
the Land of Broken Dreams, only a year ago. But the work schedule
that has catapulted Thomas to so much success is a killer. He gets
up hours before dawn and writes until around noon. Then he puts on
his producer's hat and races off to take care of production plans
and problems. His work week usually extends through the weekend,
when he tries to catch up on his various writing assignments. Good
thing he's single.
</P>
<P>
   So, is red-hot Rob Thomas having any fun as an up-and-coming
Hollywood big-wig?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Thomas answered after a long pause. ``But I'm working
these insane hours. I work 12- to 13-hour days during the week, and
on the weekends I write for 5 to 6 hours a day. When I get home, I
wait until it gets dark enough to sleep and then I fall into bed. I
try to stay awake until 9 p.m., and then I go to sleep so I can get
up at 4 and start writing again. I'm hoping to get to the point
where I can sit back, take a break and enjoy it, but right now it
feels like all I do is work.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the notion that he may be coming across as a sniveling
wimp who doesn't appreciate his good fortune stops Thomas in his
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I start feeling self-pity, I think, wait a minute. I
have my own show on network TV, and I moved to L.A. only a year
ago,'' Thomas said with a chuckle. ``Writing something I know will
be produced and produced quickly is such a thrill. It really is so
much fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' big break came last year when he was hired as a writer
for WB's sexy new teen drama, ``Dawson's Creek.'' He landed that
position after a writing job for ``My So-Called Life'' disappeared
when the series was canceled. Thomas penned the controversial
``Dawson's Creek'' episode in which 15-year-old Pacey had sex with
his thirtysomething English teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a goofy teacher, but, no, that wasn't based on personal
experience,'' said Thomas, who taught at Reagan High after he
graduated from the University of Texas in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   While he was finishing his commitment to ``Dawson's Creek,''
Thomas awaited news of the fate of his ``Cupid'' pilot. In late
spring, ABC announced that ``Cupid'' would air Saturday nights on
the network's fall schedule, paired with a quirky revival of
``Fantasy Island.'' The network describes ``Cupid'' as a ``blue-sky
drama,'' perhaps referring to its upbeat, romantic focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's very funny, blue-sky drama,'' Thomas said. ``I have no
idea what that means. Sounds like 'Little House on the Prairie' to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he doesn't understand ABC's description of his show,
Thomas thus far has been happy with the team that's been brought
together to bring ``Cupid'' to life. Assisting first-time executive
producer Thomas behind the scenes will be Scott Winant
(``thirtysomething,'' ``My So-Called Life'') and Jeff Reno and Ron
Osborn (``Moonlighting'').
</P>
<P>
   ``The joke on the set is, occasionally you run into someone
who's not a producer,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Cupid'' premise is that a young man, played by former
``Ellen'' co-star Jeremy Piven, turns up in a mental institution
claiming to be the romantic do-gooder from Mount Olympus. The
psychiatrist (Paula Marshall) assigned to him thinks he's nuts, but
Cupid insists he's the real deal. He's been sent to earth to make
up for a series of bad matches in the past, and he won't be allowed
back up the Mount until he has made permanent matches of a hundred
couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rob has created a unique milieu,'' Osborn said. ``This really
is his baby, and he's enormously talented.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said he wrote ``Cupid,'' which he thinks of as a
``post-modern, anti-Love Boat,'' to play to his own strengths. He
wasn't interested in writing a sitcom, although he enjoys comedy,
and he didn't think he was ready to tackle a complicated drama such
as ``NYPD Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I searched for a niche I thought I could do well, and I've
been a fan of hour-long shows with comedy _ 'Moonlighting,'
'Northern Exposure,' 'Ally McBeal,''' he said. ``They don't hire on
'Ally' (creator/producer David E. Kelley writes all the scripts
himself), so I thought I'd make my own.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Thomas says he thought of comedian Denis Leary (``Wag
the Dog'') when he was writing ``Cupid,'' he was thoroughly
satisfied with the casting of Piven.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without naming names, there were softer people considered,''
Thomas said. ``I didn't want Cupid to be a 'Touched by an Angel'
kind of guy. I wanted an actor who was my age, which Jeremy is.
Like Denis, Jeremy has an edge, and Jeremy is without a doubt a
better actor.''
</P>
<P>
   At ABC's lavish stars-and-press party at the posh Ritz-Carlton
Hotel in Pasadena last month, Thomas seemed slightly dazed by all
the hoopla but was having a fine time. Instead of a red-lipped
starlet in a sausage-casing dress by his side, Thomas was
accompanied by his parents, Bob and Diana Thomas, school teachers
who now live in Washington, where Rob was born. The Thomases moved
to Austin when Rob was 10 and to San Marcos, where he graduated
from high school, when he was 12.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly proud of their son's success, the Thomases were too
star-struck and pre-occupied to talk about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There goes Sipowicz!'' Diana Thomas said excitedly before
disappearing into the glittery crowd. ``My parents shock me,''
Thomas said with a huge grin on his face as ABC stars such as Jenna
Elfman (``Dharma &AMP; Greg'') and Drew Carey milled about. ``Look,
they're actually talking to Dennis Franz. They're having a good
time.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, his father brought the ``NYPD Blue'' star
over and introduced him to his son. ``I couldn't quite get over
that,'' Thomas recalled the following week. ``The next day my dad
said, `Well, I guess you won't be taking me to any more of these
things.'''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is especially close to his parents and credits his father
with nudging him toward Hollywood. He had been teaching at Reagan
High and flirting for almost a decade with life as a rock and
roller in a local band called Hey Zeus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an only child, and I have a traditional relationship with
my parents,'' Thomas said. ``I guess the defining moment for me was
when my dad sat me down and said I should write. `That's one thing
you're good at,' he said. I loved playing in the band, but I was
very mediocre.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for Thomas's writing career to take off. He
earned more for his first script ($25,000) than he had for an
entire year of teaching. His goal is to direct feature films and
continue writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is happening faster than I thought it would,'' Thomas said.
``When I'm in the middle of it, like I am now, it doesn't faze me,
but when I pause to reflect, it does surprise me. But I've always
had some sort of weird personal manifest destiny. I sort of expect
good things to happen. I don't know where I get it, but I do have a
sort of blind optimism.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Why we are targets
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Suddenly my plan to put a few pesos on the
caballitos was blocked by a picket line of intense men holding
automatic weapons, rifles and pistols.
</P>
<P>
   The men were lined up across the front entrance of the Del Prado
Hotel, which in 1959 was perhaps the best hotel in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' said one of the armed men holding up his hand as I
exited the hotel dressed in a madras sport jacket and a stylishly
narrow tie.
</P>
<P>
   These men, I realized, had their guns at the ready to protect me
and the other American hotel guests from the angry, boiling crowd
that filled the street.
</P>
<P>
   I stood in by the front door and listened to the crowd shout
anti-American obscenities and watched as they burned the American
flag.
</P>
<P>
   My first encounter with international anti-Americanism came
during a last-fling adventure through Mexico before I left for boot
camp.
</P>
<P>
   The sight of an American flag being torched in anger was
startling. My friend and I stood there slack-jawed.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators spotted us and began shouting and pointing. We
were obviously Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The armed men herded us back through the front door into the
quiet, comfortable lobby that was a world apart from the ugly melee
outside on the street.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 39 years later, I am not so startled when I encounter
anti-Americanism. I am still not sure, however, why America, which
has never taken over one square-inch of anyone's land, is so
despised by so many of the world's discontents.
</P>
<P>
   When we find out who is responsible for the recent bombings of
the American embassies in Africa, I doubt that we will be any
closer to understanding why America was the target for this deadly
hatred.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorist acts associated with Northern Ireland, the Middle East
and more recently in the former Yugoslavia can be traced to ancient
grievances.
</P>
<P>
   These grievances don't apply to the United States, which happens
to be the world's oldest democracy.
</P>
<P>
   A nation that believes in individual freedoms and practices
religious tolerance should not be a hate target, but it is.
</P>
<P>
   When my friend and I asked why the demonstrators were denouncing
the United States, we were told to not worry. Before long the
protesters, who were from the university, would get tired and go
home.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than wait for the crowd to leave, we slipped out a side
door and took a taxi to the race track.
</P>
<P>
   Our reation to all this anti-American passion must be one reason
Americans are so so despised by people who see us as disgustingly
fortunate compared to their own conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are winners simply by luck of birth. What's more, our
culture emphasizes winning. We keep score with money. Not only are
Americans born lucky, we keep piling it on.
</P>
<P>
   Although the days of pushy, ugly American travelers are in the
past, the United States also has a history of being fairly pushy
when it came to supporting U.S. business interests overseas.
</P>
<P>
   And the United States has intervened here and there in foreign
affairs to protect national security during the Cold War years.
</P>
<P>
   But those actions appear reasonable, if not defensible.
</P>
<P>
   Religious fanaticism, however, does not bend to reason. Even
though the United States has been the world's leader in trying to
broker a peace between Israel and the Palestinians, we are
perceived as taking sides against Islam by many fundamentalist
Muslims who never take a secular view of the world.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, understanding anti-Americanism becomes
unnecessary. When reasonable methods fail, the United States should
be prepared to meet force with superior force.

 &HT;    More small businesses offering retirement plans
 &HT;    By Kim Tyson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Alan Tillman built a successful business making
custom guns in his home over the past 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when the company hit $100,000 in gross annual
revenues, he was finally earning enough that he could think about
putting money aside for retirement. But until recently he found it
difficult to take advantage of the salary deferral plans common
today at large companies.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the 55-year-old gunsmith set up a simple individual
retirement account (IRA) that allows him to put aside up to $6,000
a year of his pre-tax salary. He estimates the plan costs him only
$35 a year in administrative fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's relatively inexpensive for the gain,'' he says. In
today's tight job market, more and more small businesses are
offering retirement plans as an incentive to attract good workers
and compete with bigger employers. But picking the right type of
plan depends on the size of the company, how much it can spend on
plan administration and how much it might grow.
</P>
<P>
   Most big employers offer retirement plans in the form of 401(k)
programs, which were first authorized by Congress in 1978. Some
small growing companies also can find it cost effective to set up
401(k) plans, but others should look to other, newer programs, said
Neile Wolfe, who sets up salary deferral plans for Prudential
Securities in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   While the situations may vary, there are some basic rules of
thumb to guide companies on which plans will likely work best for
them.
</P>
<P>
   To establish a 401(k) plan at a minimum cost, a company should
have at least 25 employees, plan to be adding employees, and have
more than half of its employees willing to participate, Wolfe says.
He says some advisers may quibble with those figures, but it really
depends on the specific company. A 401(k) plan allows employees to
put aside up to $10,000 in pre-tax salary for their retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a very small company _ like a family owned convenience
store, or family owned retail shop, or a couple of attorneys or a
couple of paralegals, or a small home builder _ a 401(k) is more
likely than not a poor choice for an employer,'' Wolfe says.
</P>
<P>
   But a 10-person consulting firm where each person earns $100,000
a year could find a 401(k) plan the best option.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the answer lies in tests the IRS uses to decide how much
can be deferred by the highest paid employees. The tests determine
whether highly paid executives and lower-paid employees are
participating in acceptable ratios.
</P>
<P>
   Besides those requirements, the administrative costs associated
with setting up and running 401(k) plans can make them too onerous
unless the company is large enough, Wolfe says. If a 401(k) plan
isn't right, a small business may want to consider another plan,
the simple 401(k), which allows only $6,000 to be deferred, but has
lower salary thresholds and fees.
</P>
<P>
   The simple IRA like the one Tillman started was authorized by
Congress and went into effect in January 1997. It is one of the
more attractive ways small companies can help employees save for
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The simple IRA has virtually no set-up costs, administrative
fees and no discrimination tests. Under the simple IRA the employer
matches dollar for dollar the first 3 percent of the salary being
deferred by an employee.
</P>
<P>
   Also a simple IRA, unlike the IRAs for individuals, allows up to
$6,000 vs. $2,000 of an employee's salary to be contributed pre-tax
to a retirement plan. Unlike the traditional IRA, which may or may
not be tax deductible, a simple IRA is automatically tax
deductible. (Tillman says one of the reasons he set up the simple
IRA is that because of his wife's retirement plan at work, he was
no longer able to make a tax-deferred contribution to a traditional
IRA.)
</P>
<P>
   Another option is the Simplified Employee Pension (or SEP),
which has been around for several years. SEPs haven't been as
popular with small businesses because unlike 401(k)s and Simple
IRAs where the employee makes all or most of the contribution SEPs
are fully paid for by the employer. Up to 15 percent of the
employees' full compensation may be deferred using an SEP.
</P>
<P>
   Motive Communications Inc., a young, fast-growing software
company with 32 employees, recently set up a 401(k). Its plan
offers employees 12 funds for investments, ranging from bond funds
to small cap, international, government securities and money market
funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it is a good benefit to offer the employees,'' says
Linda Hamann, director of finance for Motive. ``It's really one of
the few ways for employees to shelter part of their income from
federal income taxes and allow it to grow tax-free for
retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-four percent of Motive's employees have signed up so far.
It cost Motive about $1,000 to set up, and ongoing administrative
fees are based on employee participation and the type of plan
selected. Motive is not yet matching employee contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Hamann estimates that once the 401(k) program was set up, it
takes an extra hour each pay period, when the money is withheld
from employees' paychecks. One of the main attractions of 401(k)
plans is the money is withheld by the employer and immediately sent
to be invested _ making it easier for employees to save and invest.
</P>
<P>
   In the highly competitive high-tech world such plans have become
a common perk even among smaller companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's just viewed as one of those things as soon as you
can do it, you do it,'' Hamann says.

 &HT;    Texas prison officials poised to approve construction of 2,000
more cells
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Confronted by a shortage of high-security cells,
Texas prison officials are ready to spend nearly $100 million to
build 2,000 more cells to house disruptive convicts and prison gang
members who have ``earned'' their way into solitary confinement.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Polunsky, chairman of the prison system's governing board,
said the additional ``Super Max'' cells will allow officials to
isolate gang members who have become increasingly disruptive in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is definitely the plan,'' Polunsky said. ``If I had my
druthers, we would be building even more of these units. These are
not your normal gang punks that spray paint graffiti on expressway
overpasses. They are vicious killers, organized criminals, who have
no respect for life _ theirs or anyone else's.''
</P>
<P>
   Convicts in Super Max cells spend 23 hours a day locked up. They
leave the cells only for an hour of recreation by themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``By their behavior, they have earned the right to be housed in
this type of unit,'' Polunsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Scott, executive director of the Texas Department of
Criminal Justice, said the system's 8,000
administrative-segregation cells _ where gang members and other
violent or incorrigible convicts are held _ reached capacity
several days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, 120 additional cells at various prisons have been
temporarily designated as segregation cells to handle the growing
overflow. But Scott said that is not a long-term solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our administrative-segregation is built to house the kind of
inmates that we have there,'' he said, ``and these other beds are
not.''
</P>
<P>
   About 5,000 of the 8,000 administrative-segregation beds hold
confirmed prison gang members, officials have said previously.
Under current rules, gang members are isolated to thwart
communication with other gang members and to prevent gangs from
congregating and victimizing other convicts.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' prison system holds about 143,000 convicts.
</P>
<P>
   Approval of three additional high-security units _ at a cost of
about $32 million each _ is expected to come Friday at a meeting in
Dallas of the nine-member Texas Board of Criminal Justice. The
board last month approved construction of a fourth high-security
prison, which, like the others, should be completed in about two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Housing 660 convicts each in single cells, the new units are to
be built alongside existing prisons in Amarillo; Iowa Park, near
Wichita Falls; Woodville, southeast of Lufkin in East Texas; and
Lamesa, south of Lubbock.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Sailer, director of construction for the prison system,
said the cost of the high-security units is about $54,000 a bed.
Less secure cells, for two convicts, constructed in recent years
cost about $26,000 each. But Scott and other prison officials said
the new units are well worth the expense _ featuring
computer-controlled doors and mechanical systems that improve
security and lessen the risk of injury to guards and convicts.
</P>
<P>
   Polunsky said the completion of the new units will give the
prison system more flexibility in dealing with gang members and
other convicts who need to be isolated from the general population.
</P>
<P>
   ``The individuals who inhabit these cells have worked their way
to those cells . . . because they have been unable to adapt to the
regimen of prison life in the general population,'' Polunsky said.
``As the population of the system continues to harden, and with the
phenomenon of the prison gangs, we are going to need more of these
types of beds.''

APPLE'S IMAC _ THE NEW VW BEETLE OF COMPUTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID EINSTEIN   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most tech stocks took a tumble yesterday, but not Apple
Computer. The Cupertino company blithely ignored the market's
sell-off, gaining $1.06 to close at a 52-week high of $39.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Steve Jobs, Apple's interim CEO for life, is onto
something with the $1,299 iMac, which ships this Saturday. He's hit
a chord just as he did in 1984, when the first Macintosh captured
the public's imagination.
</P>
<P>
   The curious thing is that he's doing it without a technological
breakthrough like the graphical interface that the original Mac
introduced to the world. In fact, the iMac is basically just a Mac
honed by improvements you'd expect after 18 years, with a built-in
monitor and a seductive translucent case that would look right at
home in Tomorrowland.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac appeals to the average person, who is basically
befuddled by technology and just wants a computer that's easy to
use. Forget the megahertzes and the gigabytes, just get me on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the market right now is ripe for a machine like the
iMac. With entry-level PC prices well below $1,000, computers have
entered the realm of commodity appliances such as televisions and
stereos.
</P>
<P>
   Does anybody care how many watts a stereo amplifier has? Or how
many lines of resolution there are on a TV? No. You just plug the
things in and enjoy them.
</P>
<P>
   Apple is lucky in a way. It can't compete on price/performance
with the Compaqs and Dells of the world. But it doesn't have to.
Nobody needs a 400 MHz Pentium II or an 8 gig hard drive. The
technology inside the iMac is more than adequate for almost
anything a normal person would do with a computer, including word
processing, desktop publishing or, most importantly, getting
online.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Internet seems to have become the driving motivation
for purchases of new computers. And if what you really want is to
surf the Web and do e-mail, the iMac is a match for any PC, no
matter how powerful.
</P>
<P>
   The new Apple is a little ahead of its time, equipped as it is
only with USB ports for connecting printers, scanners and such. It
probably won't be until late this year that USB-compatible devices
start hitting the market en masse. Meanwhile, a few scanners, mice,
keyboards and modems are available with USB connectors.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, however, all PC-makers will convert to USB, phasing
out serial and parallel ports that have confused consumers for a
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs' decision not to put a floppy disk drive in the iMac also
shows his predisposition toward future-tech. As recordable CD-ROM
drives and DVDs catch on, floppies probably will go the way of the
dinosaur. Still, it would have cost Apple just a few bucks to put a
floppy drive in the iMac and give users a convenient way to back up
and exchange data.
</P>
<P>
   From the advance rumblings, it seems certain that iMacs will be
gobbled up by Apple users who can't afford the faster, more
expensive G3 Macs. The big question is, will the new computer also
appeal to first-time PC buyers who might otherwise go for a cheap
Compaq or HP machine?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it might. One gets the feeling that other PC-makers
consider entry-level systems as step-children that cower in the
shadow of the high-end, $2,500 screamers. Apple, on other hand, has
imbued the iMac with a hip personality all its own.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does it hurt that the iMac comes along at a time when
Americans are happily embracing post-modernistic designs. If
Volkswagen can sell a truckload of the revivified Beetle, Apple
should find a wide market for the iMac.

LYCOS PURCHASE AIMED AT INTERNET GATEWAY STATUS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lycos Inc., long regarded as a laggard in the race to become a
gateway to the Internet, hopes to leap to the head of the pack with
a $133 million purchase of WhoWhere Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Lycos chief executive Robert Davis said the deal,
announced Tuesday, will help his firm become not only a doorway to
the Internet, but a major destination in its own right.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos, of Waltham, Mass., will pay about 2 million shares ofits
stock for WhoWhere, a closely-held Mountain View, Calif., firm that
owns the popular WhoWhere Internet white pages service as well as
MailCity, a free electronic mail system and Angelfire, a free Web
page hosting service.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos is one of several firms building Internet ``portals'', or
Web sites that attract millions of visitors. While visitors aren't
charged for using the portal, advertisers and Internet retailers
pay millions of dollars to have their ads and electronic
storefronts on portal sites. The leading portals are run by the
America Online computer network and by the Internet search service
Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts us in a credible position to say we're challenging for
the No. 1spot in this space,'' said Davis, of the WhoWhere
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Portals generally offer popular services like Web page searches,
news headlines and free e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of Lycos'expansion plan is Angelfire, where
visitors can build their own Web site at no charge. Angelfire
presently has 1.3 million users, many of whom are adolescents or
adults over 40. That makes the company a good fit with Tripod, a
free Web site service that Lycos purchased earlier this year.
Tripod's 1.8 million members are mainly teens and young adults.
</P>
<P>
   Both Angelfire and Tripod attract users who spend hours on-line
designing their Web sites and visiting other sites created by
members with similar interests. Lycos will thus be able to deliver
an audience of millions to Internet advertisers, in much the same
way television delivers millions of viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The other parts of the WhoWhere acquisition are also supposed to
feed into this strategy. WhoWhere itself attracts thousands of
users trying to look up people's e-mail addresses and phone
numbers. MailCity has 9.3 million registered users.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Delhagen, an Internet analyst for Forrester Research in
Cambridge, said that Lycos is doing a good job of establishing
itself as a major presence on the Internet. ``They've grabbed yet
another big community,'' said Delhagen. ``This gives them yet one
more opportunity to generate revenue for all those commerce
partners.''

LYCOS ADDS WHOWHERE WEB DIRECTORY  
 BY JON SWARTZ  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Upping the ante in an increasingly crowded Internet portal
market, Lycos Inc. yesterday said it will snap up Mountain
View-based online directory WhoWhere Inc. for $133 million in
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outmaneuvered, rival Infoseek laid out $17 million in
company shares for Quando Inc., a maker of ``virtual databases''
allowing Net surfers to comparison shop.
</P>
<P>
   The buyouts are the latest machinations among online and
mainstream media companies vying to create so-called portal sites.
</P>
<P>
   They believe the all-in-one sites _ which are crammed with
e-mail, chat rooms, e-commerce features, breaking news and search
engines _ are the most efficient way to hook Web users and generate
advertising revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any serious Web site needs to offer services that make
people's lives easier for basic activities like communications and
shopping,'' Infoseek CEO Harry Motro said. ``If you don't, you
won't be around long.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a land grab,'' said Jan Horsfall, Lycos vice president of
marketing. ``You have to add as much distinct content as you
possibly can to differentiate your (portal).''
</P>
<P>
   Internet insiders said the more significant deal is Lycos'
acquisition of WhoWhere, a provider of e-mail and home-age
technology, yellow-page and white-page listings, classified ads and
other information on the Web. The company's MailCity e-mail service
has 9.3 million registered users.
</P>
<P>
   Observers consider the acquisition significant to the fortunes
of 3-year-old Lycos in the portal wars because it is trailing
Infoseek, Yahoo, Excite, AOL and Netscape in both viewership and ad
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are comparing the portal market to the television
industry, where only five or seven major networks will survive,''
said Abhishek Gami of William Blair &AMP; Co. LLC in Chicago, who
recommends Lycos stock. ``In the process, every independent company
will be bought out by one of the big boys. This is an extremely
rough space to compete in.''
</P>
<P>
   Gami noted that of the 15 most popular Internet sites listed by
online pollster Media Metrix, Lycos is among the smallest.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos, like Amazon.com and other Internet companies, has been
using its stock to buy companies since its shares more than tripled
in the past year. Lycos closed at $63.56 yesterday, down $4.38.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Waltham, Mass., company purchased Tripod
Inc., a free home-page service, and WiseWire Corp., whose software
allows Internet users to make customized searches.
</P>
<P>
   WhoWhere, which is backed by the Rockefeller family's venture
capital arm VenRock, will operate as the West Coast division of
Lycos.

ADOBE WARNS OF POSSIBLE LOSS IN 3RD QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Adobe Systems Inc. warned Tuesday that its
third-quarter revenue would fall below analysts' expectations,
resulting in a potential loss. Adobe also announced the departure
of three senior executives and a reduction of 240 to 300 jobs, or
13 percent of its work force.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Adobe fell $1.375, to $30.8125, on Nasdaq before
trading was halted for the company's announcement late in the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe, based in San Jose, Calif., is a leading maker of software
programs used in publishing, including Photoshop, Illustrator,
Pagemaker and the Postscript language used in printers. Although
Adobe has modified many of its programs to take advantage of the
Internet, and many are used to create Web sites, analysts said the
company had run into difficulty exploiting the transition to
electronic publishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adobe is a tremendously successful company in the print world,
but they haven't really figured out the right products and strategy
for making money and being successful on the Web,'' said
Christopher Galvin, an analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe also said in its announcement Tuesday that business
continued to be hurt by Japan's recession. The company said that
cost-cutting efforts, including the reduction of jobs, would lower
expenses by as much as $60 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The company said revenue for the quarter that will end Aug. 28
was likely to be $220 million to $225 million, compared with $230
million in the quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   After a one-time reorganization charge and other nonrecurring
expenses, Adobe said, net income may break even or be a loss,
compared with net income of $53.4 million in the quarter a year
earlier. Analysts had expected Adobe to earn 52 cents a diluted
share, according to First Call, which tracks company earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe also said Tuesday that three top executives, P. Jackson
Bell, executive vice president and chief administrative officer;
Robert Roblin, executive vice president for marketing, and Ross
Bott, executive vice president for product divisions, had resigned.

Humane Society wants microchips implanted in animals 
By Kelly Simmons  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A microchip identification program at the Cobb County,
Ga. animal shelter has proved so successful that the Humane Society
is asking county commissioners to institute a policy requiring the
chips for all animals that pass through the shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Several counties have voluntary microchip programs at animal
shelters. Cobb would be the first county in metro Atlanta to
require people who adopt or retrieve pets to have the
identification chips implanted in the animals, said Joy Evilsizor,
general manager of the Cobb Humane Society.
</P>
<P>
   Since launching its pilot microchip program in February,
Evilsizor said the shelter staff already had identified 10 to 15
animals a month using a universal scanner that reads the chips.
Instead of being held in shelter cages, the animals were quickly
returned to their owners, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really works,'' Evilsizor said. ``It's a long-term
potential solution.''
</P>
<P>
   This is how it works: Tiny chips, each coded with a number, are
implanted in the back of an animal's neck. A handheld scanner
deciphers the code, which is fed into a computer. The computer
reveals the animal's owner and contact information. Of the three
companies that manufacture the microchips, the Humane Society is
recommending Cobb use AVID, which has a universal scanner that
identifies all three brands of chips.
</P>
<P>
   The chips would cost pet owners $15, which would be added to pet
adoption fees. Owners retrieving lost or stray pets also would be
charged for the chip. Evilsizor said the program would pay for
itself, and perhaps even generate revenue for the shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioners agreed to consider the policy. ``It's a good
concept,'' commissioner Joe Thompson said. ``Part of the new
technology.''

JUDGE RULES GATES MUST GIVE DEPOSITION IN PUBLIC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal judge ordered Tuesday that the government's pretrial
questioning of Bill Gates and other executives of Microsoft Corp.
must be opened up to news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruling giving the press and the public access to
depositions in a major antitrust case is somewhat unusual, but it
is not unprecedented. One similar instance came during the Justice
Department's 13-year pursuit of IBM, a case that the government
dropped in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   A deposition from Gates, chairman and chief executive of
Microsoft, had been scheduled to begin Wednesday, but it was
postponed temporarily as the company's lawyers decided whether to
appeal the judge's order.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of U.S. District
Court in Washington applies not only to depositions of Gates but
also to those of 16 other Microsoft employees. The Justice
Department and 20 states have charged Microsoft with illegally
protecting its monopoly in operating systems for personal computers
and trying to extend its monopoly into the new Internet software
and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft spokesman said the company was ``very concerned
about the possible impact of the ruling on our trial preparation
and on the trial moving ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial is scheduled to begin on Sept. 8 in U.S. District
Court in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, the company spokesman said, wants to insure that its
trade secrets and confidential business information are protected
during the deposition process. Until a procedure for assuring
confidentiality and the logistics for giving reporters access can
be resolved, ``all depositions are stopped,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's ruling came in response to a motion filed by The New
York Times, The Seattle Times and the cable-television and online
news units of Ziff-Davis, a computer trade publisher. Their filing
was joined by two news services, Reuters and Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   The motion to open up pretrial depositions was made under a
provision of the nation's antitrust laws. The law states that in
civil antitrust actions brought by the federal government, the
taking of depositions ``shall be open to the public as freely as
are trials in open court, and no order excluding the public from
attendance on any such proceedings shall be valid or enforceable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Publicity in Taking of Evidence Act was passed in 1913 as
public concern about the power of industrial monopolies was at its
peak. The law was enacted, legal scholars say, to insure that the
market practices of the industrial trusts were scrutinized in
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an unusually clear and powerful statute,'' said Adam
Liptak, a lawyer for The New York Times. ``In antitrust cases
brought by the government, the presumption of public access is
almost absolute.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, Liptak said, The Times favors open court
proceedings, and the Microsoft case, in particular, is one of
considerable public interest.
</P>
<P>
   In the Microsoft case, Jackson had approved a protective order
in May limiting public access to confidential business information
gathered by the government and Microsoft during pretrial discovery.
</P>
<P>
   But in Tuesday's ruling, he said that the 1913 evidence act did
allow the press and the public access to the depositions. And he
instructed Microsoft, the news organizations and the government and
the states to figure out a procedure that would open the taking of
depositions but would also prevent ``unnecessary disclosure of
trade secrets and other confidential information.''

 Sun Refutes Idea of Eclipse By Microsoft  
 By David Einstein   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems as if a lot of people don't buy the idea _ posed in a
Chronicle article last month _ that Sun Microsystems faces a
serious threat from Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   No way, say Sun officials. Not only do they believe that they're
well-positioned to repel any attack from Microsoft, they think that
as corporate computing relies increasingly on the Internet, Sun,
with its powerful computer servers and Java programming language,
will be the company to beat.
</P>
<P>
   Sun sees no disadvantage in the fact that its computers use
Sun's own chips and operating system rather than the ``industry
standard'' combination of Windows NT and Intel Pentiums. In fact,
the Mountain View company boasts that its Unix operating system,
called Solaris, is faster and far more reliable than Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft wants Windows NT to be the operating system of choice
everywhere inside a big company _ running Intel-based servers in
workgroups, departments and even entire networks. In other words,
it is targeting Sun's main markets.
</P>
<P>
   Windows NT 4.0 has been a stunning success in department and
workgroup situations. But it doesn't work reliably on high-end
servers. Microsoft hopes to conquer the enterprise market with
Windows NT 5.0, which it plans to ship sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
   However, Forrester Research has predicted that the software
giant will be disappointed. The Year 2000 problem and fear of bugs
in the new Windows NT will slow adoption of the software through
2001, a report by Forrester read.
</P>
<P>
   ``By then, NT's enterprise aspirations will be usurped by the
rise of Internet Computing and a new competitive landscape,'' the
report stated.
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, Sun could be in great shape. Analyst Daniel
Kunstler of J.P. Morgan, a staunch Sun booster, said that if Sun
continues the momentum that has brought it three-straight quarters
of record earnings, it could amass an installed customer base that
will make it impervious even to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Sun thinks it's hurting Microsoft more than the other
way around. It believes that its low-end servers are competing well
against powerful PCs armed with Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Sun says a number of big companies including
Fujitsu, Siemens-Nixdorf, Toshiba and NCR have agreed to use an
Intel-based version of Solaris as the operating system for their PC
networks _ dealing a blow to Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   Sun also appears to be having a jolly good time jousting with
IBM and Hewlett-Packard, its main rivals in the Unix market.
According to International Data Corp., Sun shipped more Unix
servers last year than anyone, passing both IBM and HP, which had
been tied for first the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Sun topped the market in both the entry market (systems priced
under $100,000) and the midrange market (systems from $100,000 to
$1 million).
</P>
<P>
   And in its first year selling high-end servers ($1 million and
up), Sun ranked third in shipments, outpacing Silicon Graphics,
which was fourth, and IBM, which was fifth. Sun's Enterprise 10000
server, also known as Starfire, took the market by storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sun has made incredible strides in enterprise computing over
the past few years and really caught competitors by surprise in
1997,'' said Jay Bretzmann, vice president of worldwide systems at
IDC. He said Sun is likely to maintain the momentum this year ``and

   You've gotten your Whopper meal for lunch at the Burger King at
182 Broadway in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   What's next?
</P>
<P>
   Let's see ... napkins, straw, salt packet, mustard, e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. E-mail.
</P>
<P>
   It's available at the world's first Internet-enabled Burger King
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Nestled near New York's financial district in lower Manhattan,
the fast-food joint lets its customers not only hoard the
condiments and cardboard crowns but also access any of the 20
high-speed Internet stations ... by king-sizing your Value Meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers are sending and receiving e-mail, checking their
stocks and financial news, looking for apartments and jobs,
obtaining travel information, joining chat groups and playing
various interactive games,'' Peter Allen Abramson, Burger King
franchisee, said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes dining, particularly alone, more enjoyable.''
</P>
<P>
   Abramson's customers _ some tourists, some residential, but
mostly from nearby Wall Street _ are allowed 20 minutes to navigate
the Web from high-speed T-1 connections. A two-minute-warning
message appears on the monitor when Internet access is about to be
terminated. Filtering technology prevents access to inappropriate
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Abramson said the concept for the restaurant ``just came in my
head one day.'' The location of his business, which has stiff
competition from other fast-food restaurants, meant he had to have
a niche; ``I had to get something to differentiate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What are the chances of Burger King starting a cybercafe
elsewhere?
</P>
<P>
   Abramson answers in his news release: ``I will make my
technology available to other franchisees. It is a concept I want
to share with the entire Burger King system.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's will probably answer the challenge with something
called Power Big Macs or McInternet.

   NETTING THE BIKERS
</P>
<P>
   If you can't be one of the 250,000 who are expected to make it
to the Sturgis Rally bike party in Sturgis, S.D., this week, don't
sweat it.
</P>
<P>
   Boot down the kickstand on your hog and then boot up
SturgisLive.com (www.sturgislive.com).
</P>
<P>
   This year, biker enthusiasts can check the event's official site
for live images, event photos, event history, the Chew the Fat chat
room, an online store and archived concerts.
</P>
<P>
   Sturgis Rally and Race, sponsor of the site, plans to post
edited highlights of the rally on its final two days, Saturday and
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU DIG TEXAS
</P>
<P>
   The Texas State Library and Archives Commission has found a way
for those interested in state history to get a closer look at
fragile artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's Texas Treasures site
(www.tsl.state.tx.us/lobby/treasures) features digitally scanned
images of resources from the State Archives' holdings.
</P>
<P>
   The artifacts include William B. Travis' letter from the Alamo;
county-by-county vote totals from the 1845 Texas referendum on
annexation; and a collection of flags from the Texas Revolution and
Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   State archivist Christopher LaPlante said the site will remain a
work in progress. ``We've just begun to scratch the surface,'' he
said. _ Tommy Cummings, (817) 390-7397 dragon\Nstar-telegram.com

SIX FLAGS SITE IS QUITE A RIDE

<P>
   Alan Reynolds of Austin had a dream. It might not have been a
noble civil rights dream, but it was a dream nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke up with the feeling that it was very important that I
put a site \R(www.jump.net/\Palanr)\S together that would help
former employees of Six Flags Over Texas find each other,''
Reynolds said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason unknown to me, I have dreams of returning to
work at Six Flags.''
</P>
<P>
   GIven the raging heat that has enveloped Texas this summer, that
dream sounds more like a nightmare, but Reynolds is passionate
about the amusement park he worked for more than 20 years ago. His
Six Flags Over Texas Employee Contact Page is a log ride down
memory lane for those who have visited the Arlington park, and
especially for those who have worked there.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds has collected old pictures of the park, employee
stories, trivia, gone-but-not-forgotten rides and attraction pages,
old park maps and trip reports. He also includes a petition calling
on park officials to bring back the eerie but popular Spee-Lunkers,
who were replaced by Warner Bros. characters at the park's cave
ride.
</P>
<P>
   Writes one petitioner: ``We all want \Rthe Spee-Lunkers back\S
... the Looney Tunes characters scare me worse than they did.''
</P>
<P>
   NASA's Earth and space science site (observe.ivv.nasa.gov) is
taking a look at impact craters and tsunamis in articles coinciding
with this summer's disaster movies, ``Armageddon'' and ``Deep
Impact.'' In a news release, NASA is promoting two online articles
about the possible aftereffects of a celestial collision.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't been to the doctor in a while, you might find
MSNBC's new health area (www.msnbc.com) worth a visit. The site's
``Virtual Checkup'' is a series of quizzes to help you decide
whether you're at risk for various disorders. Articles include an
``Interactive Calculator,'' which gives users an estimate on how
long they will live given their current health, habits and
lifestyle. _ Tommy Cummings, (817) 390-7397

AMAZON.COM DEAL FOR PLANETALL MADE AT ST. PETER'S GATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Successful high-tech companies are supposed to start in
somebody's garage. But when a team of entrepreneurs began an
Internet business designed to bring people closer together, they
settled on a more congenial site: the rented back office of St.
Peter's Episcopal church in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, PlanetAll Inc. has been touched by an angel.
</P>
<P>
   In a deal announced Tuesday, the company will be acquired by the
leading Internet bookseller, Amazon.com, for $87.9 million in
Amazon stock. Amazon also said Tuesday it would spend $176 million
in stock to buy Junglee Corp., a Sunnyvale, Calif., maker of
software that helps consumers do their shopping on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos rejected suggestions that he's
trying to turn his on-line store into an all-purpose ``portal''
site like Yahoo, which offers e-mail, news, and many other
features. Instead, he said, Amazon is focusing on becoming the
Internet's most important retail site. He hopes to use the
PlanetAll technology to create a community of regular customers.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street approves of the strategy. Amazon stock closed up 1
5/8 at 109 7/8 on the Nasdaq stock exchange amid a sharp decline in
stocks overall.
</P>
<P>
   Privately held PlanetAll is a one of several major Internet
sites devoted to the creation of on-line communities. The idea is
to offer a place where people with similar interests and life
experiences can easily find each other and stay in touch.
</P>
<P>
   But chief executive Jim Savage says that PlanetAll is different
from rivals community-builders like Tripod and GeoCities. ``Tripod
and the Web communities are about people who don't know each other
in the real world but share a common interest,'' said Savage.
``What we focus on is people who know each other in the real
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Bezos called the PlanetAll system ``one of the most innovative
things I've seen on line, period.'' He said that Amazon is eager to
use PlanetAll's system to improve the on-line shopping experience
for Amazon customers.
</P>
<P>
   Presently, 1.5 million people have signed up for the free
PlanetAll service. They're divided into 80,000 affinity groups,
built around common experiences. Many members use the service to
keep tabs on former college classmates or colleagues in previous
jobs. Others join up to discuss hobbies and interests. Savage
noted, ``There's over 85 book clubs on PlanetAll.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon will now have an inside track in efforts to market books,
music recordings, and other products to these and other PlanetAll
members. Already, a link to Amazon has appeared on the PlanetAll
home page.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more to come. For instance, PlanetAll offers a
service that automatically sends e-mail to members to remind them
of a friend's birthday. These messages could soon contain a guide
to possible gifts available through Amazon
</P>
<P>
   .com.
</P>
<P>
   ``We literally have a whiteboard full of ideas that we're
talking about,'' said Savage.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for PlanetAll came to co-founder Warren Adams not long
after he graduated from Colgate University in 1988. He wished there
was some way he could keep in touch with classmates. By the time he
graduated from Harvard Business School in 1995, he knew there was a
way _ the Internet. Adams teamed up with Brian Robertson, a
Massachusetts Institute of Technology computer science graduate, to
create PlanetAll in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   PlanetAll members create a personal profile with as much
personal information as he or she wants to reveal. PlanetAll
pledges that none of the information will be sold to other firms or
used for its own marketing purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The member can then check out the thousands of PlanetAll
affinity groups to find one or more suitable hangouts. Many
fraternities and professional organizations have Planet-All
listings. For instance, a member of the National Society of Black
Engineers can keep up with the activities of other members.
</P>
<P>
   Another powerful feature of the site allows users to store their
daily schedule information and their personal address book on
PlanetAll. A user with a thousand names in his Rolodex can get
access to this information anywhere in the world, as long as he has
access to the Internet. The address book is compatible with many
popular management software packages like Microsoft Outlook and can
also receive data from 3Com's Palm Pilot personal information
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the power of PlanetAll increases as more Internet
users sign up for the service. Savage's dream is a world in which
everyone on line has a PlanetAll membership. ``This works a lot
better if everybody's in it,'' Savage said. ``You have to think
big.''
</P>
<P>
   The Amazon deal means a big payday for a number of individuals
and firms. PlanetAll employees own 17 percent of the company.
Another 25 percent belongs to CMG Information Services Inc. in
Andover, Mass., a firm that holds investments in a number of
leading Internet companies. An additional 10 percent of PlanetAll
is owned by Lycos Inc., the popular Internet search service based
in Waltham, Mass. CMG, in turn, owns 30 percent of Lycos, which
Tuesday agreed to buy Sunnyvale, Calif.-based GuestWorld for stock
worth $3.9 million. GuestWorld offers a ``guestbook'' service that
lets people post their comments about Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Despite PlanetAll's new ownership, Adams, Robertson, and Savage
will stay on to run the company. And don't expect to see PlanetAll
head west to Amazon's headquarters of Seattle. The firm will keep
on paying rent to the Episcopal church. No sense tempting
providence.

<TEXT>
<P>
   On April 6, 1994, Bill Gates summoned 20 employees of Microsoft
Corp. to a daylong retreat. The gathering included senior
executives and a small group of younger workers who had become
convinced that the Internet would revolutionize the computer
software business.
</P>
<P>
   Gates left no doubt that he agreed with the young evangelists,
even though the Internet was not yet a household term or an
industry. One person who attended the meeting recalled the
Microsoft chairman saying, ``We're going to make a big bet on the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   In its sweeping antitrust suit against Microsoft, the Justice
Department contends that the company's aggressive tactics in
opening its deep pockets and wielding its market muscle in the
Internet software business were intended to protect and expand its
monopoly _ by crushing a new challenger, Netscape Communications
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   But in a detailed reply to the government's suit, which must be
filed in federal court no later than Monday, Microsoft will argue
that the 1994 retreat, as well as other Microsoft discussions and
documents dating to late 1993, show that the company's Internet
plans were under way before Netscape rose to challenge Microsoft.
The retreat occurred just two days after the founding of Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft allows that its tactics did eventually hurt Netscape,
but says that was a byproduct of its main intent, which was to
improve its products and benefit consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Few concrete plans were set that day in April 1994 at the
Shumway Mansion, a three-story private residence near Seattle, in
Kirkland, Wash., that had been converted to a conference center.
</P>
<P>
   But several participants say there was agreement on one
strategy: that the Windows operating system, Microsoft's mainstay
product, should have built-in access to the Internet. The concept,
which was then still vague, was referred to variously as an
Internet viewer, interface or browser.
</P>
<P>
   ``People walked away from that April 6 meeting knowing in broad
terms what they had to do,'' recalled J. Allard, who is now general
manager of Microsoft's Internet and data-access unit but then was
the program manager for Internet activities.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, on April 7, 1994, Gates told a group of corporate
executives in Chicago that Microsoft planned to build Internet
access into the next generation of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   It was at the Kirkland gathering, Microsoft says, that it became
a matter of corporate policy to put Internet browsing technology
into Windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Justice Department can't be right,'' a senior member of
Microsoft's legal team said this week. ``Netscape wasn't even on
anybody's radar screen back then.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's case, to be sure, does not rest solely on
Microsoft's intentions toward Netscape. The Justice Department says
that Microsoft engaged in a series of illegal practices, including
contracts with personal-computer makers and others that were meant
to thwart competition, and it accuses the company of eventually
trying to persuade Netscape to divide up the market for Internet
browsers _ all of which Microsoft denies.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Justice Department official said this week that
evidence in the government's case showed a pattern of
anti-competitive behavior by a company that was ``simply hellbent
on driving a competitor out of the market.'' Microsoft's defense,
he says, is a ``grand exercise in revisionist history.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's accusation that Microsoft's Internet software
plans were designed not to improve its products or to benefit
consumers but to destroy Netscape provides the context for the
case, a context that seeks to explain Microsoft's actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intent is relevant because it provides a road map for the
court to follow,'' said Stephen Axinn, a leading antitrust
litigator in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In court, Microsoft will argue that the Justice Department's
road map is distorted. And interviews with current and former
Microsoft executives and business partners, plus internal documents
from 1993 and 1994, suggest that the company will at least be able
to cast doubt on the government's evidence of intent.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 7, 1993, for example, nearly two years before Microsoft
introduced its Windows 95 operating system, Steven Ballmer, the
company's second in command, sent an e-mail message to his
lieutenants after he had visited Harvard College and observed the
students' use of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Windows 95 was code-named ``Chicago.'' Microsoft,
Ballmer wrote, could ``really help popularize Chicago if we could
say that Chicago is the greatest front-end to the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Brad Silverberg, head of the Windows 95 product
group, replied to Ballmer, ``I see a big opportunity here: Windows
as the gateway to the information highway.''
</P>
<P>
   But the most informed thinking about the Internet was being done
further down in the Microsoft ranks. On Jan. 25, 1994, Allard, who
was then 25, wrote a 16-page memorandum titled ``Windows: The Next
Killer Application on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   In the memo Allard wrote, ``The Internet provides an incredible
opportunity for Microsoft to effectively explore large-scale
networks from many levels: customer needs, technical challenges,
quality-of-service issues, electronic commerce and
information-browsing technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   Allard's memo, which was widely circulated within Microsoft,
also said the company should make putting Internet software into
Windows 95 a priority. ``When the next generation of Windows
includes support for standard Internet protocols, the Internet
becomes a natural extension of the Windows end-user experience, and
the favored way to explore.''
</P>
<P>
   Allard emphasized that he was not talking only about putting
internal Internet software in its operating system. Rather, he
wrote, ``Windows becomes the global infostructure explorer.''
</P>
<P>
   A day later, on Jan. 26, 1994, David Pollon, a young product
manager, distributed an 11-page memo titled ``Microsoft and the
Internet: Strategic Direction.'' In it he said that a key goal for
the company was to ``be an innovator in providing the
easiest-to-use Internet interfaces.'' The interface he described
was a primitive concept of a browser, which he argued Microsoft
should make part of its Windows operating system. ``PC users,'' he
wrote, ``will adopt Windows as their easy-to-use interface to the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Netscape had not yet been founded and thus was not mentioned in
either of these e-mail memos. But other rivals were mentioned,
including Sun Microsystems and other companies whose hub computers,
or servers, ran on the rival Unix operating system _ the technology
on which Internet pioneers had built its infrastructure and the
favored platform for developing Internet software.

</P>
<P>
   Today, many of Microsoft's rivals fear that it is using its
market power to take over the lucrative market for software that
runs on Internet servers, the powerful computers that individual
users tap into from their desktops to send and receive e-mail, view
World Wide Web pages, transfer files and download audio or video
programming.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's industrial-strength operating system for this market
is Windows NT. Microsoft's practices to increase the use of Windows
NT are not part of the government's antitrust case, but the Justice
Department is investigating them.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in January 1994, based on Pollon's memo, the Windows NT
strategy for the Internet was already taking shape. Among the goals
he recommended was ``supplanting Unix with Windows NT as the
dominant back-end platform for Internet services.''
</P>
<P>
   In the antitrust case, Microsoft is expected to argue that it
certainly did use every means _ every legal means, the company says
_ at its disposal to try to defeat Netscape, the early leader and
its main rival in the browser market.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft will also argue that its powerful push into the
Internet software market _ especially incorporating the Internet
Explorer browser in the operating system _ also made it easier and
less costly for many millions of customers who use Windows-based
personal computers to participate in the global computer network.
</P>
<P>
   And the nation's antitrust laws, Microsoft's lawyers say, are
intended mainly to protect consumers from practices like price
gouging rather than to protect competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The senior Justice Department official says, however, that
Microsoft's version of events ignores some significant details. For
example, he notes that Microsoft did not license the core browser
technology around which it built Internet Explorer until December
1994, eight months after Netscape was founded.
</P>
<P>
   To hasten its entry into the browser market, Microsoft licensed
its early browsing software from Spyglass Inc. of Naperville, Ill.
The first meeting between the two companies was in April 1994,
recalled Douglas Colbeth, the president of Spyglass. In subsequent
meetings later that year, Colbeth said it was becoming clear that
Microsoft felt a sense of urgency about Internet software.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape achieved celebrity more than a year later, in August
1995, when it went public and many of its employees became instant
millionaires thanks to Wall Street's discovery of the Internet. But
within the software industry, Netscape had become known as a hot
start-up in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the attention Netscape was getting clearly prodded
Microsoft and accelerated its timing for some steps, like its
announcement in 1995 that it would give away its browser,'' Colbeth
said. ``But from our earliest discussions with Microsoft, the
message was loud and clear that the browsing functionality was
going to be put into the Windows operating system.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Whenever you license technology to Microsoft, you
have to understand that they may well do it themselves and drop it
into the operating system. That's Microsoft's business model,
expanding Windows.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the legal outcome, the way Microsoft awakened to
the opportunity and threat of the Internet is a textbook case of
the way the company works. A small group of Internet enthusiasts,
mainly in their 20s, got the attention of Microsoft's top
management including Gates.
</P>
<P>
   It helped that one of those young enthusiasts was Steven
Sinofsky, who at the time was a technical assistant to Gates, a job
that Sinofsky described as ``largely just being an extra set of
eyes and ears to learn about the newest, latest technology and
bring it back to Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinofsky had read Allard's January 1994 memo ``Windows: The Next
Killer Application on the Internet.'' And the two soon got
together. ``It was clear he had already figured this thing out,''
Sinofsky recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Sinofsky and Allard arranged the one-day brainstorming retreat
in April 1994, including handing out a 3-inch-thick pile of advance
reading for every participant, a hefty selection of
Internet-related writings. Much of the discussion focused on how
Microsoft might make money off the Internet and what might be the
big money-making product, or ``killer app,'' in the industry's
shorthand.
</P>
<P>
   Allard's formulation, then and now, was simple _ both a
distillation of Microsoft's overarching strategy and a business
practice that sends shivers of fear through its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no killer app,'' Allard said this week. ``It's just
Windows.''

MICROSOFT TOOTS ITS OWN HORN  
 BY JON SWARTZ  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A key foundation of Microsoft Corp.'s defense in the pending
antitrust case against it may have some cracks.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department contends that Microsoft used its
market-leading Windows software to promote its Internet Explorer
Web browser _ giving it an unfair edge over a rival browser from
Netscape Communications. Microsoft's browser has vaulted from a 20
percent market share in January 1997 to more than 40 percent
currently. But the company insists that Explorer succeeded on its
own merits.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence, Microsoft chief executive Bill Gates has maintained
_ both in a U.S. Senate hearing in March and a recent Economist
article _ that Internet Explorer ``has won 19 out of 20
head-to-head reviews against Netscape's, which is why we have seen
more and more consumers using it.''
</P>
<P>
   The argument is part of a multipronged legal strategy. The
software giant also asserts that its Internet plans were well under
way before Netscape was founded, and that a federal appeals court
in June ruled that Microsoft has the right to include separate
products such as IE 4.0 in the Windows operating system. In
addition, Microsoft vehemently denies Justice Department charges
that it bullied Internet service providers and computer-makers into
distributing its browser exclusively.
</P>
<P>
   A trial is set for September 8.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft's claims of technical superiority are debatable,
contend critics who say Microsoft is stacking the deck. An
evaluation of the ``20 head-to-head reviews'' _ which appeared in
both computer magazines and mainstream newspapers _ cited by
Microsoft reveals less-than-ringing endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   _``Based on features alone _ and I don't think I enjoy saying
this _ Internet Explorer is the prettier twin, warts and all,'' PC
World said in a December 1997 review.
</P>
<P>
   _``You may be better off waiting several months for Microsoft to
flush out the problems or waiting until Windows 98 or Windows NT
5.0 appear formally,'' Computerworld opined in a December 15, 1997,
review.
</P>
<P>
   _``Although we recommend using (IE 4.0) as your preferred Web
client, the smart surfer will keep both products around,'' said
Windows Magazine in a December 1997 piece.
</P>
<P>
   The list also includes an October 14, 1997, Chronicle story with
the headline, ``Explorer 4.0: 10 ways to love it, hate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft counts all those conclusions among its wins.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of the 20 reviews reveals that Microsoft fared
favorably in 14 stories _ not 19 as it claimed _ and that half of
those ``wins'' did not include direct comparisons with Netscape's
Communicator browser.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft did score outright ``head-to-head'' victories in
comparison to Netscape in the Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles
Times, Boston Globe, Houston Chronicle and several other
publications. Netscape officials said they're disturbed by
Microsoft's aggressive marketing tactics _ including the firm's
apparent exaggeration of review conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our continuing frustrations has been that the press and
public have a tendency to take at face value whatever Microsoft
says, even when Microsoft is plainly wrong,'' Netscape general
counsel Roberta Katz said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts said the less-than-convincing reviews could
undercut Microsoft's credibility in court but probably won't hurt
its case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It raises doubts about their honesty by inflating the accepted
conclusion that IE 4.0 is a better product,'' said analyst Rob
Enderle, of Giga Information in Santa Clara. ``They did themselves
damage when they didn't have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials are backpedaling from earlier boasts,
acknowledging that the reviews don't amount to an overwhelming
victory. However, officials said the reviews prove that the company
has significantly improved Explorer, which has translated into
improved market share.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we made a better product, we were getting killed in
reviews,'' Microsoft spokesman Jim Cohen said. ``Now that we are
innovating, we are winning consumers and gaining a competitive
advantage. How can that hurt the market?''
</P>
<P>
   The company also noted that most computer magazine reviews are
analytical and do not lend themselves to screaming endorsements,
the way some movie reviews do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reviews are tough to gauge,'' said Rob Bennett, Internet
Explorer group product manager. ``There are good and bad points to
every product. It is hard to define something as a 100 percent win.
But if a review in the end says we have a good product, we'll take
that as a win.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen downplayed the importance of Gates' previous claims that
the reviews prove that Explorer 4 is a superior product. He said
the browser comparison represents a ``minimal factor'' in the
antitrust case, even though it is prominently mentioned as a major
strategy on a company Web site (www.microsoft.com/presspass
/doj/7-28formalresponse.htm).
</P>
<P>
   He said Microsoft first broached the idea of incorporating
``Internet connectivity as an integral part of the Windows
operating system'' in December 1993 _ before Netscape was founded.
</P>
<P>
   At a computer show in April 1994, Gates publicly discussed
building Net access directly into its next version of Windows,
Cohen added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is convinced Microsoft tried to kill off
Netscape,'' Cohen said. ``But what's important is that a federal
appeals court in June decided that Microsoft has the right to
integrate IE 4.0 into Windows OS.''

MICROSOFT TOLD TO SURRENDER CODE FOR WINDOWS 95, 98 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Over strong objections from Microsoft Corp., a
federal judge ordered the company Thursday to turn over to the
government the source code for its operating system and to make its
chairman, Bill Gates, and 16 other executives available for
pretrial depositions that will last as long the Justice Department
deems necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft was ordered to give Justice Department lawyers
preparing for a Sept. 8 trial in the government's antitrust suit a
copy of the source code for the latest two versions of its
operating system, Windows 95 and Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft had asked that Gates' testimony be limited to eight
hours, and had wanted to provide only seven other executives for
pretrial interviews. The company had offered to turn over the
source code _ the dense technical blueprint _ of the operating
system under conditions that would have made it difficult for the
government to bring in outside experts to analyze it.
</P>
<P>
   But in a hearing called to settle these and other disputes
Thursday afternoon, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of U.S. District
Court ruled in favor of the government on every question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not intend to put a time restraint on the length of time
Gates may be deposed,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   He ordered that the deposition be taken beginning Aug. 12, four
weeks before the scheduled opening of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Months ago, Microsoft gave the source code for Windows 95, the
operating system version that was replaced this spring by Windows
98, to 20 state attorneys general. They have also filed an
anti-trust suit against the company. In that case, the attorneys
general agreed to Microsoft's request that no one who looked at the
code would be allowed to work for most major software companies
during the following 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   When Justice Department lawyers entered their own request for
the Windows 95 and and Windows 98 code, they argued that the
government ``will be unable to utilize the services of their
consultants or experts'' under such a restriction ``unless they are
willing to give up their livelihood.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the judge agreed but told Microsoft that he would
order severe penalties if any of the government's consultants
misused the data.
</P>
<P>
   The government wants the source code for Windows 95 and Windows
98 to help prove its assertion that Microsoft is improperly
bundling its browser, the software used to navigate the World Wide
Web, with its operating system. The Justice Department argues that
bundling the browser was a tactic intended to harm Microsoft's
primary competitor in that business, Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says that the company's leaders were planning to
include browser capabilities in Windows as early as April 1994 _
long before Netscape had grown to be an important player in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   In court filings, the Justice Department vigorously disputes
that notion. One brief, filed last November, quoted from numerous
internal Microsoft documents indicating that as late as 1996, the
company had made no decision to bundle the browser with Windows.
This was well after Netscape had grown to dominate the browser
market.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The government quotes from 1994 e-mail messages to and from
Steven Sinofsky, who was technical assistant to Gates, in which
Sinofsky says the company has made no decision to integrate Web
browsing software with Windows. Instead, one June 1994 message from
him says, ``What we should be doing is getting as many third
parties writing Internet things on top of'' Windows ``as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   In another internal electronic message in December 1996, Jim
Allchin, another Microsoft executive, is quoted as urging others
within the company to begin bundling the company's Web browser,
Internet Explorer, with Windows. ``My conclusion is we must
leverage Windows more,'' he wrote. Otherwise, ``I don't understand
how IE is going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We should think about an integrated solution,'' Allchin wrote.
``That is our strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the Microsoft employees and executives quoted in the
Justice Department brief have since filed declarations with the
court saying that their earlier e-mail messages were being
misinterpreted or taken out of context.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Sinofsky asserted that he wrote those
tentative-sounding messages only because not everyone within the
company had been told that the leaders had decided to bundle a
browser with Windows.
</P>
<P>
   In court Thursday, a Microsoft lawyer, John Warden, said that
the company would file a petition next Monday asking Jackson to
dismiss important parts of the antitrust case _ primarily the part
dealing with bundling the browser with Windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``You certainly are entitled to do that,'' Jackson said. But he
indicated that he probably would not approve it.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said its motion would be framed by a federal Appeals
Court ruling in June that struck down an earlier preliminary
injunction issued by Jackson, requiring Microsoft to offer Windows
without its browser.
</P>
<P>
   The Appeals Court said the injunction had been ordered before
the District Court had gathered enough evidence to support it. This
time, the judge told Warden, ``I am going to be finding facts
here'' _ that is, gathering evidence during the trial. With that,
the judge appeared to be saying that he did not think the Appeals
Court ruling had much direct bearing on the current case.

FROM BYTES TO BITE: SILICON VALLEY ELITE TACKLE MANNERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAN McKINNEY   
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ You can tell a lot about people by the way
the eat. In Silicon Valley, where big business is often conducted
over burritos, most executives take a simple point-and-click
approach to dining. But that's about to change.
</P>
<P>
   Web heads and techno-titans are learning that, even in an
entrepreneurial environment, where casual is king, it sometimes
takes more than a million-dollar idea to woo capital and clients.
</P>
<P>
   It takes good manners.
</P>
<P>
   So for the past three years, Sue Fox and Lyndy Janes have made
manners their business. Since the two Los Gatos residents opened
The Workshoppe, they've been teaching the etiquette illiterate of
the high-tech literati the proper way to eat Cornish hen, or how to
correct wardrobe and grooming.
</P>
<P>
   With a list of clients that include Apple, Hewlett Packard and
Web TV, the two have their work cut out for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``One man thought that licking your knife was the acceptable way
to clean it,'' laughs Workshoppe co-founder Fox. ``It may be a
dog-eat-dog world out there in high tech, but that doesn't mean you
should behave like one.''
</P>
<P>
   Janes and Fox began their protocol training workshops for teens,
but soon moved on to teaching their parents as well. According to
Janes, who is British, many Silicon Valley executives feel a little
insecure and even embarrassed when it comes to entertaining and
fine dining. A certain ``je ne sais quoi'' has been lost amid the
hustle and bustle of high tech-life styles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a reason for mum saying `Get your elbows off the
table,' and it's coming into play now in business and socially.''
says Janes, in her crisp British cadence. ``With people from Europe
and other areas coming to do business here, we all should be more
aware of our own culture,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   True, first impressions do count. But in a valley where
executives proclaim their status at the office by wearing shorts
and sandals, and computer code often takes precedence over dress
code, isn't emphasizing proper manners a little too Victorian?
</P>
<P>
   Not a bit of it, Janes argues. The Workshoppe stresses function
over formality _ taking the prissiness out of etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about making other people feel comfortable around you and
being considerate towards them. We don't expect clients to leave
here behaving like a character in a Merchant Ivory movie,'' Janes
says. ``Although that would be very romantic,'' she adds with a
smile.
</P>
<P>
   And Janes is all-too-often reminded of the scope of her work as
a manners missionary. Walking through the San Jose Fairmont's
fanciest eatery on the way to teach a class on table etiquette, she
passes a man with something stuck in his teeth, something enormous
that he's attempting to gouge out with his finger. The well attired
young woman seated across from him doesn't seem to mind, but Janes
knows better.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look very nice. I wouldn't want that man to pass me
the bread basket, would you?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Workshoppe participants have stories of their own. Kathleen
O'Roarke, of San Jose, went to the class after attending a state
dinner at the White House. It was a formative experience for the
new etiquette connoisseur.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting in between these two guys, and the one on the
right really knew what he was doing, made it look easy; but the one
on the left was lost.''
</P>
<P>
   She found out later that the man to her left, made so vulnerable
by forks and fingerbowls, was a former secretary of Defense.
</P>
<P>
   Even among the cultivated, manners still make the man. O'Roarke
remembers a brother-in-law with an doctorate who chewed loud enough
to deafen table conversation. Janes has noticed similar tendencies
among Silicon Valley elite. ``Some CEOs don't care so much about
manners, but even the most powerful man could be dreadful to sit
next to at dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   Among tales of terrible teeth pickers and embarrassing gristle
gaffes Janes reminds her class that even the most well-intended
diner may not be well-informed. In one case, a woman took her
fiancee in for a private consultation because she was concerned
about his table manners. The man was a corporate executive and the
couple enjoyed all the trappings of a sophisticated lifestyle; but
one thing was horribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``He insisted on licking his knife before putting it back on the
table.'' recalls Janes, who had to delve into the client's past to
get to the root of the problem. It turned out that the impulse was
well-intended: save a clean table cloth from being soiled. While he
was barely tall enough to reach the table, the man had used the
technique to impress his mother. As his fiancee feared, it wasn't
going over as well at corporate luncheons. And perhaps worst of
all, it was threatening their marriage plans: his future
mother-in-law couldn't stomach his table behavior.

COMPUTER A NECESSITY ON CAMPUS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By KERRY FEHR-SNYDER   
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - What once was a luxury for college-bound students now
has become as standard as JanSport backpack and a Sony Walkman.
</P>
<P>
   Personal computers have moved from novelty to necessity in the
'90s, despite large computing resources on most college campuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I strongly encourage all students to come with a computer,''
said Bill Lewis, vice provost for technology at Arizona State
University in Tempe. ``We do provide computers on campus, but you
have to get in line and wait.''
</P>
<P>
   With one computer to every 17 students, ASU beats the
educational goal of 1-to-20. But statistics are little consolation
when you're camped out for hours watching other students hunt and
peck on a keyboard the night before your major research paper is
due.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for students, the price of personal computers continues
to plummet. Much of the credit goes to Intel Corp., which recently
slashed the price for its 266-megahertz Celeron processor to $86
from $106, its lowest in years.
</P>
<P>
   Even Mac devotees can find deals. Apple Computer is releasing
its first consumer-oriented Mac, the iMac, next week. Price:
$1,299.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers, never ones to miss a marketing opportunity, are
jumping on the back-to-school bandwagon to sell systems and
software.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly think that going back to school is a great time
to find some deals,'' said Carol Elfstrom, a spokeswoman for
CompUSA in Dallas. The chain is taking reservations for the iMac
and offering $800 worth of mail-in coupons for Apple-related
software and accessories.
</P>
<P>
   In the more prevalent IBM-compatible world, computermakers are
offering discounts for college students. Dell Computer Corp. is
offering five systems, ranging in configuration from minitowers to
notebooks, for students who can prove they are enrolled in college.
The systems start at $1,540 and top out at $2,950.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Compaq Computer Corp. is offering $100 mail-in
rebates on its Presario PC, monitor and color inkjet printer. The
PCs range from $799 to $2,299, after the rebate, and are sold at
major computer stores.
</P>
<P>
   But savvy students may want to wait to get to campus before
plunking down any money. At ASU, for example, Dell, Apple and
others offer discounts through its computer store. Other
universities offer similar deals through campus book stores.
</P>
<P>
   Even bigger savings can be had on software.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would wait to tell them to buy their software,'' ASU's Lewis
said. ``The educational price is much, much better than you get at
the computer stores.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis cited a $250 discount on a $300 word processing,
spreadsheet and presentation software package. Similarly, the
widely used Statistical Package for the Social Sciences goes for
$1,200 in computer stores but only $150 from the ASU Computing
Store.
</P>
<P>
   As for the laptop vs. desktop question, students should consider
space, convenience and theft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recommend a laptop because of the convenience of being able
to take it to class to take notes or work on in other areas of
campus,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   But the downside for laptops are their premium cost and
temptation for theft. Although cable locks are available to
discourage theft, a good pair of wire cutters can get around them.
</P>
<P>
   Desktop computers, meanwhile, are cheaper, less of a target for
thieves and can be expanded with faster microprocessors and other
components.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, more students than ever are investing in PCs. A
study last year by ASU found that 60 percent of students have PCs.
</P>
<P>
   And a recent survey by electronics store Best Buy found that 39
percent of all freshmen would pick a computer or word processor
over a stereo (23 percent) or TV (13 percent) if they could take
only one item to their college dorm room.
</P>
<P>
   Colleges are responding by wiring more of their dorms than ever
with high-speed Internet connections. At ASU, several dorms have 10
megabit connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're actually using it to help market certain dorms to
students,'' Lewis said. &QL;

THANKS FOR THE MEMORY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the pleasures of my Chicago youth was the occasional bout
of car trouble. It gave me an excuse to visit Warshawsky &AMP; Co., a
vast auto-parts warehouse on the wrong end of State Street. You'd
get a salesman's advice on choosing a new ignition coil or a
rebuilt alternator, then wander through the fan belts and pine-tree
air fresheners till the goodies emerged from a room out back. There
were few better ways to spend an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, they didn't have personal computer stores back then.
These days, I prefer to hang out at a Cambridge, Mass. shop called
PCs for Everyone, a Warshawsky for nerds. Go to CompUSA for
attractive decor and lavish displays of merchandise. PCs for
Everyone is a boxy, bare-walled place with a carpet-covered bench
where you can sit and wait while the guy out back finds that hard
drive you asked for.
</P>
<P>
   There are salespeople in some stores whose only computer
experience is working a cash register. Not here. I hardly ever
visit without learning something, though the education generally
costs a few bucks. Like my recent quest for more memory.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, when I did a major computer upgrade, I
decided to keep using my old memory chips. I had 40 megabytes of
old RAM and the system worked well enough. But some of my software
experiments demand a bit more _ at least 64 megs more. Memory has
never been cheaper. I could get 64 megs for a little over $100. But
what kind?
</P>
<P>
   Like many newer motherboards, mine has two different sets of
memory slots. One set accepts the old-style memory chips, while the
other is designed for a faster type of computer memory called
Synchronous DRAM or SDRAM. SDRAM is designed to pump out data
significantly faster than the older type of memory chip. SDRAM is
standard equipment on many new machines. If you're in the market,
don't settle for less.
</P>
<P>
   Why is SDRAM better? Convenience, for one thing. Memory chips
come attached to little modules that look like miniature circuit
boards, and plug into slots inside the motherboard. But when you
use old-style memory in Pentium-type machines, you have to install
the modules two at a time. You can't buy one 16-megabyte module to
upgrade your machine. You need two modules of 8 megs each.
</P>
<P>
   Since most computers have just four slots for this kind of
memory, you run out fast. I've had to discard perfectly good memory
modules to make room for bigger ones. But this problem goes away
with SDRAM modules, which can be inserted one at a time. Just buy
one 64-megabyte module and you're set.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the sheer speed at which the computer can read and
write data to the chips. Never mind how fast your processor is;
these days the bottleneck between the processor and the memory is
at least as important.
</P>
<P>
   The data travels back and forth along a set of wires called a
bus, which is tuned to a particular frequency _ usually 66
megahertz. That means that pulses of data travel across the bus 66
million times every second. But old-style memory chips can't even
manage half that rate. So the computer spends half its time just
waiting for something to do. A newer kind of memory called EDO DRAM
is somewhat faster, but still not that hot. Ideally, you'd want
memory that can move data at exactly the same speed as the bus _
synchronized, in other words. And that's possible with SDRAM.
</P>
<P>
   There is a downside. SDRAM doesn't get along well with the older
type of memory, so my old chips would have to go. No problem: I'll
save them for my next building project.
</P>
<P>
   Then I saw there were two kinds of SDRAM, one about $40 cheaper
than the other. Not one to pass up a bargain, I began reaching for
the credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, said the salesman. He warned me that there are two
kinds of SDRAM out there. ``SDRAM Lite'' works on today's
motherboards. But the next wave of computers use boards that run at
100 megahertz, compared with today's 66-megahertz standard. SDRAM
Lite chips won't work with these boards, so I'd have to throw away
the memory the next time I upgrade. Pay a bit more for top-drawer
SDRAM, and it'll be good for years.
</P>
<P>
   The salesman kept me from doing something dumb, and got a few
extra bucks out of me at the same time. It was like the old days at
Warshawsky, only without the fan belts.

CYBERMEDICINE: AN UNHEALTHY ALTERNATIVE? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By AARON ZITNER   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Patients come from all over the world for treatment
by Dr. Steven Kohler, an emergency room physician at Salem (Mass.)
Hospital. It is a very speedy trip. All they have to do is log on
and tell the doctor where it hurts _ by electronic mail.
</P>
<P>
   From their office on the Internet, Kohler and fellow Salem
Hospital physician Kerry Archer have been diagnosing ailments and
prescribing medication for two years to people around the globe.
Now, a host of doctors are rushing on-line, prompting questions
about whether Internet medicine is good medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started, a lot of doctors said this is heresy,''
Kohler said. ``But as time goes on, doctors and more of the public
will see this as a significant aspect of the practice of
medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohler calls it the ``virtual housecall.'' A woman on vacation
contracts a urinary tract infection, and she needs an antibiotic. A
man on a business trip has a relapse of asthma, and he wants an
inhaler. Kohler says these are typical, minor ailments that can be
evaluated in the live, person-to-person electronic exchanges
offered for $50 by his Internet site, called CyberDocs
(www.cyberdocs.com).
</P>
<P>
   The potential for ``cybermedicine'' could be huge. It is a
low-cost way to match doctors with patients, 24 hours a day,
whether the patient lives in remotest Alaska or crowded Somerville.
</P>
<P>
   At the Physician Insurers Association of America, which
represents malpractice insurers, an official says she has received
at least a dozen inquiries from doctors in the last six months
about setting up sites like Cyberdocs. Relatively low overhead
costs make it an attractive business prospect: Kohler says he and
Archer have spent about $80,000 on their site, and that it has
begun to break even. They claim 20 to 30 consultations weekly, with
about 90 percent involving a request for prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But cybermedicine also raises a thicket of red flags. Can
doctors really treat patients they have never seen? Will patients
try to obtain drugs they do not need? Will doctors practice in
areas where they have no expertise?
</P>
<P>
   And, given that patients sometimes misreport their own symptoms,
how can Kohler and Archer trust what a patient is saying?
</P>
<P>
   ``By and large, people are putting themselves at risk to access
health care this way,'' said Dr. Thomas Reardon, president-elect of
the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``This service would definitely raise an eyebrow,'' said
Jonathan Linkous, executive director of the American Telemedicine
Association, which promotes greater access to health care through
phones and computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something here that could be very, very great, or it
could be terribly misused, and this needs to be sorted out,'' said
Dr. Nancy Auer, president of the American College of Emergency
Physicians. ``In the meantime, I think it's a case of `let the
buyer beware.'''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have been mixing medicine and telecommunications for
years. A patient in California can have his heart monitored or his
X-rays read by a doctor in Boston, with the data moving in real
time over the phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies often ask clients to take their after-hours
questions to 800-lines staffed by nurses, creating the new field of
``tele-nursing.'' And Web sites offer information on every
imaginable medical problem.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, doctors are using the Internet to extend their
practices. At Cyberspace Telemedical Office (www.telemedical.com),
computer users can tap into a medical library, shop for health
products or arrange a conference with a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   From his group practice in Beverly Hills, Calif., cardiologist
Ronald Karlsberg and his colleagues use a Web page (www.cvmg.com)
to advertise their service of offering case reviews for patients
with heart ailments. Unlike CyberDocs, Karlsberg talks to patients
by phone and obtains their medical records on paper.
</P>
<P>
   At CyberDocs, a patient who requests a ``virtual housecall''
automatically pages one of the site's doctors on call, telling the
doctor to log on for a consultation.
</P>
<P>
   The patient describes his or her symptoms and provides a medical
history. The doctor asks questions to make sure that the ailment is
not something serious, which might require in-person care. If
necessary, Kohler and Archer prescribe medication, using a separate
Internet service to arrange for quick delivery to almost anywhere
on the globe.
</P>
<P>
   They offer prescriptions for baldness. They offer the ``morning
after pill'' for women who may have become pregnant. They have
written about 50 prescription for Viagra, but only for patients
located outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   There are many things that Kohler says CyberDocs will not do: It
will not prescribe narcotics, Valium or diet pills. He said it
offers only short-term prescriptions for drugs that require close
monitoring, like blood-pressure medication. And because CyberDocs
doctors are only licensed to practice in Massachusetts, they work
only with people who say they are checking in from Massachusetts or
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at several medical trade groups said the future of
CyberDocs and related sites will hinge on how regulators and
insurance companies handle several key issues, such as whether
special licenses will be needed to provide service.
</P>
<P>
   Malpractice insurance could become another issue. Kohler said
that after walking his insurer through his Web service, the company
said his current malpractice policy would cover his on-line
doctoring, with no additional premium. But other insurers may fear
that they are taking on greater risks in tele-medicine, and they
may demand higher premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers set different malpractice premiums for each medical
specialty based on its history of pay-outs. ``But with this kind of
tele-medicine, there is no experience from a claims standpoint to
know how safe or risky this is,'' said Lori Bartholomew of the
Physician Insurers Association of America, the insurers trade
group.
</P>
<P>
   Also complicating matters, malpractice premiums vary by region.
Insurers charge twice as much for a policy in Philadelphia than in
Pittsburgh, even though both are large cities in the same state,
with comparable medical schools and hospitals. ``Maybe Philadelphia
has tougher juries or a more litigious clientelle, but insurers
have a different experience of losses in one city than the other,''
Bartholomew said.
</P>
<P>
   With cybermedicine and similar services, insurers are being
asked to cover physicians who are practicing by Internet not only
across the country, but around the world. Setting premiums could be
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, CyberDocs has some people asking whether a doctor
can treat a patient he has never seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are short of breath, I can see if your fingernails or
lips are turning blue,'' said Auer of the American College of
Emergency Physicians. ``I can see if you're breaking out in a
sweat. This helps me decide how serious your case is.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohler responds that CyberDocs does not want to treat patients
who have acute problems or need ongoing care, and that it tells
those clients to see a doctor in person. But at the same time,
there are many medical problems that doctors and patients tackle
together over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Kohler plans to expand his roster of doctors to all 50 states,
and to add a videoconferencing service so that patients and doctors
can see each other. A psychiatrist will soon come on board for
on-line counseling, though CyberDocs is wary so far of prescribing
Prozac or other anti-depression medications.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential here is enormous,'' Kohler said by phone. He
then interrupted himself. ``I see another patient signing on,'' he
said. It was a regular client who obtains hair-loss medication from
CyberDocs. ``Luckily,'' Kohler said, ``it's Dr. Archer who is on
call tonight.''

IS IT E-MAIL OR EEK-MAIL?
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY  
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I read about the latest so-called e-mail virus
scare. This sounds like just another hoax to me.
</P>
<P>
   _ Skeptical
</P>
<P>
   DEAR SKEP: Maybe. You really want to take that chance?
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks back, some four-eyes with a lot of free time on his
hands discovered a potential problem with Outlook Express 4.x,
Outlook 98 and Netscape Communicator mail. Other mail programs may
be at risk, too. File attachments with very long names _ no, I'm
not going to tell you how long because my mailbox has already been
jam-packed with malicious missives _ can crash the e-mail programs.
</P>
<P>
   Skilled hackers could conceivably execute nasty little programs
as the program halts. Although no reports of dirty tricks have
surfaced, now that the story has made the news, you can bet some
pinheaded hacker wannabe is out there losing sleep trying to invent
a way to wipe out your hard drive before you know what hit you.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has a partial fix at www.microsoft.com/ie/security,
but it's still grinding away on a complete patch. Netscape is
supposed to be hard at work, too. Check in frequently at
home.netscape.com/products/security/index.html.
</P>
<P>
   Don't you just love hackers? This is starting to cut into
efforts to catalog every Carmen Electra-worship page on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I normally leave my computer running in order
to receive faxes. We have a lot of power failures in my area, which
has not been a problem as I am running Win95-early on a 486. The
computer restarts without all the Scandisk gobbledygook and
everything works fine. I have just ordered a new 400-mHz screamer
that will come with Win98, and I am sure I'll get the gobbledygook.
Is there a way to get Windows 98 to restart on an unscheduled
shutdown without Scandisk?
</P>
<P>
   _ Stormy
</P>
<P>
   DEAR STORMY: ``You buy them books,'' a trusted mentor once told
me, ``and they eat the covers.''
</P>
<P>
   Big Bill and his pals didn't put Scandisk in there to irritate
you. They were trying to save people from themselves. Every time
you close down Windows without going through the shutdown routine,
you run the risk of corrupting your hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Stormy, I realize you're not doing the bad shutdowns
intentionally, but please think about getting an uninterruptable
power supply. Those power failures aren't doing your hardware any
good.
</P>
<P>
   The early versions of Win95 didn't run Scandisk to repair disk
problems after an improper shutdown. Why? Beats me, but most likely
because the guys at Microsoft underestimated how few people would
or could follow directions.
</P>
<P>
   New versions of Win95 and 98 automatically run Scandisk if a bad
shutdown is detected. Win 95 makes you click to get things started,
but 98 runs it on its own. I really hesitate to tell you the next
part, because this is one time when I'd prefer that you ignore me
even more than usual. You can change Scandisk's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   You should know that there's the very real potential of mucking
things up, but here goes: Use a text editor such as Notepad to open
Msdos.sys, which is in your root directory. Look for a line that
reads ``Autoscan(Equals)1.'' Change the 1 to 0 if you want to turn
off Scandisk. Change it to a 2 if you want Scandisk to run without
any intervention. Please don't touch anything else. You don't know
what you're doing, and you'll wind up blaming me.
</P>
<P>
   And if you turn Scandisk off, don't come crying to me when you
start getting ``illegal operation'' error messages out the wazoo. I
warned you.

MICROSOFT PITCHING TENT IN SILICON VALLEY  
 HOUSE E-MAIL EFFORT RAISES CENSORSHIP ISSUE  
 DIRECTV AND THOMSON PLAN SET-TOP BOX 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steven A. Ballmer, who has more often cast a dark shadow over
Silicon Valley, arrived there last week offering peace, love and
local tax payments. Ballmer, newly elevated to the job of president
of Microsoft Corp., announced that his company, based in Redmond,
Wash., would set up a satellite headquarters in a 32-acre corporate
campus in Mountain View, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer is renowned for being the field marshal of Microsoft's
aggressive and highly effective marketing efforts, which have often
left Silicon Valley littered with casualties. And not lost on
anyone is the fact that Microsoft is moving into the hometown of
Netscape Communications Corp., whose David-and-Goliath struggle
with Microsoft is at the heart of the government's antitrust suit
against Ballmer's company.
</P>
<P>
   But Ballmer declared that the campus, with five buildings,
``underscores Microsoft's ongoing commitment to its employees,
partners and customers in the valley.''
</P>
<P>
   The company, which already has 800 employees scattered in
offices throughout Silicon Valley, will move those people into the
Mountain View campus. Yet much more than merely a matter of real
estate consolidation, the step is also clearly meant to raise the
company's profile in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   A larger presence in Silicon Valley, industry executives said,
could help Microsoft recruit people from the region's talent pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft competes for engineering talent, but only the talent
that is willing to move from here to Seattle,'' said Roger McNamee,
general partner of Integral Capital Partners, an investment firm in
Menlo Park, Calif. ``And a lot of people who live in the valley are
religious about the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Others wonder what took Microsoft so long, saying the company's
relations with Silicon Valley might be better now if such a move
had been made years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``A real reason for the valley's ambivalence toward Microsoft is
that Microsoft didn't show its face around the valley and didn't
make an effort to understand valley culture,'' said Paul Saffo, a
director of the Institute for the Future, a research group in Menlo
Park. ``Microsoft is late to everything, even moving to the
valley.''

<P>
   HOUSE E-MAIL EFFORT RAISES CENSORSHIP ISSUE
</P>
<P>
   A congressional committee has endorsed a bill to control junk
e-mail by requiring the senders of unsolicited marketing material
to identify themselves in the body of their messages _ a provision
that opponents said would give Internet service providers the new,
undesirable task of weeding through private communications.
</P>
<P>
   The measure to regulate junk e-mail, or ``spam'' as it is called
by Internet users, was approved by the House Commerce Committee's
telecommunications subcommittee on Thursday as part of a bill
intended to prohibit another communications annoyance:
``slamming,'' or the practice by some telephone companies of
changing their customers' long-distance carriers without prior
approval. A similar anti-spam measure is part of the phone-slamming
bill already passed by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the House and Senate spam-buster measures
involves the spot in the message where the senders must identify
themselves. Under the Senate bill, a message must be identified as
unsolicited commercial e-mail in the subject header, which would
enable Internet service providers and individuals to filter out
such messages. But the House bill would require such identification
in the body of the message itself, making automatic filtering
difficult or impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Everett-Church, a lobbyist for the Coalition Against
Unsolicited Commercial e-mail, a group that is pushing a bill to
ban spam, called the House bill ``disastrous for consumers and
Internet service providers.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett-Church said that to filter mail through a notice in the
body of a message, as opposed to the subject header, is much more
labor-intensive because each message would have to be opened. Not
only would that add a further burden to network operators already
struggling to cope with heavy messaging traffic, he said, ``it is
disturbing to Internet service providers who don't want to get in
the practice of sifting through people's private e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We fear that will open up a new realm of censorship based on
content,'' he said.

   The way the makers of television sets see it, the cable industry
stands squarely in the way of the successful introduction of
digital, high-definition television. Most of the major cable
companies say they will not carry the digital programs that the
broadcast networks plan to being offering in November. And since
two-thirds of the nation's homes subscribe to cable, it is little
wonder that the manufacturers are concerned.
</P>
<P>
   So Thomson Multimedia, the nation's largest maker of television
sets, is teaming up with DirecTV, the largest direct-broadcast
satellite company, to work around the cable obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   DirecTV, part of the Hughes Electronics unit of General Motors
Corp., was one of four companies that bought minority stakes in
Thomson Multimedia late last month. As part of that deal, the
companies agreed to build a set-top box for use with
high-definition television sets.
</P>
<P>
   The box will include a decoder for the DirecTV satellite signal
_ as well as a tuner for over-the-air television signals, both
digital and analog. The boxes should sell for about $400 and enable
DirecTV subscribers with television antennas to get cable channels
from DirecTV, and local television stations.
</P>
<P>
   So far, direct-broadcast satellite services, which beam the same
programming to the entire country, have been unable to carry local
television stations, and that has been a large barrier to mass
acceptance. DirecTV and Thomson Multimedia hope the hybrid box will
solve some of the marketing problems.
</P>
<P>
   Of course all of this may remain academic as long as
high-definition televisions are selling, on average, for $8,000.

ADVERTISING: BRITISH CAMPAIGN FOCUSES ON YEAR 2000 COMPUTER 
PROBLEM
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Get your business ready for the bug,'' a gigantic
yellow-and-black billboard screams in the heavily trafficked
Leicester Square subway station near London's West End theater
district.
</P>
<P>
   The ``bug'' in question is the millennium bug, the technological
apocalypse that may wreak havoc on computers at the end of the
century if they have not been upgraded to understand when the year
changes from 1999 to 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The gigantic billboard is just one of 3,175 posted in and around
London as part of an ambitious $17 million advertising campaign
that seeks to make small and mid-sized businesses aware of the
potential heart attack their computers may suffer without a visit
from a digital doctor, or ``bug buster,'' as Prime Minister Tony
Blair has referred to the technological experts who are in short
supply to re-code Britain's computers.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is sponsored by Action 2000, a government agency
that was set up last fall to help prepare Britain's businesses for
the potential computer problems at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although awareness of the millennium bug is high,'' said
Gwynneth Flower, managing director of Action 2000, ``too many small
and medium-sized businesses have yet to implement a plan of
action.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the agency, only one in four British businesses has
``taken realistic measures to tackle the bug within their own
organizations.'' The campaign, which began several weeks ago in
print and on billboards, aims to provoke computer users to call
Action 2000's telephone hot line or go on line to the
organization's Web site (http://www.bug2000.co.uk) to get detailed
information on the year 2000 problem.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the ads have appeared as double-page spreads in The
Times of London, The Daily Telegraph, The Independent and The
Guardian, as well as others.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this many companies think they're ready when in fact
they're not, then the small-business sector of U.K. PLC as a whole
is suffering a worrying perception vacuum,'' said Don Cruickshank,
chairman of Action 2000, referring to the low number of companies
that are prepared for the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
   But some industry experts seem to be doing some worrying of
their own about the effectiveness of the new campaign. ``I don't
want to knock it because it's better than nothing,'' said Andy
Kyte, an analyst at Gartner Group in London. ``But it's
questionable whether the material they are providing is
comprehensive enough.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The danger is you get everyone aware of the problem
without the resources to support everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The advertising campaign, which was created by the London-based
agency FCA, a unit of Publicis SA, and is also scheduled to include
television and radio spots in early fall, is part of a larger
government-sponsored initiative to support small and medium-sized
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Blair announced that the government would spend $160
million to help eradicate the bug, in part, by providing grants to
train 20,000 people throughout Britain to understand the
technological complexities of the problem. The government hopes to
use young people as well as older unemployed or retired people to
help small and mid-sized businesses recode their computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without careful preparation, there could be major disruption
to essential services such as benefit payments, or even to
emergency services such as hospitals, the fire and the police,''
Blair said.
</P>
<P>
   The millennium bug results from a computer's inability to
recognize the year 2000 because it recognizes only the last two
digits of any given year, making many computers interpret the year
2000 as 1900.
</P>
<P>
   One consulting company that has been very critical of the
British government's handling of the year 2000 problem conceded
that the new campaign might be helpful. ``The campaign is the first
positive step the government has made,'' said Richard Coppel, chief
executive of Prove It 2000. ``Other governments ought to take a
look.''
</P>
<P>
   But Coppel still finds fault with the campaign. ``We have a
problem when we keep telling them about the issue but not providing
an adequate solution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But others say that with less than a year and a half to go
before January 2000, any information is beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is you need awareness and education,'' Kyte of the
Gartner Group said, ``even if it is at this late stage.''

PATENT AWARDED TO PRICELINE FOR INTERNET AUCTION SYSTEM

 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A small start-up company in Connecticut has been awarded a broad
patent that appears to protect not just the virtual nuts and bolts
of its electronic commerce system, but also its entire business
model for buying and selling goods and services on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Priceline.com LLC of Stamford, best known for
allowing consumers to ``name your own price'' for airline tickets,
said it would be issued U.S. patent No. 5,794,207 on Monday for
both the method and the use of ``buyer-driven commerce'' from the
Patent and Trademark Office. Priceline in effect convinced the
Patent Office that it had invented a new way of doing business, one
that was fundamentally different from any other form of electronic
commerce today.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline's ``reverse auction'' method is such a narrowly
specific approach to online business that analysts said few other
Internet commerce companies were likely to be significantly
restricted by the patent. But the Patent Office's growing
willingness to protect an entire Internet business model _ and not
just the technical wrinkles _ could set a precedent with
far-reaching implications for electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet-related business patents are extremely important,''
said Carl Oppedahl, an intellectual property lawyer in Frisco,
Colo. He cited the continuing case of E-Data, a New Jersey business
that is suing more than a dozen companies over its patent claims to
control fundamental aspects of electronic commerce. Depending on
the outcome of the E-Data case, Oppedahl said, ``Microsoft levels
of money either will or will not change hands, and there are likely
to be other Internet-business-method patent lawsuits with similarly
high stakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Several computer-related business-method patents have been
upheld by the courts in the last decade. But the Priceline patent
is one of the first awarded since the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia affirmed last month that a ``practical
application of a mathematical algorithm, formula or calculation''
could be protected.
</P>
<P>
   As such, Priceline's patent could touch off a race to control
the underlying framework of electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   In the Priceline system, consumers submit a bid, known as a
``conditional purchase offer,'' to buy goods or services _ airline
tickets or automobiles, for example _ from unknown sellers at a
certain price, and they guarantee the offer with a credit card.
Priceline presents the offers to the sellers, who then have the
option of either fulfilling or rejecting the bids, or making a
counteroffer. Priceline then completes the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a buyer might wish to buy two airplane tickets from
New York to Seattle. He or she would set conditions: the flight
must be on a major airline on a certain date, allowing one change
of planes if the layover is no more than two hours, and the price
per ticket can be no more than $300. Any airlines that participate
in the Priceline system can review the offers, and the first one
that responds, meeting all the conditions, gets the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Whinston, director of the Center for Research in
Electronic Commerce at the University of Texas at Austin, said that
from a traditional economic perspective, the Priceline business
model was hardly radical. It seems very similar to the method by
which a government agency or a corporation puts out specifications
and conditional purchase orders to multiple contractors or vendors,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Priceline's use of cryptography and other networking
technologies, what appears to be new and original, said Whinston,
is that by using computers and the Internet, the company is able to
bring this method of buyer-driven commerce to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it has one buyer and multiple sellers, it is a mirror
image of Internet auction companies like Onsale.com, in which you
have one seller and multiple buyers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline officials said that the patent would also cover the
``apparatus'' the company developed to authenticate customers'
identities and verify their ability to pay, to protect the
anonymity and privacy of both buyer and seller, to enable sellers
to browse the list of offers, and to complete the pact
electronically.
</P>
<P>
   Although Priceline does almost all its business on the World
Wide Web, company officials noted that its buyer-driven method
could also be carried out through electronic mail, voice mail or
fax.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline said last week that it had received $20 million in
private financing from the venture capital firm General Atlantic
Partners. The investors expect revenue from Priceline's business
operations, but the real potential payoff will come from the
licensing of its methods to other electronic commerce companies,
said Jay Walker, Priceline's chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Priceline is really entering into an exciting space, one that
I know many other large organizations, notably Microsoft, have also
looked at,'' said Kenneth Smith, director of online retailing
research at Mainspring, a Boston-based consulting company. ``My
assumption is they will be challenged on this patent.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Smith and other analysts noted, however, that the Priceline
model was very likely to appeal to a relatively small niche of
buyers who know the exact specifications and reasonable prices for
the product or service they want.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers must be willing to fly at unpopular times, for
example, and give up their choice of airline and perks like
frequent-flier miles.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline asserts that it has sold 40,000 airline tickets to
leisure travelers in its three months of operation, despite the
fact that only a handful of domestic airlines now participate in
the system. Even so, the airline industry reports that the average
number of seats that fly away empty every day is about 500,000.
Walker said that there was untapped demand for those seats at the
right price.
</P>
<P>
   The company recently broadened its offerings to include new
cars, but the participating car dealers are limited for now to the
New York area.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said Priceline would soon expand its online products to
include hotel rooms, automobile financing, credit cards, personal
computers, home mortgages, life insurance, rental cars, cruise ship
vacations and other services.
</P>
<P>
   James McQuivey, who analyses online retail strategies for
Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., described Priceline's broad
strategy as ``brilliant'' but said that its success would depend on
the selection of goods that are offered. ``There's really no
incentive for the airlines to play,'' he said, because all the
seats are managed by relatively few sellers. ``In the car business,
though, power is diffused through more than 20,000 dealers.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith of Mainspring was also sanguine about Priceline's patent.
``I think they have a real chance,'' he said. ``More so than in any
other industry, the Internet allows a new and interesting business
a chance to deliver value into the marketplace. At the same time,
it can quickly deliver the message from the market if the value
proposition is either not wanted or not needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words, you get a chance, but you find out very
quickly if you're going to be a failure.''

DEALS TO MAKE GLOBAL POSITIONING CHIPS PART OF EVERYDAY LIFE 
</HEADLINE>

 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ The world's two largest digital cellular
phone companies and a Japanese microelectronics giant plan to
announce on Monday separate deals with a three-year-old Silicon
Valley start-up to produce global positioning system chips
inexpensive enough to be installed in cellular telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Nokia of Finland will announce a $3 million investment in the
start-up, Sirf Technology Inc., while both Ericsson of Sweden and
Hitachi will announce partnerships to develop global positioning
systems, or GPS, for consumer products.
</P>
<P>
   GPS devices use signals from satellites to pinpoint a location
anywhere on the globe. The technology was developed by the Pentagon
and first made its way into civilian use in specialized
navigational systems for ships and airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   The new backing for Sirf, a relatively unknown company, is the
strongest signal to date that GPS technology will increasingly
become part of everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   Start-ups like Sirf are being joined by established contenders
like Trimble Navigation in rapidly adapting global positioning
technology for a wide range of consumer electronics gadgets as well
as for virtually any movable object, whether automobiles or
luggage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will put this technology in our products beginning as early
as the year 2000,'' said Daryl Toor, an Ericsson executive. ``Our
vision is that increasingly, a small portable phone will be your
gateway to the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The convergence of portable wireless electronic devices and the
World Wide Web may soon make it conceivable for consumers to type
questions like ``Where is the nearest pizza parlor?'' into
hand-held devices and receive an answer in text or even from a
robotic voice.
</P>
<P>
   By licensing its technology to consumer electronics companies
and chip makers, Sirf is hoping it will be able to transform the
GPS industry, which until now has been built around different
proprietary systems for every company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bringing in Ericsson and Nokia is a huge coup for Sirf,'' said
Dale Ford, an industry analyst with Dataquest of San Jose, Calif.,
a market research firm. ``Licensing technology to semiconductor
companies could become a very large business.''
</P>
<P>
   Sirf has been developing GPS technology on smaller and smaller
chips, and at the same time has been lowering the price to the
point where this technology can now be an economical component in
most consumer electronics products.
</P>
<P>
   The company's founder, Kanwar Chadha, a former Silicon Valley
executive at Intel and at the S3 Corp., describes an array of
applications for GPS technologies that go far beyond currently
available navigational devices used by sailors, pilots and hikers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when GPS receiver prices fall below $10, probably
some time early in the next century, it will be possible to use
them as security devices. Anything from a car to a computer would
know its location and could be programmed to automatically shut
itself off if it was moved illegally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody had been looking at the really exciting GPS
applications,'' Sirf's founder said.
</P>
<P>
   By re-engineering GPS receivers based on microprocessors and
digital signal processors, the chips that enable sound in computers
and cellular phones, Sirf executives say, the company has realized
major performance improvements in the technology.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts who have seen Sirf's prototypes said they were
more sensitive than existing products, permitting them to function
at an acceptable level in the urban canyons that have traditionally
blocked GPS signals.
</P>
<P>
   Sirf engineers recently demonstrated a prototype device that was
able to begin reporting location information almost instantly and
could continue to communicate with orbiting satellites from the
basement of a one-story parking garage.
</P>
<P>
   Current GPS systems usually require a number of minutes to start
delivering location information and fail when they are blocked by
buildings or trees.
</P>
<P>
   The new technology also has privacy and security implications,
in part because the Federal Communications Commission has required
that cellular phones be able to provide position information to
within 125 meters, or roughly 400 feet, by 2001 so they can be
located when placing 911 emergency calls.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There are now two contending technologies competing to meet the
FCC requirement. One, developed by companies like True Position
Inc., uses complex software to locate cell phones by a
triangulation method based on measuring the difference in arrival
times of signals received by different network antennas.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the GPS receivers provide location information
based on measuring the differences in arrival time from a
constellation of Air Force satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Both systems have strengths and weaknesses _ and different
implications for privacy. For example, while the network method may
prove superior in some urban areas, the GPS systems will be more
reliable in rural regions.
</P>
<P>
   Some privacy advocates prefer the GPS systems, which they argue
give the user control in deciding whether or not to transmit
location information.
</P>
<P>
   Using a triangulation system, the phone company could determine
the user's location any time the phone was turned on.
</P>
<P>
   This difference has become more important in recent months
because the FBI has indicated that it expects cellular telephone
companies to make location information available to law-enforcement
agencies.

AN ENDANGERED LIST OF BACHELORS GOES ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LISA NAPOLI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Susie Carter divorced her husband four years ago because he
was unhappy about how much time she was spending at work, she knew
what she should do next. She put him on the cover of her magazine,
Alaska Men, whose mission is to advertise the state's plentiful
supply of bachelors to eager, spouse-seeking women around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy worked. Soon her ex-husband was happily remarried
and living in Britain, and Ms. Carter, unfettered, was able to
direct her energies entirely into being a professional matchmaker
in print.
</P>
<P>
   Issues of Alaska Men usually feature up to 100 men who pay a
``nominal fee'' of $499 to have their picture and biography
published on a half-page. In return, ``they receive hundreds of
letters,'' Ms. Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carter, whose ex-husband did not have to pay the fee,
contends that Alaska Men has brought about ``three to five
marriages'' a month, although she acknowledges that it is difficult
to keep a running count.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, the guys meet a girl and just disappear,'' she
said. ``We're the last thing on their minds after they meet their
soul mate.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, though, Ms. Carter's romance with her magazine is
troubled. Because of a legal battle over its control, publication
has been suspended since winter and bachelors are going unclaimed.
But thanks to the Internet, Ms. Carter has not been completely
stymied. She has set up a World Wide Web site for the magazine and
hopes to resume publication soon.
</P>
<P>
   It was the single fathers she met while she operated a day-care
center in her home that piqued Ms. Carter's interest in starting
the magazine. Many of them, she said, seemed as if they could
benefit from the companionship and support of women.
</P>
<P>
   But women are in somewhat short supply in Alaska, making up only
48 percent of the population, vs. 51 percent nationwide. Moreover,
at least anecdotal evidence suggests that single men far outnumber
single women.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carter is eager to get back to the business of promoting her
local bachelors in print, sounding responsible for their fate _ as
well as that of the brides-to-be. ``I get mail from women in
communist China,'' she said. ``In Japan, they've done three
television shows. We fly men to Germany _ three of the guys found
mates there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carter describes Alaska Men as ``not a huge moneymaker, but
a labor of love.'' She said the magazine, which she started in her
kitchen in 1987, had built up a subscriber base of 25,000, with a
$5.95 cover price. Last year, the magazine signed an agreement with
Media Mix Marketing of Hollywood to take charge of its business and
marketing side. But Media Mix then moved to take control of the
editorial content as well, filing a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marriage didn't work,'' said Terry Gross, the magazine's
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carter, 55, filed a countersuit and argues that Media Mix
would have changed the magazine radically. ``They wanted to glitz
it up so it's more like Cosmopolitan, with model-type guys,'' she
said. ``They don't want rough-looking guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Reality, she said, is what her readers have come to expect.
``Women want to know what their husbands look like,'' she said.
``Sometimes they're short and fat and wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Media Mix would not comment on the litigation,
but Gross said he hoped a settlement could be reached soon.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Though the dispute has stalled production of the magazine, a
quarterly, a new issue is stuck in a warehouse while Ms. Carter
tries to raise cash to distribute it. Among her businesses is a
``900'' telephone number that enables readers to hear the
bachelors' voices and to leave messages.
</P>
<P>
   Her foray onto the Web has provided Ms. Carter with a way to
keep Alaska Men, and the men of Alaska, in the spotlight. Though
her matchmaking potential has been limited by the legal dispute,
she herself managed to be brushed by love while interviewing
candidates to serve as Webmaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came in and it was love at first sight,'' she said of
Patrick Smutz, who is now both the magazine's Web expert and her
fiance. ``I saw this man and thought, `What a hunk.' I don't think
that very often.''
</P>
<P>
   Electronic publishing has opened new possibilities for Ms.
Carter, who said that once the print magazine came back, ``we'll
probably be doing both.'' Already, she has added a section called
``Alaska Women.''
</P>
<P>
   Though dismayed by the legal battle, she is still committed to
one prevailing maxim: ``Women all over the world want to find
men.'' All the better, she feels, if they find them in Alaska.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 NEW YORK: lower value.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the case of America Online, both of its recent acquisitions
are far from certain moneymakers. In April, the company acquired
Netchannel, a company that introduced and then withdrew a service
that connected television sets to the Internet. When announcing the
acquisition, America Online defended it as a way of hiring
Netchannel's management to develop an entirely new service.
</P>
<P>
   Then in June, America Online bought Mirabilis, a company begun
18 months earlier by four young Israelis. Mirabilis is a perfect
Rorschach test for how different investors value Internet
companies. To bulls, Mirabilis has vast potential because it
developed a chat service that has attracted 12 million members who
spend hours a day on line. But skeptics note that Mirabilis has
never generated a dollar in revenue and that America Online's plans
to turn it into an advertising medium are unproven.
</P>
<P>
   For America Online, this represents another accounting cloud
that darkens what many investors see as one of the great business
growth stories of the decade. The company was long criticized for
its delay in taking charges for marketing expenses, a move that had
the effect of making the company appear more profitable in its
earlier growing phase.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it reversed that practice. And indeed the more recent
accounting imbroglios relate to practices that have the opposite
effect _ of taking charges for expenses faster, depressing
near-term earnings but leaving future earnings free to grow faster.
But the SEC then forced America Online to restate its earnings _ in
part because it had taken $26 million in expenses too soon.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with its research write-off, America Online says it is
hardly trying to pick yet another fight with regulators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We brought this issue to the attention of the SEC, and we are
confident that it will be worked out,'' said Tricia Primrose, a
spokeswoman. She said the company set the value of the research
done by Mirabilis and Netchannel according to calculations of an
independent appraiser and that such write-offs have become standard
in the industry. For example, IBM wrote off as research $1.8
billion of the $3.4 billion it paid for Lotus Development in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The excuse that ``everybody is doing it,'' does not calm the
critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``These write-offs should be very minimal, at best, because when
you give management the right to wipe out future expenses all on
one swoop, they tend to abuse it,'' said Brad Rexford, an analyst
with the Center for Financial Research and Analysis, a research
firm in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Yet most investors and stock analysts argue that these fine
points of accounting are not related to the financial health of the
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good will is noncash and doesn't effect the cash-generating
capacity of a company,'' said Shaun Andrikopoulos, an analyst with
BT Alex. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   If technology companies are forced by the SEC to reduce their
initial write-offs and take more of the cost of their acquisitions
as charges to earnings for continuing good will, analysts will
simply ignore the reported earnings, Andrikopoulos said. In media
companies, which often have a lot of good will charges, analysts
look more to earnings before income taxes, depreciation and
amortization than to net profit, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others worry that tightening rules on research write-offs will
inhibit technology companies from pursuing acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the SEC cracks down, it will have an effect on the whole
sector,'' said Walt Price, who runs a technology mutual fund for
Dresdner RCM Global Investors. ``In the case of Mirabilis, the only
way that acquisition is going to make sense is if you write off the
very large purchase price and then figure out how to turn it into a
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Could that be exactly what the SEC has in mind?

MARKET PLACE: SEC SIGNALS CONCERN AS INTERNET COMPANIES' STOCKS 
KEEP RISING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Has the Securities and Exchange Commission begun
voicing subtle warnings about the unusually high prices of Internet
industry stocks?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the SEC would never tell investors not to pay
sky-high prices for the stocks of young, money-losing companies.
Nor can it stop companies from buying each other at equally high
prices.
</P>
<P>
   But the agency can send some signals through its regulation of
how those acquisitions are accounted for on the buyers' financial
statements. And at the root of recent fights the agency has picked
with companies that try to write off most of the price of their
acquisitions up front is a sense that the prices of technology
companies just cannot be reconciled with conservative accounting.
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent example is America Online Inc., which was not
able to release its quarterly and full-year earnings last week
because it is still wrestling with the SEC over the accounting for
two recent acquisitions: Netchannel, for which it paid $29 million,
and Mirabilis, acquired for $287 million. The issue is how much of
the price that the online service paid for the acquisitions can be
written off now _ a one-time hit investors tend to dismiss _ versus
how much must be deducted over many quarters, a weight on profit
that more investors would be likely to heed.
</P>
<P>
   Accounting rules force companies to add up the apparent value of
the assets in companies they acquire _ both tangible things like
real estate and intangibles like patent rights. If they paid more
for the company than the value of its assets _ and most do _ the
excess is classified as good will, which must be charged against
earnings over a period of three to 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Since many companies do not want that continuing drag on
profits, they look for ways to reduce good will charges, and
technology companies in particular have latched on to an obscure
rule that allows them to write off immediately the value of
continuing research and development activities in the companies
they buy. (Completed research, on the other hand, is considered
intellectual property that must be accounted for as an asset on the
company's balance sheet.)
</P>
<P>
   Many technology firms now argue that most of the prices they pay
for their acquisitions represent continuing, or incomplete,
research, and thus can be written off as an expense right away.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Worldcom Inc. said it would write off $6 billion to
$7 billion of the $37 billion it had agreed to pay for MCI
Communications Corp., because that was the value of MCI's
continuing research. And other companies, including Microsoft Corp.
and Cisco Systems Inc., have written off the bulk of their
acquisition costs as in-process research.
</P>
<P>
   Critics argue that this rule is being abused and that future
earnings at some companies are thus being overstated.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the SEC have
started looking more closely at the research write-offs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a company puts value into the research and development
that should be in good will, it can drastically affect what
earnings they will report to investors in the future,'' said Lynn
Turner, the SEC's chief accountant. He argued that since technology
stocks in particular were trading at very high multiples to their
earnings, even relatively small accounting changes could have a big
impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a high-tech company trading at 40 times earnings, a
write-off that increases earnings by $20 million a year can
increase the company's market cap by $800 million,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Turner declined to discuss the specifics of America Online's
proposed write-offs. But he did say that often the question of
whether a write-off is fair comes down to how soon the research
will produce a marketable product and thus contribute to earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people ascribe a high value to research that is early on in
its development, the commission staff would raise questions,'' he
said. ``There may be a high degree of uncertainty about whether it
will be completed, and so it should have a lower value.''

<P>
   Today, she said, many traditional merchants are opening Web
sites, and she expects that in the future, Web-only retailers like
Amazon.com might open stores, in much the same way that J. Crew
migrated from catalogs to shopping centers. The merged version of
Cybercash is aiming to unify its product line to dominate both
markets.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also expanding its solutions for making it easier
to pay recurring bills on time. The costs for companies to mail
credit card, phone and utility bills each month is substantial, and
Cybercash intends to provide a simple, one-step tool that will
allow customers to go to a Web site, examine their bills and then
authorize payments.
</P>
<P>
   One of Cybercash's strongest assets is its perceived leadership
in these kinds of secure transaction technologies. Michael
Schneider, a vice president at IMC On-Line, an Atlanta-based
company that rents Web space, said the availability of Cybercash
was often crucial in persuading businesses to choose his service.
</P>
<P>
   ``People love the idea of the technology,'' he said, ``and they
get all caught up in it.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a catch: Most merchants, he said, discovered that
their sites did not generate enough business to justify the cost.
``For four or five transactions, having a separate statement, it
just wasn't worth it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Schneider predicted that more businesses would eventually
adopt the technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merchants are scared about the transactions coming in and
knowing whether they're bogus or not,'' he said. ``They're scared
about the unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Cybercash, it is fear of the unknown that drives
sales of security technologies.

CYBERCASH'S LESSON IN WEB SURVIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (ART ADV: A graphic is being sent to NYT graphics clients.

 By PETER WAYNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1994, when the World Wide Web had no commerce to speak of, a
group of computer and credit card-processing experts banded
together and formed a company built around high-security technology
for safely transferring money on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The product failed to find a market. Yet, four years later, the
company, Cybercash, has survived by adapting to the less
sophisticated but far more flexible security technology that was
eventually embraced throughout the Web. And though it is still in
the red, Cybercash has managed to take its stock public and to grow
by merging with a competitor.
</P>
<P>
   The history of Cybercash offers a vivid example of how difficult
it can be for any company to steer proprietary standards into the
unpredictable currents of the Internet _ even when the technology
in question is widely acknowledged to offer a superior product. It
is also a lesson in survival.
</P>
<P>
   That survival has exacted a price. When it became clear that
revenue for the second quarter, which ended on June 30, would be
lower than expected, the company, which is based in Reston, Va.,
laid off 20 percent of its staff, including one founder who
volunteered to leave.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining group of about 200 has sharpened its focus on
areas that already produce revenue. It has moved development of
more ambitious technologies for the next century to the back
burner.
</P>
<P>
   Cybercash's original product was a ``digital wallet,'' a piece
of software intended for home computers, with the idea of keeping
bank accounts and credit card numbers handy and secure. No one
would need to enter a credit card number to buy something because
the wallet would keep it encrypted.
</P>
<P>
   To further reduce fraud, the wallet would hide credit card
information even from merchants, making the system in some ways
more secure than standard retail transactions.
</P>
<P>
   But users shunned the product and gravitated toward a simpler,
nonproprietary alternative known as Secure Sockets Layer, or SSL, a
straightforward system intended to scramble all data passing
between a customer and a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   SSL did not provide any of the digital wallet's sophisticated
features for electronic commerce, but it did offer adequate
security for most transactions. What is more, it was flexible
enough to encrypt everything, including entire Web pages that held
sensitive data.
</P>
<P>
   In a nimble move, Cybercash modified its back-office processing
software for merchants to handle orders generated by SSL. Although
the company did not generate the revenue it had hoped to make with
the wallet concept, it did grab a piece of the action for handling
transactions between online merchants and their banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very nice service,'' said Michael Salim, president of
American Data, a North Carolina company that rents Web space to
retailers and resells Cybercash's processing services to his
customers. ``It really makes the use of credit cards easy.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Salim said, Cybercash's original wallet, which
denominated deposits on hand as virtual coins, ``operated with some
funny money; no one liked that.''
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Loftus, a senior vice president of Cybercash, said the
company was trying to build on that sort of response. But she said
that instead of abandoning the wallet concept, the company would
alter the wallet's design and purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, it was a container for electronic cash,'' Ms.
Loftus said. ``Going forward, we're going to concentrate on making
the buying experience easy, consistent and secure.''
</P>
<P>
   The new wallet, she said, would be more tightly integrated with
the browser and would not require the customer to spend any extra
time to install it.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Condon, Cybercash's chief operating officer, said one
important lesson in the company's evolution had been that the
consumer generally was not greatly concerned about security because
the banks and the merchants pay losses incurred in fraud or theft.
The consumer, he said, was primarily interested in convenience and
in saving time.
</P>
<P>
   Merchants and credit card companies, on the other hand, are
eager to reduce fraud. In an SSL-based system, a user can type any
credit card number, including a stolen one. In such cases, it is
the merchant, not the credit card company, that sustains the loss.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Cybercash will introduce a new generation of
its wallet later this month. Designed to the greatest degree
possible to be transparent to the consumer, it will also
incorporate the new Secure Electronic Transaction standard, or SET,
that is being pushed by the credit card industry.
</P>
<P>
   All the sophistication is aimed at reducing credit card fraud by
distributing electronic identification files known as certificates,
which act like driver's licenses or passports. The certificates
allow computers to generate digital signatures that the credit card
companies hope will weed out the most common types of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, introducing any new standard is filled with danger. In
this case, the most serious challenge will be finding ways to
distribute the certificate files to everyone's home computer. So,
while the next version of Cybercash's wallet product will be
engineered to use certificates, Condon said, the feature will not
be built in.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the company is investing money and resources in
the back-office software that generates most of its revenue. On
April 30, Cybercash completed a merger with a onetime competitor,
IC Verify, a company built on credit card services for
brick-and-mortar merchants. IC Verify had recently begun expanding
into cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Goldberg, a former IC Verify executive who is now a
Cybercash vice president, said that the goal of the companies'
merged operations was to provide merchants with a single tool for
transaction processing.

UC BERKELEY GETS FUNDS TO STUDY A KEY LAW OF CHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAN FOST   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The University of California at Berkeley will receive up to $10
million a year as one of the leading universities in an ambitious
semiconductor research project scheduled to be announced today.
</P>
<P>
   The project _ which eventually will parcel out $60 million a
year to six ``focus center'' universities _ aims to conduct the
long-term research that will drive the rapid, often incredible pace
of technological development.
</P>
<P>
   The driving force in the semiconductor industry has been the
theorem known as Moore's Law. First posited by Intel Corp.
co-founder Gordon Moore in the 1960s, Moore's Law states that the
number of transistors that fit on a chip will double every 18
months. Chips run not only computers, but all sorts of devices,
ranging from cars to clocks.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's Law has held true so far, with Intel's latest Pentium
cramming 8 million transistors on a tiny sliver of silicon. The
industry is confident that it can achieve even more astounding
figures, such as 100 million transistors on a chip.
</P>
<P>
   To get there, however, more research is needed _ into the way
chips are designed, the materials that are used to make them and
the way the finished chips are tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be sure of the continuation of Moore's Law,'' said
CraigBarrett, president and chief executive officer of Santa
Clara-based Intel and the leader of the Semiconductor Industry
Association's technology committee, which spearheaded the new
initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The final details still are being negotiated, but if all goes
according to plan, UC Berkeley will run a focus center dedicated to
research on chip design. Prior university research in that realm
led to the establishment of the two leading companies in
chip-design software, San Jose-based Cadence Design Systems and
Mountain View-based Synopsys.
</P>
<P>
   UC Berkeley would work as the hub, allocating funds and work to
other universities including Stanford University, Carnegie-Mellon
University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the
University of California at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Project leaders also will announce today that the Georgia
Institute of Technology was selected as a focus center. Four other
focus centers will be announced in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Funding will start at about $4.5 million annually, according to
Richard Newton, a professor of electrical engineering and computer
sciences at UC Berkeley and the other project director. Within a
few years, that figure is expected to reach $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Semiconductor Industry Association, the leading trade group
in the chip industry, will pay for half of the research, with the
Defense Department's Defense Advanced Research Project Agency, or
DARPA, and the chip equipment industry consortium SEMI/Sematech
splitting the other half.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement reveals some of the unusual nature of the chip
industry. While the companies in it are fiercely competitive, they
also recognize the importance of funding shared research projects.
</P>
<P>
   Getting support for the initiative ``was like trying to herd a
bunch of cats and get them to march in single file,'' Barrett said.
</P>
<P>
   Chip companies work together on a technology road map that gets
updated every year and published every two years. Each company also
funds its own in-house research and development, which leads to new
products.
</P>
<P>
   But university research often encourages the long-term thinking
that is missing from endeavors tied too closely to companies'
bottom lines. Barrett, a former Stanford professor, recognized the
importance of university research and also saw ``the federal
government pulling back from physical-science research toward
health-sciences research.''
</P>
<P>
   The chip industry also funds Sematech, a Texas-based effort that
researches practical manufacturing efforts, and the Semiconductor
Research Corp., a North Carolina institution that supports
university research. The SRC drew fire from some universities
several years ago for insisting that, in exchange for research
dollars, they surrender certain intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a history of a cultural mismatch between the SRC
and the university community over just what rights come with
(corporate-funded) research,'' said Michael Odza, publisher of
Technology Access, a Novato-based newsletter that covers the
transfer of technology from universities to industry.
</P>
<P>
   That dispute was resolved last year, according to Bill Hoskins,
director of UC Berkeley's Office of Technology Licensing. Companies
get access to the intellectual property developed with their
research dollars but have to pay royalties for other inventions to
which they did not contribute funding.

   Hollywood has treated its sex symbols with a mixture of pride
and prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   The jury is still out on Bo Derek. In the l979 movie ``10'' she
became the world's perfect woman, and an instant corn-rowed sex
symbol.
</P>
<P>
   Today Bo is all of 41 years old and while men at that age can
continue to be box office icons, her sex symbol movie career is
virtually over. However, in October she's coming back _ to the
small screen. Still able to slip easily into a bikini, in ``Wind on
Water,'' a steamy new series on NBC, she's playing a beautiful
widow with two teenage sons, a strong woman battling to keep her
Hawaiian ranch. It's a kind of ``Dallas'' meets ``Bonanza'' via
``Baywatch.''

 &HT;    Hollywood has treated its sex symbols with a mixture of pride
and prejudice. The history of the women who supply the glamour to a
glamour industry is for the most part a sad one.
 &HT;    For many, the more the flashlights popped, the more lines of
print their lives occupied, the less happiness seemed to come their
way. Rita Hayworth was the perfect screen goddess but she could
never quite cope with the adulation that came from her looks,
especially since the real woman behind the facade couldn't ever
measure up.
 &HT;    Marilyn Monroe, who parlayed pinups and calendars into the kind
of stardom even she probably never dreamed of, is now celebrated _
again and again in books and movies _ as a feminist icon. But at
the height of her success she was confused and abused and never
managed to surmount her miserable childhood.
 &HT;    Voluptuary Jayne Mansfield met an untimely end (in a car crash
in l967) before she could prove to anyone that she was anything
more than a superstructure.
 &HT;    Not all sex symbols however have crashed and burned: Raquel
Welch has worn well and is about to remarry at 57. Joan Collins
parlayed her over the top diva image into Our Lady of Perpetual
Glamor. Sharon Stone and Demi Moore are earning up to $12 million a
picture. Stone is happily married to a newspaper editor from San
Francisco while Moore's marriage to Bruce Willis has just bottomed
out.
 &HT;    The jury is still out on Bo Derek. In the l979 movie ``10'' she
became the world's perfect woman, and an instant corn-rowed sex
symbol. As Dudley Moore's fantasy, she ignited the sexual desires
of millions of men around the world.
 &HT;    Today Bo is all of 41 years old and while men at that age can
continue to be box office icons, her sex symbol movie career is
virtually over. However, in October she's coming back _ to the
small screen. Still able to slip easily into a bikini, in ``Wind on
Water,'' a steamy new series on NBC, she's playing a beautiful
widow with two teenage sons, a strong woman battling to keep her
Hawaiian ranch. It's a kind of ``Dallas'' meets ``Bonanza'' via
``Baywatch.''
 &HT;    Two decades ago while Derek had the world at her feet, her life
was hardly her own. Her world and everything in it belonged to her
Svengali _ her domineering director-husband John Derek.
 &HT;    Bo was in her teens when Derek 30 years her senior, who had made
an art of growing sex symbols and marrying them, spotted her and
recreated her to his own blueprint. From then on Derek called the
shots. But in May of this year after a 24-year marriage Derek died
of heart failure, leaving Bo with a huge hole in her life.
 &HT;    She is still a sexy lady, her skin apparently untouched by her
years in the California sun. Wearing tiny granny sunglasses to lend
maturity, her figure is exercise-trim in a gray silk pants suit
over a black blouse, her hair still California beach baby blonde.
She's still Bo, the 10, just a tiny bit older. But the strings are
still visible even though the puppeteer has disappeared.
 &HT;    ``We were together since I was l7,'' she explains seriously,
``and that was my adult life. Now he's gone it hasn't really hit me
yet. It's all very strange.''
 &HT;    Derek had spent his lifetime molding women to fit his preferred
image. A former actor, he did it with Ursula Andress, wife No. 2.
He then photographed Linda Evans, his third wife for sexy magazines
and gained control over Bo when she was little more than a child.
 &HT;    She was a typical California surfer kid named Mary Kathleen
Collins from Long Beach, when Derek first set eyes on her on the
set of an erotic film he was making in Greece. Her mother had come
along as chaperone. Derek called her The Kid because he said he
didn't like her name.
 &HT;    For the Kid, finding her own life distinct from the man who ran
the only one she's known for almost a quarter of a century is a
tough order.
 &HT;    ``It was a matter of either going back to work or jumping off a
cliff,'' says Bo, who still makes her home on the sprawling horse
ranch she shared with her husband in the Santa Ynez Valley, 150
miles north of Los Angeles in the rolling Santa Barbara hills _ far
from the influences of Hollywood.
 &HT;    ``It's an absolute blessing that I have to go to Hawaii to do
the series, '' she admits. ``They are going to tell me when to get
up, where to go and what to say and do. That's important to me
right now. I'm not good at making decisions.''
 &HT;    Ironically, she says before he died Derek tried to talk her out
of doing the show.
 &HT;    ``He shuddered at the idea of me taking the role. Coming back to
Hollywood playing a mother to two adults was not his idea of the
woman he was in love with. He always saw me as The Kid. He couldn't
figure out that I'd grown up. But I felt this was the right thing
to do. I took control of my own career. And that makes it easier
for me to live with now.''
 &HT;    While the evidence of it is all around, not least in everything
she says, she still denies that Derek orchestrated her every move.
 &HT;    ``He was a rebel and he wanted things the way he wanted them.
But we both danced to our own drummer. And we fought battles with
Hollywood. Some we lost, some we won. But it enabled me to sleep
well at night. But then I took my own life in my own hands. I'm not
l7 anymore. ''
 &HT;    Hollywood believed Derek was using his young wife, exploiting
her immaturity to stroke his own ego _ and boost his bank balance.
But Bo says it was never that big a deal.
 &HT;    ``I never took my screen image very seriously,'' she says.
``Blake Edwards (director of ``lO'') was responsible for it. Not me
... although I got a lot of credit for it. Even John got credit for
it, or the blame and he had nothing to do with it,'' she laughs.
 &HT;    The most she and Derek are guilty of, she points out, was going
with the momentum Edwards had started. ``I never made an effort to
change that image. I really didn't. I wasn't out to prove anything.
It was a blessing in my life and made my life an absolute fairy
tale. After '10' I could pretty much do anything I wanted in the
business. So it was my fault if I didn't go to another level. I was
responsible.''
 &HT;    But how does the dancer dance when the dance master is no more?
The new series, she says, will be her life line. ``Wind on Water''
has given her a new family structure.
 &HT;    ``I feel it came at the right time and place in my life. I
believe in the show but it's not about me. It's much bigger than
me. It's about the young people on the show, their problems, their
experiences. I'm just the mom. Mind you I'm never going to be the
sit on the porch kind of mom. ''

Time for a day's break from all-intrusive technology 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I am here today to propose a new national holiday. I
don't think it'll be as much fun as Christmas, or as important as
Mother's Day, but I'm pretty sure it will catch on.
</P>
<P>
   I propose we have a National Low Tech Day. Instead of writing
e-mail to a friend, send them a letter or visit them. Balance your
checkbook by hand. Leave your cellular telephone at home. I'm
suggesting we start right now. Let's make today, the day you read
this column, the first annual observance.
</P>
<P>
   Here's my bet. Instead of finding that your day is more crowded,
you'll have some leisure time for a change. I know computers and
such-like are supposed to make our lives easier. But if computers
and technology continue to make things easier, I'm going to quit my
job and join the Marines.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere along the line I've lost my sweetly naive belief in
the supposition that all this high-tech stuff makes me more
productive and leaves me with more time for leisure. You'd think
I'd be in the catbird seat as far as reaping the benefits of
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Because of my job writing about technology, I have more
electronic and computer gear in my home than the average Navy
destroyer. And when I sit down at my desk at work, I stare at two
computers _ a top-of-the-line Macintosh G3 and a super-fast Pentium
II PC _ that sit close together like two buzzards after a good day
for road kill. At work I stay logged on to the Internet using a T1
line that offers a high-speed connection. I'm well connected at
home, too.
</P>
<P>
   I have computer programs to help me cook a meal, figure my
finances, select a wine, plan a wedding, sue a creditor, buy a
house, build a house, learn to oil paint, figure out why I'm so
neurotic, tell my fortune, discover a new career, do my horoscope,
create my family tree, build a deck and learn to play bridge.
</P>
<P>
   I have a dishwasher with more computer power than the original
Univac; my car has a computer, and so does the exercise bike that I
use, and my cat plays with computerized toys.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever a new gadget hits the market, it's likely that the
manufacturer sends one to the newspaper for us to try. I spend more
on batteries than the average guy.
</P>
<P>
   But _ with all this computing power and gadgetry _ I have no
time at all. In fact, half the time my gadgets and computers
conspire to steal time from me. This morning, I spent an hour
trying to get the office's new e-mail program to work; last week my
car had to have a computer module replaced, so that meant a long
evening at the repair shop. We use a telephone system so
complicated that everyone here had to take a training class just to
be able to use it. I've seen grown men get quivery at the notion of
trying to use our copying machine.
</P>
<P>
   If the computer gurus here at the newspaper upgrade the word
processing system one more time, I'm pretty sure it'll stop working
altogether. And our new high-tech elevators went online here about
two months ago. The day after they went into service, I was trapped
in one for an hour and a half.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I'm ready to celebrate Low Tech Day. I think most of
us need a day when we escape from these electronic servants that
have _ somehow _ become our masters.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not advocating a return to the Dark Ages, but just a day
where we stop and think about how technology often uses us, instead
of us it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's time to celebrate. So get out your hammock and a good
paperback book. And plug yourself into a lazy day.

Visual Page program solid tool for editing, creating Web sites 
By Jack Warner  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Symantec's new Visual Page seems primed to give
Microsoft's Front Page some stiff competition in the niche for Web
page creation programs aimed at the casual user.
</P>
<P>
   Visual Page is a fairly straightforward tool for setting up Web
pages with or without frames. The greatest problem I found was with
its documentation, which wastes the entire ``Getting Started''
booklet showing you how to edit and improve an existing Web site.
</P>
<P>
   If for whatever reason you want to switch HTML editors or go
from one of the competing what-you-see-is-what-you-get programs,
this is certainly a splendid feature. But how many people who buy
this product are going to have an existing Web site they want to
edit?
</P>
<P>
   They are going to want to start from scratch, I should think.
All, however, is not lost, since the ``User Guide'' provides plenty
of information on creating a page from the ground up.
</P>
<P>
   Visual Page includes a special edition of Symantec's WebPainter,
a program intended for creating banners and art for your site. It
is, however, so obtuse all I managed to do was continually cause it
to lock up. Of course, there's always the possibility that I'm
obtuse, too.
</P>
<P>
   Pages are created simply by typing and bringing in objects _
lines, bullets and images _ in a very straightforward manner.
</P>
<P>
   Setting up hyperlinks works somewhat differently than Front
Page. In Front Page, when you want to set up a link to another page
within the site, you are given the option of creating that linked
page at once if it doesn't already exist. In Visual Page, the page
to be linked to has to be already available _ not finished, but at
least started.
</P>
<P>
   You can view each page in your browser _ Netscape or Explorer _
as you work, a very nice way of checking up on how things are
looking. As a matter of fact, if you have both of them installed,
you can check the appearance in both.
</P>
<P>
   Like some page design programs, you can create layers, and lines
and spaces can be adjusted in small increments with the cursor
keys, a very nice feature.
</P>
<P>
   You can, of course, create text in Visual Page, and there's a
spell-checker in the program. On the other hand, you can import
text from your word processor in the same way you would import
graphics. Text, incidentally, can be flowed around an image just as
it can be done in a page layout program.
</P>
<P>
   Cascading style sheets and font family management are available
to help keep some continuity in a page. Links can be automatically
checked and updated to keep your site current.
</P>
<P>
   For those who wish to work in HTML code, there is a color-coded
syntax editor, but I should think a real coder would be embarrassed
to use such a tool.
</P>
<P>
   I believe that when winter arrives and I have more time at my
disposal, I shall create a new personal Web page, and unless
something better comes along I'll do it in Visual Page.

Search engines of old jazzed up as portals 
By Frances Katz  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You've probably been hearing a lot about portals on
the Internet lately. People buying portals, selling portals,
analysts predicting portals are the future.
</P>
<P>
   For the uninitiated, portal is a new name for Web sites that
used to be called ``search engines.'' The difference is that now
these search engines offer much more than just lists of sites: They
have everything from e-mail to free Web pages to stock quotes and
horoscopes. Furthermore, they are all betting the farm their
content will be so compelling and useful you will be willing to
change your browser settings just to look at them before you look
at anything else.
</P>
<P>
   But do these sites have what it takes to keep you coming back
every day? Take a look at the following portals and decide for
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo! (http://www.yahoo.com) is winner and still champion of
portal sites, a start page chock-full of goods and services. And if
you want to search the Web, you can do that, too. Some of the
services it offers include travel arrangements, phone service,
Web-based instant messaging service, free e-mail, celebrity chats,
continuous news updates, special news sections and a variety of
other services too numerous to list here.
</P>
<P>
   But what pushes Yahoo! ahead of any and all competition is that
even your grandmother has probably seen ``chief Yahoos'' David Filo
and Jerry Yang counting their money on the cover of Time magazine.
And when it comes to the dizzying array of choices on the Web, to
borrow from Vince Lombardi, branding isn't everything, it's the
only thing.
</P>
<P>
   And although it seems like only yesterday NBC announced its
partnership in CNet's Snap! (http://www.snap.com), the site
unveiled its new look last week. While anything is an improvement
over the old Snap!, it's still impressive how far they've come.
</P>
<P>
   Snap!, like most portal sites, offers users the ability to
customize the site, but here all you have to do is punch in your
ZIP code and _ voila! _ you've got a personalized weather report
and other links every time you visit.
</P>
<P>
   Its special sections are as good as, if not better, than those
at Yahoo!. The section on the Monica Lewinsky scandal features
links to headlines from newspapers around the country as well as TV
and cable outlets not owned by NBC, giving the site bonus points
for truly trying to offer users the best of the Web. Snap! also has
a fun design scheme that's easy to look at and navigate.
</P>
<P>
   With a vast promotional campaign from NBC planned to coincide
with the new fall TV season, Snap! has a shot at becoming a major
portal player and leapfrogging over its competition.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the wonders of Yahoo! and the novelty of Snap!,
there are still some 35 million Netscape users who can't or won't
change their browser's default page from Netscape's Netcenter
(http://www.netscape.com). Netcenter's much-publicized face lift
this year has certainly spruced up the site, but there's still a
long way to go. You can search the Web, read the news from
ABCNews.com or download the newest version of Netscape and
corresponding plug-ins.
</P>
<P>
   However, unlike Yahoo!, Netcenter's category listings don't
provide comprehensive lists of Web sites but instead offer a
selected ``best of breed'' list of sites that is rather short. What
portal you use may come down to how you like your searches, long
and comprehensive or short and sweet. Netcenter also has an
interesting take on branding, using Netscape's green, blue and
yellow color scheme. It's not real pretty, but you never forget
where you are.
</P>
<P>
   With its nifty slogan, ``Get Lycos or Get Lost,''
Massachusetts-based Lycos (http://www.lycos.com) pioneered the idea
of returning only top-rated sites to users, although users can
still search the Web for a broader search. Lycos is well-organized,
but it's hard to tell what services are available.
</P>
<P>
   The areas Lycos trumpets include its free e-mail service and
links to other search services such as CDNow, Barnes &AMP; Noble,
PeopleFind and CityGuide. Lycos also has a targeted news area
similar to Yahoo! and Snap!, but the links aren't as specific or as
focused as the other two. Through Lycos' sister company, Tripod,
users can build their own Web pages through a link on the site.
It's fun but not a reason in and of itself to push Lycos ahead of
the increasingly stiff competition.

Carefully evaluate legal advice on the Web 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you plan to put your faith _ and perhaps your
fortune _ in the hands of the gurus dispensing free legal advice on
the World Wide Web, you can only hope your next judge has a 17-inch
screen.
</P>
<P>
   But if you use the legal resources you find on the Web to
prepare yourself for a visit with a lawyer, it's possible to save
money and do a better job of preparing for that visit. Whether your
legal needs center on buying a house, getting a divorce or settling
the family estate, you'll find plenty of advice on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best advice you'll find _ and the best place to
start our tour on sites specializing in the law _ comes from a page
called Online Legal Advice: Let the Browser Beware at http://
www.nolo.com/nn223.html. It offers common-sense advice on how to
evaluate the legal information you'll find.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, you'll be told to consider the source of the
information _ not all sites are equal. You're best served by a
lawyer operating in his or her field of expertise. In other words,
don't get estate planning advice from someone who specializes in
criminal law.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also be smart to make sure the information is up to date,
since the law changes as new legal decisions are made. Since it's
likely your own situation will be decided based on the law in the
state where you live, legal sites located in your state may be the
best bet. Also be wary of the ready-to-fill-in legal forms for
wills and divorces that you'll find on some sites. The real trick
isn't getting the form, it's knowing how to fill it in correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Our next stop is a site called Wired Law: Legal Information &AMP;
Advice on the Web at http://
</P>
<P>
   www.primenet.com/wiredlaw /links.htm. This site is especially
valuable because it contains links to many of the legal sites on
the Web, and because those links are organized according to topic.
So if your question concerns property law, for instance, you can go
directly to a site specializing in that field.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is almost certain. Your particular case or problem is
unique. That's why it's unlikely that simply browsing through the
information you find on the Web will be enough. Sooner or later, if
you decide to do more research before seeing a lawyer, you'll need
to go to a law library. Luckily, the law school at Atlanta's Emory
University has an online presence you'll find at http://
www.law.emory.edu/LAW/refdesk/toc.html. You'll be able to search
legal periodicals, law books and the federal statutes.
</P>
<P>
   Law students will also profit from this site, since it also
offers job search information. The site also offers information on
the laws in some other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, when you've followed the last link and read the
last convoluted legal article, it'll be time to find a lawyer. The
Internet also offers resources to help with that quest.
</P>
<P>
   Just stop by a page called FindLaw: Lawyers and Law Firms at
http://www.findlaw
</P>
<P>
   .com/14firms/index.html. Once there, you can search various
directories of lawyers and even take a look at a database that
offers legal aid advice and pointers. You'll also be able to use a
database compiled by the respected legal publishers, West and
Martindale-Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
   You can search based on location or name, or you can use
keywords to find a lawyer with the right specialty.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of the sites visited today, there are no charges
associated with the service. In fact, as a final bit of legal
advice, most lawyers would tell you to avoid the cut-rate,
commercial legal sites you'll find on the Web. If advice is worth
what you pay for it, then the sites that offer to answer legal
questions for fees that range from $20 to $50 may be the most
expensive lawyers you'll ever meet.

 Making A Toolbar Permanent  
 By David Einstein   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Sometimes when ``replying to author'' of an e-mail message,
I will get a toolbar between the header and the body of the message
that allows me to select fonts and formatting. I can change the
text of my reply to boldface, underline or italicize it _ even
change the color.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the toolbar appear, and is there a way to make it a
permanent feature of my computer? I use Windows 95 with Outlook
Express.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  By default, the formatting toolbar appears whenever you
reply to a message that was composed in HTML _ Internet programming
language that allows for the kind of formatting you described. You
also can use HTML for new messages. To display the toolbar for an
individual message, click the Format menu in the New Message
window, then choose Rich Text (HTML). To display the toolbar in all
new messages, click the Tools menu in the main Outlook Express
window, then choose Options. Click the Send tab, then select the
HTML option for the Mail Sending Format.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  I have AOL but have not used it for several months because
I got better service via a local ISP. I have tried in vain to
figure out how to cancel AOL. Any suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; America Online didn't get nearly 13 million subscribers by
making it easy to cancel. There is no way to do it online even
though it's a piece of cake to sign up online. Anyway, you can view
a complete list of ways to cancel by going to the keyword
``cancel.'' In the words of country singer Jo Dee Messina, ``Send a
fax or send me a letter or give me a call, that would even be
better.'' The phone number is (888) 265-8008.

   &UR; Q: &LR;  I keep hearing about what a great deal shareware is. But
I'm not really sure what it is. Can you throw some light on the
subject and also tell me where I can find some shareware?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Shareware is software that you can download and try out for
free. If you like it, you're expected to buy it. Shareware includes
utilities to help manage your PC, games and programs such as image
editors.
</P>
<P>
   Most shareware costs less than regular commercial software. For
instance, I've obtained programs for my PalmPilot for as little as
$12. But just because they're inexpensive doesn't mean they're not
good. Winzip, for instance, is a $29 shareware program that many
consider the best data-compression program available.
</P>
<P>
   Good places to look for shareware include www.shareware.com and
www.hotfiles.com. If you're an AOL user, you also can go to the
keyword ``shareware.'' Note that many top shareware programs can be
found in all of the shareware libraries.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  I've got a problem with my mouse. It keeps freezing, so I
can't even shut down Windows properly. Any ideas?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  It could be one of several problems, says Don Miller,
product specialist for mouse-maker Logitech. But the first thing
you should do is try using the keyboard next time the mouse
freezes. If you can't, it means that your whole system is frozen
and the mouse probably isn't responsible.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely reasons for a frozen mouse, says Miller, are a
problem with the electronic circuits inside the mouse, or a
messed-up driver (a software file that tells the computer how to
use a mouse, printer or other component).
</P>
<P>
   To determine whether the mouse is defective, see if your
computer will work with a different mouse. Or see if your mouse
will work with a different computer.
</P>
<P>
   If the mouse isn't the problem, it's probably the driver _ which
in many cases has been designed specifically for the brand of mouse
you have. Try changing the driver to a generic one that comes with
Windows. You can do this by going to the Mouse icon in the Control
Panel and selecting the General tab.
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't solve your problem, it could be that you have a
problem with your video driver or a port-conflict issue _ which you
may need a trained technician to solve.
</P>
<P>
   TIP OF THE WEEK &QC; Windows 98 lets you make use of the empty space
on the taskbar that resides at the bottom of the display. You can
put your Internet Explorer links there, or a URL address space for
fast access to the Web. You also can have a Quick Launch area for
icons of programs you use a lot. To explore the possibilities,
right-click any blank area on taskbar, then choose Toolbars.

THE MELDING OF MIND WITH MACHINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ROB FIXMER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   We humans have been trying to accelerate our own evolution for
millennia, and while in some ways we appear to be getting away with
it, biological computing could well test the forbearance of Mother
Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the most ambitious efforts to outwit natural
selection have been cloning and the Human Genome Project, which
sets out to map the results of random mutation and natural
selection on our collective genetic inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists embark on these projects not out of mere curiosity
but with the hope of remaking ourselves into organisms more fit for
survival than our ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   But photocopying genes and building a repair manual for them are
only ways of tinkering with natural selection. Far more ambitious
are efforts to meld machines and living cells being undertaken now
in several areas of research. If these endeavors ever realize their
goals, the personal computer will become very personal indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the work of researchers at British Telecommunications
PLC in the area of implanted chips. One project, somewhat ominously
dubbed ``Soul Catcher,'' seeks to develop a computer that can be
implanted in the brain to complement human memory and computational
skills.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, it would enable the gathering of extrasensory
information _ in this case, data transmitted by wireless
networking.
</P>
<P>
   This area of research may seem far-fetched, but it is really the
logical extension of devices like pacemakers, ocular implants,
which simulate hearing for the deaf, and neuro-stimulators, which
send small electrical charges through nerves to alleviate certain
kinds of pain.
</P>
<P>
   In a metaphorical sense, the morphing of man and machine is
already taking place. Among Silicon Valley digit-heads, the human
brain and its products are commonly alluded to as ``wetware,''
while intelligence is expressed in ``bandwidth'' _ as in, ``A lot
of valuable wetware was invested in that product, but we couldn't
sell it to a bunch of low-bandwidth vulture capitalists.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time that electronics is making its way into the
human body, biological organisms are instructing chip design.
British Telecom is investing in Soul Catcher not only for the
long-term potential of brain-chip implants but on the assumption
that, conversely, the workings of the human central nervous system
can teach chip makers a thing or two about network efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   After all, while our information storage capacity and
computational skills are limited compared with those of computers,
the responses of even a 1-year-old child to stimuli like pain,
light or sound suggest that the nervous system is a far more robust
network that the fastest Ethernet.
</P>
<P>
   Biology is already invading computer architecture. Two
University of Rochester professors _ Dr. Animesh Ray, a biologist,
and Dr. Mitsunori Ogihara, a computer scientist _ collaborated two
years ago in building a rudimentary device that uses nucleotides to
perform functions typically handled by transistors in a silicon
processor.
</P>
<P>
   And across the continent, in Santa Clara, Calif., engineers at a
company called Affymetrix are making computer chips containing DNA
to diagnose genetic mutations.
</P>
<P>
   Will the merging of machine and organism bypass evolution or is
it merely an extension of the evolutionary process?
</P>
<P>
   Peter Cochrane, the head of research at British Telecom as well
as a celebrated futurist and a specialist in ``human-computer
interfaces,'' embraces the latter view. In fact, he says the future
of the human species depends on our continuing and expanding
ability to process information. If not, he wrote in a 1996 column
for The Daily Telegraph in Britain, ``systems more efficient at
information processing may supplant us.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the spread of the Internet suggests that people
are already on the threshold of a major evolutionary step as
information-processing organisms.
</P>
<P>
   Communication over the Internet breaks old time and space
bounds, allowing those who are connected to share, interactively,
an enormous and growing wealth of information. The technology
itself is quickly evolving into a sort of global nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine the full consequences of uninterrupted
access to that network through an implanted computer that renders
each of us a node in a global tapestry of information.
</P>
<P>
   Without safeguards, for example, the enhancement of our brains
could easily destroy our minds, leaving us unable to distinguish
reality from virtual reality _ maybe even self from non-self.
Powerful software would have to be developed to help us sort, sift
and prioritize the constant deluge of information lest our brains
degenerate into data landfills.
</P>
<P>
   Many people already feel overwhelmed by information. One more
billboard, radio jingle, dashboard gauge or spam e-mail and we
suspect we will fry like an overloaded circuit.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, perhaps the most frightening question in these
futuristic visions of the mind-machine meld is who or what can be
entrusted to run the system. Who among us would entrust our
innermost thoughts and the plumbing for all this incoming data to
an ``encephalized'' operating system?
</P>
<P>
   Windows 2028, anyone?

Houston: a database. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``These are more than adequate for what we have to do,'' he
said. ``And they have open slots and room to expand. They're good
machines for the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardware companies insist that cases similar to Chung's are an
aberration. Most businesses continue to buy at the higher end of
the PC spectrum, said Ken Kurtzman, vice president for Compaq's
small and medium business division.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are demanding all the power we can give them,'' he said.
``Many small to medium businesses are using these computers to run
their entire business. They're doing their own marketing, and using
the computers to do complex graphics. They run their accounting
department on them, and a small business running its receivables on
a spreadsheet can rapidly turn it into a very big spreadsheet that
needs a lot of power to recalculate.''
</P>
<P>
   Other businesses are buying at the high end of the PC power
scale because they want to standardize on one design. If 20 people
in a building need a 400-megahertz Pentium II, it may be cheaper to
put that kind of computer on everyone's desk, rather than mix and
match different systems.
</P>
<P>
   Intel and other chip makers work with the makers of PCs to
market new and more powerful uses for personal computers, not
always with the most successful of results.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Intel has been pushing the use of PCs in desktop
video conferencing, a technology that requires both a powerful
computer and a fast connection to the Internet or a local network.
But users have found little to get excited about.
</P>
<P>
   In a news release titled ``Videoconference: A Technology
Solution Without an Obvious Problem,'' market research firm
International Data Corp. reported that most businesses did not
consider the technology a high priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survey findings clearly reveal that potential users are not
seeing videoconferencing as a necessity, and vendors are having
trouble making a compelling argument for the adoption of this
technology,'' the IDC report said.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Alter, director of microprocessor marketing and business
planning at Intel, said she thinks videoconferencing will take off
_ someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think an application is going to be there, then someone
has to get out in front with that application,'' Alter said. ``If
it's not going to be us, then it's not going to be anyone else. We
might have been a little early with it, but I think you will see
this adopted.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel also makes investments in the development of
non-processor-related technologies. For example, it's been heavily
involved in promoting new standards for faster Internet connections
into businesses and homes. That will make it easier for Intel to,
in turn, promote connection- and processor-intensive applications,
such as _ you guessed it _ videoconferencing
</P>
<P>
   One of the applications that does require a powerful computer is
gaming. While today's 3-D games will run well enough on systems
with year-old technology, they really scream on modern,
cutting-edge PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Both Intel and its chief chip rival, Advanced Micro Devices, or
AMD, have been courting computer gamers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, AMD has cozied up to the 3-D game community by
sponsoring the Professional Gamers League, an attempt to turn
computer gaming into a professional sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gamers always seem to be the early adopters _ the state of the
art is more important to them,'' said Ben Anixter, vice president
of external affairs at AMD.
</P>
<P>
   Because they require more sophisticated hardware to run at their
best, games are probably one of the most hardware-sensitive genres
for software development. Game developers walk a fine line between
being able to create a cool-looking game and ensuring there are
enough systems that can play it.
</P>
<P>
   Hardware and software developers try to keep on top of the
hardware vs. software cycle by tracking developments in each
other's arena. But it's not always easy. Hardware companies often
have problems getting their products out the door, as do software
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have very good relationships with most of the hardware
vendors, from the 3-D chip makers to Intel,'' wrote John Carmack,
one of the co-founders of the Mesquite-based game company id
Software, in an e-mail. Id's most recent game, Quake II, is
considered to be one of the most challenging for any PC to run, and
computer and graphic card makers often include benchmarks derived
from the game as proof of their systems' capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Id currently is working on the third game in its Quake series,
to be called Quake III: Arena. Carmack has said it will require
even more computing and graphics horsepower than Quake II. And, he
hopes, the hardware will be on gamers' desks when the package is on
store shelves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel provides very dependable road maps, but the 3-D chip
guys are a lot more like game companies _ `It will be done in six
months. Maybe. We hope.'''

FEW PC USERS FLEXING MACHINES' NEW MUSCLES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c.1998 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ George Bush stormed the desert of Kuwait with hundreds
of thousands of soldiers, high-tech missiles and the latest stealth
aircraft. But today, the former president's office in Houston makes
do with lowly Pentium 133 personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   And they're refurbished ones, at that.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to the consultants who set up and maintain the
computer network at Bush's office, they work quite nicely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, that's a significant upgrade for them, considering
what they had just earlier this year,'' said Terry Tisdale, a
senior technical staff member at Insource Technologies. ``They were
running on 486-33s.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's office workers use basic business applications _ word
processing, spreadsheets, e-mail, World Wide Web browsers _ and the
older computers handle these jobs just fine.
</P>
<P>
   They, and many other businesses and individuals, are taking
advantage of a cycle in PC technology in which low-cost hardware is
more than adequate for most computing tasks. Low-cost systems are
no longer technological weaklings.
</P>
<P>
   People can buy powerful computers today for well under $1,000
that, a year ago, cost in the $2,500 to $3,000 price range.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes the people at Intel cringe,'' said Nathan
Brookwood, an analyst at Dataquest, a market research firm that
studies technology trends. ``Even though hardware has gotten more
and more powerful, people are basically doing the same things with
it and using the same kind of software tools as they did three
years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The current state of hardware/software balance is the opposite
of where it was three years ago, when new operating systems from
Microsoft bogged down the most commonly used processor technology
of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember that machine you purchased in 1992, with an 80486
chip running at 33 megahertz or 66 megahertz?'' asked Brookwood.
``And remember how nicely Windows 3.1 ran on it? Then you put
Windows 95 on it and you said, `Oh my God, what happened to slow
this machine down?'''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Beilinson, a product manager at Microsoft who works on the
Windows NT operating system, said that while the microprocessor is
one of the most crucial factors in PC performance, there are
others. They include the amount of system memory; the speed of the
hard drive; the graphics card; and, for machines connected to a
network or the Internet, the speed of that connection.
</P>
<P>
   Some applications tax computers more than others, as does the
way people use them. Simple programs, such as word processors and
e-mail, don't make many demands on a PC. Graphics programs and
cutting-edge, 3-D games put more stress on a computer's hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Users who run many different programs at once _ such as a word
processor, a spreadsheet, e-mail, a Web browser, a presentation
graphics program and personal information manager _ also put heavy
demands on a PC.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of load is unusual, though. Microsoft estimates that
the average user has only three programs running simultaneously on
Windows 95/98 PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say computers selling at the low end of the market
today can handle these situations with ease. As a result, most
buyers don't need to drop big bucks on higher-powered _ and
higher-priced _ systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't many people who really need a Pentium II,''
Brookwood said.
</P>
<P>
   Most sub-$1,000 systems sold today use either an Intel Pentium
MMX chip, or one from a competing chip maker that is compatible
with the Pentium design. The processors run at speeds of 200 to 233
megahertz, and the systems have 32 megabytes of memory _ more than
enough to run several moderate-sized programs comfortably. That
configuration is similar to Apple Computer's new iMac system, aimed
at consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Such systems sold for much more about this time last year.
Houston's Compaq Computer Corp., for example, was selling
233-megahertzPresario systems for between $1,700 and $2,700 last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Compaq offers a 266-megahertz Presario that uses an
Advanced Micro Devices K6 chip _ a clone of the Pentium MMX
processor _ for $899.
</P>
<P>
   And $2,600 today will get you a 400-megahertz Pentium II system
with 128 megabytes of memory, a 10-gigabyte hard drive and
impressive 3-D graphics. Analysts say that a year from now these
systems will cost less than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Processors have increased dramatically in power since the days
of the early 80486, Intel's primary chip available at the time
Windows 95 was introduced. A 66-megahertz 80486 chip would handle
54 million instructions per second. By comparison, a 133-megahertz
Pentium chip _ the kind used in former President Bush's office _
can do nearly 219 million instructions per second. And a Pentium
Pro chip running at 200 megahertz _ used primarily in file server
computers as part of corporate networks _ can handle up to 300
million instructions per second.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Brookwood pointed out, most software hasn't changed much
in the last three years. Windows 98 and Windows 95 are
architecturally similar under the hood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Office 97 is not that much more of a power hog than Office 95
was,'' Brookwood said. ``Except maybe for games, there have been no
real new mainstream applications that stress the hardware.''
</P>
<P>
   Anita Haines, a retired geophysicist, recently set out to buy a
new computer. She'd budgeted between $1,800 and $2,000, but wound
up paying about half that for a 233-megahertz Packard Bell
computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have bought a more expensive one, but I wanted to get
a Zip drive, better speakers, accessories and things like that,''
Haines said.
</P>
<P>
   She uses her computer for word processing, Internet access,
personal finance and low-level graphics. She produces a club
newsletter on her system.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, there's nothing I've found that it won't do,'' she
said. ``I'm very impressed with the speed, considering that I'm
moving up from a 486-66.''
</P>
<P>
   Businesses also are finding that they can get along with less
than the state of the art.
</P>
<P>
   Michael S. Chung, director of Transworld Academy, a Houston
medical vocational school, recently walked into Office Depot and
came out with five $799 Presario computers for use in his offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I could have afforded more, but it was a good value,''
Chung said.
</P>
<P>
   The five computers are joined on a network at the school,
handling word-processing chores and sharing a database.

 Apple's iMac Is Already a Big Hit  
 By Jon Swartz   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Apple Computer, it's beginning to feel a lot like 1984 all
over again.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's iMac, an eye-catching new home computer that resembles
the original 1984 Macintosh in its breakthrough design and ease of
use, has already shattered the company's record for first-week
orders, with 150,000. The $1,299 computer, which sports a gently
curved aquamarine plastic case, is scheduled to ship Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our single biggest product launch since 1984,'' interim
Apple CEO Steve Jobs said in a telephone interview yesterday. ``The
feedback retailers are getting for this product is the most
exciting they've seen in years.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer dealers also noted a steep run-up in advance orders of
the ``Internet-ready'' computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never seen this type of excitement from our customers
surrounding a new PC,'' CompUSA CEO Jim Halpin said in a statement.
``We think (iMac) has the potential to become one of (our)
best-selling consumer computers of all time.''
</P>
<P>
   The $1,299 computer is targeted at the 10 million consumers who
own Macs, but have been slowly defecting to cheaper Windows PCs.
</P>
<P>
   While the sleek Internet terminal has won high marks for its
speed and ease of use, detractors contend it is too simple. They
criticize the iMac for lacking basic connections for printers and
other peripherals, omitting a standard floppy drive and being
difficult to customize.
</P>
<P>
   But despite its shortcomings, an estimated 400,000 units are
expected to ship by the end of September, fueling a sales spike
over the next six months and feeding a recent resurgence at Apple.
</P>
<P>
   Apple intends to stoke the flames of consumers' interest in iMac
with a major radio campaign, beginning yesterday, in which 20
stations nationwide are giving away an iMac daily until its
Saturday debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fun week,'' Jobs said. ``We intend on putting tens
of thousands of these on shelves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The iMac is the high-tech equivalent of the New Beetle, but it
is reasonably priced,'' said Matthew Rothenberg, director of online
content for Mac Publishing, which yesterday launched iMacworld, a
Web site devoted to the new computer. ``By wedding solid
performance and a groundbreaking design, (iMac) could be a dynamite
combination.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple's turnaround _ punctuated by three straight profitable
quarters and a rising stock price _ hasn't gone unnoticed on Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Investments, the Boston-based mutual fund giant, has
given Apple a big vote of confidence in recent months by scooping
up millions of company shares. The company last month raised its
stake to 12.29 percent, or 16.7 million shares, from 5.75 percent
(7.6 million shares) on March 31, making it the largest Apple
shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   Apple shares yesterday improved $1.44,to $37.94 _ nearly triple
its trading price at the start of the year.

APPLE REPORTS 150,000 ORDERS FOR NEW IMAC MACINTOSH IN ONE WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Apple Computer said on Monday that it had
received more than 150,000 orders for its new iMac Macintosh
computer since the company began taking orders a week ago. The
iMac, which is aimed at the consumer and education markets, goes on
sale on Aug. 15 at a suggested retail price of $1,299.
</P>
<P>
   Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., has high hopes for the iMac,
which features a translucent green case, an integrated monitor and
an illuminated mouse, and some analysts have estimated that the
company could sell more than 1 million of the new machine in its
first year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the largest first week order Apple has ever gotten for
any new product,'' Steven Jobs, Apple's interim president and chief
executive, said in a telephone interview. ``The channel is going
pretty crazy for this,'' Jobs added, referring to personal computer
dealers and distributors, many of whom have been accepting advance
customer orders for the iMac for months, but could only order from
Apple beginning on Aug. 3.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Apple shares closed at $37.9375, up $1.4375, in
Nasdaq trading. For three consecutive quarters, a resurgent Apple
has reported earnings that exceeded Wall Street analysts'
estimates, and many have been counting on a strong start of the
iMac to continue that trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will go nuts in the fourth quarter,'' said Kimball
Brown, an analyst with Dataquest, who said his only reservation
concerned Apple's reliance on a new connection scheme, called USB,
for printers, floppy disk drives and other peripheral devices. But
in schools and offices, where such devices are often shared on a
network, USB is not an issue. ``In education, this is a dream
machine,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   The use of USB, or universal system bus, means that the iMac
cannot connect directly to older printers, and there are fewer new
devices using USB than many industry watchers had anticipated at
this time. Yet several companies already offer adaptors that allow
the use of non-USB devices with the iMac, so the problem is not
insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   Apple also had good news on the software front, saying that more
than 460 new or upgraded software applications had been announced
for the Macintosh since the introduction of the iMac on May 6.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's declining market share in recent years had prompted
numerous software developers to abandon the Macintosh, but the
return of Jobs, and Apple's return to profitability, coupled with
excitement over the new machine, have brought many back to the
fold.

 Sorting Out Cybershrinks  
 By Jamie Beckett   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In these cyber times, you can find love and lose it, gamble your
fortune away or shop 'til you drop a bundle _ all without leaving
your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Now can you get help there, too.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of therapists are setting up online practices
that provide counseling over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not therapy, but it can be therapeutic,'' said David
Sommers, a Kensington, Md., psychologist who went online in 1995,
one of the first to offer counsel by e-mail. Although Sommers
eventually found his Internet practice too time-consuming, more
than 100 other psychologists have since hung out electronic
shingles. That's generating controversy in psychological circles,
where many worry about the lack of controls or research on online
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The types of therapy offered online are as varied as the
therapists themselves. Besides individual psychotherapists, there
are specialists in the problems of clergy, sex offenders and police
officers. Many sites promise help with sex or relationship problems
_ and, appropriately, some even specialize in problems with online
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Some counselors answer a single question by e-mail for a fee.
Others do ongoing electronic counseling. Still others offer group
or one-on-one chats. Fees range from $15 to $45 per e-mail query.
Therapy by keyboard is no substitute for the real thing _
especially for those with serious emotional problems. (It probably
isn't much good for the Web-addicted, either.)
</P>
<P>
   But cybershrinks say their services can be helpful, especially
for people who live in remote areas, disabled people, those who
travel a lot, and those too embarrassed or rushed to see a
therapist in person.
</P>
<P>
   Web therapy has provoked fierce debate among psychologists. The
American Psychological Association (APA) set up a task force to
study the issue and has scheduled two discussions on it as part of
its annual convention in San Francisco beginning this Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's impossible to be ethical and provide services to
new patients via e-mail,'' said Marlene Mahue, a San Diego
psychologist and a member of the APA task force. Mahue, who
publishes the online Self-Help and Psychology Magazine at
www.cybertowers.com/ selfhelp, said therapists are trained to read
visual and auditory signals from patients and can't properly
evaluate people based on written text only.
</P>
<P>
   She also worries about the anonymity of the Internet _
therapists have no way of knowing exactly who it is they are
treating. Likewise, anyone can set up a Web site and purport to be
a therapist.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no supervision and no research (on Internet therapy).
People are just doing it,'' said Thomas Nagy, a Palo Alto
psychologist who teaches ethics at Stanford University's department
of psychiatry.
</P>
<P>
   Many online shrinks share such concerns, and they urge patients
to proceed with caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in the Wild West era,'' said John Grohol,
president of the newly formed International Society for Mental
Health Online. Grohol, who runs free mental health chats online at
www.grohol.com/chats.htm, collaborated with Martha Ainsworth, a
Princeton, N.J., Internet communications counselor, on a Web site
at www.metanoia.org that lists online therapists and checks their
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Grohol and others are still excited about the possibilities
offered by the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet offers a great way of expanding treatment
options,'' said Jeanne Rust, a Tucson, Ariz., eating-disorders
counselor (www.edrecovery.com). Rust treats patients in such
far-flung spots as Australia, Malaysia and Switzerland via
real-time Internet chats. She's planning to open an
eating-disorders treatment center in Tucson that will offer two
months of online follow-up therapy.
</P>
<P>
   She also uses the Web to keep in touch with her local patients,
who e-mail her daily with lists of what they ate and how they felt
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes people will write me things that would take months
to say in face-to-face therapy,'' Rust said.

 Novell Nears Acid Test With NetWare 5  
 By David Einstein   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The day of reckoning is close at hand for Eric Schmidt, the
former super nerd at Sun Microsystems who heads Novell.
</P>
<P>
   The Provo, Utah, company announced yesterday that NetWare 5 will
go on sale by September 20. It is the first major upgrade of
Novell's flagship product since 1994 _ and some believe its best
chance to stem Microsoft's headlong assault on a market that Novell
once dominated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Novell is under significant pressure to have a very successful
product,'' said Dan Kusnetzky, research analyst with International
Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   NetWare 5 is built entirely on the technology of the Internet,
allowing companies to seamlessly blend their Intranets and
corporate networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brings down the barrier between them,'' said John Slitz,
Novell's senior vice president of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   In the year and a half since Schmidt became chief executive of
Novell, he has remolded the company to fit his vision of a future
in which all networking will revolve around the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, he has trimmed 1,000 jobs _ about one-fifth of
the workforce _ while purging about half of the company's managers
and installing his own team.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt has brought financial stability back to Novell, which
lost $122 million in the first full quarter after he took over. It
has made money in the past three quarters, and its stock hit a
52-week high of $13.50 last month. It closed yesterday up 6 cents
at $10.88.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues have been flat, however, and still are running at an
annual rate of about half the $2 billion that the company posted in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Novell's slide has coincided with the rise of Windows NT,
Microsoft's network operating software. Although NetWare still
boasts more than 80 million users, Windows NT now is outselling it
in new installations.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt made it clear that he intends to regain the momentum
that previous management squandered through a combination of
ill-fated acquisitions, poor marketing and product delays.
</P>
<P>
   ``With NetWare 5, customers leap ahead of the pack with smarter,
more manageable and efficient networks,'' he said. ``Novell has
regained its rightful place as the only networking vendor that can
get them there.''
</P>
<P>
   By emphasizing NetWare's integration with the Internet, Novell
hopes to counter Microsoft's argument that Windows NT works better
than NetWare in corporate networks that use Windows-based PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Novell is heavily promoting NetWare's directory feature, which
lets network administrators manage various parts of the network.
Novell generally is considered better than Microsoft in that area.
</P>
<P>
   Slitz said NetWare 5 also outguns Windows NT when it comes to
working on large network servers.
</P>
<P>
   But Novell isn't just battling Microsoft. It also must fight its
own past mistakes, especially the initial version of NetWare 4,
which was full of bugs and didn't always work with previous
versions of the software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Novell really needs something to set a fire underneath the
company,'' said analyst Bruce Raabe of Collins &AMP; Co. Whether
NetWare 5 can do that is unclear, but Raabe said that ``having a
product like this can't hurt.''

   The Houston Chronicle is planning a three-day sports series on
creatine, a controversial dietary supplement that is being used by
middle school, high school, college and professional athletes to
build muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, creatine sales are booming _ from $50 million
in 1996 to $100 million last year. Sales of $300 million are
expected this year.
</P>
<P>
   Creatine is not an anabolic steroid. But whether it's safe is a
matter of ongoing debate among sports medicine doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Mackie Shilstone, conditioning consultant for the San Francisco
Giants, has steered players toward creatine, but he has misgivings:
``The one question that hangs out there is, what effect does it
have on the heart?''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   CREATINE-ATHLETES (Undated) _ Mark McGwire swears by it. Jeff
Bagwell and Craig Biggio both use it regularly. Creatine has
emerged as the latest magic potion among professional athletes _
and among the younger athletes who watch their every move. But is
the muscle supplement safe?
</P>
<P>
   CREATINE-DOCTORS (Houston) _ Dr. John Nash, a Houston
chiropractor who has worked with college athletes and the U.S.
women's Olympic volleyball team, says, ``Creatine per se may not be
a problem, but the lack of fluids can be a major problem. And we
don't know much about how it reacts with whatever other supplements
are being used.''

   CREATINE-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Ten questions and answers about

</P>
<P>
   CREATINE-EDGE (Houston) _ Athletes who are seeking an extra edge
are turning to diet supplements. Phil Garner, manager of the
Milwaukee Brewers, has seen attitudes on nutrition change
drastically since he played baseball in the 1970s and '80s. ``When
I got into baseball,'' he said, ``if you didn't drink a six-pack
and puke before a day game, you weren't a man. Now, a lot of guys
don't drink, but you wonder about all these other things that make
you feel good and strong.''
</P>
<P>
   DAY 3
</P>
<P>
   CREATINE-STEROIDS (Houston) _ Dr. Bill Bryan of the Baylor
Sports Medicine Institute believes steroid use has declined in the
past decade. But he said, ``Once you get into the elite levels of
athletics, the least bit of performance enhancement becomes
important, and those people will try all the tricks.'' Last month,
Olympic shot-put champion Randy Barnes and Olympic sprinter Dennis
Mitchell tested positive for performance-enhancing banned
substances.

FREE ADVICE FOR THE FIRST STUD 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Hey, Bill, don't sweat it. You can be
interrogated on closed-circuit television and make special
prosecutor Ken Starr look like Marcia Clark after going through the
Johnnie Cochran Carwash in a convertible.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, like Mayor Willie Brown of San Francisco suggests, you'll
let the testimony be broadcast nationwide. So Starr wants leaks?
Pay him back with a tsunami of sincerity. Like Brown says, you're a
star, our Mick Jagger.
</P>
<P>
   Free Advice No. 1: Don't emulate Brown and say you have no
ex-girlfriends.
</P>
<P>
   No, just get Starr off your cloud, and don't sweat it. Take it
from me, a guy who walked blocks to a deposition in Washington in
an Internet free-speech lawsuit and arrived soaked and wrinkled.
</P>
<P>
   Free Advice No. 2: Make like Letterman and keep the air
conditioning dialed down to 55. It's OK for Mick to sweat, but not
you. Don't ever let them see your makeup run.
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of people, I was dismayed to read that the entire
White House inner circle is meticulously preparing our president
for his TV appearance before the grand jury. It's a multiple first
in American politics and show business, and they're advising him on
everything from the color of his suit to his enunciation of ``I
don't recall.''
</P>
<P>
   This is very disillusioning. I always thought Clinton was the
Laurence Olivier of presidents and could get high poll ratings by
reading the phone book.
</P>
<P>
   It's like finding out that Willie Brown has to have a personal
shopper.
</P>
<P>
   Free Advice No. 3: Don't talk too much. Look, I know it's hard,
Bill, and you have a speech handicap called glib-o-mania.
</P>
<P>
   Some words and phrases to avoid: Don't say ``that woman.'' Don't
say oral sex isn't sex. Don't say ``stain'' unless it's part of ``I
abstain.''
</P>
<P>
   Say ``I don't know,'' ``could be'' or ``I don't remember'' with
an air of authority.
</P>
<P>
   Look, I can understand the difficulties of a president's giving
a one-man show as himself after a career of playing everything to
everybody. It's especially hard when an impeachment panel may be
doing the reviewing instead of theater or TV critics.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Clinton is undergoing numerous ``mock
interrogations'' on his alleged affair with Monica Lewinsky by his
lawyers, and among those lawyers is his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Why do I get the idea those interrogations aren't particularly
mock? Why do I worry about White House lamps flying at taxpayers'
expense? Maybe the president is being over-coached. Maybe he should
try method acting.
</P>
<P>
   Let me put it like an acting coach. What is your motivation for
this scene, Bill? To keep from being drummed out of office, and
finding that the Clinton Library is an 18-and-over Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Free Advice No. 4: Don't wear a blue dot over your face. If
Starr gives you gloves to try on, think latex undergloves. No
glove, no love.
</P>
<P>
   May I suggest a conservative blue suit, fresh from the cleaners,
like the one you wore before the American people in January when
you denied having ``sexual relations'' with ``that woman''?
</P>
<P>
   Free Advice No. 5: In that January TV appearance, your advisers
took down the pictures on the wall behind you, so as not to detract
from you, the very handsome president. Maybe you want some pictures
up there this time.
</P>
<P>
   Some ideas, depending on the thrust of your testimony: George
Washington with the cherry tree, Alfred E. Neuman or Steve Martin.
It all depends on whether you say ``I cannot tell a lie,'' ``What,
me worry?'' or ``I forgot.''
</P>
<P>
   Free Advice No. 6: Don't let the camera show the kneehole under
your desk in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Free Advice No. 7: Have you given any thought to playing
background music? Try your friend Barbra Streisand singing verses
like ``People, people who need people many times a day.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, would be part of the unlimited,
let-it-all-hang-out strategy. This also would involve bringing a
note from Dr. Ruth, wearing the gold chains of a sad old swinger
and pledging to take the Sexaholics Anonymous 12-step program.
</P>
<P>
   First step: Recognize a higher power, namely Oprah.
</P>
<P>
   If you broadcast your testimony to the American people, they may
be most sympathetic to that strategy. Think of all the sex addicts
and compulsive liars who go on talk shows and confess, all to great
acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, you may want to provide a studio audience to
whoop, cheer and say ``Aw'' on cue. Bolt their chairs down, though,
in case Republican ringers try to throw them, a la Springer.
</P>
<P>
   If you decide to use the unlimited, let-it-all-hang-out approach
(also known as ULIAHO _ yell it loud at moments of joy), forget
Free Advice 1 through 4.
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead, sweat like a revivalist preacher, World Wrestling
Federation star or, yes, Mick Jagger doing the rooster dance.
</P>
<P>
   Make it sincere sweat, though, and let Oprah clutch your sweaty
paw. ``Ah have sinned, Amurrica, but mah wife lets me.''
</P>
<P>
   You don't need any coaching on that. We'll feel your pain. Just
don't come to me for advice on your impeachment.
</P>

DEPUTY SAYS PEPPER SPRAY IS SAFE ENOUGH TO EAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SETH ROSENFELD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A Humboldt County sheriff's deputy testified
that pepper spray was so safe that people could use it instead of
horseradish.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you wanted to spray it on your dinner steak ... certainly
you could spray it on your steak and eat it,'' Deputy Wayne Hanson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hanson's remark came Tuesday in the second day of a trial in San
Francisco federal court on whether deputies used excessive force in
wiping pepper spray directly around the eyes of nine people
protesting the Pacific Lumber Co.'s plans to cut old-growth trees
in and around the pristine Headwaters Forest.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit claims this was an unprecedented use of pepper spray
not sanctioned anywhere else. Officials for the Northern California
county said the use of pepper spray at three separate protests was
proper and that they are prepared to do it again.
</P>
<P>
   Macon Cowles, the plaintiff's lead lawyer, began Tuesday's
session by questioning Hanson in an effort to show that sheriff's
training manuals recommended the spray for physically aggressive
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Hanson acknowledged that state memos said the spray was
``designed to incapacitate aggressors'' and was effective against
``vicious animals.'' But he maintained it also could be used to
induce inmates to leave their cells and posed less risk of injury
than twisting a wrist.
</P>
<P>
   He said he knew of no reported case of permanent injury due to
the spray, calling it ``a pretty minor use of force.''
</P>
<P>
   The second witness, Vernell Spring Lundberg, said she felt
intense pain when deputies rubbed the liquid around her eyes during
a Sept. 25, 1997, anti-logging protest at Pacific Lumber's Scotia
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most pain I ever felt,'' said then-17-year-old
Lundberg as she ran a finger across her eyelid to show jurors where
a deputy swabbed her. ``I could not get enough air. I was trying to
breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Harris, one of her lawyers, played a sheriff's videotape of
the protest that brought widespread criticism of the swabbing when
the video was televised last year.
</P>
<P>
   It showed seven peaceful protesters sitting in a circle on the
floor of the lumber company office, holding each other with
homemade metal devices called ``black bears.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``lock box'' devices _ pieces of pipe through which the
protesters slide their arms and lock hands _ were intended to delay
police efforts to remove them from the protest, Lundberg testified.
</P>
<P>
   The deputies warned the demonstrators that if they did not leave
in five minutes, the officers would use pepper spray. Three
protesters left.
</P>
<P>
   The deputies, who appeared to be gentle throughout, then held
back the head of each of those remaining and applied the spray with
cotton swabs. The demonstrators remained passive, but cried in pain
and gasped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only did one eye. I'm going to do the other eye if you don't
release,'' one deputy told a protester.
</P>
<P>
   After repeated applications failed to prompt the demonstrators
to unlock themselves, the deputies sprayed them with water to wash
off the pepper spray.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the deputies carried the four outside on gurneys.
Lundberg and her partner unlocked themselves, but deputies cut
loose the other two.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Delaney, a lawyer for the sheriff's department, said the
mixed results led the deputies to use heavier doses of pepper spray
at two subsequent demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is expected to last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs, who do not claim they were permanently injured,
seek unspecified payments for pain and suffering and a finding that
the applications violated the Fourth Amendment's ban on
unreasonable seizures of their bodies.

 &HT;    UT seating plan riles students
 &HT;    By Angela Shah
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ University of Texas graduates and students have
always claimed to have a special relationship with God. They say
the burnt orange sunset is proof positive that the Almighty is a
proud Longhorn.
</P>
<P>
   But some students aren't praising UT athletics officials' plan
to put them closer to the heavens by elevating about 2,000 student
seats to the new upper deck on the east side of Royal-Memorial
Stadium. They say the reassignment unfairly separates student fans
from the action on the football field.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a good view of the entire field, but the players look
like ants,'' said Daniel Knight, president of Beta Alpha Rho, a
pre-law fraternity whose members usually buy football tickets
through block seating reserved for student groups. ``You lose the
feeling of being right there in the game. You can't get that in the
upper deck. It ruins the whole atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   UT student David Bain said he won't be buying tickets to
football games this year, because he'd have to move up for alumni
and student recruits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The students provide the pageantry of what the entire
experience of going to the game is about,'' said Bain, a
22-year-old accounting student. ``I have a number of friends who
are football players, and they say that the greatest motivation is
to look over and see us cheering.''
</P>
<P>
   But athletics' officials say the student uproar is overblown.
There are still about 11,000 student seats in the lower deck. Chris
Plonsky, UT associate athletic director for external services, said
the new seating arrangement gives most students better views.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until they see the upper deck, I wish they'd reserve
judgment,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The seats are on the east side's lower deck in the first six
rows and the last 10 rows between the north 30-yard line and the
field's southern end line. Some of the lower deck seating will be
converted to chair-back seats for alumni and donors, costing almost
$1,500 for season tickets to home games this year. Other seats will
be reserved for athletic recruits and certain university athletes.
</P>
<P>
   The seat switch is part of a $93million stadium renovation that
includes the new upper deck, 66 skyboxes, a stadium country club,
chair-back seats and other improvements. The upper deck is expected
to open just days before the first home football game Sept.
5against New Mexico State.
</P>
<P>
   It's not unusual for students to be assigned to the upper
sections.
</P>
<P>
   Although as many as 5,000 Texas A&AMP;M University student tickets
are available on Kyle Field's lower deck, the majority sit in the
upper deck, said Jim Kotch, A&AMP;M's athletic ticket manager.
</P>
<P>
   In the Midwest, two recent university stadium renovationshad
different effects on student seating. University of Notre Dame
officials added 22,000 seats to their football stadium last year,
but didn't change the traditional student section _ seniors at
midfield and freshmen in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   But when Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., renovated
its stadium last year, students objected to a plan to shift about
1,800 seats toward the goal line, said Mark Wesoloski ,
Northwestern's assistant ticket manager. Officials and students
agreed to shift only 746 seats, he said.
</P>
<P>
   UT Student Government President Annie Holand cq said she also
hopes to broker a compromise with athletics officials in Austin.
She suggested some tweaking of the luck-of-the draw ticket-buying
system. She suggests allowing students to decide whether they want
to sit in the upper deck or the horseshoe area of the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Student spirit groups, such as the 360-member UT marching band,
also rely on students to excite spectators, said Paula Crider,
director of UT's Longhorn Bands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current student body is definitely our strongest voice in
the stadium,'' Crider said. ``But, hopefully, spreading them around
will electrify (the rest of) the crowd.''

as $276 a pair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand it's a matter of money'' for the athletics
department, he said. ``But it's getting expensive . . . to pretty
much sit up there and bake.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Wilson, a 1972 UT business school graduate and Austin
attorney, spends nearly $1,000 each year on football tickets and
has attended every home game since 1969.

   He hopes the students get over it: ``If they're worried about
where they're sitting,'' he said, ``they're entirely too sober.''

OUT OF BRICKS AND MORTAR, A NEW ORLEANS TALE EMERGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ There are long waiting lists for apartments in the
Pontalba buildings, two red-brick symbols of antebellum grandeur
that face each other across Jackson Square in the French Quarter.
And since the city of New Orleans controls the ``Upper Pontalba''
and the state owns the ``Lower'' there have long been suspicions
that politics helps pick the tenants.
</P>
<P>
   Framing a daily scene of street artists, musicians, tarot seers,
magicians, and mimes, the buildings seem steeped in prestige and
romance, yet few people knew the strange history behind the
properties until the recent publication of the book ``Intimate
Enemies,'' an account of an arranged marriage in the 19th century,
a bloody family feud over money, and a strong-willed woman, the
Baroness Micaela Almonester de Pontalba.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on 20 years of research in New Orleans and Paris, author
Christina Vella, a history professor at Tulane University, has
written a narrative of Micaela's troubled life that also describes
old New Orleans and the class rivalries that persist.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Orleans is full of colonial records,'' Vella said over
lunch the other day. ``Property settlements, wills. In every record
you open you'll find a compendium of nonsense'' in which earthly
possessions are listed down to the cheapest hairpin. It enabled her
to restore a forgotten past to the iron-laced facade of the
Pontalba buildings.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when New Orleans was under Spanish control and the
central square was known as ``Plaza de Armas,'' a nobleman named
Don Andres Almonester financed the construction of St. Louis
Cathedral, its presbytery, and the Cabildo, the seat of city
government, on the west side of the block. By 1782, he had also
bought all of the lots flanking the square on its north and south
sides, and the row of apartments became a source of substantial
rental income for the Almonester family. ``It was a Spanish custom
to have residences close to the center of power,'' Vella said.
</P>
<P>
   After Almonester's death, a marriage was arranged in 1810
between his 15-year-old daughter, Micaela, and Celestin Delfau de
Pontalba, the son of French aristocrats. She moved to France, and
almost immediately her husband and in-laws set off an epic struggle
over her dowry and control of her family's property in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Because Micaela's mother had upgraded the cottages on the
square, later renamed to honor Andrew Jackson following his victory
in the Battle of New Orleans, she clung to the lots. After a
petition by the Pontalbas, Almonester's widow grudgingly added part
of the property to her daughter's dowry with the stipulation that
Celestin could not collect the rent without Micaela's permission _
``a provision,'' the author noted, ``that would be unhesitatingly
ignored as soon as the blotter was lifted from the document's last
signature.''
</P>
<P>
   In scenes out of a 19th century marriage from hell, Micaela
acceded to a pact with the Pontalbas following her mother's death,
giving her husband administrative control over the property. In
1827, Celestin moved quickly to plunder it. ``He lost no time
getting to New Orleans, making improvements to the houses ... and
raising the rents,'' Vella wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, Micaela traveled to New Orleans to reclaim
the property through American courts. Back in France, her
father-in-law, Joseph Xavier Delfau de Pontalba, seethed over the
loss of income. After Micaela felt obligated to move back to the
Pontalba estate outside Paris, her father-in-law shot and gravely
wounded her, then killed himself.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until 1839 that Micaela finally won property rights.
By this time, Vella wrote, the quarrel had ``destroyed the family
and shattered the happiness'' of the three children born to Micaela
and Celestin. But the story was not complete.
</P>
<P>
   Micaela returned to New Orleans for a few years at midcentury.
Although the land on Jackson Square was ``the third most valuable
property in the Vieux Carre,'' Vella wrote, ``she did not realize a
great profit from it because her tenants were notoriously
delinquent.'' And the 21 apartments were dilapidated.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, filth of every kind characterized New Orleans,''
according to the book. Offal was exposed everywhere, turkeys were
``commonplace pedestrians,'' and dogs roamed the streets.
``Bounties were offered for dead dogs until it was found that
policemen were capturing dogs for a reward instead of chasing
unremunerative criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   It was far worse than the modern scenes of filth in New Orleans
described last month by Mike Ditka, the coach of the New Orleans
Saints, in a Sports Illustrated interview that created an uproar in
the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who think New Orleans is filthy have never been
elsewhere,'' said Vella, who grew up in the city. Because New
Orleans is below sea level, it was subject to ``wet filth,'' she
said, but it was really no worse than conditions in East Coast
cities.
</P>
<P>
   To improve the square in 1849, Micaela underwrote the
construction of a pair of four-story buildings with luxurious
apartments. ``No one knows who designed the Pontalba buildings,''
Vella wrote, but the spirit of French architect Henri Labrouste
``haunts the New Orleans buildings'' where brick, iron, and curved
space were ``used to create a feeling both of airiness and
solidity.''
</P>
<P>
   Micaela transformed the neighborhood, Vella said. ``She made it
into a prestige address, the most desirable place in town.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Lind, an American theater star, was one of the first
residents. But Union forces bivouacked in the buildings for the
occupation of New Orleans during the Civil War, and the property
became ``an unspeakable slum,'' Vella said.
</P>
<P>
   When Micaela died in 1874, annual rents from the Pontalba
buildings totaled only $3,402 and tenants owed $4,929. The property
was eventually sold.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the 20th century, a prominent New Orleanian bequeathed
the Lower Pontalba to the state and the building was renovated. A
few years later, a group of businessmen bought the Upper Pontalba
and gave it to the city.
</P>
<P>
   Property managers of the two buildings deny that any favoritism
is involved in leasing the apartments, though confidants of Mayor
Marc Morial and Edwin W. Edwards, the former governor, wound up
with places there.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Hand, director of the French Market Corp. that manages the
Upper side, said there are two waiting lists, an internal file of
current residents who want a more desirable apartment and another
with 60 names of those who hope someday to find a spot there.
Turnover is fairly rapid for fourth-floor walkups, he said, priced
at roughly $400 a month, but there are lengthy waits for more
expensive apartments.
</P>
<P>
   At the other building, applicants sometimes wait years for a
choice apartment with balcony views of the Mississippi River, the
cathedral, and the activity on Jackson Square. Despite the noise,
``some people think it's the greatest thing this side of the
Waldorf-Astoria,'' said James Sefcik, director of the Louisiana
State Museum and manager of the Lower Pontalba. ``They are the only
homes built on the psychological heart of New Orleans.''
</P>
<P>
   After nearly a century and a half, the buildings coexist
peacefully on Jackson Square, while in France, Micaela's body lies
in a crypt beside her husband and her vengeful father-in-law. No
members of the family are left in New Orleans. The only vestiges of
Micaela's legacy are her initials, A.P. for Almonester and
Pontalba, cut into the iron grillwork on the Pontalba balconies.

CATHOLIC AUTHOR WARNS OF THE DANGERS OF RELIGIOUS RELATIVISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thirty years ago Pope Paul VI's encyclical condemning artificial
birth control sent shock waves through the Roman Catholic world.
</P>
<P>
   Humanae Vitae dashed the hopes of many Catholics who believed
church fathers might be willing to amend religious teachings on
certain thorny contemporary issues. Instead, the pope stood firm.
The repercussions of Paul's encyclical still reverberate.
Fundamentally, Humanae Vitae made the question of authority the
root of all tensions in Roman Catholicism today.
</P>
<P>
   In a new book, author Roger LeBlanc argues that the spread of
dissent throughout the church on issues ranging from the role of
women to human sexuality is eroding papal authority and endangering
the church's future.
</P>
<P>
   LeBlanc, who holds a pontifical certificate to teach Catholic
catechism, believes the single biggest threat to the papacy is the
rise of religious relativism _ the rejection that there is one true
set of beliefs that emanate from the Holy See, whose authority can
be traced directly to Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Religious relativism is a denial that there is one true faith
that is valid, the same for all people at all times and places,''
LeBlanc writes in ``Relativism As Religion: Tracing its Historical
Roots to the Modern Day Crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is in fact the very cause of religious division in the
world,'' he writes. ``In His eternal wisdom, Christ left something
among us by which we can say: `This is indeed the true faith.' He
left us a guide, a true rule of faith. It is the papacy, the
companion of sound reason.''
</P>
<P>
   LeBlanc's book is sure to raise the hackles of non-Roman
Catholic Christians who bristle at any suggestion that the Vatican
possesses the sole copyright on how to be a proper Christian. After
all, it was fierce disagreements over the role of the pope that led
to the many schisms in Christianity over the centuries. And it is
questions over the papacy that present some of the biggest
stumbling blocks to Christian unity.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting under a statue of the Virgin Mary in the living room of
his mother's Natick, Mass. home, LeBlanc said he doesn't want to
antagonize other Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``This book is not a call to arms,'' he said. ``I'm not raising
the swords. I would simply ask people to look at the question of
what gave birth to thousands of Christian denominations. And look
at the reason for the Catholic Church's claim to absolute truth and
the pope's claim to absolute authority. These are things that need
to be discussed.''
</P>
<P>
   LeBlanc said a main motivation behind the book is to lay down a
challenge to all Catholics to examine what it is that makes them
Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Despite various polls suggesting that most American Catholics
oppose the Vatican on numerous controversial topics ranging from
homosexuality to a married clergy, Le-Blanc said there is a growing
cadre of younger Catholics whose views are more in line with Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to be a Catholic, but you if you are going to
call yourself one at least accept what that means,'' LeBlanc says.
``If you look at the story of Adam and Eve, you realize that
religious relativism is what caused man to lose grace with God. How
do people expect to embrace religious relativism and still find
their way to God? And Christ gave back to man what he lost in Eden
by giving him the papacy.''
</P>
<P>
   LeBlanc's book comes at a crucial moment for the church. Vatican
officials say Pope John Paul II is expected to release a major
encyclical attacking relativism in the fall. Angered by what he
sees as unjustified assaults on church teaching and authority, John
Paul has issued edicts that attempt to dampen dissent and increase
the power of the clergy.
</P>
<P>
   Recent pronouncements have been aimed at curbing theologians who
challenge church dogma, and limiting the role of lay people in
local churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like the pope is afraid of losing his authority,''
LeBlanc says. ``He's trying to defend the faith. If you don't have
ultimate authority rest in the papacy, you reduce religion to
something of man's own invention _ and then there is no more reason
to discuss matters of faith because it's all purely subjective.''

   _In its first comments on the investigation involving President
Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, the official newspaper of the
Archdiocese of Boston says the president's private actions are a
public concern.
</P>
<P>
   The editorial in this week's Pilot takes issue with observations
by some political pundits that many Americans believe whatever may
have occurred between Clinton and Lewinsky is a private matter
between consenting adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without speaking from an Olympian perch of self-righteousness
... such talk is moral nonsense,'' the Pilot argues. ``Marriage
vows are public vows. And to those who are quick to call sexual
misconduct something `private' _ tell that with a straight face to
Chelsea Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   _Apparently seeking to increase its involvement in the highly
charged debate over homosexuality, a prominent conservative
Christian organization has hired two people who say they are former
practicing homosexuals to work on public policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   Focus on the Family has hired Amy Tracy, former press secretary
for the National Organization for Women, and John Faulk, a former
male prostitute, to be active players in the organization's
campaign to combat gay activism.
</P>
<P>
   _Providing evidence of some softening in relations between the
United States and Cuba, the National Council of Churches has sent
its first direct relief flight to Cuba in two years. The flight
contained $143,200 in medical and other supplies bound for two
medical clinics in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   After Pope John Paul II's historic trip to Cuba in January,
President Clinton bowed to intense pressure and lifted restrictions
on direct humanitarian flights between the United States and the
Caribbean island nation earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   _The Salvation Army, in a campaign to emphasize the
organization's religious foundation, has announced plans to begin
publishing a semi-annual academic journal this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The first issue of ``Word and Deed: A Journal of the Salvation
Army and Ministry'' will include articles by Salvationist
theologians on such topics as ``Biblical Foundations for the
Doctrine of Holiness'' and ``Wesleyanism and Holiness Teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   The journal is intended to link the the Army's many social
ministries to its theological roots, according to Jeff McDonald,
managing editor of the War Cry, the Salvation Army's official
national magazine.

NEW BAT TAKES THE STING OUT OF HITTING

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kenneth B. Lazarus has a high-tech solution to an age-old
problem: stopping baseball players' hands from stinging when they
hit a ball off the wrong part of the bat.
</P>
<P>
   Lazarus' company, Active Control Experts Inc., has designed a
system, embedded in an aluminium bat, that turns the bat's natural
vibrations into energy _ energy that is not felt by the batter.
</P>
<P>
   The result: the $290 bat Copperhead ACX bat, which retails for
about $100 more than other high-end aluminum bats. ACX officials
say the Copperhead decreases player discomfort when batting,
boosting ballplayers' confidence in their hitting ability. Batters
feel as if they have hit the ``sweet spot,'' the ideal contact
point on the bat, even when they haven't, Lazarus said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of contact sports, getting that solid feel of hitting
the object is a reinforcing feeling that does give players more
confidence,'' Lazarus said. ``If you're not nervous about it
hurting and you have more confidence, that psychologically impacts
you to be a better player.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicknamed the Smart Bat, the high-tech piece of equipment is
made and marketed by Worth Inc. of Tullahoma, Tenn.. Worth plans to
focus on younger and amateur players in leagues with less stringent
rules about qualifying bats.
</P>
<P>
   While Major League Baseball uses only wooden bats, aluminum bats
are standard equipment in college, high school, and Little League
play, and increasingly used in unofficial recreation. The Smart
Bat's special piezoelectric components don't make it illegal for
National Collegiate Athletic Association teams, as long as the bat
fits weight, height, diameter, and performance regulations,
according to an NCAA spokesman, Wallace I. Renfro.
</P>
<P>
   ACX and Worth officials say piezoelectrics are an improvement
over older, more low-tech methods of damping vibrations, including
what Lazarus calls ``rubber and goo.'' And coaches and
retail &UR;  &LR; chain buyers are taking notice: Although Worth just started
producing the bats on July 20, each day the Tennessee firm turns
out 20 bats and takes 15 orders for more.
</P>
<P>
   The bats should be in retail stores by the end of August, and
currently can be ordered from Worth. According to Derrick Olsen,
Worth's baseball marketing manager, July is the industry's selling
season for baseball bats, giving coaches time to buy before the
next season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cambridge, Mass. company has optimistic projections for the
bat's sales. This year, Worth expects to sell 12,000 to 24,000
Copperheads, netting 15 to 18 percent of the aluminum-bat market,
Olsen said. Currently, Worth's most expensive bat after the
Copperhead ACX is the regular Copperhead, selling at about $190.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising will be secondary to personal experience and word of
mouth in Worth's campaign to sell Copperheads; the company has
provided free test bats to 25 high school baseball coaches who
serve on the firm's baseball advisory board. ``Word of mouth
typically works extremely well in this industry,'' said the
Copperhead's developer, Worth research and development vice
president Dan S. Pitsenberger.
</P>
<P>
   The Smart Bat is not ACX's first foray into solving the problem
of sports equipment vibrations and turning it into profit. The
100-employee company, founded in 1992 by president and chief
executive Lazarus and chairman Edward Crawley, is a relative
veteran in the applied piezoelectric products market. The privately
held firm focuses on sports gear, with piezoelectric skis,
snowboards, and a suspension mountain bike, all already on the
market from Los Angeles-based K2 Inc.
</P>
<P>
   After developing the company's core piezoelectric technology in
1992 and 1993, ACX found that skiers would pay to reduce vibration
in their skis as they barreled down a mountain. ACX canvassed a
short &UR;  &LR; list of top ski companies and selected K2, which agreed to
buy the credit-card-sized smart components.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting K2 Four model, known as the Smart Ski, became the
best-selling ski in the United States, according to Stuart N.
Rempel, vice president and general manager for K2 skis. The
sporting-goods manufacturer has since come out with the Merlin line
of skis, which use more advanced ACX technology, including a
piezoelectric coil embedded in the ski.
</P>
<P>
   K2 says that its Smart Skis are allowed in professional
competition, and that many pros use them.
</P>
<P>
   ACX's management comes from the technical side of its product.
Both founders are Massachusetts Institute of Technology engineers
by training; Lazarus earned his doctorate at MIT, and Crawley still
heads its aeronautics and astronautics department. Their idea
centered on the use of piezoelectric ceramic materials to cut down
on vibrations, allowing moving parts to function without
disruption. The firm makes only the piezoelectric system, selling
the components to other companies for use in products.
</P>
<P>
   To finance development of the core piezoelectric components, ACX
generated $300,000 from selling stakes in the company, which now
has about 100 investors. In 1995, the company raised $1.5 million
in its second round of financing; the company has now raised $8
million.
</P>
<P>
   While the company won't disclose its revenues, it is growing at
a rate of 100 percent each year and recently reached the break-even
point, according to the chief financial officer, Scott B. Taitel.
He says ACX is considering going public in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   The company foresees several key applications for the
technology, which ACX manufactures in its Cambridge facility. While
ACX officials would not disclose specific plans for pipeline
products or potential manufacturing partners, Taitel says the firm
plans to expand its piezoelectric components into different types
of sports equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer electronics also offer a potentially large market for
the company, with products including piezoelectric disk drives,
pagers, and cell phones slated to come to market in the next one to
two years. In addition, the company plans to market automotive
applications within two to five years, Taitel says.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Smart Bat, its profitability will rest on customers'
willingness to shell out more money for a bat with mostly
psychological benefits.
</P>
<P>
   At Brine's Sporting Goods in Cambridge, for example, its
top-of-the-line aluminum bat, the Louisville Slugger TPX
Megabarrel, goes for $189; the Cadillac of bats, made from
titanium, can cost as much as $600.
</P>
<P>
   Lazarus says he's confident ballplayers will see beyond the
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that's changed with the advent of the metal
bat is they last longer,'' Lazarus said. ``You can spend a little
more money on a bat and it will last you a whole season, instead of
a dozen (wooden bats) each season.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he says, ACX is counting on batters' attraction to
quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to have the best equipment,'' he said. ``They want
to really enjoy themselves, and that means being their best.''
</P>
<P>
   The view from the trenches at this point is uncertain. Few
people have had the chance to play with the bat. But at least one
coach has already become a fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids loved it,'' said Ken R. Kezer, head baseball coach at
New Britain High School in New Britain, Conn., a Worth advisory
panel member who received a free bat from the company and plans to
order six Copperheads for his players. ``It was nice and light.
Contact was good on any part of the bat.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all sports fans think a high-priced damper system is
worth the money. ``I wouldn't buy it,'' said Joseph T. Bennett, a
salesman at Adams Sporting Goods Inc. in Dorchester, Mass., whose
top-of-the-line aluminum bat is the Louisville Slugger Air Attack,
selling for $115. ``It's just too expensive.''

   ANAHEIM, Calif. -- No false advertising greets the customer
here. The headline on the 1998 season schedule proclaims, ``There's
a brand new theme park in Anaheim.'' Captioning an overview of
water fountains, fireworks, and baseball, the Anaheim Angels
present ``Edison Field ... the ultimate playground.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is just one element in this theme park, which competes
with other Orange County attractions like Knott's Berry Farm,
Ripley's Believe It or Not, the Movieland Wax Museum, the Crystal
Cathedral, and the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and
Birthplace.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest draw is Disneyland, owned by the Walt Disney Co.,
which bought the Angels from the singing cowboy, Gene Autry, in
1996. The team once struggled against football for dominance in a
concrete 1960s stadium. Now it faces a slugger's lineup of ace
marketers, pitchmen, and avatars of family fun. Baseball may be
pure, but the Disney bullpen is deep.
</P>
<P>
   After two years and $117 million, a ballpark emerged from the
one-size-fits-all fever that expanded many stadiums for football.
The Los Angeles Rams are now in St. Louis, and the football seats
are gone.
</P>
<P>
   Identity is a sometime thing in cloverleaf heaven. The team was
the Los Angeles Angels, then the California Angels. Now they are
named after Anaheim, baptized by German settlers in 1857 after the
Santa Ana River and the Teutonic word for ``home.'' This place was
home to orange groves until Walt Disney built his theme park in
1955 with subthemes like Fantasyland and Adventureland. Now his
company has added what seems like ``Baseball-land.''
</P>
<P>
   The hype begins with the national anthem, when the ``rocket's
red glare'' produces real fireworks and waterspouts, blending
Francis Scott Key and MTV. The pyrotechnics emerge from a rockpile
beyond center field, a backdrop lacking the verisimilitude of the
Baltimore warehouse in Camden Yards or the Citgo sign behind Fenway
Park. This theme looks as authentic as Fred Flintstone's miniature
golf course.
</P>
<P>
   The public address system announces each batter with thundering
resonance, whether it be Babe Ruth or a banjo hitter just called up
from Vancouver. It is all unmodulated, all robotic, a cartoon
version of Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   The concourses are wide and handsome, with dessert carts
groaning with goodies like ``Chocolate Success Cake.'' The
restaurants are busy, and the souvenir store moves product, and
only one product. Fans seeking a Red Sox or Yankee cap must shop
elsewhere, because this marketing is pinpoint-targeted.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels kept their pre-Disney colors of red and blue but,
according to the media guide, ``a periwinkle blue was added as a
main third color. The Angels logos were designed by Disney Consumer
Products and approved by Major League Baseball Properties. The team
lettering marries an angel's wing with a speeding ball. Together
they create a logo that immediately says `Angels' and gives the
feeling of fluidity and motion of the game of baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   This prose shimmers with the wan defeatism of a marketer who
wanted to name the acquisition the Anaheim Lion Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Defeatism is a problem on the field, too. The Angels were atop
the American League West for a while, although they would not be
near first place in any other division in baseball. A summer swoon
makes postseason play unlikely. The trading deadline passed with no
fireworks, and many fans think the team is run by Doc, Sleepy,
Grumpy, and Dopey.
</P>
<P>
   Disney hired the New York architect, Robert A.M. Stern, to
provide some sophistication. Some of his touches, like green and
copper colors for usher's uniforms and concourses, mitigate the
zeal with which Anaheim resists sophistication in its postgame rush
to the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   In baseball as in real estate, it's location, location,
location. People may enjoy the game at Edison Field, but the
revamped ballpark works better as a vast Disney billboard.

 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Some of the world's best boxers work the bags at
Freddie Roach's small, steamy gym in a Hollywood strip mall.
Heavyweight contender Michael Moorer. Lucia Rijker, the female
champion. O.J. Simpson defense attorney Robert Shapiro.
</P>
<P>
   Roach, a Massachusetts native, will take on anyone gutsy enough
to step into his ring, located right above the Wash 'n' Fold
laundromat. Of course, Roach doesn't fight them himself anymore.
The former featherweight turned trainer 10 years ago, after 150
amateur bouts and 54 professional matches.
</P>
<P>
   Now he trains 14 professional fighters at his Wild Card Boxing
Club and dozens of ``executive'' boxers, more accustomed to taking
meetings than punches. Side by side, they work the rope, glove up
and hit the mitts. Sometimes they even spar together. This is not
the sort of aerobic fisticuffs offered at health clubs. This is
boxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's controlled,'' emphasized Roach, 38. ``It's fun for them
to say they got in there with a world champion. But they're not
delusional.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro, who every so often asks to go jab-to-uppercut with one
of the club's resident pros, successfully defended Simpson against
double-murder charges, and he says he can defend himself in the
ring against an opponent his size: 160 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freddie wouldn't allow me to be in jeopardy,'' said Shapiro,
who has been boxing with Roach for five years. ``If I was sparring
with a middleweight or a superweight, I would be killed. But if
it's a lower weight, I try to hold my own and I usually can.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are fighting words to Roach's real boxers, who say only
their good graces allow the ``white-collar'' boxers to survive.
Six-time world champion James Toney, imposing even when wearing
street clothes and a smile, simply smirked when asked about taking
on Shapiro or Mickey Rourke, who went from acting in movies like
``Diner'' to boxing professionally under Roach's tutelage and back
to acting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fighting?'' Toney said. ``Nah, I'm just messing around with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Yvonne Trevino, a pro with an impressive word of mouth,
says she toys with the boys, especially newcomers who forget to
move their heads out of the way of her fist. Mostly, though, she's
not allowed to take a swing and instead works on her defense by
dancing around punches.
</P>
<P>
   ``My real sparring partners, the guys, can make me see stars,''
said Trevino, who comes from a family of fighters and has a 7-2-1
record. ``The other guys? Ha.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam Simon, a Hollywood producer who was one of the co-creators
of ``The Simpsons'' and now directs ``The Drew Carey Show,''
understands who is at whose mercy in the ring. Simon began boxing
four years ago, sick of daily runs and serious about slimming down.
Now he can bob and weave like a pro _ almost. He broke his nose
when it connected with the sharp side of the padded mitts that
trainers hold while boxers practice throwing punches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pros don't hit me hard unless, for some reason, I get
lucky and hit them,'' said Simon. ``And then they hit me as hard as
they can until I fall down. ... But it doesn't make me nervous or
afraid because I feel like I should get knocked out, and if I don't
I'm doing well.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Roach says he admires the would-be fighters, both
for their heart and their willingness to face fists the size of
hams. Roach, the son of a fighter, triumphed over his first
opponent at age 8, winning the Junior Olympics in New England,
where his mother, Barbara, is still secretary of the boxing
commission. At the time, he weighed 50 pounds, the smallest
weight &UR;  &LR; class, and then kept fighting for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The chance to train Rourke got him to Los Angeles, where the
pair opened a gym together, then later closed it on what Roach says
was the advice of Rourke's accountant. But he was already a
sought-after trainer by boxers who wear suits to their real jobs,
and those whose jobs call for nothing more than a mouthpiece and
satin shorts. Two-and-a-half years ago he opened the Wild Card.
</P>
<P>
   Today the gym has about 75 members, a third of them professional
fighters, two-thirds of them secretaries, actors, and studio
executives who pay $50 a month for gym access, plus $20 or so an
hour for private sessions with Roach or one of his four trainers.
Anyone with a pro or amateur license pays $25 monthly, although
Roach also takes 10 percent of his pros' winning purses.
</P>
<P>
   Besides connecting fists to faces, boxers can also make
post-career connections at the club. For instance, champion Troy
Baudoin, who fought professionally from 1985 to 1993 and then
became a trainer, now also acts in movies and music videos. The
upside is a pain-free career for a change. The downside is he
suddenly has to worry about his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only people I go in the ring with are people who can't do
me no harm,'' Baudoin said. ``Every now and then they'll touch me
and I'll tap them to show I'm letting them get away with it. ... I
like playing with them. I don't try to kill them even if I could.
That would be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethan Maniquis, a film editor at Miramax, says he can't believe
how much longer three rounds, or nine minutes, feels in real life
than on TV. Like most of the non-fighters who are in it for the
workout, he usually does only drills. But sometimes he can't resist
the real ring. So far, he's had his nose bloodied and felt dizzy
and nauseated for an entire day _ despite donning the head gear
that all sparring partners wear.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they're easy on me, because I stink,'' said Maniquis.
``They'll smack me once or twice in the head to let me know who's
boss. But they'll also say, `Go easy on the kid.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Shannon L. McIntosh, a senior vice president at Miramax,
says she doesn't want anyone going easy on her, male or female.
Now, after a year of working out with Roach, she is considering
going amateur.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spar with girls, whoever will get in the ring with me,''
McIntosh said. ``I've been hit in the head by guys. It keeps you
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Roach worked McIntosh's corner during the local white-collar
fights last August, and she calls him a ``calming force'' with
flawless technique. Shapiro cites his ``knowledge and dedication,''
saying he trains lawyers the same as a world champion. Rourke once
publicly admitted that Roach had made him cry.
</P>
<P>
   With his baggy shorts, slight but tight frame and wiry red
goatee, Roach doesn't look fierce. But inside the gym _ walls
covered with autographed pictures of boxers and posters advertising
their bouts _ his word is law. The New England featherweight
champion of 1980 _ a title his father, Paul, held in 1947 _ earned
him a name as a trainer in the boxing capital of the world, Las
Vegas. Now movie stars such as Mira Sorvino, who hasn't been at the
Wild Card for a while, know his name, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't treat anyone special,'' said Roach, surrounded by
sweat-covered fighters all focusing on the bag or body in front of
them. ``Everyone here's the same, except maybe in the ring.''

FIRST PEEK AT MOL; BREAKING SILENCE OF SALINGER AFFAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a famous episode of ``Seinfeld,'' Elaine is appalled to
discover a nipple peeking out from her shirt in the photo of
herself she used on her Christmas cards. But somehow I don't think
actress Gretchen Mol is particularly upset or surprised by the
spiky revelations she shares on the cover of the thick new Vanity
Fair for September. (Observers will need to decide for themselves
whether photographer Annie Leibovitz turned the heat way up, or way
down.) An unknown actress whom VF is trying to ``break'' in the
manner of Matthew McConaughey and Matt Damon, both of whom won VF
covers before they met with success, Mol stars in two forthcoming
movies that are rating high on the advance buzz-o-meter: Woody
Allen's ``Celebrity,'' with Leonardo DiCaprio, and ``Rounders,''
with Damon. In the meantime, she really doesn't have much to say
about her last days of anonymity, or her rogue of a pet rabbit.
We'll have to wait and see if Mol's Pre-Celebrity Moment evolves
into a Damon-like year or, alas, fame of the McConaughey
Woulda-Coulda-Been variety.
</P>
<P>
   The disturbing piece in VF is an excerpt from Joyce Maynard's
forthcoming memoir about her relationship with J.D. Salinger. When
she was 18, and he was 53, the two had an unlikely nine-month
affair that Maynard has been unwilling to chronicle out of respect
for the press-phobic author's privacy. But now she tells their
story with a vengeance, portraying Salinger as a bitter, eccentric
loner obsessed with homeopathy who would force himself to vomit
unhealthy food. At the beginning of the relationship, he treats her
like his favorite daughter, writing letters to her with creepy
lines like ``I haven't had a pal like you before, you know,
kiddo.'' In the middle, Maynard moves in with Salinger and they
unsuccessfully explore a sexual rapport, as Maynard finds she can't
physically relax in bed. And at the end, he becomes an icy stranger
who despises her willingness to promote herself as a writer and
asks her to leave his house. (We never learn where her parents
stood on all of this.)
</P>
<P>
   It's a hard story to read, partly because of the age-power
imbalance in their affair, partly because of unaddressed questions
about Maynard's motivation in telling all. Is she using us to get
back at him, revealing the secrets of a man who at one point says
to her, ``A writer's face should never be known''? Is she crusading
against the potential harmfulness of extreme May-December
relationships? Is she simply cashing in on her experience? In any
case, we probably wouldn't care much about Salinger's dietary
habits if information about his life weren't so famously withheld.
</P>
<P>
   For a small bit of irreverence, check out the Tommy Hilfiger ads
near the front of the issue, a White House motif featuring a
barefoot young woman lounging on a desk that could only belong to
the president.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, it's hard to resist terribly dramatic cover lines
designed to get you into a magazine fast _ the glossy equivalent of
those ultra-italicized movie-trailer voice-overs. On its September
cover, Details promises us that its profile of Matt Damon will
expose us to ``The Dark Side of Oscar's Golden Boy,'' truly a big
promise since Damon and his 1,000-watt smile seem quite immune to
darkness. But the article doesn't even pretend to dig in the dirt,
serving as little more than yet another addition to the thousands
of stories already chronicling Damon's happy rise to stardom, his
friendship with Ben Affleck, his respect for idols like Tom Hanks,
his closeness to his mother, etc., etc., etc.
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorker for Aug. 17 includes a Talk of the Town piece by
William Styron, who served on the editorial board that compiled the
Modern Library's controversial list of the 100 best novels written
in English this century. Styron confesses that he felt ``a little
shocked at what the ten of us had wrought, not only in respect to
the list's glaring omissions (no Toni Morrison, no Patrick White,
only eight women in the lot) but in respect to its generally
oppressive stodginess.'' He says the problem was the voting
process, which, as he describes it, sounds seriously inadequate, as
well as the absence of an in-person meeting of the board to debate
the results. Meanwhile, Entertainment Weekly, the magazine that
loves nothing better than a good list, has a story, ``Listomania,''
that explores the cultural need to compile lists like the top 100
novels or movies. Here's the list of reasons we like lists,
abbreviated: 1) to make the information overload of modern life
more manageable; 2) to counteract the temporary nature of modern
life by building lasting structures; and 3) We dig numbers.

`STRESSED ERIC': A GUY WHO NEVER GETS A BREAK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
STRESSED ERIC 
On: NBC, Wednesday nights 
With the voice of: Hank Azaria 
Rated: TVPG 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Stressed Eric'' is Eric Feeble, a man whose life is always on
the verge of explosion. He is a single father raising a daughter
allergic to everything she loves, including her dolls, and a son
who won't utter a word but insists on shoving everything into his
mouth. He and his wife are divorced _ ``I'm going for a swim in the
lake of me,'' she tells him _ and he has replaced her with a
mumbling, alcoholic au pair who vomits every time she opens her
mouth. His job as a numbers cruncher is hanging on by a thread, no
thanks to his hostile secretary, who spends her days chatting about
boyfriends on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Modern life, in other words, has a contract out on poor
beleagured Eric Feeble. And if that vein in his forehead doesn't
stop its rabid pulsing, modern life just might land the guy in an
emergency room, or, more likely, an asylum. An animated series
imported from Britain for a six-week run on NBC, ``Stressed Eric''
is a brash, relentless half-hour of TV that captures the insanity
we've all felt when time is definitely not on our side. As his
daughter's lips swell from eating the wrong cereal, and his son
refuses to say ``baaaah'' for his role as Sheep No.6 in the school
nativity, and his au pair regurgitates last night's spirits down
the drain, and his boss waits impatiently for a report he dropped
outside his house, Eric Feeble does not manage to find even a
moment's peace. And it doesn't help that he lives next door to the
Perfects, a family whose luck seems to improve with every laurel
laid on their doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   Ads for ``Stressed Eric'' proclaim that the show is ``spicier
than `South Park.''' The ads, of course, are overstated: ``Stressed
Eric'' doesn't use political incorrectness and cultural irony as
its stock in trade, relying instead on the more familiar comedy of
good intentions foiled _ sometimes violently _ by circumstances.
The show is edgy in its unwillingness to give Eric a break, and in
its resistance to sentimental resolutions, but it is nonetheless a
classic example of animatated slapstick.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the voice of Hank Azaria has been dubbed over the
original dialogue voiced by English actor Mark Heap for American
audiences. For NBC, Eric has been made into an American dad living
in London.

JUST THE TICKET IF YOUR HEART'S IN THE HEARTLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There used to be a professor at the Harvard Business School who
famously asked corporate chieftains, ``What business are you really
in?'' He convinced a struggling railroad company that it was really
in the booming transportation business. They invested millions in
the trucking and airline industries and lost their shirts. A stern
lesson for the client; however, at $10,000 a day, our B-School man
came out all right.
</P>
<P>
   But I digress.
</P>
<P>
   We here in the media often wonder: What business are we really
in? And the answer is: We are in the business of teaching you how
to live. Just look around you: Country Life, Vermont Life, Southern
Living, Coastal Living, or my current favorite, Midwest Living.
</P>
<P>
   The title took me aback when I first spotted ML on the newstand.
There was a time when I might have cavalierly dismissed life
``between the mountains'' as dull and devoid of content. But during
the past two summers, I crossed the continent twice, and each time
I spent a full week in the heartland. So now, when I dismiss the
Midwest as dull and devoid of content, I do so from a position of
authority.
</P>
<P>
   But of course this vibrant magazine, which has doubled its
circulation in the past decade, and bulges with advertising for
wholesome foods and roomy, American-made cars, puts paid to my
callous Eastern snobbery. Unlike Arizona Highways or New England's
Yankee magazine, which have more subscribers outside their
territory than in, 90 percent of ML readers still hail from the 12
Midwestern states. A cynic might suggest that people who've put the
Freeman, S.D., Schmeckfest in their rearview mirror don't want to
be reminded of it. But I am not a cynic.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing to do in the Midwest? What could I have been thinking?
The Strategic Air Command has just opened up a new museum on
Interstate 80. What about the Ashland, Wis., Smelt Run? (You run;
the smelt frolic in Lake Superior.) Or what about Buzzard Day in
Hinckley, Ohio? ``Join in this welcome-back party for the thousands
of migrating turkey vultures that have come home to nest,'' ML
suggests. Why not? How about that Tibetan restaurant in
Indianapolis? India-no-place no more!
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere to eat in the Midwest? What could I have been thinking?
They're serving gourmet dishes that stick to your ribs, not to
mention your arteries. Jasper, Ind., boasts the Schnitzelbank,
where ``entrees range from goulash to sauerbraten.'' Or how about a
table for two at Little Eva's Dumpling Factory of Medford, Wis.?
I'm looking forward to the St. Urho's Day festival in Finland,
Minn. ``You'll feel Finnish when you eat a steaming bowlful of kala
moijakka (fish soup),'' the ML critic informs me. Either that, or
you'll be Russian to get out of there.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere to stay? Rest your bones at the Nordic Inn Medieval Bed
Breakfast in Crosby, Minn. ``Odin's Loft has a king-size bed tucked
inside a dragon-headed Viking ship,'' we learn. Or at Ohio's
all-stone Ravenwood Castle, with Rapunzel's tower and cottages
boasting ``jolly old English themes.'' Here in New England, those
would be ``jolly olde English themes.'' The Midwest can only aspire
to our heights of Anglo-phoniness.
</P>
<P>
   Here to say something nice about the featureless cradle of
American civilization is Dan Kaercher, the founding editor of
Midwest Living. ``I would be glad to defend flyover country,'' says
Kaercher, who sounds corn-fed but in fact comes from upstate New
York. He's heard all the gibes. ``Midwest Living _ isn't that an
oxymoron?'' Or after he published his first issue, friends joshed
that he would never come up with enough material to fill a second
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone in the Midwest, with the possible exception of
James McDougal and Web Hubbell, Kaercher comes off as
straightforward and likable. He's certainly got his finger on the
regional pulse. ``As we speak, there's a lady inside a refrigerated
barn carving a life-size butter cow that will be the prize
attraction at the Iowa State Fair. Do you have anything like that
in New England?''
</P>
<P>
   I have to admit, we do not.

<P>
   In a small third floor office in downtown Boston, Marc Pollick
presides over a charity that could help make it far easier for
professional athletes to overcome a tarnished public image.
</P>
<P>
   The Giving Back Fund, started by Pollick one year ago, is
offering athletes a one-stop service for establishing and
administering foundations, and the opportunity to turn their
lucrative salaries into philanthropic endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Many athletes try to establish charitable foundations, but the
funds often fail to achieve their promise when they are improperly
administered or poorly financed. Few young athletes get the
technical aid to sustain philanthropies from their agents,
franchise owners or players' unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been some horror stories of foundations that
weren't funded adequately, or the athlete is letting their brother
or uncle run things, and it just turns out badly,'' Pollick said.
``If it was managed properly and well-financed _ like a good
business _ it could be one of the very best things an athlete can
do. Our point is to try to provide a service to these truly wealthy
individuals who want to do good works.''
</P>
<P>
   The image of a wealthy, selfish athlete who flouts the mores of
society is increasingly well-established. With free agency in the
four major sports, athletes' salaries are now often well beyond the
imagination of he average fan. When athletes run afoul of the law
or of commonly accepted social behavior, even their good deeds are
greeted with skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports crises are clearly more frequent today than ever
before,'' said Kathleen Hessert, president of Sports Media
Challenge, a consultancy in North Carolina. ``One result is that
the public is actually getting numb to sports crises, even
expecting them.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey by Sports Media Challenge found that 70 percent
of professional sports teams and 74 percent of collegiate athletic
programs had experienced a crisis related to athletes' mistakes off
the playing field within the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers, and athletes themselves, believe that a perfect
antedote is philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much negative stuff going on, this is one way they
can look good,'' said Myron Finkbeiner, head of the World Sports
Humanitarian Hall of Fame in Boise, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a relative no-brainer,'' said Richard Lapchick, founder
of Northeastern University's Center for the Study of Sport in
Society, who is also an adviser to The Giving Back Fund. ``It's a
triple win situation. The community benefits from the players'
money and time, the player is less likely to fall into a
megalomaniacal posture and, if you get into that habit of
charitable giving and works, there is a better chance of being a
successful player because there are going to be fewer problems with
the team or their personal lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollick says he came to the idea of The Giving Back Fund ``very
circuitously.'' He was immersed in Holocaust studies at Boston
University, striving for a doctorate while working with Elie
Wiesel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea for a humanitarian studies institute came to mind,
and Elie really liked the idea,'' Pollick said. ``As we began
putting it together the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanitarian
Studies I found that he, with his celebrity, was able to make a lot
of contacts.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Pollick founded The Giving Back Fund, a national
nonprofit organization to encourage giving by athletes and
entertainers. The fund has been granted tax-exempt status as a
full-service public charity in all 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   It is composed of individually identified donor-advised funds
and foundations, each with donor-appointed trustees. While each of
the foundations appears to stand alone, Pollick said, they all
benefit from the financial buying power of the pooled assets,
including the expertise of the fund's strategic partners and the
grant-making guidance of the staff.
</P>
<P>
   Among the advisers to the fund are the NBC broadcaster Bob
Costas, the retired track star Florence Griffith Joyner and her
husband and coach Al Joyner, the author Jonathan Kozol, Rabbi
Harold Kushner, Harvard Law School professor Charles Ogletree and
the retired basketball star Bill Walton.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, the fund is receiving services on a reduced
fee or pro bono basis from BankBoston, the law firm of Hale And
Dorr, the accounting firm of Ernst &AMP; Young, the grant-making
services of Grants Management Associates, public relations from
Silverman Media and Marketing and the New England Sports Network is
developing and managing a web site.
</P>
<P>
   The former Boston College football star Doug Flutie has used The
Giving Back fund to start a foundation to fight autism, which
afflicts his son, Doug Jr. Former Celtics star Dee Brown and his
wife Tammy also have started a foundation to support groups that
teach parenting skills and to provide needy schools with teaching
and sports equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Pollick said The Giving Back Fund was started with $250,000 in
seed money from various organizations, and now has about $500,000
of money under management.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a long way from our goal of $20 million in assets by
2002,'' Pollick said, ``but it is a start. I really do see it on a
grand scale. In five years, I see this as a major source for
philanthropy in many ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``By putting all of this together, you're really, really
bringing some power and attention to bear on these various
causes,'' he said. ``If in the process it shows that not all
athletes are greedy and selfish as portrayed in the media, that's
good too.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is plenty of anecdotal evidence that athletes are
aware of the appropriateness or potential power of their charitable
donations or work. All four major sports teams in Boston do
considerable charitable work.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Celtics Charitable Foundation and the Red Auerbach
Youth Foundation both rely on extensive public appearances by
Celtics players at golf tournaments and other events to raise
money. The New England Patriots Foundation was established in 1994,
and has contibuted more than $1 million to help support youth
groups like the Boys and Girls Clubs of Boston and the ROSE
(Regaining One's Self Esteem) Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Bruins contibute to the Failure to Thrive Clinic and
the Anthony Spinazzola Foundation. And the Red Sox, of course, have
their Jimmy Fund and other community charities.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn, Pedro Martinez, Drew Bledsoe, Tebucky Jones and
Raymond Bourque are among the players in Boston who have
established separate foundations.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, there are many examples. But among the most striking
are the attempts by the National Basketball Association star
Dikembe Mutombo to contribute his own money and raise additional
funds to finance a $2 million hospital in his native Congo, and the
former National Hockey League player and professed sexual abuse
victim Sheldon Kennedy attempting to raise $15 million for other
victims, in part by in-line skating across Canada.
</P>
<P>
   No attempt has been made to tally how many such efforts exist,
or how much money they have raised, according to several sources,
including the Council on Foundations in Washington and The
Chronicle of Philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is one agent, Leigh Steinberg. I have to give him credit
that when he signs up a client, the first thing he tells them is
that, `If you're my client, you're going to give back,'''
Finkbeiner said.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of oversight and guidance, however, has led to some
disasters involving even the most well-intentioned athletes.
</P>
<P>
   The basketball star Michael Jordan was forced to close down his
children's foundation in 1996, seven years after he started it,
when the admnistration of it became ungainly, expensive trips were
financed for overseers, and it was revealed that Jordan had
contributed less than $10,000 over six years.
</P>
<P>
   The basketball star Juwan Howard announced a foundation, with
considerable notice, in 1995, only to admit two years later that it
had yet to register in the District of Columbia, where he plays for
the Washington Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the athletes are dedicated, but not skilled in
creating a foundation,'' said Larry Moulter, of Woolf Associates in
Boston. &UR;  &LR; ``It's one thing to commit to doing a foundation, but does
that translate to the dedication that can pull the business aspects
of it off?''
</P>
<P>
   Pollick's answer is that The Giving Back Fund can pick up where
the athlete's good intentions end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really think we can provide a full service that is going to
cut down on some of the problems, and provide the athletes with a
really stable foundation, whether they are really hands-on or
content to sit back and watch,'' Pollick said.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Some of the world's best boxers work the bags at
Freddie Roach's small, steamy gym in a Hollywood strip mall.
Heavyweight contender Michael Moorer. Lucia Rijker, the female
champion. O.J. Simpson defense attorney Robert Shapiro.
</P>
<P>
   Roach, a Massachusetts native, will take on anyone gutsy enough
to step into his ring, located right above the Wash 'n' Fold
laundromat. Of course, Roach doesn't fight them himself anymore.
The former featherweight turned trainer 10 years ago, after 150
amateur bouts and 54 professional matches.
</P>
<P>
   Now he trains 14 professional fighters at his Wild Card Boxing
Club and dozens of ``executive'' boxers, more accustomed to taking
meetings than punches. Side by side, they work the rope, glove up
and hit the mitts. Sometimes they even spar together. This is not
the sort of aerobic fisticuffs offered at health clubs. This is
boxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's controlled,'' emphasized Roach, 38. ``It's fun for them
to say they got in there with a world champion. But they're not
delusional.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro, who every so often asks to go jab-to-uppercut with one
of the club's resident pros, successfully defended Simpson against
double-murder charges, and he says he can defend himself in the
ring against an opponent his size: 160 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freddie wouldn't allow me to be in jeopardy,'' said Shapiro,
who has been boxing with Roach for five years. ``If I was sparring
with a middleweight or a superweight, I would be killed. But if
it's a lower weight, I try to hold my own and I usually can.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are fighting words to Roach's real boxers, who say only
their good graces allow the ``white-collar'' boxers to survive.
Six-time world champion James Toney, imposing even when wearing
street clothes and a smile, simply smirked when asked about taking
on Shapiro or Mickey Rourke, who went from acting in movies like
``Diner'' to boxing professionally under Roach's tutelage and back
to acting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fighting?'' Toney said. ``Nah, I'm just messing around with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Yvonne Trevino, a pro with an impressive word of mouth,
says she toys with the boys, especially newcomers who forget to
move their heads out of the way of her fist. Mostly, though, she's
not allowed to take a swing and instead works on her defense by
dancing around punches.
</P>
<P>
   ``My real sparring partners, the guys, can make me see stars,''
said Trevino, who comes from a family of fighters and has a 7-2-1
record. ``The other guys? Ha.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam Simon, a Hollywood producer who was one of the co-creators
of ``The Simpsons'' and now directs ``The Drew Carey Show,''
understands who is at whose mercy in the ring. Simon began boxing
four years ago, sick of daily runs and serious about slimming down.
Now he can bob and weave like a pro _ almost. He broke his nose
when it connected with the sharp side of the padded mitts that
trainers hold while boxers practice throwing punches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pros don't hit me hard unless, for some reason, I get
lucky and hit them,'' said Simon. ``And then they hit me as hard as
they can until I fall down. ... But it doesn't make me nervous or
afraid because I feel like I should get knocked out, and if I don't
I'm doing well.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Roach says he admires the would-be fighters, both
for their heart and their willingness to face fists the size of
hams. Roach, the son of a fighter, triumphed over his first
opponent at age 8, winning the Junior Olympics in New England,
where his mother, Barbara, is still secretary of the boxing
commission. At the time, he weighed 50 pounds, the smallest
weight &UR;  &LR; class, and then kept fighting for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The chance to train Rourke got him to Los Angeles, where the
pair opened a gym together, then later closed it on what Roach says
was the advice of Rourke's accountant. But he was already a
sought-after trainer by boxers who wear suits to their real jobs,
and those whose jobs call for nothing more than a mouthpiece and
satin shorts. Two-and-a-half years ago he opened the Wild Card.
</P>
<P>
   Today the gym has about 75 members, a third of them professional
fighters, two-thirds of them secretaries, actors, and studio
executives who pay $50 a month for gym access, plus $20 or so an
hour for private sessions with Roach or one of his four trainers.
Anyone with a pro or amateur license pays $25 monthly, although
Roach also takes 10 percent of his pros' winning purses.
</P>
<P>
   Besides connecting fists to faces, boxers can also make
post-career connections at the club. For instance, champion Troy
Baudoin, who fought professionally from 1985 to 1993 and then
became a trainer, now also acts in movies and music videos. The
upside is a pain-free career for a change. The downside is he
suddenly has to worry about his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only people I go in the ring with are people who can't do
me no harm,'' Baudoin said. ``Every now and then they'll touch me
and I'll tap them to show I'm letting them get away with it. ... I
like playing with them. I don't try to kill them even if I could.
That would be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethan Maniquis, a film editor at Miramax, says he can't believe
how much longer three rounds, or nine minutes, feels in real life
than on TV. Like most of the non-fighters who are in it for the
workout, he usually does only drills. But sometimes he can't resist
the real ring. So far, he's had his nose bloodied and felt dizzy
and nauseated for an entire day _ despite donning the head gear
that all sparring partners wear.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they're easy on me, because I stink,'' said Maniquis.
``They'll smack me once or twice in the head to let me know who's
boss. But they'll also say, `Go easy on the kid.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Shannon L. McIntosh, a senior vice president at Miramax,
says she doesn't want anyone going easy on her, male or female.
Now, after a year of working out with Roach, she is considering
going amateur.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spar with girls, whoever will get in the ring with me,''
McIntosh said. ``I've been hit in the head by guys. It keeps you
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Roach worked McIntosh's corner during the local white-collar
fights last August, and she calls him a ``calming force'' with
flawless technique. Shapiro cites his ``knowledge and dedication,''
saying he trains lawyers the same as a world champion. Rourke once
publicly admitted that Roach had made him cry.
</P>
<P>
   With his baggy shorts, slight but tight frame and wiry red
goatee, Roach doesn't look fierce. But inside the gym _ walls
covered with autographed pictures of boxers and posters advertising
their bouts _ his word is law. The New England featherweight
champion of 1980 _ a title his father, Paul, held in 1947 _ earned
him a name as a trainer in the boxing capital of the world, Las
Vegas. Now movie stars such as Mira Sorvino, who hasn't been at the
Wild Card for a while, know his name, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't treat anyone special,'' said Roach, surrounded by
sweat-covered fighters all focusing on the bag or body in front of
them. ``Everyone here's the same, except maybe in the ring.''

 &HT;    AS WITH PAST U.S. LEADERS, FOR GINGRICH, IRISH EYES ARE SMILING
DURING VISIT
 &HT;    EDs: With optional trim.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Newt Gingrich grips a 10-pound
concrete block, hoists it from the stack in his work-gloved hands,
walks briskly 10 feet and plunks it neatly in the cast frame of a
house foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The house, a project of Georgia-based Habitat for Humanity, will
sit in the Glencairn housing project on a hillside overlooking
Belfast. It will be dubbed ``The House that Congress Built,'' and
indeed six House members from both parties and their spouses joined
Gingrich in the labor Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   His face a little flushed with exertion, the Speaker of the U.S.
House of Representatives grabs another block and places it at the
end of the last one. A half-dozen TV cameras and a few still
photographers catch it all, the symbolically potent images of a
prominent American politician helping to lay the foundation for
Northern Ireland's future. Through it all, Gingrich sustains a
broad smile.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to escape the sense that the speaker is laying
another foundation on this sunny Irish hillside: One that would
support grander ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich was coy when Irish reporters asked playfully about his
presidential aspirations, yet it is becoming increasingly clear
that Ireland is becoming an important stop on the 2000 election
stump. Massachusetts Gov. George Weld, a potential rival if
Gingrich chooses to run, visited last year. New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, another prospective Republican candidate, is said to be
planning a trip soon.
</P>
<P>
   The political stature Ireland -- not to mention 46 million
American voters of Irish descent -- on the American political
landscape did not escape Gingrich, who noted that about a third of
U.S. politicians claims some Irish heritage. ``It's always been
there,'' the speaker said Wednesday in front of the elegant
Culloden Hotel, where his party of nearly 30 had been staying.
``You go back to President Kennedy's visit in '63. Tip O'Neil
coming here regularly in the '80s. Reagan's trip in '84. President
Clinton had a remarkably successful trip here in 1995.''
</P>
<P>
   But the speaker stressed that this trip was unrelated to
domestic politics. Instead, the seven-day tour was intended to
underscore the strength of U.S. support for the fragile Irish peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said he had conferred with President Clinton about the
goals of the trip. ``We wanted to communicate strongly that there
is bipartisan support, both from the legislative as well as
executive branch, and in talking with the president, he thought
this would be a helpful time,'' the speaker said. ``They get us
here at the beginning at the month and him here at the end of the
month.'' Clinton is scheduled to visit Ireland Sept. 3, following a
trip to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich and his delegation of six House members have met
privately with both sides of the conflict that has plagued this
country for 30 years. With the speaker are Reps. John Dingell
(D-Mich.), Jerry Lewis (R-Calif.), Jim Walsh (R-N.Y.), Anna Eshoo
(D-Calif.), Ray LaHood (R-Ill.) and Ken Bentsen (D-Texas).
</P>
<P>
   The group has met with representatives of Sinn Fein, the
political wing of the Irish Republican Army, as well as the Ulster
Democratic Unionist Party. The Catholic IRA for years has fought to
unite Northern Ireland with the Irish Republic, while the
Protestant Unionists have fought to keep Northern Ireland part of
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've communicated pretty successfully the intensity and depth
of our support for the process,'' he said. ``We also learned some
things that will make the president's trip better.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and British governments are placing much of their hopes
on the success of a new Belfast-based assembly, a central part of
the political settlement struck between Protestant Unionists and
Catholic Republicans last April.
</P>
<P>
   In the meetings, Unionists expressed concerns about forming a
government with members of Sinn Fein without adequate safeguards
that the IRA has renounced violence. The Unionist leaders equated
this to the United States entering into a partnership with the
Oklahoma City bomber.
</P>
<P>
   After emerging from a meeting with Unionist leaders, Gingrich
acknowledged that this issue remains an obstacle. ``It's very clear
that you have a real concern about the authenticity of the
renunciation of violence by the various groups that have used
terrorism,'' he said. ``We have a much better sense of how
important it is to focus on genuine decommissioning and to focus on
a genuine transition to a political process and away from violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these things take time. You've had 30 years or longer of
no one trusting anybody, so everybody starts every morning from a
position of distrust, so it takes everyone a long time to get
through that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's assessment of the situation has been reported widely
across Ireland and Britain, where he was routinely portrayed as the
third most powerful man in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim here.)
</P>
<P>
   And Gingrich's political ambitions also have been noted in the
media here. ``The U.S. presidential election is two years away, but
Glencairn, a loyalist estate overlooking Belfast, was as good a
place as any to canvass,'' wrote The Guardian Newspaper under the
headline ``Newt hopes that a touch of blarney will boost his
prospects.''
</P>
<P>
   The images at the Habitat for Humanity event seemed to have been
considered carefully. Unlike all the other workers, Gingrich worked
bareheaded, reducing the prospect of goofy photos of him with a
bright yellow hardhat perched on his head. Unlike the rest,
Gingrich opted for a flattering dark blue denim workshirt rather
than a white commemorative T-shirt that could have accentuated his
girth. He worked deliberately for a 55-year-old man unused to heavy
lifting.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end, he surveyed the pale gray foundation with a look
of satisfaction, a drop of sweat dangling from the end of his nose.
When the work was done, he posed with a sweet-faced little boy
named Michael Moore, who had shadowed the speaker as he worked.
</P>
<P>
   As other boys who had been hanging around joined Michael and the
speaker, Gingrich seized the opportunity. ``Our visit is really
about these boys' future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim here.)
</P>
<P>
   While here, Gingrich often has taken the tone of a statesman,
using carefully measured words to describe his talks with leaders
here and even speaking respectfully of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He also has associated himself with John Hume, a friend and
Northern Ireland's most respected Roman Catholic political leader.
At a St. Patrick's Day luncheon hosted by the speaker in
Washington, Gingrich said that he and Hume determined that they
were distantly related.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich was scheduled to have dinner Thursday with Hume, an
architect of the peace plan and a Nobel Peace Prize nominee, in
Donegal. Thursday morning, he was scheduled to visit the O'Doherty
Genealogy Center to help trace his family roots. The O'Dohertys are
the ancestors of his mother, Kathleen Daugherty.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that sense there's a certain amount of personal fun
involved in this trip,'' said Gingrich, who is scheduled to return
home to the United States on Saturday. ``Like all Americans, I'm
curious about my background.''
</P>
<P>
   And given the attention American presidents have received by
visiting their ancient Irish homesteads, the speaker also may be
gathering information for some future visit under very different
circumstances.

   JERUSALEM _ The waitress could see that my parents and I were
novices.
</P>
<P>
   Huddled with a few Israelis in the bathroom corridor of a
downtown sandwich shop, we waited for word that the suspicious
object down the street had been deemed harmless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this your first time?'' said our server with a big,
friendly smile.
</P>
<P>
   Such friendly smiles might be a rarity in this tense city, but
bomb scares are not.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, we were allowed back to our table. Israeli bomb
specialists were putting their armor vests back into their van.
</P>
<P>
   After a year as Cox Newspapers' Middle East correspondent, I
realized, during this visit from my parents, that I'm getting used
to conditions that most Americans would find unnerving and most
Israelis barely notice.
</P>
<P>
   The news media here has been saturated this week with coverage
of the U.S. embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. They were the
kind of events that, unfortunately, have shaped the daily life of
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Police here sometimes deal with hundreds of bomb scares a day
after terror attacks.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen a bomb squad seal off a pedestrian promenade and, with
ropes, carefully tug apart a mysterious paper box only to find a
cake inside. The day after a birthday party for a colleague's
child, the bomb squad blew up an unfamiliar object found in the
garbage -- a beat up pinata.
</P>
<P>
   Entering any mall or movie theater, guards search your shoulder
bag. They take your name and license plate number when parking at
the mall.
</P>
<P>
   Any doubt that this is necessary was erased a few months ago.
Israeli police said Palestinian terrorists had cased a Jerusalem
mall, passing through security with heavy bags of nails to test the
prospects of returning someday with nail bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Suicide bombers killed 21 Israelis in attacks in July and
September of last year.
</P>
<P>
   These attacks rattle the Israelis, cause breaks in peace talks
and can unsettle the region. The omnipresent security may actually
relieve tension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only do we accept it, but we welcome it,'' said Rachel
Levy-Shiff, psychology professor at Tel Aviv's Bar-Ilan University.
</P>
<P>
   Suicide bombers have walked right past guards on the way to
their attacks. But Levy-Shiff said that security, even if it might
be an ``illusion,'' still makes Israelis feel better.
</P>
<P>
   Airline passengers here face questioning about who packed their
bags, who they met in Israel and whether they know any Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   It can take just a few minutes, or can lead to an item-by-item
inspection of luggage by large, multi-lingual, teams of young
Israelis.

   Israelis or even American Jews often face just perfunctory
security reviews.

   When an Israeli Jew walked past a security ring in 1995 and
killed Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, police were accused of having
a ``blind spot'' toward the threat from their own people.

   JERUSALEM _ The waitress could see that my parents and I were
novices.
</P>
<P>
   Huddled with a few Israelis in the bathroom corridor of a
downtown sandwich shop, we waited for word that the suspicious
object down the street had been deemed harmless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this your first time?'' said our server with a big,
friendly smile.
</P>
<P>
   Such friendly smiles might be a rarity in this tense city, but
bomb scares are not.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, we were allowed back to our table. Israeli bomb
specialists were putting their armor vests back into their van.
</P>
<P>
   After a year as Cox Newspapers' Middle East correspondent, I
realized, during this visit from my parents, that I'm getting used
to conditions that most Americans would find unnerving and most
Israelis barely notice.
</P>
<P>
   The news media here has been saturated this week with coverage
of the U.S. embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. They were the
kind of events that, unfortunately, have shaped the daily life of
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Police here sometimes deal with hundreds of bomb scares a day
after terror attacks.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen a bomb squad seal off a pedestrian promenade and, with
ropes, carefully tug apart a mysterious paper box only to find a
cake inside. The day after a birthday party for a colleague's
child, the bomb squad blew up an unfamiliar object found in the
garbage -- a beat up pinata.
</P>
<P>
   Entering any mall or movie theater, guards search your shoulder
bag. They take your name and license plate number when parking at
the mall.
</P>
<P>
   Any doubt that this is necessary was erased a few months ago.
Israeli police said Palestinian terrorists had cased a Jerusalem
mall, passing through security with heavy bags of nails to test the
prospects of returning someday with nail bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Suicide bombers killed 21 Israelis in attacks in July and
September of last year.
</P>
<P>
   These attacks rattle the Israelis, cause breaks in peace talks
and can unsettle the region. The omnipresent security may actually
relieve tension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only do we accept it, but we welcome it,'' said Rachel
Levy-Shiff, psychology professor at Tel Aviv's Bar-Ilan University.
</P>
<P>
   Suicide bombers have walked right past guards on the way to
their attacks. But Levy-Shiff said that security, even if it might
be an ``illusion,'' still makes Israelis feel better.
</P>
<P>
   Airline passengers here face questioning about who packed their
bags, who they met in Israel and whether they know any Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   It can take just a few minutes, or can lead to an item-by-item
inspection of luggage by large, multi-lingual, teams of young
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis or even American Jews often face just perfunctory
security reviews.
</P>
<P>
   When an Israeli Jew walked past a security ring in 1995 and
killed Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, police were accused of having
a ``blind spot'' toward the threat from their own people.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Palestinians will often be separated from the crowd

<TEXT>
<P>
   Phil Garner, the Milwaukee Brewers' manager, faced a problem
last summer that many other parents are confronting: a teen-age son
wanting to use a controversial dietary supplement called creatine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew my son, Ty, who's a senior playing baseball, was going
to use it,'' Garner said. ``So I wanted to try it first-hand, but
in a controlled way.''
</P>
<P>
   For three months, the former player and coach for the Houston
Astros took the recommended doses of creatine monohydrate, a
laboratory replication of the muscle-building compound formed from
amino acids in the liver, kidneys and pancreas.
</P>
<P>
   In his brief exposure to creatine, Garner was impressed. ``You
definitely feel energized,'' he said. ``You get a good workout with
it. You're stronger and you look better.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar testimonials have come from major league sluggers Jeff
Bagwell, Dante Bichette, Harold Baines, Ken Caminiti, Eric Karros,
Ryan Klesko, Mike Piazza and Gary Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows you to push more weight for a longer period, which
will make you stronger in the long run,'' said Bagwell, the Astros'
first baseman.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bill Bryan, team physician for the Astros, has conducted a
poll of major-league players that indicates at least 200 are
supplementing the body's natural supply of creatine with the
manufactured variety.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire, who is assaulting the hallowed record of 61 home
runs in a season by Roger Maris, claims creatine has ``helped a lot
with strength and endurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike anabolic steroids, the muscle-pumping but potentially
fatal hormones that raged in the 1970s, creatine is legal, and it
can be purchased without a prescription.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, creatine sales are booming _ from $50 million
in 1996 to $100 million last year to an expected $300 million this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Americans are buying creatine, and even horses are
taking it. Never mind that some doctors warn that its use _ or
misuse _ can lead to torn and cramped muscles, gastrointestinal
distress, kidney malfunction, high blood pressure, dehydration and
heat stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Although Garner, 49, noticed no ill effects from his brief
creatine trial, he said, ``There is a downside. It leads to some
strange injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics say creatine drastically alters the body's hydraulics
as it shifts water from the bloodstream to the skeletal muscles.
And since the substance acts on muscles, and the heart is a
creatine-containing muscle, some doctors fear supplementation could
lead to cardiovascular troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Mackie Shilstone, conditioning consultant for the San Francisco
Giants, has steered players toward creatine, but he has misgivings:
``The one question that hangs out there is, what effect does it
have on the heart?``
</P>
<P>
   Greg Hoover, a Houston physician specializing in sports
medicine, said: ``The cardiac muscle is somewhat different from
skeletal muscles, but there could be potential that you're
enlarging the heart as well as other muscles. This is something we
really don't know. It's too early to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Since athletes have been training with creatine for only six to
seven years, its long-term effects cannot be determined.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lon Castle of the Baylor Sports Medicine Institute in
Houston lamented that creatine use is widespread among high school
students and has made its way into junior high schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of parents are bringing kids in for school physicals and
asking me about creatine, wondering if their sons will be hurt by
it,'' Castle said. ``These kids are 13, 14 years old and they're
taking this stuff. This is where the emulation of athletes starts
to get dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
QUESTIONS ON LONG-TERM USE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Creatine was investigated by the Food and Drug Administration
last year following the fatal heart attacks of three college
wrestlers who were thought to have used the supplement.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA attributed the deaths to training in rubber suits in
heated rooms, in dehydrated condition. Even so, the agency issued a
warning in April that anyone using creatine first should consult a
physician.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, creatine has been subjected to what Bryan calls ``a
witch hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever somebody pulls a muscle or dies, we're going to blame
creatine. One guy e-mailed me the other day who said he has a fatal
heart condition, and he swears it's due to creatine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he's right. On the other hand, you do have to
be concerned about risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Willie Ainsley, former Astros prospect who now works for
Houston's Department of Parks and Recreation, said he knows of a
teen-ager in south Houston who died recently after he and some
friends bought into a bottle of creatine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently he didn't drink enough water after he took it,''
Ainsley said. ``He went out and played basketball, and he died that
night in his sleep when his whole body cramped up.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy's family declined to be interviewed, so it's not known
what other factors might have contributed to the death.
</P>
<P>
   With a withering summer producing more than 100 fatal heat
strokes in Texas, Bryan frets about high-school football players
going through two-a-day workouts while creatine supplements course
through their veins.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we launch into Texas football,'' he said, ``our biggest
concern is that young athletes may be at jeopardy for dehydration
and heat stroke.''
</P>
<P>
   Castle consults with the University of Houston football program
and has advised the athletes to cycle off creatine during
two-a-days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, when more players were taking creatine than in the
past, we put in a lot more IVs than we did in the past,'' he said.
``My supposition is the people taking creatine got dehydrated
working out twice a day under that hot Texas sun.''
</P>
<P>
   Astros second baseman Craig Biggio, who bulked up with creatine
last year but has sworn off it for this baseball season, feels it
should be avoided in hot weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go into St. Louis to play a game in the middle of the
summer,'' he said, ``there's just not enough fluids you can
drink.''
</P>
<P>
   And he disapproves of high school students using creatine at any
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``For below-20 guys, I don't see a need for it,'' he said.
``When you're 18 years old, you can work out hard and your body's
gonna bounce back without any supplements.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jenna Anding, a registered dietician and assistant professor
of nutrition at UH, agreed with Biggio. ``No one has studied the
effects of creatine in teen-agers,'' she said. ``I question whether
we need to be using these types of products at that young an age.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bryan is aware that many high school coaches are
recommending creatine and in some cases supplying it themselves to
football players.
</P>
<P>
   ``With creatine now being used so widely in high school
football,'' he said, ``this will be the first year we find out if
our fears are valid. I think coaches nowadays know to force water
down these guys, especially when they're outside doing two-a-days.
But are they going to keep them hydrated enough?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're about to find out.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`I WON'T LOOK AT IT AGAIN' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The main knock on creatine is that it induces dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who take supplements,'' Castle said, ``should drink
lots of water _ 10 to 12 eight-ounce cups a day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' Derek Bell said his failure to drink enough water
with his creatine led to two off-season trips to a hospital, first
with kidney stones and later with dehydration. After those
incidents, he said he ``threw the creatine in the garbage'' and
added: ``I won't look at it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight major league teams, including McGwire's St. Louis
Cardinals, are on record as opposing creatine because they believe
it damages as many muscles as it builds.
</P>
<P>
   But McGwire, who was called ``The Big Always Hurt,'' swings on
into history, as healthy as crabgrass. Every upper-deck launch is a
sales boost for creatine.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Bagwell and Biggio could be poster boys for creatine.
Biggio, a seven-time All-Star, played 494 consecutive games before
taking a day off last week.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell, the Astros' perennial home run leader, has used
creatine for three years, and he played all 162 games in 1996 and
'97, missing action this season only because of a lacerated knee.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Kraemer of the Penn State University Center for
Sports Medicine believes that when athletes in their 20s and 30s
use creatine in proper dosage and with appropriate amount of
liquids, they are not endangering their health.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If creatine causes cramping, he said, the 1996 Atlanta Olympics
``would have been the Cramping Games; about 80 percent of the
athletes were on creatine.''
</P>
<P>
   But Biggio admitted that while using creatine he ``did have some
cramping. It helped me with training, but I stayed on it way too
long last year. This year, I've been able to maintain without it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoover said that when conducting physical examinations of Texas
A&AMP;M football players, he found ``a lot of them were getting
abdominal cramps. They weren't hydrating well with the use of
creatine.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Coleman, the Astros' strength coach, said the ``three or
four'' players on the team who take creatine reduce the risk of
muscle pulls by abstaining from it during the season.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell limits his creatine to the off-season, but not because
it's dangerous to do otherwise. ``The only reason I don't take it
during the season,'' he said, ``is that my schedule is too busy for
me to get involved in the load-up phase.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he fears adverse side effects from creatine, he said:
``All I know is that creatine hasn't done anything to my body to
make me say, `Oh, my God, this is scary.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan, 49, had a scare after taking creatine last spring while
training for his hobby of bicycle racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was judicious with it,'' he said. ``Then we had a
bicycle race in Austin and I developed the most atypical cramps in
both my legs; I thought I was going to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it was because of creatine and getting dehydrated and
pushing too hard. You tend to do that with creatine. We saw that
all the time with anabolic steroids. Torn tendons, torn muscles,
torn ligaments. The stuff was driving the system too hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoover also has seen gruesome muscle damage: ``three men who had
ruptures of the pectoral muscles and two biceps tendon muscles
after using creatine for an extended period.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting muscles that are so much stronger than the
tendons we have,'' Hoover said. ``That's why they're being ripped
off.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
IT'S A MUSCLE SENSATION &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Harrowing tales of muscles popping loose have not kept the
National Football League from embracing creatine. In a sport where
strength is critical to success at most positions, creatine is
almost as popular as steak.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent poll by USA Today, the New York Giants, Tennessee
Oilers, Chicago Bears and Oakland Raiders reported more than 50
percent of their players take creatine.
</P>
<P>
   And the substance has won a following in the college ranks. The
University of Nebraska, always on the leading edge of muscle
training, has supplied its football players with creatine for the
last four years. Three of those seasons ended in national
championships.
</P>
<P>
   It's no mystery why creatine is a sensation. ``When researchers
give people creatine and give another group a placebo,'' Bryan
said, ``the creatine users do better at lifting weights.''
</P>
<P>
   If creatine doesn't bring the muscle accumulation steroids can
do, it's far less frightening, because it is not hormonal in
nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given my choice between creatine and anabolic steroids,''
Hoover said, ``I'd pick creatine in a second.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman said the Astros have ``no official club policy on
creatine, because we don't know what it does long-term. The players
who take it get their own creatine and use it at their own risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Sean Berry tried creatine before the 1996 season,
during which he had a career-high 95 runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took it for three months, but when I started hearing a few
bad things about it, I stopped,'' Berry said. ``I really have heard
more positive about it than negative. Maybe I should have stayed
with it. I had my best year after I used the creatine.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't feel the gain is dramatic enough to make a big
difference in your performance. With some people, I think the
effect is more mental than physical.''
</P>
<P>
   Effects vary among athletes, depending on how much they work out
and how much creatine they produce naturally.
</P>
<P>
   ``People with a higher baseline level of creatine in the body do
not respond particularly well to supplementation,'' Castle said.
``You can get that baseline level determined, but it's very
expensive to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggio said that before using creatine, people ``should educate
themselves about it. You have to do your homework to determine when
to take it and how long to take it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see how mistakes are made. Creatine often comes in
packaging that provides no warnings about the need for extra
liquids.
</P>
<P>
   The directions that accompany the creatine sold at Bally's
health clubs in Houston advise only to take the substance ``with
several ounces of cool water.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the labels of several brands of creatine recently
examined at a GNC store contained no references to hydration risk.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan said: ``The creatine label should state that once you're
outside in a dehydrating environment, away from that
air-conditioned gym, you'd better be careful to have plenty of
fluids in you.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, some consumers are learning that the hard way.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`IT'S BUYER BEWARE' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994,
creatine is classified not as a drug but as a nutrient. As such, it
was admitted to the marketplace without having to undergo
scientific testing. The FDA has no authority to regulate it unless
it's first proved to be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   And the FDA hasn't found the evidence against it to be
conclusive.
</P>
<P>
   So, as Anding said: ``It's buyer beware.''
</P>
<P>
   Creatine is not marketed by the major drug companies. It can be
ordered by mail, and some magazine advertisements contain veiled
references to competitors pushing impure products.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say whatever you want to market it and you can put
anything you want into the product,'' Castle said. ``How much
filler are they using and what kind? How much actual creatine is in
there? Who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   Hoover cited a recent study by the American Academy of Sports
Medicine: ``They tested several commercial preparations of
supplements, including creatine, and there were unidentifiable
impurities found in four of six samples.''
</P>
<P>
   Anding advises against ordering any dietary supplement by mail.
``Major health-food stores are big enough that they can demand
quality products,'' she said. ``But some of these mail-order
companies, you don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers might consider a tragedy involving the mail-order sale
of the amino acid supplement tryptophan in the late 1980s. Some 30
deaths were attributed to a contaminated batch produced in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the creatine buyer has obtained a product that meets
the ``99.9 percent'' purity standard that many labels promise, the
next issue becomes dosage.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers recommend taking 15 to 25 grams of creatine per
day for the ``loading phase'' of the training program, which lasts
five to seven days. After that, the daily dosage is supposed to
drop to three to five grams for ``maintenance.''
</P>
<P>
   Some users double or triple the suggested dosage. Such a
practice produces no additional muscle, Bryan said, while greatly
increasing the risk of health damage.
</P>
<P>
   A 400-gram bottle _ a one-month supply _ of powdered creatine
(the product also is available as a gel, candy bar, chewing gum and
liquid form) _ typically costs $30 to $70, with prices trending
downward.
</P>
<P>
   Castle feels that for some athletes, it may be worth the
expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the University of Houston we have some pro football
prospects,'' he said. ``Creatine may give them just enough strength
gain that they do a little better on their bench press at the
combine, and they get drafted. So you're talking about their career
and a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``But a 10-year-old, a 12-year-old, they can all go buy creatine
in stores, and we don't know what the long-term effects of using
this will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about long-term risk, Bagwell said: ``I don't worry about
that. There's a lot of things people put in their bodies that give
them long-term effects they don't worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's one thing for Bagwell, a 30-year-old professional
ballplayer who works out zealously with medical supervision, to
take that position. It's another situation when teen-agers looking
for a better physique are plunging into a substance they know
nothing about.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan noted that teen-agers ``tend to forgo good eating habits.
I worry about kids taking a couple of scoops of creatine and a
Snickers bar and thinking that's all they need. We've observed this
problem at the collegiate level, which is disconcerting.''
</P>
<P>
   Castle said: ``You've got to wonder what problems someone may
have 10 years from now because he took creatine when he was 12.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Garner has those same concerns. ``We don't need to be going
hog-wild on this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it looks like, for better or worse, that's already
happening.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON CREATINE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For weekend release, Aug. 15) 
(Also with Creatine-athletes, Creatine-doctor) 
 
By ALAN TRUEX 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Ten questions and answers about creatine:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ What's the difference between creatine and anabolic steroids?
</P>
<P>
   They are completely different biochemically. Unlike steroids,
which are taken to increase testosterone production, creatine has
nothing to do with hormones; it is a product of the metabolism of
amino acids and acts only on the muscles.
</P>
<P>
   _ How does creatine compare with steroids in building muscle?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charles Yesalis, who has conducted research on creatine at
Penn State University, estimates it is only 15 percent to 20
percent as effective as anabolic steroids in adding muscle. Dr. Lon
Castle of the Baylor Sports Medicine Institute emphasizes that
those who take creatine without working out will not benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``With anabolic steroids, you don't have to work out very hard
to look good,'' Castle said. ``With creatine, you have to put a lot
of energy into it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Is creatine damaging to the liver?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not, but there is concern about long-term damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we do blood work on athletes who use creatine,'' Castle
observes, ``we notice their liver functions are up a little bit.
But they go right back to normal when they stop cycling the
creatine. So maybe it does make the liver work harder. But so far
we haven't seen any signs of damage to the liver.''
</P>
<P>
   _ How long does creatine monohydrate stay in the body?
</P>
<P>
   A dose of creatine is believed to remain in the body for about
four weeks, but Castle says, ``I don't know of any studies that
show exactly how long the external creatine stays in the body. You
can test the creatine level, but it won't distinguish the synthetic
from the natural.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if someone is taking a lot of creatine, blood tests won't
show it because the body dumps it when it gets beyond a certain
level. At that point the body, which produces about a gram of
creatine a day, shuts down its production.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Does creatine make athletes faster?
</P>
<P>
   British sprinter Linford Christie said it brought him Olympic
gold in 1992, but creatine doesn't necessarily increase speed. Any
gain in leg muscle is likely to be offset by an equal gain in water
weight. Studies have shown that swimmers have slower times after
loading on creatine than before.
</P>
<P>
   However, some football players report increases in speed after
taking creatine for a month, building leg muscles, and then cycling
off it for a month to allow the water to recede from the muscles.
</P>
<P>
   _ Is creatine useful for pitchers?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not. ``Pitching is mostly flexibility and mechanics,''
Castle says. ``If you get bigger you change your mechanics, and
that can throw everything out of whack. You don't see pitchers who
look like Mark McGwire.'' McGwire does use creatine.
</P>
<P>
   _ How do you choose which brand of creatine to use?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jenna Anding, licensed dietician and assistant professor of
nutrition at the University of Houston, advises: ``Look at the
research studies on that certain supplement and the brand of
products those studies used. Researchers use the purest creatine
they can get.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also wise to choose creatine powder that's fine-grain; a
coarse, granular powder may be more difficult to digest and more
likely to cause diarrhea and stomach cramping.
</P>
<P>
   _ Does creatine give people energy?
</P>
<P>
   Some creatine users claim it does, but Dr. Bill Bryan of the
Baylor Sports Medicine Institute insists otherwise. He finds no
reason to take creatine a few minutes prior to competition.
``That's absurd,'' he says. ``It has to get in your body, and it
has to build up and you have to take advantage of it by working
out.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Is liquid creatine better than powder?
</P>
<P>
   For people who might not be drinking enough water, it's better.
But people who aren't drinking plenty of water shouldn't be in a
creatine program in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Greg Hoover, a Houston sports medicine specialist, said that
while ``liquid creatine is advertised as being more efficient than
the powder, there's no evidence this is true. But it is more
expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Where can more information be obtained about creatine and
other sports supplements?
</P>
<P>
   The Internet. You can reach the Medline Web site at
www4.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/medline.html. Then type in the name of
any supplement you wish to research. You also can read medical
reports and studies at the Texas Medical Center.

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kenneth B. Lazarus has a high-tech solution to an age-old
problem: stopping baseball players' hands from stinging when they
hit a ball off the wrong part of the bat.
</P>
<P>
   Lazarus' company, Active Control Experts Inc., has designed a
system, embedded in an aluminium bat, that turns the bat's natural
vibrations into energy _ energy that is not felt by the batter.
</P>
<P>
   The result: the $290 bat Copperhead ACX bat, which retails for
about $100 more than other high-end aluminum bats. ACX officials
say the Copperhead decreases player discomfort when batting,
boosting ballplayers' confidence in their hitting ability. Batters
feel as if they have hit the ``sweet spot,'' the ideal contact
point on the bat, even when they haven't, Lazarus said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of contact sports, getting that solid feel of hitting
the object is a reinforcing feeling that does give players more
confidence,'' Lazarus said. ``If you're not nervous about it
hurting and you have more confidence, that psychologically impacts
you to be a better player.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicknamed the Smart Bat, the high-tech piece of equipment is
made and marketed by Worth Inc. of Tullahoma, Tenn.. Worth plans to
focus on younger and amateur players in leagues with less stringent
rules about qualifying bats.
</P>
<P>
   While Major League Baseball uses only wooden bats, aluminum bats
are standard equipment in college, high school, and Little League
play, and increasingly used in unofficial recreation. The Smart
Bat's special piezoelectric components don't make it illegal for
National Collegiate Athletic Association teams, as long as the bat
fits weight, height, diameter, and performance regulations,
according to an NCAA spokesman, Wallace I. Renfro.
</P>
<P>
   ACX and Worth officials say piezoelectrics are an improvement
over older, more low-tech methods of damping vibrations, including
what Lazarus calls ``rubber and goo.'' And coaches and
retail &UR;  &LR; chain buyers are taking notice: Although Worth just started
producing the bats on July 20, each day the Tennessee firm turns
out 20 bats and takes 15 orders for more.
</P>
<P>
   The bats should be in retail stores by the end of August, and
currently can be ordered from Worth. According to Derrick Olsen,
Worth's baseball marketing manager, July is the industry's selling
season for baseball bats, giving coaches time to buy before the
next season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cambridge, Mass. company has optimistic projections for the
bat's sales. This year, Worth expects to sell 12,000 to 24,000
Copperheads, netting 15 to 18 percent of the aluminum-bat market,
Olsen said. Currently, Worth's most expensive bat after the
Copperhead ACX is the regular Copperhead, selling at about $190.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising will be secondary to personal experience and word of
mouth in Worth's campaign to sell Copperheads; the company has
provided free test bats to 25 high school baseball coaches who
serve on the firm's baseball advisory board. ``Word of mouth
typically works extremely well in this industry,'' said the
Copperhead's developer, Worth research and development vice
president Dan S. Pitsenberger.
</P>
<P>
   The Smart Bat is not ACX's first foray into solving the problem
of sports equipment vibrations and turning it into profit. The
100-employee company, founded in 1992 by president and chief
executive Lazarus and chairman Edward Crawley, is a relative
veteran in the applied piezoelectric products market. The privately
held firm focuses on sports gear, with piezoelectric skis,
snowboards, and a suspension mountain bike, all already on the
market from Los Angeles-based K2 Inc.
</P>
<P>
   After developing the company's core piezoelectric technology in
1992 and 1993, ACX found that skiers would pay to reduce vibration
in their skis as they barreled down a mountain. ACX canvassed a
short &UR;  &LR; list of top ski companies and selected K2, which agreed to
buy the credit-card-sized smart components.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting K2 Four model, known as the Smart Ski, became the
best-selling ski in the United States, according to Stuart N.
Rempel, vice president and general manager for K2 skis. The
sporting-goods manufacturer has since come out with the Merlin line
of skis, which use more advanced ACX technology, including a
piezoelectric coil embedded in the ski.
</P>
<P>
   K2 says that its Smart Skis are allowed in professional
competition, and that many pros use them.
</P>
<P>
   ACX's management comes from the technical side of its product.
Both founders are Massachusetts Institute of Technology engineers
by training; Lazarus earned his doctorate at MIT, and Crawley still
heads its aeronautics and astronautics department. Their idea
centered on the use of piezoelectric ceramic materials to cut down
on vibrations, allowing moving parts to function without
disruption. The firm makes only the piezoelectric system, selling
the components to other companies for use in products.
</P>
<P>
   To finance development of the core piezoelectric components, ACX
generated $300,000 from selling stakes in the company, which now
has about 100 investors. In 1995, the company raised $1.5 million
in its second round of financing; the company has now raised $8
million.
</P>
<P>
   While the company won't disclose its revenues, it is growing at
a rate of 100 percent each year and recently reached the break-even
point, according to the chief financial officer, Scott B. Taitel.
He says ACX is considering going public in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   The company foresees several key applications for the
technology, which ACX manufactures in its Cambridge facility. While
ACX officials would not disclose specific plans for pipeline
products or potential manufacturing partners, Taitel says the firm
plans to expand its piezoelectric components into different types
of sports equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer electronics also offer a potentially large market for
the company, with products including piezoelectric disk drives,
pagers, and cell phones slated to come to market in the next one to
two years. In addition, the company plans to market automotive
applications within two to five years, Taitel says.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Smart Bat, its profitability will rest on customers'
willingness to shell out more money for a bat with mostly
psychological benefits.
</P>
<P>
   At Brine's Sporting Goods in Cambridge, for example, its
top-of-the-line aluminum bat, the Louisville Slugger TPX
Megabarrel, goes for $189; the Cadillac of bats, made from
titanium, can cost as much as $600.
</P>
<P>
   Lazarus says he's confident ballplayers will see beyond the
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that's changed with the advent of the metal
bat is they last longer,'' Lazarus said. ``You can spend a little
more money on a bat and it will last you a whole season, instead of
a dozen (wooden bats) each season.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he says, ACX is counting on batters' attraction to
quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to have the best equipment,'' he said. ``They want
to really enjoy themselves, and that means being their best.''
</P>
<P>
   The view from the trenches at this point is uncertain. Few
people have had the chance to play with the bat. But at least one
coach has already become a fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids loved it,'' said Ken R. Kezer, head baseball coach at
New Britain High School in New Britain, Conn., a Worth advisory
panel member who received a free bat from the company and plans to
order six Copperheads for his players. ``It was nice and light.
Contact was good on any part of the bat.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all sports fans think a high-priced damper system is
worth the money. ``I wouldn't buy it,'' said Joseph T. Bennett, a
salesman at Adams Sporting Goods Inc. in Dorchester, Mass., whose
top-of-the-line aluminum bat is the Louisville Slugger Air Attack,
selling for $115. ``It's just too expensive.''

CHEMICAL HELPS `FUEL' MUSCLES TO CONTRACT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For weekend release, Aug. 15) 
(Also with Creatine-athletes, Creatine-Q&AMP;A) 
 
By ALAN TRUEX 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ For all the controversy it has created, creatine
monohydrate looks harmless. In its most common form, it's an
odorless, virtually tasteless powder that's dissolved into water or
fruit juices and then swallowed.
</P>
<P>
   This is the laboratory-produced version of a chemical compound
synthesized in the liver, kidneys and pancreas from the breakdown
of the amino acids argenine, glycine and methionine.
</P>
<P>
   It's sold in nutrition stores and gyms, through the mail and on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   So what does it do?
</P>
<P>
   When combined with phosphate, creatine helps the body replenish
its supply of adenosine triphosphate, the ``fuel'' that drives the
muscles to contract. With a shot of supplemental creatine, the
theory goes, the muscles pump longer.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`MORE ENERGY' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you more energy for anything that's aerobic in
nature,'' said Gene Coleman, strength coach of the Houston Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Creatine's role in muscle development has been known since the
mid-19th century, but it was not used as a performance enhancer
until the 1992 British Olympians trained with it. When Linford
Christie proceeded to win the gold medal in the 100-meter run, he
credited creatine for adding spring in his leg muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Thus began the creatine craze. It soon became the favored
muscle-building supplement of athletes around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The ``legal, safe steroid,'' it's called, and its use is
described in terminology that mimics steroids: During a five- to
seven-day ``loading'' period, the athlete takes 20 to 25 grams of
creatine per day; then the dosage drops to three to five grams
daily for a ``maintenance'' period, to be followed by ``cycling
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Creatine is actually not a steroid. It has nothing to do with
the production of hormones. But whether it's safe is a matter of
ongoing debate among sports medicine doctors.
</P>
<P>
   By the completion of a monthlong creatine cycle, the athlete
typically adds six to 10 pounds of body weight. But about half that
gain is water, not muscle tissue.
</P>
<P>
   As Dr. Bill Bryan of the Baylor Sports Medicine Institute in
Houston explained it, ``You may look better, but you're
water-logged. With creatine in them, the cells suck up water.''
</P>
<P>
   And a muscle cramp or strain may develop, Bryan said, ``if the
water goes into the muscles and stretches the fibers. People on
creatine have experienced an increase in the number of sprains and
muscle pulls. Whether that's because they're driving the muscle too
hard or whether it's because it's swollen with water, we don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
HAMSTRING PULLS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Nash, a Houston chiropractor who has worked with
college athletes and the U.S. women's Olympic volleyball team,
blames creatine for causing hamstring pulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The athletes coming in with that injury are, to a really high
degree, ones using creatine,'' he said. ``We were sitting in the
stands at a Rice baseball game one day, and somebody mentioned that
a player had a hamstring injury. Almost in unison, a group of
scouts said, `Creatine.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The creatine per se may not be a problem,'' Nash said, ``but
the lack of fluids can be a major problem. And we don't know much
about how it reacts with whatever other supplements are being
used.''
</P>
<P>
   What is known is that creatine, when combined with proper diet
and vigorous workouts, can contribute to gains in strength.
</P>
<P>
   In controlled studies at three universities, athletes using
creatine showed significantly more improvement in weightlifting
performance than did placebo groups in identical training programs.
</P>
<P>
   At the Penn State University Center for Sports Medicine, the
gains were noticeable one week after athletes had consumed 25 grams
a day of creatine monohydrate.
</P>
<P>
   These findings were supported by a similar study at the
University of Nottingham in England, where athletes used 20 grams
per day.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study at Truman State University in Missouri showed
that weightlifters taking only five grams of creatine per day
increased their bench press by an average of 20 pounds over a
six-week period.
</P>
<P>
   All these studies lead back to the question of how much creatine
the body needs.
</P>
<P>
   The human body typically produces one or two grams of creatine
each day. Five grams of the synthetic creatine monohydrate is equal
to the amount of creatine obtainable from eating 2.2 pounds of
uncooked beef or salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors think this may be an appropriate amount of creatine for
a full-time athlete, but it's far more than the average citizen
needs.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan notes that research on creatine has been minimal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have not looked at racial differences; they haven't
looked at age factors,'' he said. ``Maybe an 18-year-old can get
away with it and middle-aged men can't.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be careful as you get older, because your body
metabolism tends to change. If you're over 40, you should have some
blood work done to make sure your kidney is functioning well before
you get into this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jenna Anding, a registered licensed dietician and assistant
professor of nutrition at the University of Houston, said, ``I
don't know if I can recommend it for women, because the studies
have not shown conclusively that it's safe for women.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
PHYSICAL CONDITION &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bryan, the Astros' team physician, believes athletes who benefit
from creatine are already in excellent physical condition. He and
trainer Dave Labossiere discourage its use by players who are prone
to muscle strains or dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   Said Bryan: ``We're telling those guys, `You probably don't want
to do this.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Greg Hoover, a Houston sports medicine specialist,
emphasized that whoever uses creatine ``should not stay on it
continuously. Even if you take a lot of water, you can get problems
with the kidneys being overstressed and not having a chance to
recover.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoover also theorizes that the muscles need periodic relief from
creatine supplementation, so they can return to their normal state
of hydration.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors all urge caution in using creatine. But they agree
that it does what it's supposed to do: It helps people acquire more
muscle.

MANY ATHLETES SEEKING EXTRA EDGE TURN TO DIET SUPPLEMENTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For weekend release, Aug. 15) 
(Eds.: Day 2 of three-part series) 
 
By ALAN TRUEX 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ As batting practice was about to begin, Astros first
baseman Jeff Bagwell rushed to his locker, pulled a plastic bottle
of ``zinc stresstabs'' off a shelf and swallowed a pill.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of many nutritional supplements stocked in the
clubhouse by Bagwell and second baseman Craig Biggio, who total
nine All-Star appearances between them.
</P>
<P>
   Their success may or may not be attributable in part to diet
supplementation. But like elite athletes in any sport, the best
baseball players tend to do whatever they can to increase their
strength and durability.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a million things you can take,'' Bagwell said during a
break from his ongoing training mission. ``There are all these
things that are supposed to be the new drug that will do wonders _
build you up like steroids but be good to the body.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell grinned.
</P>
<P>
   He doubts anything healthful can make it easy to acquire a
sculpted physique. He is the most muscular of the Astros _ a shade
under 6 feet and 200 pounds _ because he has worked out almost
daily (pumping iron as soon as the game ends) for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell is not one of the home-run mashers rumored on the
baseball circuit to partake of anabolic steroids, which were deemed
to be potentially lethal and made illegal in 1990 (except by
doctor's prescription).
</P>
<P>
   But going the legal route, Bagwell has taken androstenedione,
which is a close neighbor in the hormone chain to the illegal
steroids. So close, in fact, that the International Olympic
Committee banned it. Shot-putter Randy Barnes recently was
suspended for using this substance.
</P>
<P>
   While Bagwell has had impressive results with creatine, a muscle
energizer approved by the IOC, he said, ``I took Andro-6 for a
while, and I thought it worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say Andro-6 works because two of its main ingredients
are tribulus and androstenedione _ hot items on the gray market of
``hormone precursors'' that are legal, but tenuously so.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lon Castle of the Baylor Sports Medicine Institute in
Houston said Andro-6 ``is definitely a little more worrisome than
creatine. Androstene is a steroid, and it does make people
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Androstenedione and its ``mother hormone'' of DHEA
(dehydroepiandrosterone) are advertised on the Internet, as are
tribulus and chrysin (another ingredient of Andro-6) as ``legal
steroids'' and ``growth hormones.''
</P>
<P>
   QFAC, a supplement distributor with a Web site called ``Dirty
Dieting,'' warns that these steroid precursors ``may soon become
restricted and/or banned.''
</P>
<P>
   The underlying message: ``Buy them while you can.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have the potency of the illegal steroids,'' Castle
said. ``But when people take a lot of them, as they tend to do if
they want to add significant strength, then they're dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   They're under scrutiny from the Food and Drug Administration
because they are advertised to double or triple the production of
testosterone, the male hormone and primary muscle-building steroid.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA banned the selling of DHEA in 1996. Upon further review,
it was reinstated to legal status, but that could change again.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Greg Hoover, a Houston specialist in sports medicine, said,
``We haven't yet seen the abuse and side effects with these
precursors that we saw with anabolic steroids. But when that does
happen, we may have some more banned substances.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
HUMAN GUINEA PIGS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Step into a nutrition store, and you see dozens of products _
androstene and DHEA among them _ that are supposed to transform you
into Arnold Schwarzenegger. Dietary supplementation is a
multibillion-dollar industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was more money spent last year on alternative medicine
and nutritional products than on medicine itself,'' Hoover
observed. ``With the money involved in sports, everyone looks for
that little edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggio, 32, said, ``When you're 28, 29, 35 and you're doing the
things we do in the gym, your body doesn't bounce back so well. As
you get older you have to look at supplements, not just creatine
but a lot of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, human beings are guinea pigs for many of these
products. Thanks to the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act
of 1994, a broad range of ``nutrients'' do not have to pass
scientific testing before being admitted to the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Before outlawing them, the FDA must prove through scientific
testing that the substances are harmful.
</P>
<P>
   The supplement industry vigorously lobbied for this legislation,
which excluded from FDA control amino acids, vitamins, minerals,
botanicals, metabolites (such as creatine) and _ giant loophole _
``dietary substances for use by man to supplement the diet to
increase the total dietary intake.''
</P>
<P>
   Androstene is a botanical, found in wild yams in Mexico.
Likewise, tribulus and chrysin are botanically based and assumed to
be harmless. Never mind that some plants _ poison ivy, poison oak,
coca leaves, opium poppy and certain strains of California
mushrooms _ pose obvious health risks.
</P>
<P>
   DHEA has been allowed back into circulation because it may be
safe at 50 milligrams per day. Nutritionist Beth M. Ley writes in
``DHEA: Unlocking the Secrets to the Fountain of Youth'' that
studies with mice indicate supplementation of this hormone extends
life span.
</P>
<P>
   However, Dr. Bill Bryan, team physician for the Astros, calls
DHEA ``the fountain of prostate cancer.'' Other doctors say it
causes not only prostate cancer in men but ovarian cancer in women.
And Ley notes that using DHEA in amounts large enough to promote
substantial muscle gain entails risk of liver disease.
</P>
<P>
   Castle believes there may be a certain amount of androstene or
DHEA that can increase muscle mass without inducing alarming
side-effects, such as shrinking testicles and soft-tissue breasts
in men, and beards and deepening voices in women.
</P>
<P>
   A shrewd body-builder, such as Bagwell, tries to determine the
dosage at which the anabolic product enhances strength without
posing a health threat.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors worry about such powerful chemicals being used by
the public _ especially teen-agers.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In a small third floor office in downtown Boston, Marc Pollick
presides over a charity that could help make it far easier for
professional athletes to overcome a tarnished public image.
</P>
<P>
   The Giving Back Fund, started by Pollick one year ago, is
offering athletes a one-stop service for establishing and
administering foundations, and the opportunity to turn their
lucrative salaries into philanthropic endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Many athletes try to establish charitable foundations, but the
funds often fail to achieve their promise when they are improperly
administered or poorly financed. Few young athletes get the
technical aid to sustain philanthropies from their agents,
franchise owners or players' unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been some horror stories of foundations that
weren't funded adequately, or the athlete is letting their brother
or uncle run things, and it just turns out badly,'' Pollick said.
``If it was managed properly and well-financed _ like a good
business _ it could be one of the very best things an athlete can
do. Our point is to try to provide a service to these truly wealthy
individuals who want to do good works.''
</P>
<P>
   The image of a wealthy, selfish athlete who flouts the mores of
society is increasingly well-established. With free agency in the
four major sports, athletes' salaries are now often well beyond the
imagination of he average fan. When athletes run afoul of the law
or of commonly accepted social behavior, even their good deeds are
greeted with skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports crises are clearly more frequent today than ever
before,'' said Kathleen Hessert, president of Sports Media
Challenge, a consultancy in North Carolina. ``One result is that
the public is actually getting numb to sports crises, even
expecting them.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey by Sports Media Challenge found that 70 percent
of professional sports teams and 74 percent of collegiate athletic
programs had experienced a crisis related to athletes' mistakes off
the playing field within the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers, and athletes themselves, believe that a perfect
antedote is philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much negative stuff going on, this is one way they
can look good,'' said Myron Finkbeiner, head of the World Sports
Humanitarian Hall of Fame in Boise, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a relative no-brainer,'' said Richard Lapchick, founder
of Northeastern University's Center for the Study of Sport in
Society, who is also an adviser to The Giving Back Fund. ``It's a
triple win situation. The community benefits from the players'
money and time, the player is less likely to fall into a
megalomaniacal posture and, if you get into that habit of
charitable giving and works, there is a better chance of being a
successful player because there are going to be fewer problems with
the team or their personal lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollick says he came to the idea of The Giving Back Fund ``very
circuitously.'' He was immersed in Holocaust studies at Boston
University, striving for a doctorate while working with Elie
Wiesel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea for a humanitarian studies institute came to mind,
and Elie really liked the idea,'' Pollick said. ``As we began
putting it together the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanitarian
Studies I found that he, with his celebrity, was able to make a lot
of contacts.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Pollick founded The Giving Back Fund, a national
nonprofit organization to encourage giving by athletes and
entertainers. The fund has been granted tax-exempt status as a
full-service public charity in all 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   It is composed of individually identified donor-advised funds
and foundations, each with donor-appointed trustees. While each of
the foundations appears to stand alone, Pollick said, they all
benefit from the financial buying power of the pooled assets,
including the expertise of the fund's strategic partners and the
grant-making guidance of the staff.
</P>
<P>
   Among the advisers to the fund are the NBC broadcaster Bob
Costas, the retired track star Florence Griffith Joyner and her
husband and coach Al Joyner, the author Jonathan Kozol, Rabbi
Harold Kushner, Harvard Law School professor Charles Ogletree and
the retired basketball star Bill Walton.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, the fund is receiving services on a reduced
fee or pro bono basis from BankBoston, the law firm of Hale And
Dorr, the accounting firm of Ernst &AMP; Young, the grant-making
services of Grants Management Associates, public relations from
Silverman Media and Marketing and the New England Sports Network is
developing and managing a web site.
</P>
<P>
   The former Boston College football star Doug Flutie has used The
Giving Back fund to start a foundation to fight autism, which
afflicts his son, Doug Jr. Former Celtics star Dee Brown and his
wife Tammy also have started a foundation to support groups that
teach parenting skills and to provide needy schools with teaching
and sports equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Pollick said The Giving Back Fund was started with $250,000 in
seed money from various organizations, and now has about $500,000
of money under management.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a long way from our goal of $20 million in assets by
2002,'' Pollick said, ``but it is a start. I really do see it on a
grand scale. In five years, I see this as a major source for
philanthropy in many ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``By putting all of this together, you're really, really
bringing some power and attention to bear on these various
causes,'' he said. ``If in the process it shows that not all
athletes are greedy and selfish as portrayed in the media, that's
good too.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is plenty of anecdotal evidence that athletes are
aware of the appropriateness or potential power of their charitable
donations or work. All four major sports teams in Boston do
considerable charitable work.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Celtics Charitable Foundation and the Red Auerbach
Youth Foundation both rely on extensive public appearances by
Celtics players at golf tournaments and other events to raise
money. The New England Patriots Foundation was established in 1994,
and has contibuted more than $1 million to help support youth
groups like the Boys and Girls Clubs of Boston and the ROSE
(Regaining One's Self Esteem) Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Bruins contibute to the Failure to Thrive Clinic and
the Anthony Spinazzola Foundation. And the Red Sox, of course, have
their Jimmy Fund and other community charities.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn, Pedro Martinez, Drew Bledsoe, Tebucky Jones and
Raymond Bourque are among the players in Boston who have
established separate foundations.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, there are many examples. But among the most striking
are the attempts by the National Basketball Association star
Dikembe Mutombo to contribute his own money and raise additional
funds to finance a $2 million hospital in his native Congo, and the
former National Hockey League player and professed sexual abuse
victim Sheldon Kennedy attempting to raise $15 million for other
victims, in part by in-line skating across Canada.
</P>
<P>
   No attempt has been made to tally how many such efforts exist,
or how much money they have raised, according to several sources,
including the Council on Foundations in Washington and The
Chronicle of Philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is one agent, Leigh Steinberg. I have to give him credit
that when he signs up a client, the first thing he tells them is
that, `If you're my client, you're going to give back,'''
Finkbeiner said.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of oversight and guidance, however, has led to some
disasters involving even the most well-intentioned athletes.
</P>
<P>
   The basketball star Michael Jordan was forced to close down his
children's foundation in 1996, seven years after he started it,
when the admnistration of it became ungainly, expensive trips were
financed for overseers, and it was revealed that Jordan had
contributed less than $10,000 over six years.
</P>
<P>
   The basketball star Juwan Howard announced a foundation, with
considerable notice, in 1995, only to admit two years later that it
had yet to register in the District of Columbia, where he plays for
the Washington Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the athletes are dedicated, but not skilled in
creating a foundation,'' said Larry Moulter, of Woolf Associates in
Boston. &UR;  &LR; ``It's one thing to commit to doing a foundation, but does
that translate to the dedication that can pull the business aspects
of it off?''
</P>
<P>
   Pollick's answer is that The Giving Back Fund can pick up where
the athlete's good intentions end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really think we can provide a full service that is going to
cut down on some of the problems, and provide the athletes with a
really stable foundation, whether they are really hands-on or
content to sit back and watch,'' Pollick said.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 
HOUSTON: especially teen-agers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   When several sales clerks at General Nutrition Center outlets in
the Houston area were questioned, they said they would not sell
creatine, Andro-6 or DHEA to anyone under 18. But if high-schoolers
and younger can't buy them in stores or obtain them from older
friends, they can order these substances by mail or via the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   GNC is a Pittsburgh-based chain of outlets that sells
nutritional supplements nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jenna Anding, a licensed dietician and assistant professor
of nutrition at the University of Houston, said many supplements
are not bought for athletic purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a population, we're getting older, and we want to do
everything we can to stay young and healthy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some controversial supplements are popular with office workers
and executives who sense an energizing effect from them. ``DHEA and
androstene give men sort of a euphoric feeling,'' Castle said.
``They make them feel like they're getting stronger, whether or not
they are.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
`PSEUDO-SCIENCE GETS THROWN IN' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays there are so many supplements available that nutrition
experts cannot keep up with them, let alone evaluate their health
risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know everything that's on the market, because it
changes so rapidly,'' Anding said. ``It could be a full-time job
just to keep track of all the supplements coming out.''
</P>
<P>
   While creatine is the biggest-selling sports supplement _ GNC
salesmen estimate it represents about 50 percent of their business
_ the second-trendiest item might be chromium picolinate, which
assists in blood sugar regulation and helps curb cravings for
carbohydrates and sweets.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're training for a marathon, it makes sense to use it,
because your body might get low on chromium,'' Bryan said. ``But
it's expensive, and for those of us working out for an hour or two
every other day, it's a waste of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Most supplements are recommended not by doctors or scientists,
Bryan said, but by personal fitness trainers ``who take a few
courses in nutrition and all of a sudden they're experts. A lot of
pseudo-science gets thrown in.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been going on for 200 years. You can go back through
history and find people using magnets and all kinds of stuff to try
to get stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   You can even go back to the ancient Greeks, who stuffed
themselves with fish (which are high in creatine) prior to Olympic
competition.
</P>
<P>
   The early Olympians knew that protein-loaded meats would help
them add muscle. In modern times, athletes buy powdered protein
supplements.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's one area we probably are neglecting in nutrition,''
Hoover said, ``it's protein. We're getting too much carbohydrate
and not enough protein.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Bryan cautioned that protein ``in heavy concentrations
is difficult to digest and can trigger gout. If you're a football
player beating up your body every day, it probably makes sense to
take extra protein. But it would be cheaper to go to Whataburger.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, protein in a hamburger is accompanied by
considerable fat, whereas whey protein, extracted from goat's milk,
has little fat.
</P>
<P>
   One of the promising new supplements is
beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate _ HMB for short. Bagwell said, ``I
don't think it helped me much.'' But Castle said it has been shown
in studies to improve muscle strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't seem to have any side effects,'' Castle said. ``It
will be the next hot supplement after creatine runs its course.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoover agreed that HMB in moderate amounts is probably effective
and safe. But he said, ``What concerns me is, I'm seeing people
`stacking' _ taking creatine and growth hormone and HMB to promote
breakdown of protein.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're stacking all these things together. Who knows what
effect that will have?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
SOME SUPPLEMENTS ARE WORTHLESS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some of GNC's supplements, Bryan contends, are worthless; for
example, shark cartilage is bought by athletes who expect it to
strengthen their own cartilage.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is absurd,'' Bryan said, ``because when it gets into the
stomach, acids break it down, and it doesn't get past the
intestines.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Bryan said chondroitin sulfate, glucosamine and copper
sebacate are unable to do what they're advertised to do: make
ligaments stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, there's nothing you can do to strengthen
ligaments,'' he said. ``As you get older, they get weaker. When
they break, it's just a mechanical thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is one group of supplements that sports medicine
doctors seem to like: antioxidants, which neutralize the free
radicals that accelerate the aging of cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think antioxidants are helpful in athletic training,''
Hoover said. ``Coenzyme Q10 seems to have some scientific basis,
but it's not as effective as selenium, beta-carotine, vitamin C and
vitamin E.''
</P>
<P>
   Zinc, one of Bagwell's favored supplements, is one of these
antioxidants that is believed to help the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   But Hoover said, ``If you're going to take one thing, I think
vitamin E is the one thing to take.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoover also said that caffeine, a major component of coffee, is
a stimulus not only for the brain but also for the muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It increases metabolism and may make the muscle fibers more
ready for exercise,'' he said. ``One study showed that moderate
doses of caffeine, taken an hour before exercise, enhanced
endurance performance. When that study came out, tons of athletes
started taking caffeine.''
</P>
<P>
   While some doctors believe a person can obtain all the vitamins
and minerals needed by eating proper foods, others insist that's no
longer the case in a world of nutrient-depleted, pollution-tainted
soil and air.
</P>
<P>
   So the marketplace is inundated with enough supplements to
overwhelm an athletic trainer or strength coach.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Coleman, Astros strength coach, said: ``We look at
everything that comes down the pike. The players will ask about
this product and that, and you'd better have an answer and not blow
it off and say, `That doesn't work.'
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, people would go to doctors and ask about steroids
and they'd say, `They don't work.' But the athletes could look
around them and see they did work _ if they were taken in doses
that were not safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman distributes only one product to the Astros: Ultra-Met, a
protein-rich powder made by Champion Nutrition Co. that's mixed
with water or juice and ice and taken before games. Beer is no
longer the beverage of choice among ballplayers.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Garner, manager of the Milwaukee Brewers, has seen
attitudes on nutrition change drastically since he played baseball
in the 1970s and '80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got into baseball,'' he said, ``if you didn't drink a
six-pack and puke before a day game, you weren't a man. Now, a lot
of guys don't drink, but you wonder about all these other things
that make you feel good and strong.''

CRITICS OF PATRIOTS' OFFENSE MISS THE POINTS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ A day off, a couple of film sessions, and
it's amazing what kind of spin you can put on a 28-0 loss, even if
it came in an exhibition game that was best forgotten the instant
it was over.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Drew Bledsoe what went wrong in Sunday's loss to the
Vikings, ask him about progress in an offense that has yet to make
it from practice to game day with any kind of efficiency, and you
will hear an explanation that makes sense only in the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a lot closer than we were a week ago,'' said the
Patriots quarterback Tuesday. ``I feel we made some strides in the
game. We obviously are not where we need to be, but we made some
strides in the game, offensively and in our passing game. The
timing is starting to come. We've started to feel that happening
for us a little bit. Obviously, it wasn't exact, but we're making
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   The degree of progress is what's being questioned. Sunday's game
does not count for anything, just as Monday night's game against
the Dallas Cowboys will not mean a whole lot in the grand scheme of
a season that is still three weeks from opening.
</P>
<P>
   And the Patriots do have a built-in excuse, particularly on
offense. Bledsoe and his teammates are absorbing their third
offensive system in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe says that change is a way of life in the National
Football League, that staffs seem to turn over as often as players
move around in free agency. So he urges caution against making
premature judgments and asks for patience from fans who are growing
restless after two listless offensive efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between having an excellent offense and not
scoring any points in this league is so minute,'' he said, pointing
out that against the Vikings, a few inches' difference would have
produced a touchdown pass to Vincent Brisby and a lucky bounce
would have resulted in an incomplete pass to Terry Glenn rather
than an interception return for a touchdown. ``It's still
preseason. When we're done with this, it all gets thrown out. It's
by no means time to panic.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are some worry lines around the eyes of the coaches
that weren't there a couple of weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Head coach Pete Carroll saw the same films that Bledsoe saw and
had almost the same frustrations. While he remains optimistic that
progress can be made in bigger leaps, he is also concerned about
what happens when the Patriots go from practice to game situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not carrying over the things we did in practice to
games, and that's an area of concern,'' said Carroll, who felt
Sunday's offensive inefficiency was attributable more to what the
Patriots didn't do than to what the Vikings did do.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever reason you choose, the Patriots are not producing. Zero
points and 180 yards in total offense against the Vikings is not a
formula for winning football. Bledsoe, in his limited first-half
stint, was 7 of 15 for 74 yards with an interception. He has been
forced to make a constant series of adjustments, ranging from
acquainting himself with new offensive schemes to changing the way
he drops back to pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been the biggest change from a timing standpoint and from
a mechanical standpoint for me and the receivers,'' Bledsoe said
when asked if this has been the most difficult of the passing
offenses to learn. ``That's taking a little bit of time, but when
we start to click in the offense, which I feel we're going to do
very soon, it'll be very productive.''
</P>
<P>
   What worries Carroll _ and right now it is only a worry, not
panic _ is that the Patriots are having what he calls ``clean
practices,'' in which the offense is working. But in two games, the
offensive schemes have been littered with mistakes and inefficiency
both passing and running (66 yards against Minnesota).
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to generate some movement of the football,'' said
Carroll, who watched his team run 14 offensive series against the
Vikings with only one net gain of more than 25 yards, while six
series lasted three or fewer plays. ``I thought we'd be cleaner
than this.''
</P>
<P>
   But they haven't been, and while it's still only midway through
the preseason, it is clear that the Patriots need to make a quantum
offensive leap in the next three games.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ During a U.S. Gymnastics meet last March in Baytown,
Texas, a teen-age contestant approached one of the visiting members
of the Olympic team and asked what he could do to gain strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lift weights,'' he was told. ``And eat your Wheaties.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wheaties?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Special Wheaties,'' the older gymnast said, with a grin and a
wink.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager asked no more questions. He understood the coded
message: steroids.
</P>
<P>
   Anabolic steroids, which made their first impact on athletic
competition with the world-record weightlifting performances by the
1956 Russian Olympic team, are still in prominent use despite the
health hazards they pose.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Olympic shot-put champion Randy Barnes tested
positive _ for the second time in his career _ for
performance-enhancing banned substances. Also failing his steroid
test, at about the same time, was Olympic sprinter Dennis Mitchell,
a bronze medalist in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Anabolic (which means ``building'') steroids were made illegal
in the United States in 1990, except with medical prescription.
They are designed to imitate testosterone or to stimulate its
production. Testosterone, a male sex hormone (also found in small
amounts in women), induces growth of skeletal muscles.
</P>
<P>
   But at the dosage levels needed to build muscle, the steroids
put so much strain on the liver, kidneys and heart that the athlete
risks death before the age of 50. Pro football star Lyle Alzado and
many weightlifting competitors of the 1970s died young, ravaged by
tumors and cardiac disease.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bill Bryan of the Baylor Sports Medicine Institute in
Houston believes steroid use has declined in the past decade. But
he said, ``Once you get into the elite levels of athletics, the
least bit of performance enhancement becomes important, and those
people will try all the tricks.''
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the sport of bicycle racing has been scandalized by
EPO, which stands for erythropoietin (eri-throw-poy-i-tin). This is
a steroid that stimulates the bone marrow to produce red blood
cells, which carry oxygen to the muscles.
</P>
<P>
   EPO is a significant performance enhancer for endurance
athletes, such as five Tour de France bicyclists who recently
disqualified themselves by admitting use of the banned substance.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gerald Gremion, after resigning his position of consultant
for Swiss bicycle teams, said ``almost all'' the Tour de France
cyclists use performance-enhancing drugs. He told reporters in
Europe: ``Each racer had his little suitcase with dopes and
syringes.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FOILING TESTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like other steroids, EPO has legitimate medical purposes, when
used in moderate amounts. A protein-carbohydrate compound, EPO is
helpful in treating kidney disease, AIDS and cancer. But it is
dangerous when taken in dosages large enough to affect performance
in a marathon run or a bicycle race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem,'' said Dr. Kenneth Renney of Sports Medicine
Associates in Houston, ``is that you don't know exactly how much to
use and what the effects are. If you get too many blood cells, you
can get sluggish, and the blood thickens.''
</P>
<P>
   That leaves athletes at risk of blood-clotting, stroke and heart
attacks. In the past 20 years, EPO has been implicated in more than
two dozen deaths in cycling.
</P>
<P>
   EPO usually goes undetected because tests cannot distinguish
between the hormone produced by the kidneys from the laboratory
version.
</P>
<P>
   But when blood tests reveal an excessive percentage of red blood
cells, the athlete is presumed to be using EPO illegally and is
suspended for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   EPO is one of at least 20 anabolic steroids prohibited by the
International Olympics Committee. New ones are constantly being
invented. No sooner is one blacklisted than another emerges to
confound drug testers.
</P>
<P>
   Many Olympic athletes try to foil the tests by using masking
agents or a new batch of difficult-to-trace water-based steroids.
</P>
<P>
   Renney, a crew chief of the U.S. Olympic drug-testing committee,
said, ``There's no masking agent that will keep steroids from being
detected. That's why some athletes fail the test. But they can use
diuretics that will get the steroids out of their system quickly,
and they can use some new steroids that are water-based, that clear
the body a lot faster that the oil-based ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan said tests will be developed that will make it more
difficult for athletes to cheat with steroids.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Japanese company is developing biological markers that will
detect the steroids people are taking,'' he said. ``The technology
may be at that level to test the athletes at the 2000 Olympics in
Sydney. We'll be able to shut down the use of anabolic steroids
significantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, many athletes engage in a delicate balancing act,
trying to take as many hormone supplements as they can _ legal and
illegal _ without exceeding the limits of red blood count or the
6-to-1 ratio between testosterone and its metabolic breakdown
product of epitestosterone.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
THE ADDICTION &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Greg Hoover, a sports medicine specialist in Houston, said
new products allow athletes to fine-tune the testosterone level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some athletes are using testosterone patches that release the
testosterone into the body at a gradual, lower dose,'' he said,
``like a Nicorette patch.''
</P>
<P>
   Renney explained that the testosterone limit was set to take
into account that ``everyone is going to have some type of level of
anabolic steroids, since they are found naturally in the body.''
</P>
<P>
   Although men generally have a testosterone/epi ratio of 3 to 1
or 4 to 1, some are naturally as high as 6 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people could take anabolic steroids and still be within
that approved level,'' Renney said. ``You can look at the tests,
and you may know the athlete is on steroids, but there's nothing
you can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, ironically a vocal opponent of steroids, tested over
the limit.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, who formerly competed for Texas A&AMP;M University in
College Station, Texas, was cited for using androstenedione, which
is found in wild yams and is legal in the United States and most
other countries but has been banned from Olympic competition
because of its steroidlike qualities.
</P>
<P>
   While Olympic athletes, such as Barnes and Mitchell,
occasionally slip up and get caught, Renney said, ``If they want to
do it, they're going to find a way to beat the system.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be naive to think anabolic steroids have been
eradicated from the National Football League, which has a limited
drug-testing program, or from Major League Baseball, which has no
drug-testing program at all.
</P>
<P>
   Since possession of anabolic steroids is illegal, no
big-leaguers admit, on the record, to using them. But some say,
anonymously, that about 30 percent of the hitters include them in
their muscle-building program.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Garner, manager of the Milwaukee Brewers, said, ``There was
one kid, 27, who was cycling steroids, and I asked him, `Do you
realize you could need an artificial heart when you're 40 years
old?'
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I don't care what happens at 40. All I want to do is
be the biggest, baddest guy I can be right now.'''
</P>
<P>
   That was the thinking of Mike Spinelli, a 1995 fourth-round
draft choice of the Boston Red Sox, who began ingesting steroids at
18.
</P>
<P>
   In two years, Spinelli's 6-2 frame filled out from 180 to 245
pounds. But he did not pitch well: 4-10 with a 5.57 ERA in two
minor-league seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Aware that he was addicted to steroids, Spinelli checked himself
into the Hazelden Foundation in Minnesota last February. ``I just
thank God I was able to get out of this,'' he said, ``before it
killed me.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE TEMPTATION &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Athletes _ and even nonathletes _ much younger than Spinelli
have been turning to steroids. A report by the National
Clearinghouse on Alcohol and Drug Abuse estimates that half a
million Americans under the age of 18 are using illegal steroids.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey of 965 pupils in Massachusetts middle schools
found that 2.7 percent admitted to using anabolic steroids, with
the percentages almost the same for girls as for boys. Some were as
young as 10 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, parents are buying these substances on the black
market and passing them on to their athlete children.
</P>
<P>
   But studies also have shown that about 40 percent of the high
school students using steroids are doing so not to compete in
sports but to improve their appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Yesalis, a Ph.D. at Penn State University, recently
reported that about 1 percent of girls in grades eight through 12
have used anabolic hormones _ a 100 percent increase by this group
since 1996. Among teen-age males, steroid use had remained stable
at about 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Such figures dismay Garner, who has seen the alarming effects of
steroids on men in their 20s.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd see guys suddenly add a lot of muscle,'' Garner said.
``They'd say, `I'm just lifting weights.' But then you'd see them
tear up phone booths at night and lift cars at odd hours, and you'd
say, `You're doing something else.'''
</P>
<P>
   Garner understands the temptation. ``You realize you can't
compete against somebody doing steroids,'' he said. ``They're
faster, quicker, stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, he looked to steroids as a means of delaying the end of
his playing career. He thought they might help him regain the 10
pounds of muscle mass he had lost after back surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only knew one player who had done steroids at that time, and
I talked with him about using them to put muscle back on,'' Garner
said. ``But I had some friends who were doctors, and they told me,
`You might have heart disease in 10 years.'''
</P>
<P>
   He decided he didn't want to sacrifice years of life for a few
extra glory days.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the kids today?'' he said. ``I don't know if they're
thinking about the future.''

PLUNGING MARKET TAKES FUNDS ALONG FOR THE RIDE

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Check your mutual funds lately?
</P>
<P>
   It's no suprise that stock funds have taken a beating in the
last month as the market's leading indexes slumped. But it's one
thing to watch abstract market measures slide and quite another to
see real money disappear out of your shareholder account.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the general stock funds at Fidelity Investments are
still outperforming their market index benchmarks, but the gaudy
returns of just a month ago have been slashed since stocks peaked
July 17.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity's Retirement Growth fund, up 31 percent for the year on
July 17, was ahead by only 19.6 percent by Monday. Contrafund's
1998 gain was cut from 25.4 percent to 15.3 percent during the same
period, and returns for Magellan, the world's biggest mutual fund,
were trimmed from 24.9 percent to 13.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, up 23.3 percent at its July 17
peak, had earned 14.2 percent as of Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity's funds have lots of company. The performance of
practically every general stock fund managed from Boston and
elsewhere has slipped by 10 percentage points or more.
</P>
<P>
   Even funds that lean toward big ``Nifty Fifty'' stocks have been
stung in the last month. Massachusetts Investors Growth, which
usually invests in large stocks, saw its gains trimmed from 32
percent to 18.2 percent between July 17 and Monday. Pioneer Growth,
another strong performer in the big-stock category, has trimmed its
1998 return from 30.4 percent to 19.6 percent over the same time
period.
</P>
<P>
   But small-stock funds, which already trailed the performance of
funds that invest in big companies, have gotten hit even harder at
practically every turn in the last month.
</P>
<P>
   Managers said the adverse investor sentiment toward small stocks
give them no choice but to buy attractive companies at cheap prices
and hope for the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not making up ground,'' said Russ Kinnel, equity
editor at Morningstar Inc., the mutual fund research firm. ``Even
before (Tuesday), small-capitalization funds were in the red when
the average large-cap fund was up 10 percent or so. There's a
tremendous gap.''
</P>
<P>
   Putnam OTC &AMP; Emerging Growth was up 18.2 percent on July 17, a
gain that had shrunk to about 1.5 percent after another tough day
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``What continues to amaze me is negativity'' toward small
stocks, said Mike Mufson, a co-manager of the fund. ``The glass
isn't half empty, people just think it's empty.''
</P>
<P>
   Putnam OTC is hardly alone. John Hancock Special Equities, a
concentrated portfolio of small stocks, was already struggling on
July 17, up 4.8 percent for the year. But it's been hit hard since
and posted a year-to-date loss of about 12 percent by the end of
the day Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time now that small stocks have
underperformed,'' said Robert Freedman, chief investment officer at
John Hancock Mutual Funds. ``At the moment, there's not much light
at the end of the tunnel.''
</P>
<P>
   Fund managers like Bart Geer, who invests in midsize companies
for the State Street Research Alpha fund, said they can't do much
in sharp market declines except to spot stocks that briefly fall
even harder for no apparent reason. But most of their time is still
spent in the normal process of analyzing companies for their
longer-term prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life goes on,'' said Geer. ``You can't spend your life in
front of a (computer) screen.''

</P>
<P>
   _On the move: Stock in Zoll Medical Corp. is up 40 percent in

MAKING IT BY BILLIONS: GILLETTE'S RETOOLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Over the next year, Gillette Co. looks to make a lot of
noise as it spends $300 million to market its new Mach3 razor to
the world _ the ad campaign for the triple-bladed razor is set to
kick into high gear tomorrow in the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   But since 1995, the company has quietly spent even more money to
overhaul its manufacturing facility in South Boston.
</P>
<P>
   It's not easy to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on the
q.t. When Hollywood spent $200 million on ``Titanic,'' movie
audiences paid attention. When the New England Patriots proposed a
$200 million football stadium in South Boston, the neighborhood
howled in protest.
</P>
<P>
   But when Gillette renovated its South Boston facility and
installed new Mach3 production lines, which cost nearly as much as
a blockbuster movie and a football stadium put together, nearly no
one noticed.
</P>
<P>
   With stealth worthy of the CIA, Gillette has designed, built,
and installed machinery that cost roughly $375 million, all to
produce the Mach3 razor that hit retailers' shelves last month.
</P>
<P>
   Billed as the world's first triple-bladed razor and the most
revolutionary advance in shaving in a generation, the new product
is vital to Gillette's continued success.
</P>
<P>
   All told, Gillette says it will spend $750 million on the
continuous-motion production lines and robotics that give it a
capacity to make 1.2 billion Mach3 razor cartridges a year.
</P>
<P>
   About half that total went to renovating the South Boston
facility, said Gillette's executive vice president, Robert G. King.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that this $750 million does not include the money
spent on the research and development of the Mach3 prototype, which
at various times was known by such code names as Manx, 225, and
``the Frankenstein razor'' (because its bolted profile resembled
the silhouette of the famous monster).
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the $750 million include money spent on hiring 160 new
workers and giving them 30,000 hours of training.
</P>
<P>
   According to Gillette, developing a ``revolutionary''
triple-bladed razor is only part of the story.
</P>
<P>
   The real trick is to take the prototype and reproduce it 1.2
billion times a year at a price low enough that consumers will buy
it but high enough to boost Gillette's profits.
</P>
<P>
   For Gillette, getting the Mach3 quickly into hands of consumers
is crucial to success.
</P>
<P>
   But with a top speed of only 200 razor cartridges per minute,
the production lines that Gillette uses to make its older Sensor
razors were simply too slow to meet Mach3's goals.
</P>
<P>
   So Gillette has developed a new production lines that use rotary
tables, continuous-motion machines, a system of automated
forklifts, and a secret ion-deposition process.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a production line that can turn out Mach3 razor
cartridges at a rate of 600 per minute, King said.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette made secrecy a priority until the Mach3 was formally
unveiled at an April press conference in New York.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent rivals from learning ahead of time that it was
working on a three-bladed razor, Gillette parceled out jobs to a
variety of subcontractors. In building components for the
production line, each subcontractor could see one small piece of a
jigsaw puzzle; only a few Gillette executives could see the picture
the pieces made when the jigsaw was fitted together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked strictly on a need-to-know basis,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   So while South Boston was loudly debating the merits of the $200
million football stadium, Gillette was sneaking more than $300
million worth of gear into its South Boston plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's complicated, expensive equipment,'' said Michael T.
Cowhig, Gillette's senior vice president of manufacturing. ``But if
you spend the money up front, it's cheaper to manufacture in the
long term.''

A DESK JOB, MINUS A BIT OF THE STRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHANA R. SCHOENBERGER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; For two Iranian refugees, the American dream has a concrete
form: an ergonomic computer desk. And it comes in black, gray, or
cherry wood, with reversible maple paneling.
</P>
<P>
   Max Ladjevardi and Bibi Kasrai, who are married, have built a
business far from the revolution that sent them fleeing Iran in the
late 1970s. While Soho Inc., based in Milford, Mass., has only four
employees and annual sales of about $4 million, the furniture
start-up ships computer desks to retailing heavyweights like Office
Max and major catalogs like Global. Banking on the growing demand
for ergonomic furniture, designed to reduce fatigue and stress in
users, Soho aims to grab a piece of the $13.7 billion domestic
office furniture market as a virtual manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind the company is an adjustable computer desk, a
matte metal piece of office furniture with shelves that can move up
and down. Soho's most valuable asset may be the patent for the
adjustable mechanism, which allows a user to reposition the shelves
by turning two knobs. The 5-year-old company has already won a
patent-infringement suit against a ``big fish'' competitor,
according to Kasrai, the firm's marketing director.
</P>
<P>
   Customers buy Soho's desks for offices, home or corporate, and
for home computer use. Once purchased, a Soho desk takes 30 minutes
to assemble using only a screwdriver. Soho's three- and four-shelf
desks can accommodate a computer, printer, monitor, and keyboard,
and retail from about $199 to $249, said Ladjevardi, the firm's
founder and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The company is still in start-up mode, with little money for
advertising. Kasrai, a veteran of the New York management
consulting firm McKinsey &AMP; Co., has had to scramble to get the firm
noticed. Her marketing strategy focuses primarily on value and
quality, branding Soho as ``the Volkswagen of ergonomics.'' (The
couple drive a Jeep.)
</P>
<P>
   Value is a clarion call in the ready-to-assemble office
furniture market. ``People are very value-conscious in that
category,'' said Douglas S. Bush, vice president of merchandising
at Bush Industries in Jamestown, N.Y., a Soho competitor. Bush
Industries did $325 million in sales last year, and several large
companies that have staked claims to the market are competing in
prices and quality.
</P>
<P>
   Soho doesn't have to worry about pleasing its investors. The
privately-held company gets its financing from Ladjevardi, the
scion of a family that owned the largest conglomerate in the Middle
East, Behshahr Industrial Group, before the Iranian revolution.
Ladjevardi's entire supply of capital comes from his savings and
personal funds. Part of his financing also came from money he
earned during a stint as a brand manager for New York-based
Colgate-Palmolive Co.
</P>
<P>
   Ladjevardi, who is a US citizen, did not reveal how well the
company is doing, but he said revenues are in the neighborhood of
$4 million annually. He attributed the company's success to an
innovative corporate structure that lets him run his firm by
managing relationships between other companies.
</P>
<P>
   The small firm operates as a virtual manufacturer, or middleman,
between furniture factories, which make desk components, and
retailers, which sell them to consumers. Soho, whose name is an
acronym for the small office-home office market, does not own a
factory.
</P>
<P>
   Its employees work out of three offices: in Milford, where the
company is based; San Diego, where Ladjevardi, 34, and Kasrai, 32,
live with their 3-month-old son; and Chicago, where the company has
a warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Running a manufacturing company without a factory means relying
entirely on computers. Retailers transmit orders electronically to
Soho; a logistics and warehousing firm working for Ladjevardi's
company ships the desks directly to individual retail stores, or,
in the case of catalog orders, to customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our (corporate) model is designed for a small company that
wants to really go fast,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The process is streamlined, with a backup supplier waiting in
the wings should any of Soho's suppliers fail to deliver,
Ladjevardi said. It's a formula designed to use the marketing and
management skills Ladjevardi and Kasrai acquired at Harvard
Business School, where both received MBA degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we structured the company was to focus all my
resources on what it was that I did very well, product development
and marketing,'' said Ladjevardi, who learned about virtual
manufacturing in business school.
</P>
<P>
   Virtual manufacturing has caught on in other industries, such as
apparel, but has yet to make a splash in the office furniture
business. Industry analysts and Soho's competitors, several of whom
said they hadn't heard of Ladjevardi's firm, expressed doubt that
Soho's strategy will be competitive in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are companies out there that are doing it, but in my
mind they are just adding cost,'' said Bush, whose firm owns its
own factories. ``Maybe it's not more expensive initially, but down
the road, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said the model might make sense for a firm Soho's size,
but not for a larger company dealing with merchants who want
just-in-time delivery without any hitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is probably a pretty good business model for a smaller
business to adopt,'' said Michael L. Franks, director of marketing
at O'Sullivan Industries Inc., a Missouri-based Soho competitor
that owns two factories.
</P>
<P>
   Ladjevardi defended his approach, noting Soho holds suppliers
financially responsible for delays. The virtual manufacturing model
may be relatively new, he said, but it's worked for Soho so far.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is confident enough in Soho's suppliers to plan the
launch of a new desk, slated to reach the market early next year.
And he said he is certain Soho's reputation will lure more
customers to the cash register.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to customer service,'' Ladjevardi said. ``The
real proof is, how do people who see my product think of it?''

 &HT;    A FIT FIDEL QUASHES RUMORS OF ILL HEALTH AS 72ND BIRTHDAY
APPROACHES
 &HT;    With CASTRO-BOX-0813.

<P>
   MIAMI _ Cuba's septuagenarian leader Fidel Castro ``died'' four
years ago, supposedly from a stroke. It was lung cancer that killed
him two years ago. Most recently, he suffered from a potentially
fatal disorder that turns the brain to mush.
</P>
<P>
   But the irrepressible Castro, who turns 72 on Thursday, has more
lives than a cat.
</P>
<P>
   Every summer, Castro's birthday unleashes a fresh round of
feverish speculation concerning the health of the Communist
dictator, much of it kindled by wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
   And this birthday's no exception.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a Miami newspaper quoted a Cuban defector claiming
to be a surgeon as saying Castro had received treatment in October
for a brain malady known as hypertensive encephalopathy.
</P>
<P>
   Hope that the Castro regime's days were numbered spread like
wildfire through the exile community here.
</P>
<P>
   But the claims of the defector, Elizabeth Trujillo, collapsed
when the Vatican's chief spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Vals, reported
that he had met with Castro for six hours in October, on a day when
Castro was supposed to be seriously ill, to plan January's visit by
Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   Castro ridiculed reports of his illness, saying he'd never even
heard of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every once in a while, they kill me off,'' Castro said. ``The
day I die, no one will believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was no different last summer, when all sorts of ill-health
stories made the rounds -- some even announcing his death -- after
Castro wasn't seen in public for several weeks. But Castro easily
quashed those rumors by delivering a rousing, marathon seven-hour
speech at the opening of the Fifth Communist Party Congress.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, a robust and seemingly healthy Castro basked in
warm receptions during a six-day swing through the Caribbean
following the reports of Trujillo's claims. He visited Jamaica,
Barbados and -- most significantly -- the only place where Cuban
and American troops ever did battle: Grenada.
</P>
<P>
   He will visit the Dominican Republic in late August -- his first
trip there since his 1959 Communist revolution -- and South Africa
and Portugal later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy reportedly dies every two years or so, but in reality
the man's 72 years old and still giving six-hour speeches, and he's
traveling all over the place, so he can't be doing all that bad,''
said Max Castro, an expert on Cuba at the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But, to many Castro foes, the dictator ``just doesn't look
well,'' although they admit their perceptions could be borne of
fertile imaginations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't look like a healthy 72-year-old man should look.
His color's not good. He's thin. Maybe it's just wishful
thinking,'' said Ninoska Perez, spokeswoman for the Cuban American
National Foundation, the most powerful anti-Castro exile group.
</P>
<P>
   One reason ill-health rumors swirl so freely around Castro is
the general secretiveness of Communist regimes.
</P>
<P>
   Leonid Brezhnev, for example, wasn't seen for weeks before
Soviet authorities acknowledged his death.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, the government rarely publishes meeting agendas or
economic statistics, let alone details concerning Castro's health.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the United States, where there's an open society, if the
president gets sick, everybody knows about it, but in Cuba this
kind of thing is treated like a state secret,'' Perez said.
</P>
<P>
   Also fueling a growing number of rumors has been the increased
visibility over the past year of Castro's brother, Raul, who is
five years Fidel's junior.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Raul Castro was formally designated his
brother's successor as Communist Party leader at the party congress
held in October.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Raul Castro, the head of the Armed Forces, has
enjoyed a more public role in running Cuba's government. Late last
year, he represented Cuba both in Beijing and at the Vatican in
advance of the pope's visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Fidel is clearly worried about his health and is
clearly trying to pass on the mantle,'' said Jaime Suchliki, an
expert on Cuba at the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``His voice is certainly not as clear as it once was and it's
obvious he's lost weight,'' he said. ``I've heard that he only
works four hours a day so it's clear that he has slowed down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban Foreign Ministry has repeatedly said that Fidel Castro
is in good health.
</P>
<P>
   And, if anything, Castro himself has made it abundantly clear in
recent months that he retains a firm grip on his country of 11
million people.
</P>
<P>
   He vowed at a Communist Party congress in March that he would
take no steps toward capitalism. He reaffirmed his belief that,
despite the trends toward worldwide capitalism, his socialist
vision of the world would eventually prevail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have to perfect it, to become stronger, more cultured,
more prepared,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Castro's also scored a number of diplomatic victories over the
past year, particularly since the pope's visit.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien -- the dismay of the
United States -- traveled to Cuba in April to announce increased
bilateral cooperation. Earlier this year, Guatemala and the
Dominican Republic restored diplomatic relations with the island.
</P>
<P>
   And, despite decades of efforts by the U.S. government to
isolate Cuba, more than 2,000 U.S. executives are expected to visit
Havana this year, according to the New York-based U.S.-Cuba
Economic Trade Council.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Cuban government hailed Castro's whirlwind
Caribbean tour as a triumph of Third World solidarity and a
rejection of U.S. moves to force political changes on the communist
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Castro seems to be secure in his power and has become
something of an icon by standing up to the United States,'' said
Ernest Preeg, who follows Cuba at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, a right-of-center think tank in Washington.
``This plays well throughout the Caribbean, so it's no wonder
relations are being strengthened.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also no indication that a popular uprising might remove
Fidel Castro any time soon, despite worsening economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
   A devastating low 1997-98 sugar harvest and reports of a severe
drought in eastern Cuba have raised serious doubts about the
island's economic recovery prospects this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a few human rights groups in Cuba, but they are not
a powerful force, so there is no real organized resistance,'' Preeg
said.
</P>
<P>
   And that may be why Castro's critics are so eager to believe
stories of ill health: it could be the only way to get rid of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to Castro, people are always grasping at
straws,'' said Shawn Malone, an expert on Cuba at Georgetown
University in Washington. ``Speculation over Castro's poor health
is typically overblown.''
</P>
<P>
   So, as Castro approaches the 40th anniversary of the revolution
he led, there's every reason to believe the leader will be around
for awhile longer.
</P>
<P>
   Joaquin Balaguer, for example, ruled the Dominican Republic well
into his 80s, even when he was physically frail and blind. At age
92, he still has a hand in Dominican politics.

CLINTON RAISES BIG BUCKS, BUT VISIT STIRS MIXED FEELINGS IN SAN
FRANCISCO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ With President Clinton's motorcade waiting
outside the St. Francis Hotel, a half-dozen protesters carrying
signs reading ``Impeach Clinton Now!'' faced off against a Clinton
die-hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best president we've ever had,'' a man in a business
suit said, his arm around his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a liar and a crook,'' a man in a T-shirt responded.
Another protester added, ``This man has brought disrepute on the
office of the president.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's visit to San Francisco Tuesday stirred Clinton
supporters and his detractors. He was in the area to promote new
regulations on the safety of drinking water and to raise money for
Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, the Democratic candidate for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is to testify Monday for a grand jury investigating an
alleged sexual affair and cover-up involving a former White House
intern.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, a staunch Clinton defender who
spoke at the fund-raiser at the St. Francis Hotel, said he thought
Clinton should have his testimony televised live nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should not allow spin doctors to interpret what he
testified to in that secret proceeding,'' Brown said. ``Of course,
I'm not a great aficionado of the grand jury.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said he believed Clinton had told the truth when he
denied having a sexual affair with the intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should not talk in that secret chamber,'' Brown said. ``He
should speak directly to the American people and not those 23
people in secret.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the glitzy Grand Ballroom of the St. Francis, Clinton was
welcomed by a friendly lunchtime crowd of union leaders,
politicians and deep-pocketed Democratic contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, the beneficiary of the $1,000-a-plate event, praised
Clinton for making life better for Californians.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told the crowd the outcome of the governor's race would
determine how his administration's programs, such as the effort to
provide health care coverage to 5 million uninsured children, were
carried out in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need somebody who believes in the potential of government
to alleviate problems and strengthen our common life,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   In his sharpest remark, Clinton blasted Senate Republican
leaders for blocking his nomination of San Francisco philanthropist
James Hormel as the next ambassador to Luxembourg. Hormel, who is
gay, has been denied a hearing by Republicans who claim he will
promote a gay agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting sick and tired of coming to San Francisco and
saying, as I must say one more time, Jim Hormel should have a
hearing,'' he said to strong applause.
</P>
<P>
   The president also urged Democrats to get out the vote for
Davis, warning that the only thing that could defeat the Democrat
would be a low turnout in November.
</P>
<P>
   Davis faces the state's Republican attorney general, Dan
Lungren, in the Nov. 3 general election.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was the featured guest at two more fund-raisers for
Davis in Los Angeles Tuesday night, one hosted by Bruce Karatz,
chief executive of Kaufman &AMP; Broad Home Corp., and another staged
by movie executive Jeffrey Katzenberg of DreamWorks SKG.
</P>
<P>
   All together, the three events raised $3 million for the Davis
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   To Clinton loyalists at the St. Francis, the investigation led
by independent counsel Kenneth Starr was little more than a
partisan jab at the president and his administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's just another tactic to keep them from doing the
job they should be doing,'' said Sandra Carter, a retired Pacific
Bell technician. ``I have every confidence the president will
prevail because the American people want him to prevail.''

GETTING STEAMROLLED BY BUREAUCRACY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The longer I live in this town, the more appalled
I am by the way the bureaucracy thinks and operates. Bureaucracy in
Albany defends the status quo even when the quo has no status
whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Most recent example: a hapless working stiff named Jim Helin.
</P>
<P>
   He's a 35-year-old electrician who lives in the Albany suburb of
Saratoga Springs. Until recently, he worked for the New York State
Department of Transportation. He earned about 29 grand a year when
the overtime was good. When George Pataki and his hatchet moved
into the governor's office, overtime dried up, and Jim Helin went
looking for a job in the private sector. He has three kids. They
get hungry. Every day, that happens.
</P>
<P>
   On his way out the door, Jim Helin's boss in state government
warned him that he couldn't work on any department contract for two
years. Doing that would violate the state's ethics law.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Helin was aghast. This law was aimed at government big shots
_ at legislators and top honchos in executive departments. It was
especially aimed at lawyers. The law says that former state
employees have to wait two years to ``appear or practice'' before
their former agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Helin wrote a letter to Pataki saying that this struck him
as asinine. Pataki wrote back, saying that he couldn't do anything
about it.
</P>
<P>
   So Jim Helin essentially went to work for the electrical workers
union, which supplies electricians to contractors. He ended up
working on a transportation department job, installing electrical
car counters.
</P>
<P>
   He figured he was cool on this job. The company the union had
assigned him to wasn't a state contractor. Instead, it had a
subcontract with the company that actually held the state contract.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of this job, Jim Helin dealt with engineers and
other state transportation department employees. Next thing he
knew, the State Ethics Commission was charging him with violating
the ethics law.
</P>
<P>
   There was a hearing. The hearing officer could have stuck Jim
Helin for 10 grand. Instead, the hearing officer recommended a
$1,000 fine. The full ethics commission, in its bureaucratic
benevolence, accepted the hearing officer's recommendation. Now Jim
Helin has to come up with a grand or find some judge to overturn
the commission ruling. That'll probably cost considerably more than
a grand.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Helin can't believe it. A law designed to prevent former
lawmakers and state government movers and shakers from influence
peddling is instead used to punish a blue-collar guy who made 600
bucks in a good week as a state employee.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because he'd actually talked to state department of
transportation employees during the installation of these traffic
counters. According to the ethics commission, that constituted an
``appearance'' before a state agency.
</P>
<P>
   Ethics commissions are good things, not bad ones. The idea is to
keep powerful people in government from profiting improperly from
their government service at your expense and mine. Their purpose is
not to stick it to ordinary working guys like Jim Helin, who have
no influence whatever over state policy and for whom a thousand
bucks is not an insignificant sum. The commission says it doesn't
like the law and would like it changed to exclude small fry like
Jim Helin. Richard Rivkin, the commission's executive director,
admitted that ``this is not the greatest case in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Which raises this question: why bring it, then? Who was going to
raise hell if the ethics commission simply decided not to bust this
poor guy's chops? Where was the huge public outcry to hang poor Jim
Helin?
</P>
<P>
   A century and a half ago, the French novelist, Honore de Balzac,
wrote: ``Bureaucracy is a giant mechanism operated by pygmies.''
</P>
<P>
   Not much has changed, Mr. Balzac.

   Music, art and drama can pay huge intellectual dividends in
terms of a child's mental development, Blumenthal writes. Studies
have shown, for example, that students who study music do better on
their SATs and score higher on spatial IQ tests. Blumenthal offers
tips on how parents can boost their children's learning powers
through exposure to the arts. (slugged:

   Parents of children with late-summer or fall birthdays often
find themselves faced with a difficult decision _ whether to let
the child be one of the youngest in the kindergarten class, or wait
until the following year. Bulion tells the stories of three
families confronted with this dilemma and how they reached their
decisions. (slugged:

   Math, reading and geography lessons can delight rather than

Software Revue. She gives a rundown of some of the best educational
programs and reference software on the market, programs that are so
much fun that kids won't even realize how much they're learning.

   More and more businesses are adopting policies that recognize
the problems parents have balancing work and family. But now these
family-friendly policies are igniting a backlash from childless
employees who feel resentful about what they perceive as more
favorable treatment of working parents. Harris looks at the
validity of these objections and suggests ways that employers can
treat both groups equitably. (slugged:

   High-fat diets and sedentary lifestyles are leading an
increasing number of children to tip the scales at far beyond their
ideal weight. Hours of playing videogames or watching television
instead of partaking in more physical activities are taking their
toll, Downey says. So is the decline of the family dinner hour.
Downey offers advice to parents on how to help children take off
those extra pounds. (slugged:

<P>
   Janice Ruell started worrying about when to send her third
child, Rosemary, to kindergarten even before the baby was born.
</P>
<P>
   Her first and second children had both arrived several weeks
later than expected, so when she went into labor in late August,
only a couple of days after her due date, Janice sat up on the
delivery table and shouted, ``She made the cutoff!''
</P>
<P>
   Five years later Rosemary's late-summer birthday did, in fact,
mean that she could begin kindergarten just as she turned 5, making
her one of the youngest kids in the class.
</P>
<P>
   Janice's older children had spring birthdays, and she couldn't
help but focus on the developmental differences between Rosemary
and her other children.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first two kids seemed further along in their intellectual
development when kindergarten came up,'' Janice recalls.
``Rosemary's sister wanted to go to kindergarten so badly that we
had to mark off each week on a calendar from her April birthday to
the first day of school, the following September. I was expecting
to see that same burning desire from Rosemary, but I've noticed
that she often has trouble thinking about the unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult for most parents to determine with absolute
certainty their children's readiness for kindergarten. Kids
approaching their fifth birthday can take large developmental
strides and acquire a good deal of self-confidence between spring
registration time and the first day of school at the end of the
summer. And the fact that parents get so much advice on the issue
can sometimes make the decision even more overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom is contradictory at best: ``It helps to
be the oldest in the class,'' ``You can get ahead if you start
younger,'' ``Keep young boys out a year,'' ``Children should be
able to tie their shoes, write their names and count up to 10.''
</P>
<P>
   How is a concerned parent to sort out the most important factors
in making the decision?
</P>
<P>
   The three kids described below had parents who reached different
conclusions about the timing of early schooling. Though the
decisions differed, they each led to a successful kindergarten
experience.
 &UR; ROSEMARY'S STORY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary's parents ultimately decided to send her to
kindergarten despite the fact that she was likely to be one of the
youngest kids in the class. Her father, Steve, didn't doubt
Rosemary's readiness for one second.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was so enthusiastic about learning,'' he says. ``I thought
we should take advantage of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary's mother eventually agreed and was happy about the
decision, which was also influenced by friends' experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost embarrassing,'' Janice admits, ``but there's a
certain social pressure on parents as well as children. Rosemary's
neighborhood friend has the same birthday, and her mother never
considered keeping her out of kindergarten for a year. Rosemary
would have been upset if her friend went to kindergarten and she
didn't. And I felt that Rosemary was as ready as her friend was.''
</P>
<P>
   Janice also talked to Rosemary's teachers at Chelmsford
Children's School, a private day-care and preschool program in
Chelmsford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all felt Rosemary was ready for kindergarten,'' says Dianne
Sadowski, Rosemary's preschool teacher. ``She had no difficulty
separating from her mother and father and showed a fair amount of
self-confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The teachers in Rosemary's preschool reassured her mother that
such social skills as communicating thoughts, listening, following
instructions, sharing and making transitions from one activity to
another are more important than mastery of the alphabet in helping
children to absorb what kindergarten has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rosemary started out the school year on the quiet side,'' her
Harrington Elementary School kindergarten teacher, Dora Bungard,
says. ``She was absorbing things, but she wasn't ready to volunteer
and share her knowledge. Then she went through this magical
transition that often happens in late winter, and now she is really
a class leader.''
</P>
<P>
   As a child learns classroom routines and develops a trusting
relationship with the teacher, she demonstrates increasing
confidence in her ability to master tasks in kindergarten. At the
same time, a child's large and small motor skills, attention span
and listening skills continue to develop.
</P>
<P>
   In Rosemary's case, the ``magical transition'' included an
increase in self-confidence and progress in her ability to handle
pencil and paper and perform other small motor tasks.
 &UR; NICHOLAS' STORY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is separation anxiety a reason to wait? Camille Lema, a mother
of two from Durham, Conn., opted to wait a year before sending her
son, Nicholas, who has a late-December birthday, to kindergarten.
Nicholas' parents made the decision mostly because he'd insisted
that his mother stay with him for a large part of the day during
his entire first year of preschool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Academically, he knew a lot, and he played well with others,
but he just didn't appear ready to move on,'' Camille says.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to separate confidently from parents is something
that develops over time at a child's own pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children who have the hardest time in kindergarten are the
ones with big separation anxiety,'' says Diane Kischell, director
of the Wesleyan University day-care and preschool in Middletown,
Conn. ``If they worry all day long, then they are not going to be
connected with the school process.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas' difficulties with separation indicated that the
demands of kindergarten, the school bus and a new setting would be
more than he could handle. At the end of his first preschool year,
he was still challenged by the experience.
</P>
<P>
   His parents' hunch that he wasn't ready for kindergarten was
shared by his preschool teacher, Kathy Meyering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nicholas underwent a metamorphosis during his second year of
preschool,'' she recalls. ``He began to jump into the day and he
became very comfortable with his classmates, at times even taking a
leadership role in dramatic play.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas developed the ability to separate from his parents in
his own time. The way they supported him gave him the security and
confidence he needed to successfully negotiate kindergarten at
Brewster Elementary School a year later, at 5 years, 9 months. When
the first day of school finally rolled around, Nicholas was excited
to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such a kind, sensitive boy,'' says Ann Rau, Nicholas'
kindergarten teacher. ``He came to our class with some strong
preacademic skills, but he never outgrew kindergarten by being a
little older.''
 &UR; ERIC'S STORY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With a mid-October birthday, Eric Wenz narrowly missed the Ohio
kindergarten cutoff date of Sept. 30. In the Kenston school
district, where the Wenz family lives, parents of children born
between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31 can apply for early kindergarten
entrance. Admission is based on a written application, a visit to
the child's preschool by elementary-school staff, an interview and
a series of standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   While most potential kindergartners are not required to go
through such an extensive entrance process, many school districts,
like Eric's, hold regular kindergarten screenings in early spring,
at which parents and children meet kindergarten teachers, speech
and language specialists, school nurses and other school personnel
who can help sort out various questions about readiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric showed some abilities that seemed far beyond his age, and
yet he's still a little boy,'' Eric's mother, Margie, says. ``His
emotional maturity was the biggest unknown for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The evaluation process for early admission was lengthy but
helpful, Margie says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric took it all in stride,'' she recalls. ``We could see him
becoming more and more confident, and by the time of his testing, I
knew he was ready. Now we have to get used to the idea of our last
child going off to school!''
 &UR; THE BOTTOM LINE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When to send a child to kindergarten can seem a momentous
decision to parents, who hope their child will feel secure,
confident and open to the learning experience. While many parents
may worry, the fact is that most healthy, age-eligible children
will thrive in a good kindergarten setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``A child who has been talked to, who has been questioned and
who has been given answers to questions, a child who has been read
to and who has learned to share and play with other children and to
take turns is more successful right from the beginning,'' says
Carol Aikenhead, past president of the Kindergarten Association of
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Five-year-old Rosemary knows the feeling of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like kindergarten, and I learn a lot of stuff,'' she says
enthusiastically. ``All of my new friends are here, and my teacher
smiles. When it is a kindergarten day, I feel happy.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Mark Schubart was dean of New York's famed Juilliard School
of Music, he was visited in his office one day by a distraught
mother pulling along her little boy.
</P>
<P>
   What could she do about him? she asked. Here the boy was,
already 4 years old, and his piano repertoire consisted of only 34
pieces!
</P>
<P>
   Schubart, now chairman of the Lincoln Center Institute, which
trains teachers to use the arts to expand young minds, still shakes
his head over the encounter. Clearly, some people don't know when
to stop pushing their kids.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, parents with a more measured
appreciation of how to boost their children's learning power are
tuning in to a host of exciting new findings. Music, in particular,
is emerging as both a pathway and a stimulant to intellectual
growth.
</P>
<P>
   But the visual and dramatic arts can play a big role too, along
with other approaches that are revolutionizing childhood education.
On television, that master teacher ``Sesame Street'' has been
applying some of the latest research in maximizing youngsters'
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Watch carefully and you'll see how lessons on the same topics
are increasingly being clustered for reinforcement. The letter of
the day _ D _ might be shown in different ways: outlined in
candles, and then set to music in clay animation. Preschoolers who
have trouble grasping the lesson in a linguistic way may get it
through music or movement or other presentations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea,'' said Celia Genishi, chairwoman of curriculum and
development at Columbia University's Teachers College, ``is to give
children many different entry points for learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Driving all this is a new understanding of intelligence.
Increasingly, experts are redefining intelligence as more than
linguistic and mathematical ability, the traditional yardsticks.
Rather, they say, it takes many forms.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to specialists such as Howard Gardner, a professor of
education at Harvard who is widely credited with the theory of
multiple intelligences, and Daniel Goleman, author of the
best-selling book ``Emotional Intelligence'' (Bantam Books,
$19.95), our understanding of the workings and expression of
intelligence has widened.
</P>
<P>
   Now we include creative powers and the ability to understand
oneself and others along with the rest of the natural and spiritual
world, as well as the simple ability to get along with other
people.
 &UR; SEVEN KINDS OF INTELLIGENCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gardner makes a case for at least seven different intelligences:
linguistic (poet), logical-mathematical (scientist), musical
(composer), spatial (architect), bodily-kinesthetic (dancer,
athlete), interpersonal (salesman, teacher) and intrapersonal
(those with a highly developed sense of self).
</P>
<P>
   The implications of this expanded view of intelligence have been
sweeping. No longer must the label ``smart'' be reserved for the
best readers, writers and counters in the classroom. Now youngsters
who can follow complex dance steps or drum rhythms, organize games
or soothe conflicts with their schoolmates can be recognized as
possessing different types of intelligence. And these skills can be
utilized to learn the ever-crucial reading, writing and arithmetic.
</P>
<P>
   Although scientists are still struggling to understand the
developing brain, there is widespread agreement that the preschool
years open a mental window through which learning can flood in at a
rate never again duplicated in life. Opportunities not exploited at
this time can never be made up.
</P>
<P>
   Within the first four years of life, the child's brain grows to
fully two-thirds of its adult size, evolving at a faster rate than
it ever will again. And the stimulation present at that time will
have a lot to say about the kind of adult the child will become.
 &UR; WHAT PARENTS CAN DO &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In one famous 1960s experiment, scientists at the University of
California at Berkeley raised two groups of lab animals, one in a
setting of wheels and ladders and toys, the other in an
impoverished environment. After several months the animals in the
enriched setting not only were in better health and performed
better, but also had grown larger brains.
</P>
<P>
   So what can parents do to boost their children's learning power?
</P>
<P>
   + Expose them early to music and art.
</P>
<P>
   This should be done not in hopes of uncovering a prodigy, though
that may possibly happen, but because research has found links
between intellectual achievement and musical training and ability.
</P>
<P>
   How early? Well, some mothers-to-be make a point of listening to
Mozart and other soothing symphonists. Their hope is to predispose
their offspring to high culture, although science has yet to
confirm that this works.
</P>
<P>
   Because financially hard-pressed schools around the country have
cut arts programs left and right, parents have to do more to take
up the slack. Music lessons in piano or violin, two of the most
popular instruments for children to learn, can be started as early
as preschool.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some experts say it's almost never too soon to begin
and, for those with true talent, starting too late may mean never
fully exploiting their gifts. The idea is to train children so
early that their technique becomes intuitional.
</P>
<P>
   + Take children to live performances.
</P>
<P>
   There's no better way of exciting them about the arts. Give them
a good view of the conductor. Let them peer into the orchestra,
before or after the performance. Go backstage afterward if
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Many young people's theaters make a practice of letting the
actors in costume mingle with the audience after the curtain. Allow
time after the show for your kids to shake hands with the stars.
Or, for a look behind the scenes of a show or concert, try to
attend a dress rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   + Do dance exercises with young children at home.
</P>
<P>
   The urge to dance and move to rhythm is strong in many children.
Isadora Duncan liked to say she learned to dance in her mother's
womb.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from formal ballet and dance instruction, parents can put
on some music and have children dance or skip to the changing
rhythms. Ask them to imitate sailboats or gliding seagulls. Teach
beats with a makeshift drum.
</P>
<P>
   + At museums, look for ``please touch me'' exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing teaches children faster than hands-on experiences.
Children's museums are particularly rich in such fun, educational
displays.
</P>
<P>
   Many museums also offer children's art programs. Instructors
lead young visitors to a sculpture or painting gallery, talk a
little about the work on display and then give out paint, paper and
crayons with which the children try their own versions.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, parents can do similar things at home using art
books, art supplies and collage materials they have at hand _
anything from cut-up magazines and newspapers to old photos, pieces
of fabric and buttons.
</P>
<P>
   + Buy your child an inexpensive camera.
</P>
<P>
   Older children are often intrigued by photography. The pictures
they take can be developed inexpensively at neighborhood film
depots and used by parents as a springboard into discussions about
color and design: What makes some pictures nicer than others? How
does an artist pick a subject and angle?
</P>
<P>
   + Expose children to other languages at an early age.
</P>
<P>
   With their young brains programmed to soak up information at a
rate they will never achieve again, preschoolers can painlessly lay
the foundations for multilingualism. A foreign language that they
experience now will never sound completely strange to them again
and will be picked up much more quickly in later years.
</P>
<P>
   Research increasingly supports these recommendations. In one
recent study, four classes of first- and second-graders in West
Orange, N.J., were taught music using a highly structured and
demanding program pioneered 60 years ago by the Hungarian composer
Zoltan Kodaly. Their art instruction was also particularly
challenging. Four other classes took conventional music and art.
</P>
<P>
   After two years, the enriched classes had doubled the percentage
of pupils performing at grade level in math, to more than
three-quarters of the class. The other classes had lower gains.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits seem to endure. In profiles of test-takers, the
College Board found that those who studied or played music scored
an average of 51 points higher on the verbal portion of the SAT and
39 points higher on the math portion.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, at the University of California at Irvine,
psychologist Frances Rauscher and neuroscientist Gordon Shaw found
that preschoolers who took keyboard lessons for eight months
boosted their IQ scores on spatial tests by 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Rauscher and Shaw reported, college students
who listened to a Mozart sonata for 10 minutes performed better on
spatial IQ tests _ a benefit termed ``the Mozart effect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Music excites the inherent brain patterns and enhances their
use in complex reasoning tasks,'' the researchers concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The visual arts, too, pay intellectual dividends. Philip
Yenawine of Development Through Art, former director of education
for the Museum of Modern Art, reported that students who learned to
critically discuss paintings in a museum did better in social
studies and other subjects. They learned to formulate theorems,
draw meaning from abstract ideas and communicate thoughts. And
their writing improved.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nothing can turn off youngsters faster than forced
marches down endless museum corridors. One clever way of focusing
children's attention is to buy them postcards of works of art and
then challenge them to find the originals on the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Ask open-ended questions such as: What's happening in this
picture? What do you see in it?
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for any special answer _ just signs of thinking.

 By CHARLES DOWNEY  
 From Kiwanis magazine 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Jimmy, a 6-year-old first-grader, should have weighed about 50
pounds but pressed the scales to the 95-pound mark. At his school
near Baton Rouge, La., the lumbering lad always was dead last in
gym-class activities and any sports he played with fellow students.
 &HT;    Because of the flabby rolls that hung over his pants, Jimmy
suffered all the cruel taunts other children could heap on a boy
who weighed almost twice the normal weight.
 &HT;    Eventually, his physician referred him to a weight-loss clinic,
the Committed to Kids Pediatric Weight Management Program at
Louisiana State University in New Orleans.
 &HT;    One of his first prescription slips read: ``Play outside twice a
week for 20 minutes.'' This could entail walking, bicycling,
in-line skating or other common childhood pastimes. At first, it
was difficult for him to huff and puff through those 20 minutes,
but he slowly improved.
 &HT;    Like Jimmy, most obese children live in industrialized nations,
but cases of childhood obesity are found worldwide. American kids
top the childhood heavyweight list: One in four children ages 5 to
12 is 70 percent or more over his or her proper weight, according
to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
 &HT;    Childhood obesity is partly caused by children being home alone
after school and snacking on whatever they want, as often as they
want. Also, more and more children have become couch potatoes who
routinely log four to six hours a day watching television or
playing video games.
 &HT;    Medical doctors, nutritionists and child-behavior specialists
are concerned about these trends, because obese children still are
growing and require certain nutrients for healthy physical and
mental development. Such growth may be stunted by high-fat diets
and sedentary lifestyles.
 &HT;    After a year at a weight-loss clinic, Jimmy worked up to doing
aerobic exercises and other physical activities for 45 minutes five
times a week. He _ along with his family _ also learned
much-improved nutritional habits and reduced his weight to 67
pounds.
 &HT;    But the big plus for Jimmy was constantly finishing first in
physical activities and sports at school. The cruel taunts stopped
when he began placing at the top.
 &HT;    Trading television for sports works, and many children need to
try it. The World Health Organization once surveyed Canadian
children and found that, outside school, the girls were active only
half an hour per week or less. One-fourth of the boys and girls
reported spending at least four hours a day in front of the tube.
 &HT;    ``We don't tell our young patients they must give up
television,'' says Uwe Blecker, medical director of the LSA
weight-loss clinic, ``but instead of watching television or playing
video games four hours a day, we ask them to reduce it to three. Or
we ask them to ride a stationary bike or walk on a treadmill while
watching television.''
 &HT;    It's all too easy for children to get their forks into one of
the biggest health hazards: fatty foods. Health professionals who
monitor the eating habits of young children have found that one
cheeseburger with fries can equal the total amount of fat a child
should consume in two days.
 &HT;    Children who must watch their weight are encouraged to consume
more whole grains, vegetables and fruits while cutting back on _
not eliminating _ dairy products, beef, pork, lamb and high-fat or
highly sugared treats.
 &HT;    Obesity has a genetic link. According to Canada's National
Institute of Nutrition in Ottawa, Ontario, if both parents tip the
scales at a normal weight, the probability of a child becoming
obese is about 10 percent. But if one parent is overweight, the
child's odds of matching that physical trait rise to 49 percent.
 &HT;    If both the mother and father are overweight, a child stands an
80 percent chance of becoming obese, due to a complex mix of
genetic and lifestyle factors that medical scientists don't fully
understand.
 &HT;    What medical science does understand about obesity is the
increased risk of more widespread health woes, such as the
development of diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis or skeletal
problems in hips and legs.
 &HT;    Studies reveal that portly children usually grow into pudgy
teens and adults. Each stage then brings its own woes. For
instance, University surveys and personality inventories show that,
as early as kindergarten, children have an aversion to obesity and
describe their overweight classmates as less likable, less capable
and less able to control themselves.
 &HT;    To curb childhood obesity, the American Pediatric Association
urges families to begin early with proper diets and exercise. When
overweight children learn to reduce and maintain weight through
good nutrition and exercise, the loss is more likely to be
permanent as they grow into young adulthood.
 &HT;    ``One of the primary causes of childhood obesity among our
patients is because families no longer sit down together for dinner
at a fixed time,'' says Baylor College's William Klish. ``Instead,
children eat in front of the television, after `grazing' all
afternoon. But when everybody in a family sits down for dinner at a
fixed time every night, fewer and healthier calories are consumed.
Also, today's children just don't play outside like they did in
years past.''
 &HT;    Families eat less when they eat together, because they talk and
that slows down the speed of eating, giving the stomach's fullness
signals a chance to work. Even small amounts of food will begin
sending satiety signals to the brain after about 20 minutes.
 &HT;    Children tend to lose weight more successfully when the entire
family is involved. Ideal loss for plump children is no more than
one-half to one pound per week.
 &HT;    ``When an overweight child starts watching the types of food he
or she eats, the rest of the family also must watch what they
eat,'' says Marilyn Day, a nutritionist at Children's Hospital in
Denver, Colo. ``It's unfair to forbid cookies and other treats to a
child while others in the home munch them.
 &HT;    ``I've found in my practice that a child often can lose unwanted
pounds through some very simple changes in ordinary foods that are
normally kept in the home,'' she adds. ``I've known children who
cut back from whole milk to skim milk or cut out the highly sugared
cola drinks and lost weight.''
 &HT;    Other researchers have uncovered an unexpected source of flab in
a study group of 168 children ages 2 to 5: fruit juice. In
Pediatrics, the journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics, they
reported that children who drink at least 12 ounces of fruit juice
a day are more likely to be obese.
 &HT;    Young children worldwide are famous for being fussy eaters. More
than one serving of peas or spinach has ended up on the floor or
caused an evening-long power struggle between parents and children.
Studies have disclosed, however, that if caretakers introduce new
or more nutritious foods to young children too forcefully, it can
backfire.
 &HT;    Susan Johnson, an assistant professor of pediatrics at the
Center for Human Nutrition of the University of Colorado Health
Sciences Center in Denver, found in a study of 77 youngsters ages 3
to 5 that those children with the most body fat also had the most
controlling mothers.
 &HT;    Johnson notes that, though parents still are responsible for
making sure that children eat healthful food, the ``children
themselves are capable of figuring out how much to eat.''
 &HT;    Her advice about clean plates? ``Relax a little.''
 &HT;    The study revealed that children whose mothers allowed them to
be spontaneous about food _ to eat when they are hungry and not
necessarily finish all the food given to them _ showed a natural
instinct for regulating their own calories.
 &HT;    So there may be hope for caregivers trying to make vegetables _
and other unfamiliar but healthful food _ more popular with young
children. After all, if it leads to better health via an
appropriate weight, what harm is there in a few servings of peas
and spinach on the dining-room floor?

 By DIANE HARRIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It figures. Just as American employers finally appear to be
catching on to the need for family-friendly programs and policies,
a small but vocal group comes along that seems bent on taking those
hard-won benefits away.
 &HT;    Call it a backlash, but a growing number of childless workers
are protesting what they believe to be the inequity of benefits
designed to help working parents better balance the demands of
their personal and professional lives.
 &HT;    ``Programs and policies that exclude large groups of people are
inherently unfair,'' says warehouse-software manufacturer Ann
Price, a member of The Childfree Network, a Citrus Heights,
Calif.-based advocacy group that boasts 5,000 members nationwide.
``If I don't have kids, family-friendly benefits by definition
aren't very friendly to me.''
 &HT;    New research supports the notion that some childless workers
feel they are being stiffed by their employer's focus on the needs
of co-workers with kids. For instance, some 56 percent of work-life
professionals believe that childless workers harbor resentment
toward employees with children, according to a recent survey by The
Conference Board, a business-research group in New York.
 &HT;    ``Where people feel the most discrimination is around time _
having to stay late at the office, having to finish work at home,
not being able to attend to personal responsibilities,'' says
Marcia Brumit Kropf, a vice president with Catalyst, a women's
research and consulting firm in New York. ``The real problem is how
stretched everyone feels in the workplace today.''
 &HT;    With a view toward clearing the air, here is a closer look at
the most common complaints voiced by childless workers, along with
some expert thinking about what's legitimate about the gripes,
what's not and what companies and employees can do to insure a fair
deal for all workers, whether they are parents or not.
 &HT;    + It's a family-friendly world out there.
 &HT;    If only it were true.
 &HT;    ``Over the past five years there has been a sea change in
consciousness, a general recognition that helping employees balance
their professional and private lives is an important business
issue,'' Brumit Kropf says. ``But we have a lot of work left to do
to turn that consciousness into reality.''
 &HT;    In fact, while the range of possible benefits has expanded over
the past decade, the majority of employers have yet to get with the
program.
 &HT;    Consider: Only 37 percent of companies offer paid parental
leave, only 18 percent provide any form of child-care help, such as
an on-site child-care center or backup care, and a scant 12 percent
lend a hand with adoption expenses, according to a 1996 survey of
313 companies by Buck Consultants, a New York-based
benefits-consulting firm.
 &HT;    But while family-friendly programs are not as ubiquitous as
critics claim, a climate that is generally open to family concerns
is.
 &HT;    ``Companies tend to reflect a cultural attitude that views
raising children as a kind of sacred calling,'' says Mary Young, a
researcher at Boston University's School of Management. ``Having to
get home to your kids is a high card of sorts that is hard for a
childless employee to match.''
 &HT;    What would help: The most painful work-life conflict for
employees is to not be treated with respect or recognized as a
whole person with a compelling life off the job, concludes a new
study by human-resources consultant Marci Koblenz of MK Consultants
in Evanston, Ill. And that's as true for childless employees as it
is for working parents, Koblenz found.
 &HT;    Yet the language used to describe programs to help employees
achieve balance _ phrases such as ``family-friendly'' or
``work-family'' _ inadvertently fuels divisiveness by seeming to
exclude anyone who doesn't have kids.
 &HT;    To send a more inclusive message, a growing number of firms are
changing the name of their initiatives to more neutral titles, such
as ``work-life,'' indicating that such programs are intended to
help all employees resolve conflicts between their personal and
professional responsibilities, whether or not they have children.
 &HT;    + Childless workers pick up the slack for working moms and dads.
 &HT;    Three quarters of the work-life experts surveyed by The
Conference Board disputed the notion that employees without
children carry more than their fair share of the work load.
 &HT;    ``Sure, you occasionally hear stories about childless employees
staying until 10 at night to make up the work left behind by a
working parent,'' says Catherine Popper, a vice president with WFD,
a work-family research and consulting firm in Boston. ``But those
incidents by far tend to be the exception, not the rule.''
 &HT;    When such a problem does arise, experts say, the cause can
usually be traced to how a flexible schedule was implemented, not
to the policy itself. Most typically, a well-meaning manager may
approve a working parent's request for flextime without thinking
through the consequences.
 &HT;    What would help: Companies need to train managers about how to
implement flexible schedules, work-family experts suggest. Before a
request for flextime is approved, the supervisor and employee
should discuss how the work will be accomplished and establish ways
for the employee to pass along needed information when she's not in
the office.
 &HT;    ``Managers need to treat flexibility as a business issue, a
strategy to achieve business results,'' Popper says, ``not as an
accommodation.''
 &HT;    + Childless workers do not get a fair share of the benefits pie.
 &HT;    ``An on-site child-care center or a lactation room are icons of
all the money that companies spend on employees with kids,'' says
Ann Price of The Childfree Network. ``For childless workers,
they're a constant reminder of all the benefits dollars that aren't
spent on us.''
 &HT;    Price is not alone in her views: Some 42 percent of the work-
family specialists in The Conference Board survey agreed that
employees without children feel they are subsidizing benefits for
other employees' families lives.
 &HT;    To some extent, the negative feelings simply reflect bad PR on
the part of employers. Companies don't usually talk up benefits
that are used primarily by workers without children, such as
tuition assistance and wellness programs, even though they are far
more common offerings.
 &HT;    What would help: As a first step, work-life consultants urge
companies to conduct focus groups and surveys to determine which
benefits childless employees value most.
 &HT;    ``Simply by asking, you communicate respect, which can head off
a lot of resentment,'' says Boston University's Mary Young.
 &HT;    A small but growing number of companies are designing
cafeteria-style benefits packages that can be used in different
ways by different employees, depending on their particular needs.
 &HT;    Xerox's 5-year-old LifeCycle Assistance Program is a striking
example: Employees are entitled to $10,000 over the course of their
career with the company, to be used for one of three purposes: to
help pay for child care, a down payment on a first home or
unreimbursed health-care expenses for members of one's household.
 &HT;    + Working parents feel they have a superior claim on the need to
balance work and outside interests.
 &HT;    At its most fundamental level, the tension between working
parents and childless employees boils down to a competition for
scarce resources. In this case, the resource is flexibility, which
the majority of employees want and most companies are loath to
grant across the board.
 &HT;    Do working parents have a greater claim on flexibility than
other staffers? The question is hotly debated among employees,
within the human-resources field and the larger community as well.
 &HT;    Certainly, once a company approves flextime for some employees,
it's difficult for anyone to know where to draw the line and on
what grounds. Is your sick child more important than my sick cat?
Is your need to leave on time to pick up your toddler from child
care more compelling than my need to get to a night-school class so
I can earn an MBA? Is your child's softball game more important
than my softball game?
 &HT;    What would help: Fortunately, if a flextime program is managed
correctly, employers don't really have to get into the messy
business of determining the moral merits of each request.
 &HT;    Amoco makes flextime and a compressed workweek available to all
employees, regardless of family status. Indeed, roughly 10,000
Amoco workers, or about a third of the work force, have opted for
the compressed workweek since the program was introduced
company-wide a year ago _ and the number of enrollees with and
without children is proportionate to their numbers in the work
force.
 &HT;    Certainly, the technology now exists to make such flexibility
possible, from voice mail and faxes to computers, beepers and
e-mail.
 &HT;    As Fran Rodgers, founder and CEO of WFD, observes, ``We're in
the midst of a revolution in the way work gets done.''
 &HT;    But the revolution hasn't been won yet. And until it is,
companies, working parents and childless employees must work
together to create the kind of workplace community in which
everyone is considerate of one another's needs, regardless of
family status.

COURT THROWS OUT NEW YORK REQUIREMENT ON ELECTRIC CARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MELISSA GRACE  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A federal appeals court threw a roadblock in
front of a state regulation mandating that 2 percent of all
vehicles sold in New York beginning this year be non-polluting.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, made Tuesday, ends New York's bid to lead the
country in the number of zero-emission vehicles, or ZEVs, sold.
Most ZEVs are electric cars.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the state Department of Environmental Conservation
adopted a policy requiring automobile manufacturers to produce 2
percent of their fleets as ZEVs by this year. That number was to
increase until 2003, when the mandate topped out at 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan held that the New
York standard was out of step with the national standard and was a
burden to car makers. It also said the state regulation did not
conform with the exception that is allowed, the so-called
``California standard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased because this is a decision which is actually to
the benefit of New York state consumers,'' said Lois R. Phillips,
an Albany attorney representing automobile dealers opposed to the
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Car manufacturers argued that the development of ZEVs should be
left to market forces and not to ``artificial sales quotas'' and
that battery technology is not sufficiently advanced to make ZEVs a
``commercial and practical reality,'' said Phillip A. Lacovara, a
New York City attorney.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare political marriage, Republican Gov. George Pataki and
several state environmental groups supported the regulations, and
the state attorney general went to court to defend them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regulations adopted by (the Department of Environmental
Conservation) were meant to push the technology, to encourage the
sale of electric vehicles in New York state in hopes of meeting our
transportation needs and addressing out air quality problems,''
said Gary Sheffer, spokesman for the agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the program has worked, it has pushed the
technology,'' he added, ``and we hope that regardless of what
happens in the courts, that the progress made by the auto makers
will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   He said New York, especially New York City, already has problems
meeting federal air quality standards and that those standards are
going to get tougher in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Automobiles contribute half of the ozone-smog-causing
pollutants and virtually all the carbon monoxide,'' Sheffer said.
</P>
<P>
   The state can appeal the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Last year, U.S. District Judge Lawrence E. Kahn in Albany held that
the New York standards were a way of achieving the goals of the
Clean Air Act and ruled that they could stand.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reversing his decision on a strict interpretation of the law,
the appeals panel wrote, ``The language here seems plain enough ...
States must adopt and enforce standards that are `identical' to the
California standards.''
</P>
<P>
   New York's standard was identical to California's until 1993,
when that state shifted its regulation of alternate-fuel vehicles,
voiding the 2 percent goal by 1998, but maintaining the 10 percent
requirement by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental department argued that it was not out of line
with federal law because it was essentially following California,
``albeit by a slightly different standard,'' Sheffer said. ``We are
doing the same thing. It's just that California postponed their
standard.''
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan-based appeals court disagreed, finding that if the
New York regulations were allowed to stand that could lead other
states to create individual standards.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ruling favored car makers, some environmentalists
were somewhat optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that it isn't going to make a huge difference, and
the reason is they weren't complying with it,'' said Valerie
Washington, executive director of Environmental Advocates in
Albany.
</P>
<P>
   She said that because there is ``a future in alternative fuel
vehicles'' manufacturers will look at them.

WHALING RIGHT CLAMIED, PROVOKING OPPOSITION 
</HEADLINE>

 (WITH WHALES-MAKAHS)

<P>
   NEAH BAY, Wash. _ To Wayne Johnson, whaling is not just a legal
right; it is his birthright.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the rifleman who hopes to kill the first whale, says
that what protesters forget is Makah history _ and what his
ancestors fought to save almost 150 years ago in treaty talks.
</P>
<P>
   In 1855, a tribal chief, Tse-Kauwtl, spoke plainly to U.S.
government negotiators who had come to strike a deal with the
tribe: ``I want the sea; that is my country.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting treaty between the two sovereign nations spells
out the Makah's right to whale. Though some Alaska natives have
been allowed to hunt whales, the Makah is the only tribe in the
country with such a treaty right.
</P>
<P>
   Most Makah believe they need not ask anyone's permission to take
to the sea in canoes and return with a whale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I view the importance our treaty signers placed on whaling as
a last will and testament of a sacred way of life,'' said Micah
McCarty, a Makah who hopes to harpoon a whale this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge confronting the Makah was to get the world to
agree.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the tribe asked the United States to represent it
before the International Whaling Commission in its quest to resume
hunting.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move became possible the year before when the gray whale,
which had been pushed to extinction, largely by non-Indian hunters,
was removed from the federal endangered species list. The tribe
wanted a quota of whales that could be taken for subsistence and
ceremonial use.
</P>
<P>
   At the International Whaling Commission meeting in Monaco last
year, the assembled nations approved a deal by which the United
States for the first time received a quota of gray whales taken
from the stock that has been hunted by Siberian natives. And the
Russian government received a quota of bowhead whales taken from
the stock that had been hunted by Alaskan Inuit. The gray whales
were allocated by the U.S. government to the Makah and the bowheads
were allocated by the Russian government to the Siberian natives.
</P>
<P>
   National Marine Fisheries chief counsel Margaret Hayes said the
nations didn't swap whale quotas, but that's what opponents allege,
calling it a backroom deal.
</P>
<P>
   After the Monaco commission meeting, U.S. negotiators publicly
declared that the IWC had approved a Makah whale hunt. But some IWC
member nations said the commission never formally gave its stamp of
approval to the hunt.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. IWC Commissioner James Baker said the commission works by
granting quotas for subsistence hunts to member nations and leaves
it up to those nations to chose which native people qualify for
whale hunts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commission grants quotas; it does not identify people,''
said Baker, who is the U.S. Department of Commerce undersecretary
for oceans and atmosphere. After hearing of the Makah's nutritional
and cultural need to hunt, the IWC granted the quota. That, said
Baker ``is sufficient legal support for the Makahs to do their
whaling.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Makahs claim a legal right to hunt gray whales,
international opposition continues to build from those who say the
claim is bogus. More than 350 groups from around the world posted
an open letter to the Makah on the Internet asking the tribe to
withdraw its plans for a hunt. The groups that signed include the
Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals from the
United Kingdom, Dutch Society for the Protection of Animals and the
European Federation for Nature and Animals based in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs
said: ``We would argue that the IWC has not recognized a cultural
and subsistence need by the Makah to hunt those whales. A lot of
other delegations expressed similar views.''
</P>
<P>
   An animal rights group called Australians for Animals is helping
to finance a lawsuit by U.S. Rep. Jack Metcalf, R-Wash., that seeks
to halt the hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Arnold, the group's founder, said in a telephone interview
from Australia that she decided to become involved when she heard
how some U.S. animal rights groups were reluctant to take on the
issue because of a sensitivity to Indian rights.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold, who plans to be here to protest, said the Makah hunt is
raising concern around the world. ``European groups are deeply
concerned. People in Australia and New Zealand are boiling with
rage. I think you can expect there will be a migration from this
country to Neah Bay to protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``If America goes whaling in her waters, then we've lost the
whale,'' Arnold said. ``There are so many indigenous tribes waiting
for the outcome of this.''

MAKAH HUNT FOR WHALING HERITAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 (WITH WHALES-HISTORY)  
 By PAUL SHUKOVSKY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEAH BAY, Wash. _ Micah McCarty rises with the sun and slips
into the chilly waters of Waatch River, just upstream from the
untamed edge of the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   With each stroke, he mimics the movement of the whale he hopes
to slay this fall with a hand-carved wooden harpoon. And he prays
that the gray whale will be ``a kind brother or sister.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarty is preparing himself for the Makah tribe's first whale
hunt in more than seven decades. He hopes it will renew the Olympic
Peninsula tribe's spirit and traditions. Opponents call the hunt
butchery, saying it has no place in a modern world where whales are
protected by international law.
</P>
<P>
   McCarty wants to be the ``chosen one.''
</P>
<P>
   The harpooner will stand in a dugout canoe, steady himself
against 10-foot Pacific swells, heft the barbed lance, take aim and
plunge it into the back of a 38-foot leviathan.
</P>
<P>
   The kill will be a sacred moment for the Makah, honoring the
great whale. But the eight men in the canoe _ keepers of a ritual
dating back at least 100 generations _ will be encircled by an
armada of outraged animal rights activists, a swarm of
international media and a thin phalanx of security.
</P>
<P>
   The hunt's notoriety stems from a controversial decision by the
International Whaling Commission that granted the Makah the right
to kill up to 20 whales through 2002. Animal rights activists fear
the hunt will spark a wholesale return to commercial whaling,
presently banned by the commission.
</P>
<P>
   But as the 27-year-old McCarty runs barefoot along Hobuck Beach,
he does not think about the global forces aligned against the 1,800
people living in his fishing village. Instead, he meditates and
prays to make his spirit pure to receive the whale, ``an honored
guest of the village.''
</P>
<P>
   He anchors his feet in the sand of the beach and heaves hunks of
driftwood in hopes of being chosen the harpooner.
</P>
<P>
   McCarty is one of 16 men selected by Makah families to compete
for eight spots on the first tribal whaling crew since the 1920s.
He feels the excitement building on this 44-square-mile reservation
of heavily logged rain forest and spectacular wilderness beach
located at the extreme northwest tip of the contiguous United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The return to whaling will be a sort of homecoming for the
Makah, whose real name _ which cannot be written in English _ means
``people who live by the rocks and the seagulls.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarty comes from a long line of whalers. His grandfather and
great-grandfather participated in the last hunts before whaling was
suspended, because gray whales had been stalked almost to
extinction by non-Indian whalers. McCarty's father, John, until
recently was executive director of the tribe's whaling commission.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from high school in Olympia, Micah McCarty came
home to Neah Bay and immersed himself in the maritime life, working
with his father as a commercial fisherman. ``It became a passionate
connection with the waters my ancestors plied,'' McCarty said.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Makah whalers before him, McCarty prepares by purifying
himself in frigid streams such as the Waatch River. ``We look upon
the water as its own being,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While bathing, McCarty said he ``thinks about the whale moving
gracefully through the water, and I swim as gracefully as I can.
... And I pray that our whale crew will be one mind, one body, one
spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Historically, secrecy guarded every aspect of Makah whaling from
the hunt to the communal butchering and feasting, according to
anthropological texts. Tribal members today remain guarded about
saying too much about the hunt to outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is usually taboo to even talk about,'' McCarty said.
``Usually, you just prepare yourself and go whaling.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarty, like his father and the rest of the tribe, is acutely
aware of the international controversy surrounding this fall's
hunt. ``In this day and age, it's important to say something about
it,'' McCarty said.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate that whaling still defines the fabric of Makah
life, McCarty shares a few words from sacred whaling songs that
have been passed down from generation to generation and are still
sung today.
</P>
<P>
   One song says ``my canoe travels with killer whales as an
escort,'' and another says ``my canoe travels with lightning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I might get in trouble for telling you that, but it's not a
direct translation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCarty said he has wanted to hunt whales for a long time, long
before they became news to the outside world. An accomplished
carver whose art is sold at a shop called Tribes in Fremont,
McCarty frequently creates masks that call upon spirits related to
whaling and the sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I learned about our oral history, some of the songs and
dances we do, my artwork took on more meaning about who we are and
where we come from.''
</P>
<P>
   The other whalers said McCarty and crew member Darrell
Markishtum frequently lead them in ancient paddle songs as they
practice stealth and speed in the red and black dugout canoe called
the Hummingbird.
</P>
<P>
   ``The songs keep your mind off the pain'' of paddling for hours,
said Don Swan, a powerfully built man who, like McCarty, would like
to be the ``chosen one'' to heft the harpoon.
</P>
<P>
   Neah Bay, like many other Native American communities, is
struggling with unemployment rates often exceeding 50 percent, deep
poverty and the problems of crime, drug and alcohol abuse and
domestic violence. McCarty hopes the return to whaling will provide
inspiration and a new focus for the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a sacred way of life that sets an honorable example,''
he said. Whaling ``involves so much concentration, so much
preparation, that anyone who was involved in that lifestyle
(substance abuse or violence) would have to drop it.''
</P>
<P>
   On a rare sunny spring day, McCarty and seven other members of
the crew boarded the 34-foot Hummingbird for paddle practice.
</P>
<P>
   A motorized chase boat skippered by whale commissioner Arnie
Hunter trailed the canoe. Nine-year-old Eric Johnson Jr. sat near
Hunter and stared at his dad paddling in the stern. In the
background, a fog horn on Waadah Island played a haunting, two-note
tune.
</P>
<P>
   Eric would like to be a whaler someday. ``Yeah, I'm thinking
about getting some barbells with 10-pound weights,'' he said,
becoming very serious. ``I think I would want to be the harpooner.
If you're the harpooner, you have to have a lot of strength so you
can stick it in the whale.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really want to take after my ancestors,'' said Eric, one
small example of how whaling may infuse a new generation of Makah
with the old values that existed before anyone had heard of
unemployment or Jim Beam.
</P>
<P>
   Arnie Hunter let up on the throttle and the canoe came
alongside. The men passed little Eric between boats. As he
scrambled into the bow of the dugout canoe, a luminous smile
transformed his serious face.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting a couple of feet from Eric was Wayne Johnson cradling a
.50-caliber military rifle designed to penetrate armor. It will
deliver the coupe de grace once the whale is harpooned, explained
Johnson, hefting the weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The rifle is one of the concessions to the 20th century made by
the Makah. The International Whaling Commission insists on a quick
kill. Says McCarty: ``They want us to do a humane kill. That
necessitates a quick and efficient method of ushering the whale to
the next world. I believe it to be an honorable alteration to a
sacred way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   But Makah elder Alberta Thompson disapproves not only of the
gun, but also of the hunt itself. ``What are we building our
culture on by going after something we don't want to eat?'' she
asked.
</P>
<P>
   That a few elders in the Neah Bay community have publicly
opposed the tribe's return to whaling has been used by opponents of
the hunt in an attempt to discredit the tribal leadership as not
representing the will of the people.
</P>
<P>
   But people in Neah Bay point out that Native American
communities do not have a single, monolithic viewpoint any more
than other communities.
</P>
<P>
   John McCarty also notes that in December's tribal council
election, two men who support resurrecting whaling _ Ben Johnson
Jr. and Keith Johnson _ were voted into office.
</P>
<P>
   But resurrecting whaling skills that have been dormant for more
than 70 years is a daunting challenge. So the Makah are turning for
advice to other indigenous whalers.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of the Makah Whaling Commission and whaling crew
traveled this winter to Barrow, Alaska, for the native whaling
captains convention. They attended seminars on topics such as
effective kill techniques used by the few indigenous tribes still
allowed to hunt by the International Whaling Commission. The tribe
is also considering sending a couple of Makah women to Alaska to
learn recipes for preparing whale meat and blubber, said Keith
Johnson, president of the tribal whaling commission.
</P>
<P>
   The whaling crew members are also training together. They run
together on the beach and take communal sweats in a lodge they
built behind Arnie Hunter's trailer. The young men are learning to
function as a team, said rifleman Wayne Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The crew training includes paddling into the Pacific to practice
``sneaking up and backing off'' whales, said McCarty.
</P>
<P>
   But many training methods will not be shared with the outside
world. For example, beginning with the first day of a new moon, the
nascent whalers will do a ``special type of training,'' said
McCarty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four new moons prior to the hunt will be the countdown,'' said
McCarty without offering further explanation.
</P>
<P>
   A big part of what whaling is about for these tribal people is
the bridge it creates between generations. For example, John
McCarty heard whaling stories from his father and told them to son
Micah.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Makah Bay, they harpooned this whale, a big bull,'' said
John McCarty, recounting the tale he heard from his father. ``He
was big enough and strong enough that they couldn't get close
enough to give him another harpoon. He went straight out to sea
(dragging the canoe by the harpoon tether).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one fierce ride. The whale was relentless; the toughest
whale they had ever seen. They looked back and Cheeka Peak was just
a tiny bump. They gave up, cut him loose, lost their harpoon and
floats. Fortunately, there was a west wind, so they set sail and
headed home. The guys were so exhausted they were laying on the
bottom of the canoe.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the telling of such stories across the generations that
defines the Makah. When he learned how little Eric Johnson beamed
when the men passed him into the whaling canoe, Keith Johnson said:
``These are the magical moments that are happening to our youth.
How can we describe that to the world?''

ANTI-NUDITY HUFF DESERVES A REBUFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Maybe you've seen Laetitia Casta posing nude on the
``Rolling Stone'' cover currently on newsstands.
</P>
<P>
   Or, depending on where you shop, maybe you haven't. The usual
paragons of moral superiority _ Wal-Mart, Kmart, Target, etc. _
have banned the issue from their newsstand shelves.
</P>
<P>
   No surprise there. I doubt whether these stores even sell the
nude shade of pantyhose.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. In my selfless role as a crusading journalist and
in an attempt to both shed light on controversial issues and
protect the public from dangers real and perceived, I have studied
the cover carefully. Many, many times.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: no big deal.
</P>
<P>
   The cover shows Casta in a pose somewhat reminiscent of Marilyn
Monroe in the photo that was used as the centerfold in the first
issue of ``Playboy,'' only Casta is less revealing.
</P>
<P>
   True, the view from behind is pretty complete. But without
getting into details fit only for men's magazines and front-page
newspaper stories describing the Bill Clinton-Monica Lewinksy
controversy, let's just say someone in the art department at
``Rolling Stone'' must be armed with an airbrush and he isn't
afraid to use it.
</P>
<P>
   I'm always momentarily boggled when someone gets upset over
something like this. So some beautiful model type flashes a little
skin on a magazine cover. And we're supposed to care? It's like
getting upset over a dog sniffing people in inappropriate places:
It's what they do. If you don't like it, don't look (and ``Rolling
Stone'' made that easy, by putting a removable card across the
cover for newsstand copies that hides Casta's, ahem, assets). &QL; 
 &QL; 
HECK, HECK, DARN, DARN
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But then I recall that every time I quote someone who uses the
words ``hell'' or ``damn,'' I hear from people outraged by such
shocking language.
</P>
<P>
   More power to you. I sincerely hope you enjoy the rest of 1927.
And by the way, your ankle is showing.
</P>
<P>
   It all goes back to the age-old debate: Is the human body in its
natural state beautiful or pornographic? Depends on the context.
And the body.
</P>
<P>
   Nudity in general doesn't offend me. It's not necessarily a
selling point _ I didn't buy Prince's ``Lovesexy'' CD way back when
just because he was sitting there naked on a leaf on the cover _
but it won't stop me from making a purchase or using a product. I
didn't boycott ``NYPD Blue'' when they showed Sipowicz's butt
(though I did skip my midnight snack).
</P>
<P>
   Those who know about such things say ``Rolling Stone's''
circulation has been slipping of late, that its motivation for
putting Casta on the cover in her birthday suit was to sell more
copies of the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Noooo! Next thing you know, they'll be saying American Express
hired Jerry Seinfeld for its commercials because it wanted more
customers. There is no end to perceptive analysis, especially now
that Matt Drudge has his own television show. &QL; 
G,WHAT ABOUT ME?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'm surprised more magazines haven't tried nude covers _ it's a
guaranteed attention-getter. Remember the pregnant Demi Moore on
the cover of ``Vanity Fair``? Why not put a stripped-down Drew
Carey on the cover of ``TV Guide``? He's an Everyman sort of
fellow, a beer-and-a-shot kind of guy. Pour him into one of those
thongs that rides way up high, pose him so as to keep things legal,
and every Schlitz drinker on the planet will feel better about
himself. Or worse about Drew anyway.
</P>
<P>
   In a show of solidarity with Casta, I considered switching the
usual picture that runs atop this column with a full-body nude shot
of myself. But I realized that any picture _ clothed or not _ that
doesn't reveal your waistline is the one you want to go with.
</P>
<P>
   Casta's body shape lends itself to nudity. Mine lends itself to
having the ``G'' in a human ``G-O S-U-N-S'' banner painted on it.
</P>
<P>
   Teenage smoking offends me. Pro sports salaries offend me. Sam
Donaldson offends me.
</P>
<P>
   A nude ``Rolling Stone'' cover just doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the naked truth. &QL;

GOLFER JOHN DALY IS A MAN FOR THE MASSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ It was Davis Love's turn, but John Daly wanted
to hit one more ball. After walloping drives in conventional
fashion with his unorthodox swing, Daly decided to tee up another,
this time on top of an Aquafina water bottle.
</P>
<P>
   There he stood, John Daly in front of the world again at
Tuesday's PGA champions clinic, showing his playful side. With a
loud thwack, Daly's steel-headed Callaway driver simultaneously
smacked the plastic bottle and balata ball, the impact sending
every dimple over the driving-range fence.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be when Daly wanted to take another shot, he would
ask the bartender to pour him one.
</P>
<P>
   For almost a year and a half, in his second courtship with
sobriety, Daly has been dry. His life, as errant as some of his
drives, now revolves around the ordinary. Daly has found that the
purest pleasures come from his two daughters and a reunion with his
third ex-wife.
</P>
<P>
   With Daly you rarely get the mundane snippets of his everyday
existence because he continues to pack more shrill than monotone.
</P>
<P>
   When he gets an 18 on a hole at Bay Hill, you can't figure it
out. When he rolls a 10 on the final hole at the British Open to
miss the cut, you wonder. When he busts his 5-iron and doesn't sign
his scorecard in Memphis, you hear the whispers like the ones from
a Sahalee volunteer: ``Is he back on the sauce?''
</P>
<P>
   No he's not. But Daly admitted Tuesday he still has the urge,
fighting the obsessive tendencies, realizing the glitches will be
perceived as setbacks, hoping everyone understands.
</P>
<P>
   The incident in Memphis disturbs him. It was typical John Daly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a lot of things with John, it was one step back, two
steps forward,'' said Donnie Crabtree, one of his longtime friends.
``He doesn't want to get back into the thing of: `It's the same old
John again.'''
</P>
<P>
   The temporary lapse could lead to long-term implications.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good example of what he shouldn't do,'' said Ely
Callaway.
</P>
<P>
   Daly used to walk out of Las Vegas casinos $250,000 up or
$250,000 down before Callaway gambled on him. During Daly's days of
liquor-fueled mishaps, Wilson dropped its $10 million contract with
him. Ely Callaway, who heads the Big Bertha club-making giant,
decided to take a flyer on a volatile investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He decided he wanted to live and capitalize on his talent in
golf,'' Callaway said. ``We knew if he could do that and stop
drinking, he would be a tremendous attraction because of his
appeal. Fans have a basic empathy for him, a connection even though
they don't know him. He's a very lovable character because of his
problems. We weren't gambling. He was the one gambling _ with his
life.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, Daly is the straight and Sahalee is the narrow. There
is evidence he has changed. He grinded it out at the Bob Hope
Classic, firing a 67 on Friday even when he had no hope of making
the cut.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Tour is not the cocktail circuit anymore. His saying
used to be: ``One's too many and 100 ain't enough.'' He will attend
Alcoholics Anonymous meetings while he is here.
</P>
<P>
   His difficulties with alcohol, his publicized nut-outs, his
numerous divorces have somehow endeared him to galleries who first
embraced Daly when he was the nobody who won the PGA Championship
in 1991 at Crooked Stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of who he is, the average person can relate to him,''
said Crabtree. ``He's not as far removed from some of the fans as
other professional golfers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am one of them,'' Daly said.
</P>
<P>
   In every way but one. Daly routinely launches 300-yard drives
and on one occasion reached the 630-yard uphill 17th hole at
Baltusrol in two with a driver and 1-iron.
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's clinic, he wound up and delivered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hit it hard,'' said Lanny Wadkins, the clinic's emcee. ``They
want to see the big boy one time. These people are not concerned
with accuracy right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly obliged with shots that skied as high as a 9-iron but went
so far they disappeared in the distance, right where he hopes his
past will go.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently _ because you never know with him _ a new Daly has
emerged, one who is rekindling his relationship with Paulette, his
former wife, and enjoying fatherhood.
</P>
<P>
   Shynah, his 6-year-old daughter from a previous marriage, lives
in Orlando, but Daly spent Monday with her in New York at a
tournament raising money for breast cancer. Daly made some
left-handed clubs for her, and she tagged along, hitting shots and
hanging out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just wonderful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then when he is home with Paulette, he likes to take their
3-year-old daughter Sierra to Chuck E. Cheese. ``She just loves
that place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   John Daly, a family man who seems to be ordering off the menu
instead of sampling the whole buffet. Even his appetite is
suppressed, Daly having lost 20 pounds, substituting Diet Coke for
Coke and evidently reducing those cravings for chocolate frozen
yogurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything in my life is perfect now,'' Daly said. ``But life
is a struggle. Every day is not always a great day. I'm learning
you can turn a bad day into a good day.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he has no hope at Sahalee, given the confined surroundings
and his occasionally wayward game. It bothers the competitor in him
that he has not won since 1995 at the British Open. The frustration
shows despite encouragement from his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he forgets that drive he took one night in Colorado
when Crabtree had to talk him out of careening off a cliff,
speeding along at 140 mph, contemplating suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Daly has finally slowed down and is trying to catch up again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'm so used to adversity that my game has gone to
crap,'' Daly said. ``I don't know, maybe my life's too good.''

MAJORS WIN ENSURES A PLACE IN HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ It can be a major burden or a major relief.
</P>
<P>
   Winning one of golf's four coveted major titles can validate and
enhance an entire career or make every other regular PGA Tour event
and life in general seem slightly less significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rather win two majors and no other tournaments,'' said
Fred Couples, who won the 1992 Masters.
</P>
<P>
   The victory at Augusta earned Couples superstar status, but then
there are those whom Couples says ``fell off the turnip truck.''
</P>
<P>
   Players such as Corey Pavin, who won the 1995 U.S. Open but has
only one other tournament victory since. Last year, his best finish
on the Tour was a tie for eighth at the Mercedes Championships, his
only top 10 finish.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing can take away the importance of winning a major.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win a major championship is a very big deal,'' Pavin said.
``I knew I was capable of doing it and it would have been a missed
opportunity if I didn't get one. I wouldn't mind getting a few
more. I feel there is more out there for me to win.''
</P>
<P>
   But winning a major creates undue expectations from fans and the
media that the feat can be accomplished more than once.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really can't go into them expecting that you are going to
win them,'' Pavin said. ``There is a lot of luck involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning the first major is the key, even if it is the only one.
It gives players a sense that they have etched their name in the
history books.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Mark O'Meara is the latest to make history, winning
the Masters and the British Open after playing on the tour for 18
years _ 56 majors _ before breaking through. Up until this year, he
always had been known as one of the top performers on the PGA Tour
to have never won a major event.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win a major championship was a dream come true for me,''
O'Meara said upon winning the Masters. ``Hopefully (the win), put a
lot of that stuff to rest. When I come in the press room, people
won't say how you haven't won a major championship. I've got that
under my belt.''
</P>
<P>
   The list of top golfers to have never won a major title includes
David Duval, who is the winningest player on the PGA Tour over the
past year, with victories in five regular tour events. He finished
second at the Masters, seventh at the U.S. Open and 11th at the
British Open. He feels that he's close to a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be extremely special,'' Duval said of the possibility
that he could win his first major at the PGA Championship this week
at Sahalee Country Club in Redmond. ``It would certainly put a nice
asterisk next to what has been a good year for me and build on last
year, which was a very good year as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Others in the same category are Phil Mickelson (28 years old, 12
tour wins but no majors) and Jim Furyk (28 years old, two Tour
wins, no majors). Then there are those who feel that time is
catching up with them, such as Scotland's Colin Montgomerie (35
years old, 17 tournament wins and no majors).
</P>
<P>
   At age 26, Duval believes that time is on his side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't particularly feel any additional pressure right now,''
he said. ``If I have a couple more close calls where it doesn't
quite work out my way, then I might start to feel a little more
pressure. This is certainly one of the four events that you aim for
through the course of the year ... so it certainly would be a great
crowning moment of the year and probably for my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick Price, a native of South Africa, has worn that crown three
times in the past seven years, winning the 1992 and 1994 PGA
Championships, along with the 1994 British Open. It took him nearly
a decade of toiling on the PGA and European tours before he broke
through.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me at the age of 35, it did take a little bit of a monkey
off of my back,'' he said of his first PGA win. ``But let's look at
it in another light; it enhanced my career. The second one did a
little more and the third one even made it better.''
</P>
<P>
   Price believes the PGA Championships are as important as any of
the other three major tournaments because the PGA draws the best
and toughest field of golfers from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   He also likes the fact that the PGA moves its tournament to
different courses across the country, and feels proud to have won
the event at two vastly different courses: Bellerive Country Club
in St. Louis and Southern Hills Country Club in Tulsa, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hat's off to the PGA for being adventurous and trying new
golf courses,'' he said. ``If we didn't, we'd just be playing the
same courses year in and year out.''
</P>
<P>
   When he won last year's PGA Championship at Winged Foot in New
York, his first major after 11 years on the Tour, Davis Love III
called it the most important moment of his life. Even though he's
struggled this year because of back spasms, he'll never have to
answer questions about why he can't win a major.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know every time I play, I have a little more confidence
because of my win at Winged Foot,'' Love said. ``. . . I'll always
enjoy being called the PGA champion.''

LEHMAN: NO. 11 HOLE AT SAHALEE IS `BRUTAL' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ If Sahalee Country Club was an otherwise
spotless windshield, the 11th hole would be its small crack. Or
bug.
</P>
<P>
   Five hundred and forty-six yards of real estate. Turns to the
left. Finishes in a forest. Looks like a slalom course.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four hours from teeing it up for real, Sahalee largely
has passed inspection as host of the PGA Championship. The weather
and setting have drawn raves. The greens and enthusiasm have rated
a thumbs-up.
</P>
<P>
   Compliments stop once players journey down No. 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's 17 great holes and one brutal one,'' Tom Lehman says.
``I wouldn't even call it average _ because that hole is brutal.''
</P>
<P>
   Two maple trees guard the green to the right, two fir trees
shadow it to the left. The par-5 has a goalpost look on final
approach. Making matters worse, there's yet another wide-bodied
tree stuck in the middle of the fairway, 90 yards out. Somewhere in
the middle of all this flora and fauna, a flag sticks out.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Kite ricocheted a shot off a greenside limb on No. 11
Tuesday and dropped another ball in the fairway. He hit the trees
again. Duffy Waldorf sent two into wooded oblivion. Steve Jones
plunked one off the natural barricade. As did Fred Couples the day
before. As did nearly every other golfer brave enough _ or
foolhardy _ to try and reach the putting surface in the minimum
number of shots.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th is the first thing fans see when they jump off their
shuttle bus and enter the grounds; it's the last thing the golfers
want to look at.
</P>
<P>
   Roll an 11 in craps, and everybody's a winner. Do it at Sahalee,
and everybody ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Joey Sindelar was one of the few players who landed a second
shot on the 11th green Tuesday. You wouldn't know it by talking to
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little confused,'' he said. ``I have to have another
look at it.'' Finally, Sindelar concluded, ``It's not what I would
do if it was my hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Haas diplomatically called the 11th unique. Jim Furyk
described it as interesting. Ask any pro about the hole, and a slow
smile creeps across his face. Let us play through unimpeded, these
guys plead.
</P>
<P>
   Trees smack in the middle of fairways are fairly unique at
upscale golf layouts. Stanford Golf Club has one. Los Angeles
Country Club has one. Preston Trails in the Dallas area has one.
Sahalee is the leader in this clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking one, we're talking four,'' Sindelar said.
``You can play around one, strategize around two. But you have a
bunch of them. We'll try to birdie it somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   To obtain the PGA Championship, Sahalee agreed to remove 400
trees from the course, including a couple stuck inside bunkers.
Apparently there was a strong enough argument to save the trees
bordering No. 11, particularly the proud, leafy one blanketing the
right side of the green.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would cry if they cut down that maple tree on that hole,''
said Carl Taylor, Sahalee grounds crew member. ``It's a par-5. They
don't have to get there in two.''
</P>
<P>
   On the tour, there is always the occasional maverick who breaks
from popular opinion. Heading the committee supporting Initiative
11 is Ernie Els.
</P>
<P>
   He actually likes the testy par-5. He reached it in two shots
the first time he tried it, using a driver and 2-iron.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great hole,'' Els said. ``It's not easy. But
that's just design. We don't play on golf courses with these kind
of trees. I wouldn't want to take any of these trees out. They're
too nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Payne Stewart: ``I don't mind the 11th hole at all. But as
I say that, it might jump up and bite me.''
</P>
<P>
   Do I go for it in two or lay up?
</P>
<P>
   It's the type of obstacle, not conservative play, that has the
tour players grumbling. They're used to avoiding lakes and creeks
with half swings. Backing off from trees is not their nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was up to me,'' Lehman said, ``I'd take a chain saw to
it.''

SEN. GORTON PERSONALLY GOES FISHING FOR A POLLOCK AGREEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Next Tuesday, U.S. Sen. Slade Gorton will preside over
a peace conference among the entrepreneurs of pollock. Fisher men
and women, owners of factory trawlers, catcher boats, mother ships
and shore plants in Alaska will crowd into a room at Davis Wright
Tremaine law offices and have at it. No environmentalists are
invited _ and no media.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton, R-Wash., hopes to find some formula to reduce the number
of boats, especially the factory trawlers. One imagines something
like the London Naval Treaty of 1921, which called for the
scrapping of dreadnoughts and set the ratio of capital ships in the
British, American and Japanese navies at 5:5:3. No one disputes
that a similar disarmament is needed in America's highest volume
fishery, in which seasons have shrunk to just 70 days a year. The
question is how to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, fired the opening salvo a year ago
with his American Fisheries Act (S. 1221). His bill targets 18 big
boats rebuilt a decade ago in Norwegian yards or that are owned by
Norwegians. It declares its intent to ``Americanize'' the fishery,
and ejects the boats without compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton took umbrage at this, which is not surprising in that the
boats are based in Washington state. When Stevens, who chairs the
Appropriations Committee, said he would attach S. 1221 to a money
bill, Gorton threatened to filibuster it. Talking a bill to death
is not a usual Gorton tactic. Stevens agreed to let Gorton try to
work out a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides cheered. The American Fisheries Act Coalition
(www.usafish.org) was happy that Gorton had agreed to the idea of
retiring boats. The companies targeted by Stevens
(www.fairfishlaws.org) were happy that Gorton had insisted that all
sides agree that ``all present participants in the fishery are in
it legally'' and that any reduction in boats ``be done in a manner
that recognizes the economic interests of all.''
</P>
<P>
   The pro-Stevens side may try to sell Gorton on a boat buyback.
Some compensation might be possible to owners of kicked-out boats,
said maritime attorney Terry Leitzell, vice president of Victor
Seafoods. But he said the foreign-built boats have to go. That, he
said, ``is clearly Sen. Stevens' issue, and we're not in a position
to negotiate it away.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with a buyback is who pays. ``I don't think the
government is going to put down money to buy factory trawlers,''
said one boat company boss.
</P>
<P>
   The At-sea Processors Association, which represents most of the
factory trawlers, is pushing for a co-op. The fish are now
allocated among three groups _ at-sea processors, on-shore
processors and Alaskan villages. The association's proposal would
split off the mother ships, leaving just seven factory-trawler
companies _ few enough to divvy up the fish by private agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The result would be a system of individual fishing quotas
(IFQs), which boat owners have been lobbying for since the early
'90s. A formal quota is virtually a property right on the fish.
This would be something less than that, an informal quota. But in a
common-property world, even an informal drawing of fences can pay
dividends.
</P>
<P>
   Four companies _ American Seafoods, Tyson, Alaska Ocean and
Glacier Fish _ have done it already in the whiting fishery off the
Oregon coast. The result, said Glacier's manager, John Bundy, has
been that skippers have slowed down, reduced the catch of unwanted
species, increased the quality of the product and stayed in the
black. And because there was no race for fish, the harvest was done
by seven boats instead of 10.
</P>
<P>
   That's a 30 percent reduction in boats. The same plan could cut
the number of factory trawlers in the Bering Sea by 20 percent, the
At-sea Processors Association says.
</P>
<P>
   How about that? Not likely, says Leitzell: ``They get all the
operational benefits of an IFQ, and we don't. We're sitting at the
back of the truck.'' Leitzell likes individual quotas, though some
in his coalition don't. But he says: Reduce the number of boats
first.
</P>
<P>
   How to entice boats to leave? ``I don't know,'' he says. The
Stevens approach has not been to entice them to leave; it has been
to force them to leave.
</P>
<P>
   It will take a miracle for Gorton to fashion a consensus from
this. A deal is possible on one issue, though: nationality. ``We
wouldn't oppose a U.S. ownership requirement,'' said Bernt Bodal,
chief executive of American Seafoods, which is owned by Aker/RGI
Group of Oslo, Norway. ``We are willing to work practically to get
something in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Bodal's boss, Hjell Rokke, was in Seattle a few weeks ago. Bodal
would not confirm it, but several sources said Rokke talked with
representatives of Alaskan villages, which have bought interests in
other factory trawlers. They don't have the cash to buy American's
fleet, but politically they would be unassailable.
</P>
<P>
   And in fish, politics counts for a lot.

TEED OFF: HOW GOLFERS CAN KEEP THEIR COOL WHEN TEMPERS FLARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN IWASAKI  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sudden death in golf may not always mean a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Wozeniak, head pro at Interbay Family Golf Center in
Seattle, has heard tales of players who have died after angrily
breaking their clubs, only to have a jagged shaft snap back and
pierce an artery.
</P>
<P>
   While that might be merely a chilling bit of golf lore, there's
little question that many players are mad about golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had clients destroy tee markers _ just smash 'em _ break
clubs over their knees, stomp their putters,'' said Deborah Graham,
a Texas sports psychologist who works with more than 100 touring
pros, including some playing in this week's PGA Championship at
Redmond's Sahalee Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've seen that commercial where a player heaves his whole
bag into the lake? That's happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Helping everyone from weekend hackers to the world's best
golfers to tee off without being teed off is part of the job of
instructors and sports psychologists, who say emotional stability
is a key to a successful game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golf is a sport where there's very little release of tension
and emotion,'' said Graham, whose clients play on the PGA, LPGA,
Senior PGA and Nike tours. ``Those things have an outlet in contact
sports or in sports where you're moving at an active pace or
reacting to a moving ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``In golf, you have a lot of time to think. And the ball is just
sitting there.''
</P>
<P>
   Redmond pro golfer Rick Fehr, who is considered to be a
gentleman on and off the PGA Tour, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   NBA players can bang bodies as they battle for a rebound or
basket, he said, and frustrated athletes in team sports kick water
coolers. But outbursts stand out in golf, a game of decorum and
etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been there before,'' Fehr said sheepishly. ``Sometimes
you do something childish and immature. I'm not sure golfers are
more guilty of this than others. But maybe we're more visible.''
</P>
<P>
   John Daly, a long hitter with a short temper, broke his 5-iron
en route to one of his three double bogies during the third round
of the St. Jude Classic in Memphis earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   While the tales Wozeniak has heard about golfers accidentally
killing themselves may be more myth than fact _ a computer search
of newspaper files across the country found no cases of such
self-inflicted deaths or injuries _ stories of literal weekend
warriors abound.
</P>
<P>
   They include the reported death of a Wisconsin golfer in 1996
after a fight triggered by accusations of slow play.
</P>
<P>
   And the time in 1994 when an Ohio golfer fractured the skull of
a player with a club after a disagreement over whose group was to
tee off first. Two years later, another Ohio golfer broke the nose
of a player in a slow-moving foursome, which included a pregnant
woman.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a Pennsylvania golfer was convicted of punching a
tournament official in the face after shooting a quadruple bogey.
</P>
<P>
   The violent outbursts suggest that the aggressors may have
problems dealing with anger anywhere, not just on the course. But
even more typical expressions of frustration, such as tossing
clubs, may not be directly linked to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very often, the anger you see on the golf course has other
roots,'' Graham said. ``Very often it's suppressed anger about a
frustrating work situation, financial problems, family problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other individual sports, golf tends to attract those who
``may be a little more competitive and self-reliant, but it also
puts players in the position of being very critical of
themselves,'' said Jim Bauman, a sports psychologist at Washington
State University.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty is getting players not to dwell on past mistakes
or look too far ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell golfers, you never play the last shot. You never play
the next shot. You play one shot at a time, period,'' Bauman said.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, who evaluates the personalities of her clients and tries
to help them emulate the mental traits of champions, says those who
are used to being in command often find themselves at the mercy of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go out and try to control golf, you get into trouble,
because you can't,'' she said. ``Perfectionists can go berserk out
there. The harder he tries, the worse it gets. Golf is a game where
you've got to let it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Wozeniak likewise strives to induce steady play from his
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to get across to people that even the best golfers in
the world don't hit the shots that they want to all day long,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way you play best is at an even keel. If you hit a bad
shot, well, you just go from there. That's hard to do. That's why
there are so few great golfers. You can't tell if they're shooting
good or an 80.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Krueger, associate chaplain for the Tour Bible Study, a
Christian ministry to the PGA Tour, said pro golfers are marked by
an intense drive to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they fall short _ and this applies to the weekend golfer
as well _ they throw clubs, get sullen, withdraw,'' he said. ``I
find that the guys who are better able to handle the crisis moment
are the guys who excel.
</P>
<P>
   ``They realize they're going to hit some bad shots. They don't
let that tank them mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the average golfer who gets ticked off after topping the
third ball in a row, dealing with failure on the course is part of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia sports psychologist Bob Rotella, a consultant to PGA
golfers and other athletes, said the most frustrated players are
amateurs ``who never practice, play once a week, don't have any
skills and should not have any business expecting to play par golf.
They miss a shot and go ballistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing an extreme case, Graham recalled her horror as an
amateur client, upset over his play, bloodied himself by striking
his head with his club. She also heard of a Southwest golfer who
punished himself by plunging into a cactus.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are bordering on self-destructive tendencies,''
Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   To help the typical golfers deal with stress, instructors and
sports psychologists prescribe mental exercises or visual
reminders.

   BED-DESIGN (Undated) _ The bed has gone to its head. The
traditional, boat-like bed that saw you through life's journey _
from birth to death, from stem to stern, from side to side _ is
becoming a more minimal platform for modern living. It is now
basically a flat barge for layered bed linens. But, ready to seize
the moment, the headboard is grabbing the spotlight and going solo.
From couture-end home furnishing designers to mass-market
retailers, the headboard alone is being sold as an option for the
bed and making itself widely available. By William L. Hamilton.

   VIDEO-BEACH-HOUSE (Undated) _ Michael Jantzen, a California
designer and conceptual artist, was driving down the Pacific Coast
Highway in Malibu one day when he had an unusual vision. ``I was
looking at all the ugly houses blocking the view of the ocean,'' he
said, ``and I thought, wouldn't it be nice to see the ocean on the
facade?'' The result _ a millennial flight of fantasy yet to be
built _ is the world's first video beach house. In what is perhaps
an architectural critic's dream, a ho-hum building could seem to
disappear. In this case, video monitors pointing toward the ocean
in the back of the house project waves and sky onto the facade. By
Patricia Leigh Brown.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-LIBRARY (Los Angeles) _ The Clinton mystery that
consumes an elite slice of America's architectural and
entertainment establishment these days has nothing to do with DNA
and everything to do with bricks and mortar. Or glass and steel. Or
granite and marble. So far, only the scene is known: 26 acres of
warehouses and vacant lots on the banks of the Arkansas River in
Little Rock have now been set aside as the future home of the
William J. Clinton Presidential Library. By Todd S. Purdum.
</P>
<P>
   ELVIS-SHRINE (Holly Springs, Miss.) _ ``I guess I know more
about Elvis than Elvis knew about himself,'' said Paul MacLeod, who
over the last few years has turned the antebellum house he
inherited here into Graceland Too, a shrine run by the
self-described ``universe's, the galaxy's, the planet's, the
world's No. 1 Elvis fan.'' By Phil Patton.
</P>
<P>
   FORMICA-LANDMARK (Undatd) _ Everyone knows what decorative
laminate is. That's the plastic stuff, often called Formica, that
renovators rip out when they restore a historic house. But take
note. It's none other than those garish old plastic laminates,
circa 1959, that have just qualified the Ralph Sr. and Sunny Wilson
House, in Temple, Texas, for a plaque from the National Park
Service. By Barbara Flanagan.
</P>
<P>
   BACKYARD-BARBECUE (Undated) _ Smoke gets in their eyes _ and
that's only part of the attraction. Once man cooked over an open
fire in a cave. Some time later came the 1950s backyard grill, a
mammoth creation etched on the landscape in brick or stone. In the
'60s more mobile chefs, or those without backyards, swore by their
portable hibachis and Weber kettle grills. And then came the '80s
and the portable gas-fired grills that turned summer cookery into
something as romantic as, say, lighting the kitchen range. And now?
After two decades of growth, the American economy has brought a
return to the backyard barbecue. By Donna Paul.
</P>
<P>
   RUG-BUSINES (New York) _ The intimate world of oriental rug
dealers is about to get even cosier. As of Sept. 1, ABC Carpet of
Manhattan is taking over the 3rd-floor rug department at Harrods of
Knightsbridge in London. This late-blooming marriage between two
centenarian retail giants appears to be a far from impulsive union
born of mutual admiration and canny business savvy.
</P>
<P>
   HARRELL-DESIGN (New York) _ Five years ago in Harlem, Andre
Harrell, then the president of Uptown Entertainment, a record
label, had a design epiphany. He went to a cocktail party at Graham
Court, at 116th Street and Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard;
walked into the apartment of Warner Johnson, the managing director
of Axicom Online.com, a Web-based telephone company, and found the
look that had been eluding him. By Elaine Louie.

FORMER SOVIET ATHLETE REDISCOVERS STARDOM IN THE USA

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ As one of the best modern pentathletes in the
world, Vaho Iagorachvili remembers the days he lived like a king.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the Soviet Union's top 10 athletes, Iagorachvili had
the money, the fame and most importantly, he had the respect.
</P>
<P>
   He had won the bronze medal at the 1988 Seoul Olympics and the
gold at the 1986 Goodwill Games. Iagorachvili held the Soviet
national title three times and was European champion in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was well-known,'' Iagorachvili, 34, said. ``I had
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   When when the old communist state began to unravel, Iagorachvili
was forced to return to his native Georgia, a former Soviet
republic.
</P>
<P>
   There he found life without heat, running water and food. Where
there was so much hope, Iagorachvili encountered despair.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1991, a chance meeting with American pentathlete Rob
Stull rejuvenated Iagorachvili. Stull offered Iagorachvili a chance
to go to the United States and coach.
</P>
<P>
   Iagorachvili jumped at the opportunity and seven years later,
he's representing the United States in international competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lived here a long time,'' Iagorachvili said. ``It does
feel a little different. But this is my home now.''
</P>
<P>
   And on Aug. 2, Iagorachvili brought back a silver medal for the
United States from the World Championships in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew this maybe was my last chance to win a medal,'' said
Iagorachvili, who now lives in Austin, Texas. ``I wanted to make
sure I did my best.''
</P>
<P>
   Iagorachvili's silver was the first U.S. individual men's medal
since 1979, when Bob Nieman won the gold at the world championship.
</P>
<P>
   Modern pentathlon is a creation of Baron Pierre de Coubertin,
the Frenchman largely responsible for the modern Olympics. He
patterned the sport after the duties of a Napoleonic courier,
making the competition the ultimate challenge for a soldier ordered
to deliver a message.
</P>
<P>
   At its highest level, the sport consists of 20 air-pistol shots
from 10 meters, a 200-meter swim, a round-robin fencing tournament,
equestrian show-jumping and a 3-kilometer run.
</P>
<P>
   What surprised many people about Iagorachvili's performance was
that he retired in March to pursue other options.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to work to pay my bills,'' Iagorachvili said. ``It's
hard to earn a living and train. But (U.S. national team) coach
(Victor Svatenko) asked me to come back so I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Iagorachvili went to Colorado Springs, Colo., to train for four
weeks before the championships.
</P>
<P>
   Iagorachvili said he would retire again and go back to work as a
physical education instructor at Austin Community College.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no other choice,'' he said. ``I have two children and a
family to think about.''

NEW YORK GROUP ACQUIRES HOME OF ARTIST THOMAS COLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MIKE HUREWITZ  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CATSKILL, N.Y. _ Major brush strokes have been added to the
work-in-progress of restoring the home of Thomas Cole, who founded
the Hudson River School of painting.
</P>
<P>
   The Greene County Historical Society has signed a contract to
purchase the long-neglected building in Catskill from a struggling
foundation that has owned it for roughly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The development comes as President Clinton last month designated
the Hudson as one of 14 American Heritage Rivers, a move that
spotlights the Hudson Valley region and can serve as a catalyst to
generate additional funding for projects like the Cole house.
</P>
<P>
   Activists pushing to refurbish Cole's earliest studio and home
see it as crucial to the growth of eco-tourism in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Cole is credited with spawning an American art movement famous
for its ethereal beams of light illuminating the rugged landscape,
not as wilderness to be conquered but as an inspirational work of
God. One of his pupils was Frederic Church, whose beautifully
restored Moorish-inspired house, Olana, across the river in
Greenport, is now a state historic site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know Cole's historic value,'' said Darlene Downing,
executive director of the Catskill Center for Conservation and
Development. ``But frankly, it's also a keystone eco-tourism venue.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can come across the river from Olana in Columbia
County, visit the Cole house and then travel up the Catskill
escarpment to the mountains the Hudson River School artists
painted, and even go on to Cooperstown. James Fenimore Cooper was a
friend of Cole and part of that whole intellectual genre of looking
to the wilderness for inspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   Plans to construct a new museum and visitor center at Olana
received a major boost in June when Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y.,
tucked $1 million for the project into a transportation bill.
Preliminary plans call for the 18,000-square-foot complex to be
built on a site adjacent to the historic property on a bluff
overlooking the river.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the Rip Van Winkle Bridge, the Catskill
Center has had a conservation easement on the Cole property that
ensures its preservation for public use and architectural
integrity. The Arkville-based center helped arrange the recent
sale.
</P>
<P>
   The Cole site has been purchased by the Greene County Historical
Society from the Thomas Cole Foundation for $87,500. The final
transfer awaits cutting through some red tape governing the
handling of assets by nonprofit groups, but those close to the
project said no major problems are expected.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition was financed in large part by a roughly $100,000
donation made by Raymond Beecher, former president of the local
historical society, which already oversees the historic Bronck
Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Beecher said plans call for the house to be refurnished with
historic pieces from Cole's time, including some botanical
specimens and paintings donated by a Cole family descendant.
</P>
<P>
   The site and setting will be invaluable to understanding the art
and philosophy of the young American democracy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose, like everything else, you could read about it in a
book,'' said Beecher, 81. ``But there's nothing like seeing the
site and the studio and the gallery exhibits and then going to see
one of the nearby areas he painted like Kaaterskill Falls.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year the state matched Beecher's generosity with a
$192,000 grant from the state Environmental Bond Act to be
allocated for restoration of building exteriors on the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to have it opened to the public by the millennium,
and then have a major retrospective of Cole's work,'' Downing said.

   BOMBING-INSIDER _ Working as a Foreign Service Officer at the

guards blew up a suspicious parcel. It wasn't a bomb. And neither
was the tin of cookies _ a Christmas gift _ that the Marine guards

   US-ADULTERY _ WASHINGTON - Despite President Clinton's high
approval ratings in the face of allegations of marital infidelity,
a huge majority of Americans still believe adultery is wrong,
according to polling data. And adultery among the average American
couple is far less common than the flurry of recent allegations
against Clinton and other public figures would suggest, say
sociologists, marriage counselors and clergy. But in cases of
divorce, adultery plays a much larger role. (Shepard, Cox News

   GAYS-CLERGY _ WASHINGTON _ The Family Research Council sponsors

whether or not homosexuality is an immutable identity. (Shook, Cox

in the bombing or bomings if Rudolph is charged in the Atlanta
cases. Decamp will be in the state of North Caroina at a convention
and a phone call a way when Patriot leader Bo Gritz goes into the
woods of Western North Carolina to hopefully negotiate Rudolph from
his hiding place. (Scruggs, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 25-30.

BARISTAS FIND HOT COMMODITY IN FROZEN COFFEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The season's hottest drink is frozen.
</P>
<P>
   Not frozen solid, of course. It's a blended beverage mixing ice,
coffee and any number of flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Confused? Then you haven't set foot in a donut shop or coffee
bar on a sultry summer afternoon and waited impatiently for the
drink that refreshes.
</P>
<P>
   Frozen coffee drinks, relatively unheard of just two years ago,
are suddenly as popular as a winning Powerball ticket. Well, maybe
not that the odds on being able to enjoy one are far better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The daily consumption of frozen coffee has almost doubled in
the past year,'' said Gary Goldstein, spokesman for the National
Coffee Association in New York. ``It's almost an entirely new
coffee beverage that appeals to non-coffee drinkers as well as the
regular coffee consumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dunkin' Donuts has done some market research and 20 to 25
percent of its Coolatta buyers are non-coffee drinkers. These
drinks are introducing some people to coffee as a beverage through
a category that hadn't been thought of before, the cold category.''
</P>
<P>
   Some coffee shops, such as Starbucks, make their frozen drinks
with shots of espresso, while others rely on fresh-brewed coffee
(Dunkin' Donuts). Either way, it seems to be a recipe for success.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's craziness. Cold drinks are becoming just as popular as
hot drinks,'' said Beth Wood-Leidt, president of Connecticut-based
Nancy's Coffee Cafe. Her stores offer frozen cappuccinos and frozen
mochas, as well as mocha shakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, people have never thought of coffeehouses as a
place that offers cold products,'' Wood-Leidt added, ``but that's
changed completely in the past two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Iced coffee has been with us for ages, but frozen coffee made
its debut in the Northeast just last year.
</P>
<P>
   A chain in California, Coffee Bean &AMP; Tea Leaf, claims to be the
first retailer to have added frozen coffee drinks to its menu, but
industry experts can't agree on which company first took the
concept of a caffeine-laced smoothie or frappe and began marketing
the heck out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle-based Starbucks gets credit for popularizing this
beverage, however. Last summer, the ubiquitous chain started
offering coffee, mocha, chocolate, vanilla and decaf Frappuccinos
in three different sizes, and has advertised its drinks heavily.
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks officials declined to provide sales figures for frozen
drinks, which as of this summer includes a non-coffee drink as
well, the Tiazzi, a blend of tea, juice and ice. But Dunkin'
Donuts, which introduced the coffee Coolatta last summer, is not
shy about sharing the impact of its frozen coffee drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Coffee Coolatta sales reached $65 million last year and are
expected to top $90 million this year, according to a spokesman for
Dunkin' Donuts, which this summer has added fruit Coolattas to its
repertoire. Most Dunkin' Donuts shops experienced a 20 percent to
30 percent increase in sales last summer, due to the introduction
of the coffee Coolatta, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of its competitors, Dunkin' Donuts charges more than
twice the cost of a cup of coffee for one of its frozen drinks. The
Coolattas come in three sizes (16, 24 and 32 ounces) and have a
recommended retail price of $1.99 to $3.99, depending on the size
and flavor. The price range at Starbucks is from $2.35 to $3.50.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a good comparison for the frozen coffee drinks is
microbeers, another rage item for the '90s. Both sell for about
$3.50 each, and there doesn't seem to be much price resistance from
people,'' said Bruce Mullins, director of new products and
education at Coffee Bean International in Portland, Ore. ``We're
talking about a drink that's really fresh and I think that's a hot
button right now for consumers.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Coffee shops themselves are evolving. The only option a few
years ago was for decaf, or possibly an espresso or cappuccino.
Many coffee bars now offer dozens of flavors of coffee, and frozen
drinks are but another way they have found to diversify their menu.
</P>
<P>
   Rod Torrence, owner of Stagecoach Coffee, headquartered in
Cooperstown, N.Y., compares today's coffee shops to the bar
industry two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The frozen coffee drinks are really like smoothies, which were
a big deal in California five or six years ago,'' Torrence
observed. ``This is part of an overall trend. Coffee bars are
following the pattern of real bars, where the number of drinks
proliferated with frozen margaritas and other specialty drinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where this is going is anyone's guess, but today's coffee bars
remind me of the fern bars of the '70s and '80s. Consumers are
steadily becoming more savvy about what they want, and the coffee
bars are trying to stay one step ahead.''

DON'T COUNT THE JAPANESE OUT DESPITE THEIR TROUBLES 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BERNARD D. KAPLAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Japan's new prime minister conceded this week that his
country's economy is in a bad way and is facing a long, hard slump.
</P>
<P>
   It was an amazingly frank confession for a Japanese official to
make. In Japan it's considered poor manners to be that blunt. The
Japanese much prefer to speak elliptically. So when Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi referred to a ``severe situation,'' it meant things
must be pretty rough _ rougher, in fact, than most foreign experts
previously realized.
</P>
<P>
   But although Japan is down, don't count it out.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese are a highly resilient people, as they demonstrated
when they emerged _ literally _ from the ashes of their
catastrophic wartime defeat in 1945 to soon build one of the
world's most powerful economies, even challenging that of their
conqueror, the United States.
</P>
<P>
   When I first went to Japan in the early 1950s, the scars of the
war were everywhere. The cities had been largely burned out. The
highway from the port of Yokohama to Tokyo was a trail of
incinerated factories. Yet Japan already had the feel of a nation
on the move.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese optical firms had begun turning out world-class
cameras. High-quality steel alloys matched the best the United
States and Europe had to offer. The startling aspect of this was
that these were products that pre-war Japan, which specialized in
cheap imitations of Western goods, had not manufactured.
</P>
<P>
   Officials and business executives had already made the key
strategic decision to become an industrial power in the full sense,
recognizing that the old Japanese economy would never provide the
prosperity they sought.
</P>
<P>
   The embryonic auto industry churned out flimsy models that
looked as if they were held together with rubber bands and glue.
Indeed, the bodies of these early Toyotas and Datsuns were hammered
out by hand. Foreigners laughed and said no one had to worry about
competition from the Japanese car industry. But the Japanese
weren't laughing. Within a decade or so, they acquired a hefty
slice of the global auto market from the western car makers who had
sneered at them.
</P>
<P>
   This is all an old story by now. Still, it is worth recalling.
Most of Japan's problems are of its own making, the result of too
much power residing in too few hands especially in the top
government bureaucracy and the big banks.
</P>
<P>
   But just as the Japanese drew the appropriate lessons from their
disastrous misadventure in militarism in the 1930s and '40s, they
are likely to make the required changes to get themselves back on
their feet now.
</P>
<P>
   It could take time. In some ways, the Japanese are extremely
cautious and conservative. But eventually they do move. That's the
moment to watch out for them.

said, ``and I thought, wouldn't it be nice to see the ocean on the
facade?'' The result _ a millennial flight of fantasy yet to be
built _ is the world's first video beach house. In what is perhaps
an architectural critic's dream, a ho-hum building could seem to

in the back of the house project waves and sky onto the facade. By

granite and marble. So far, only the scene is known: 26 acres of

Little Rock have now been set aside as the future home of the
William J. Clinton Presidential Library. By Todd S. Purdum.

   FORMICA-LANDMARK (Undatd) _ Everyone knows what decorative
laminate is. That's the plastic stuff, often called Formica, that
renovators rip out when they restore a historic house. But take
note. It's none other than those garish old plastic laminates,
circa 1959, that have just qualified the Ralph Sr. and Sunny Wilson
House, in Temple, Texas, for a plaque from the National Park
Service. By Barbara Flanagan.

   BACKYARD-BARBECUE (Undated) _ Smoke gets in their eyes _ and
that's only part of the attraction. Once man cooked over an open
fire in a cave. Some time later came the 1950s backyard grill, a
mammoth creation etched on the landscape in brick or stone. In the
'60s more mobile chefs, or those without backyards, swore by their
portable hibachis and Weber kettle grills. And then came the '80s
and the portable gas-fired grills that turned summer cookery into
something as romantic as, say, lighting the kitchen range. And now?

   RUG-BUSINES (New York) _ The intimate world of oriental rug
dealers is about to get even cosier. As of Sept. 1, ABC Carpet of
Manhattan is taking over the 3rd-floor rug department at Harrods of
Knightsbridge in London. This late-blooming marriage between two
centenarian retail giants appears to be a far from impulsive union
born of mutual admiration and canny business savvy.

   HARRELL-DESIGN (New York) _ Five years ago in Harlem, Andre
Harrell, then the president of Uptown Entertainment, a record
label, had a design epiphany. He went to a cocktail party at Graham

walked into the apartment of Warner Johnson, the managing director

APPLE'S NEW MAC NO GUARANTEE OF COMPANY'S SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MIKE SPAIN  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Coming soon to a store near you is Apple
Computer's much ballyhooed iMac, the friendly $1,299 all-in-one
computer aimed at the education and home consumer market.
</P>
<P>
   Pronounced EYE-MAC, the ``i'' stands for the Internet. The
company boasts it takes less than eight minutes for even a child to
open the box, plug in everything and get onto the Net.
</P>
<P>
   At the Mac World Expo in New York last month, the company
displayed dozens of blue-green, translucent plastic-cowled iMacs to
play a mini-infomercial called ``Simplicity Shootout,'' which sums
up Apple's iMac marketing approach.
</P>
<P>
   The video features a 7-year-old boy setting up an iMac, squaring
off against a 26-year-old Stanford MBA doing the same with a PC.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good computer, for a Wintel PC,'' the pleasant sounding
but patronizing narrator says. Wintel refers to the Microsoft
Windows Operating System running with a processor made by microchip
giant Intel Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In split screen, the two open their boxes and assemble the
computer systems. Naturally, the simplicity of the iMac setup is
emphasized. In eight minutes, 15 seconds, the youngster turns his
iMac on and is on his way to setting up his Internet browser.
Meanwhile, the MBA fumbles through the directions and has to unpack
several boxes, compared with one iMac carton.
</P>
<P>
   As the youngster successfully gets onto the Internet and checks
his stocks portfolio, the MBA appears to struggle, typing in serial
numbers in a complicated setup. Long after the kid and his dog take
off _ about 20 minutes later _ the MBA finally enters the Net. The
fact is that after the initial setup _ and it really does take
longer for a PC _ the PC is nearly as simple to use as the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question the iMac will be welcomed by Macintosh
enthusiasts. It offers a competitively priced path to upgrade their
older Macs and, for the list price of $1,299, packs a lot of power.
Indeed, it has a faster microprocessor and a bigger hard drive than
most of the Macs (and PCs, too, for that matter).
</P>
<P>
   Apple also has announced more than 150 software companies are
producing new and updated software on the Mac OS platform. Some
colleges, such as Dartmouth, have embraced the iMac, recommending
it for incoming freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   Those already devoted to the Macintosh platform are applauding
loudly. The real question is, can cool new iMac win over PC users?
Many people who use Windows PCs at work or have had their own PCs
for a couple of years want faster and bigger units so they can
cruise the Internet and run their current programs faster. Does it
make sense for these folks to consider the iMac?
</P>
<P>
   Apple thinks so, but catchy commercials, competitive pricing and
a neat looking computer may not be enough. Apple has to offer
something the potential customer cannot have with his or her PC
(while making sure the customer doesn't lose something by moving to
the Mac.)
</P>
<P>
   This, many have speculated, was one of the biggest reasons for
Apple's alliance with Microsoft last year. Microsoft Office 98 for
the Macintosh runs elegantly, and its Word documents, Excel
spreadsheets and Powerpoint presentations are interchangeable with
their counterparts on the PC version of Microsoft Office.
</P>
<P>
   And for those who have some PC programs they don't want to give
up, there are Windows emulators such as SoftWindows and Virtual PC
that allow Windows or DOS programs to run on the Mac. These
programs really work and give comfort to those who may be afraid to
move to a Mac. The iMac includes the new G3 processors, which test
up to twice as fast as the Intel Pentium counterparts, but it also
has some new features.
</P>
<P>
   A Universal Serial Bus (USB) port will make hooking up mice,
printers, scanners and digital cameras much easier. Now, all a
manufacturer of a peripheral device for PCs needs to do is write a
relatively simple piece of software, a ``driver,'' for the device
to also be Mac compatible.
</P>
<P>
   Another Apple ``innovation'' on the iMac is that there is no
floppy disk drive. It just comes with a 24X CD-ROM drive. You can
add an external floppy drive, but Apple says small files that fit
on the 1.4 megabyte floppy disks can be e-mailed or put onto the
SuperDisks and Zip Drives, external disk drives that cram 100
megabytes onto a single disk.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the big test will be whether Apple can deliver the
actual product. It is notorious for introducing products, raising
demand, only to disappoint by delaying delivery by months.
</P>
<P>
   Apple promises it will have adequate inventory on iMacs on hand
by Saturday so there will not be an instant shortage.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac is part of the process whereby Apple has returned to
profitability. It just completed its third quarter in the black,
gaining lots of praise on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac is the third of a four-block matrix of products the
company has been rolling out. The first was the
``Pentium-toasting'' G3 chip Macs for the professional market. Then
there was the release of high-end Powerbook laptops running with
the speedy G3 chips, aimed at the professional market.
</P>
<P>
   Following the iMac, Apple says it will introduce one more
component to the matrix _ a low-cost portable computer aimed at the
home/student market by 1999.

 &HT;    AS WITH PAST U.S. LEADERS, FOR GINGRICH, IRISH EYES ARE SMILING
DURING VISIT

 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Newt Gingrich grips a 10-pound
concrete block, hoists it from the stack in his work-gloved hands,
walks briskly 10 feet and plunks it neatly in the cast frame of a
house foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The house, a project of Georgia-based Habitat for Humanity, will
sit in the Glencairn housing project on a hillside overlooking
Belfast. It will be dubbed ``The House that Congress Built,'' and
indeed six House members from both parties and their spouses joined
Gingrich in the labor Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   His face a little flushed with exertion, the Speaker of the U.S.
House of Representatives grabs another block and places it at the
end of the last one. A half-dozen TV cameras and a few still
photographers catch it all, the symbolically potent images of a
prominent American politician helping to lay the foundation for
Northern Ireland's future. Through it all, Gingrich sustains a
broad smile.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to escape the sense that the speaker is laying
another foundation on this sunny Irish hillside: One that would
support grander ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich was coy when Irish reporters asked playfully about his
presidential aspirations, yet it is becoming increasingly clear
that Ireland is becoming an important stop on the 2000 election
stump. Former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld, a potential rival if
Gingrich chooses to run, visited last year. New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, another prospective Republican candidate, is said to be
planning a trip soon.
</P>
<P>
   The political stature Ireland -- not to mention 46 million
American voters of Irish descent -- on the American political
landscape did not escape Gingrich, who noted that about a third of
U.S. politicians claims some Irish heritage. ``It's always been
there,'' the speaker said Wednesday in front of the elegant
Culloden Hotel, where his party of nearly 30 had been staying.
``You go back to President Kennedy's visit in '63. Tip O'Neil
coming here regularly in the '80s. Reagan's trip in '84. President
Clinton had a remarkably successful trip here in 1995.''
</P>
<P>
   But the speaker stressed that this trip was unrelated to
domestic politics. Instead, the seven-day tour was intended to
underscore the strength of U.S. support for the fragile Irish peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said he had conferred with President Clinton about the
goals of the trip. ``We wanted to communicate strongly that there
is bipartisan support, both from the legislative as well as
executive branch, and in talking with the president, he thought
this would be a helpful time,'' the speaker said. ``They get us
here at the beginning at the month and him here at the end of the
month.'' Clinton is scheduled to visit Ireland Sept. 3, following a
trip to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich and his delegation of six House members have met
privately with both sides of the conflict that has plagued this
country for 30 years. With the speaker are Reps. John Dingell
(D-Mich.), Jerry Lewis (R-Calif.), Jim Walsh (R-N.Y.), Anna Eshoo
(D-Calif.), Ray LaHood (R-Ill.) and Ken Bentsen (D-Texas).
</P>
<P>
   The group has met with representatives of Sinn Fein, the
political wing of the Irish Republican Army, as well as the Ulster
Democratic Unionist Party. The Catholic IRA for years has fought to
unite Northern Ireland with the Irish Republic, while the
Protestant Unionists have fought to keep Northern Ireland part of
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've communicated pretty successfully the intensity and depth
of our support for the process,'' he said. ``We also learned some
things that will make the president's trip better.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and British governments are placing much of their hopes
on the success of a new Belfast-based assembly, a central part of
the political settlement struck between Protestant Unionists and
Catholic Republicans last April.
</P>
<P>
   In the meetings, Unionists expressed concerns about forming a
government with members of Sinn Fein without adequate safeguards
that the IRA has renounced violence. The Unionist leaders equated
this to the United States entering into a partnership with the
Oklahoma City bomber.
</P>
<P>
   After emerging from a meeting with Unionist leaders, Gingrich
acknowledged that this issue remains an obstacle. ``It's very clear
that you have a real concern about the authenticity of the
renunciation of violence by the various groups that have used
terrorism,'' he said. ``We have a much better sense of how
important it is to focus on genuine decommissioning and to focus on
a genuine transition to a political process and away from violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these things take time. You've had 30 years or longer of
no one trusting anybody, so everybody starts every morning from a
position of distrust, so it takes everyone a long time to get
through that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's assessment of the situation has been reported widely
across Ireland and Britain, where he was routinely portrayed as the
third most powerful man in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim here.)
</P>
<P>
   And Gingrich's political ambitions also have been noted in the
media here. ``The U.S. presidential election is two years away, but
Glencairn, a loyalist estate overlooking Belfast, was as good a
place as any to canvass,'' wrote The Guardian Newspaper under the
headline ``Newt hopes that a touch of blarney will boost his
prospects.''
</P>
<P>
   The images at the Habitat for Humanity event seemed to have been
considered carefully. Unlike all the other workers, Gingrich worked
bareheaded, reducing the prospect of goofy photos of him with a
bright yellow hardhat perched on his head. Unlike the rest,
Gingrich opted for a flattering dark blue denim workshirt rather
than a white commemorative T-shirt that could have accentuated his
girth. He worked deliberately for a 55-year-old man unused to heavy
lifting.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end, he surveyed the pale gray foundation with a look
of satisfaction, a drop of sweat dangling from the end of his nose.
When the work was done, he posed with a sweet-faced little boy
named Michael Moore, who had shadowed the speaker as he worked.
</P>
<P>
   As other boys who had been hanging around joined Michael and the
speaker, Gingrich seized the opportunity. ``Our visit is really
about these boys' future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim here.)
</P>
<P>
   While here, Gingrich often has taken the tone of a statesman,
using carefully measured words to describe his talks with leaders
here and even speaking respectfully of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He also has associated himself with John Hume, a friend and
Northern Ireland's most respected Roman Catholic political leader.
At a St. Patrick's Day luncheon hosted by the speaker in
Washington, Gingrich said that he and Hume determined that they
were distantly related.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich was scheduled to have dinner Thursday with Hume, an
architect of the peace plan and a Nobel Peace Prize nominee, in
Donegal. Thursday morning, he was scheduled to visit the O'Doherty
Genealogy Center to help trace his family roots. The O'Dohertys are
the ancestors of his mother, Kathleen Daugherty.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that sense there's a certain amount of personal fun
involved in this trip,'' said Gingrich, who is scheduled to return
home to the United States on Saturday. ``Like all Americans, I'm
curious about my background.''
</P>
<P>
   And given the attention American presidents have received by
visiting their ancient Irish homesteads, the speaker also may be
gathering information for some future visit under very different
circumstances.

SAN FRANCISCO LITERARY FIXTURE NAMES CITY'S POET LAUREATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GREGORY LEWIS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Internationally acclaimed writer, book seller
and publisher Lawrence Ferlinghetti has been named San Francisco's
first poet laureate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's our greatest poet, but he's so much more _ he's the
quintessential San Franciscan,'' Mayor Willie Brown said Tuesday in
conferring the honor.
</P>
<P>
   Ferlinghetti, 79, will serve in the role for one year beginning
on Oct. 13, when he will deliver the first of what will become an
annual poet laureate's address at the New Main Library.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the annual address, the poet laureate's duties
include participating in cultural events, visiting branch libraries
and meeting and greeting dignitaries visiting the city.
</P>
<P>
   The title will come with a $5,000 annual honorarium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as we call upon the ballet, the symphony, and the opera,
we will call upon the poet laureate,'' Brown said, to show off San
Francisco's culture.
</P>
<P>
   Ferlinghetti said he would use his new title as ``a soap box to
promote ideas'' and proceeded to announce two of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Poet's House on Treasure Island or the Presidio,'' he said.
``I presented that idea 20 years ago to the Board of Supervisors
and three months ago to Mayor Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   His second idea is to designate North Beach, because of its rich
literary history, a federal historic site.
</P>
<P>
   Ferlinghetti said the neighborhood, made famous by the so-called
Beat poets who made San Francisco a hipster poet destination in the
1950s, also attracted writers such as Mark Twain and George
Sterling.
</P>
<P>
   Ferlinghetti's business, City Lights Bookshop, has been a North
Beach landmark since 1953. It was the nation's first all-paperback
bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   Ferlinghetti launched a publishing career from there in 1955 but
his 1958 book of poetry ``A Coney Island of the Mind'' along with
the late Allen Ginsberg's ``Howl'' were the most popular poetry
books of the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   A 1961 compendium, ``Starting from San Francisco,'' took its
title from Walt Whitman and arguably established Ferlinghetti as
this century's Whitmanesque American bard.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our ageless radicals and true bards'' is how Booklist
described Ferlinghetti, the author of 14 books of poetry, four
works of prose, two plays and two works of translation. His most
recent collection of poetry, ``A Far Rockaway of the Heart'' was
published in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But Ferlinghetti's publication of Ginsburg's ``Howl'' in 1956,
which led to his arrest on federal obscenity charges, drew national
attention to the Beat movement and helped establish broader free
speech interpretations. He was acquitted of the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Brown announced last November the establishment of a San
Francisco poet laureate during a speech at Seoul University in
South Korea. Last month he formed a seven-member committee, headed
by City Librarian Regina Minudri. The panel provided Brown with a
short list of recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said he believed it was necessary to establish the
program because San Franciscans benefit from the cultural
perspective of artists and writers, whom he described as the
``thinkers, dreamers and image constructors'' in society.
</P>
<P>
   Ferlinghetti noted proudly that ``Plato in `The Republic' called
the poet subversive to the public and a gadfly to the state.''

FORMER ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION OFFICIAL DIES AT 87 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA KLEKAR  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Alvin R. Luedecke, who
distinguished himself in the military, as an educator, acting
president of Texas A&AMP;M University and Atomic Energy Commission
official, died Sunday in San Antonio at the age of 87.
</P>
<P>
   The credits to his life are long: He served in World War II and
when he became a brigadier general at age 33, he was the youngest
ranking general in all the armed forces. He later was promoted to
major general, his rank at retirement in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   Following his military career, Luedecke became general manager
of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission for almost five years,
participating in the successful launches of the Voyager and
Surveyor spacecraft missions. The agency eventually became the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Luedecke returned to his alma mater _ Texas A&AMP;M
University, where he received a degree in chemical engineering in
1932 _ as acting president following the death of Gen. Earl Rudder.
He stayed on as an administrator for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Luedecke retired to San Antonio two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a masterful job of leading A&AMP;M. He was an effective and
quiet leader who led by example,'' said Lane Stephenson, deputy
director of university relations at Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved A&AMP;M. He didn't need the job; he just wanted to come
back,'' Stephenson added.
</P>
<P>
   Alvin R. Luedecke Jr. of Austin admired his father for the way
the achieved his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important to realize that he started in West
Texas, the son of a ranch-farmer and had a pretty rough time with
some lean years,'' the son said. ``He was the eldest of eight
children. He had to learn a lot on his own because there were so
many people around.''

   ``He was a true leader of men. The integrity and work ethic of
his parents was passed on to him,'' his son added.
</P>
<P>
   Luedecke said he remembers most the respect his father garnered
in the numerous careers he undertook. ``Whatever job he had, the
one consistency was that all those who worked for him respected
him.''
</P>
<P>
   This earned the general the motto ``Man of patience made of
steel,'' which his son coined after years of witnessing what he
called his father's ``gentleness and strengths.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Luedecke spent the last years of his retirement in San
Antonio, struggling with the loss of his sight and hearing. ``It
was frustrating for him, but he was alert and sharp, and full of
life,'' the son said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the son, the general is survived by his wife
Isabelle; two daughters, Jan Lee Maynard of Littleton, Colo., and
Miriam Luedecke of Loveland, Colo.; six sisters; three
grandchildren and one great-grandchild; three step-children and two
step-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Services are scheduled Friday at Fort Sam Houston National
Cemetery in San Antonio.

LAWSUIT ACCUSES PHONE COMPANY OF `HIDING' VOICE MAIL FEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SETH ROSENFELD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Pacific Bell allegedly charged hundreds of
thousands of customers a hidden fee for every message on their
voice mail service, a lawsuit says.
</P>
<P>
   The class-action complaint, filed Tuesday in San Francisco
Superior Court, accuses the telephone company of deceptively
advertising the Voice Mail service it sells small business
customers by failing to explain that they are charged the price of
a local call each time they get a message.
</P>
<P>
   The local charges are disguised on the bill, the lawsuit says,
because they are not listed under Voice Mail services but merged
with regular local calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a hidden charge here,'' said Terry Gross, a San
Francisco lawyer who specializes in bringing class-action lawsuits.
``Pac Bell has led customers to believe there is one all-inclusive
charge for the Voice Mail service, hiding the fact that there is a
per-call charge for each message received.''
</P>
<P>
   Gross said the average business customer easily could be
``overcharged'' hundreds of dollars a year in such costs.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Cohen, a Pacific Bell spokesman, declined to comment on the
lawsuit. He said the Voice Mail service has about 500,000 customers
statewide, and ``it's one of our hottest selling products.''
</P>
<P>
   The service is marketed at $21.95 per month. It is separate from
Pacific Bell's Message Center, a voice mail service sold to home
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit accuses San Francisco-based Pacific Bell of engaging
in false advertising, unfair competition and violations of consumer
protection laws.
</P>
<P>
   The class action was brought by three plaintiffs _ from
Berkeley, Oakland and San Diego _ who filed it on behalf of all
``similarly situated'' Pacific Bell Voice Mail customers.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint asks the court to bar the telephone company from
engaging in the allegedly improper advertising practices and to
order the company to repay any hidden charges.
</P>
<P>
   Local telephone companies around the country recently have come
under pressure from the Federal Communications Commission to stem
unauthorized billings, a practice known as ``cramming.''
</P>
<P>
   In most of these cases, however, the issue was not phone company
charges but ones from third parties _ like call waiting or Internet
access companies _ that are included on the phone bill.

FOLKS WHO LOVE TO EAT, LIVE TO WRITE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the introduction to ``Stirring Prose, Cooking With Texas
Authors'' ($19.95, Texas A&AMP;M Press), author Deborah Douglas
basically explains that she has no business writing the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, I don't enjoy eating all that much,'' she writes. ``I
eat mainly because I don't like to go hungry. If someone would only
invent them, I would gladly swallow pills labeled `Breakfast,'
`Dinner' and `Supper.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, no one has. To fill the pages of this book she had
no business writing, Douglas (who is a pathologist, I guess it
should be noted, although I'm not sure why) went to a host of
writers around the state and asked them for a few of their favorite
recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you can't ask a bunch of writers for a simple recipe.
What Douglas got is a book full of essays. It is what she hoped for
all along.
</P>
<P>
   ``By asking authors to write about something as familiar as
their favorite recipes, they were freed from the big toe-digging
constraints of having to talk directly about themselves,'' she
writes. ``The resulting off-center reflections are brilliant slices
of their personalities and their writing styles.''
</P>
<P>
   One more small note: Douglas knows that it was her
responsibility to test the recipes, to make sure the ingredients
and their amounts were correct. She didn't. She's not much of a
proofreader, she acknowledges, so the numbers might not be all that
accurate. And she tried only one finished product.
</P>
<P>
   It was Larry L. King's remedy for Asian flu.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only did it not cure the flu, but I woke up with a
horrendous headache, trembling hands, bloodshot eyes, churning
stomach and a surly outlook,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That was the end of her testing. She warns: ``Eat and drink at
your own risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-nine writers contributed to ``Stirring Prose,'' and not
all of their recipes are debilitating. Some aren't even for food _
such as King's _ and some are for foods you aren't likely to fix.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Flores offers a recipe for a 2-pound buffalo tenderloin.
Robert Flynn has a stew that calls for 2 pounds of diced lion.
</P>
<P>
   John Graves presents an ideal sandwich. It calls for peanut
butter on one slice of the bread and mayonnaise on the other. Add
fresh buttercrunch lettuce, slices of Big Boy or Better Boy
tomatoes and several thick slices of the ``old, true, dry-cured,
smokehouse kind'' of bacon. The sandwich can be embellished, he
says, with a hard-fried egg, or slivers of fresh green jalapeno,
seeds attached.
</P>
<P>
   James Ward Lee begins his recipe for neck bones and liver with:
``Kill a hog and take the liver on in the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee warns, unnecessarily, that we won't find a can of mushroom
soup or a ``ten-ounce package of frozen broccoli,'' in any of his
recipes.
</P>
<P>
   It is obvious in ``Stirring Prose'' that good, everyday recipes
are somewhat accidental, although there are quite a few. What
Douglas was looking for was how people felt about cooking; what
kind of emotions cooking evoked from them.
</P>
<P>
   She got a lot of history, a lot of folklore and a lot of special
remembrances. Sunny Nash remembered her grandmother, Bigmama, and
Bigmama's mysterious rose-water splash.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandmother told me, `No matter how awkwardly your features
are arranged on your face or what color the skin on your face may
be, if the skin on your face is flawless, then your face is
divine.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Nash remembered that about once a month in the spring and
summer, her family kitchen became a laboratory for ``rose-water
splashes, sudsy complexion bars and herbal treatments for problem
skin, nails, and scalps.''
</P>
<P>
   Bigmama's recipe for rose-water splash: Take the petals of one
medium to large rose, 2 cups tap water, and 1/4 cup of clear
rubbing alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   In a small saucepan, bring water to a boil. Drop rose petals
into boiling water. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 10 minutes.
Remove from heat. Allow to cool before stirring in the alcohol.
Store in a cool place in glass bottles with lids, stoppers or
corks.
</P>
<P>
   Nash says that the recipe can be doubled, tripled or quadrupled.
She suggests placing a rosebud or a fresh petal in the bottle to
indicate what color flower the rose water was extracted from.
</P>
<P>
   Nash writes that no one she knew, growing up in Bryan, could
afford to buy cosmetics; they made their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The women who lived along the narrow dirt roads of my
neighborhood did their laundry in the back yard by hand in a tub
with a rub-board and homemade soap. These women, though, had a
soft, sultry beauty that was matched only by the grace with which
they went about their unfortunate lives.''

TEED OFF: HOW GOLFERS CAN KEEP THEIR COOL WHEN TEMPERS FLARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN IWASAKI  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sudden death in golf may not always mean a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Wozeniak, head pro at Interbay Family Golf Center in
Seattle, has heard tales of players who have died after angrily
breaking their clubs, only to have a jagged shaft snap back and
pierce an artery.
</P>
<P>
   While that might be merely a chilling bit of golf lore, there's
little question that many players are mad about golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had clients destroy tee markers _ just smash 'em _ break
clubs over their knees, stomp their putters,'' said Deborah Graham,
a Texas sports psychologist who works with more than 100 touring
pros, including some playing in this week's PGA Championship at
Redmond's Sahalee Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've seen that commercial where a player heaves his whole
bag into the lake? That's happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Helping everyone from weekend hackers to the world's best
golfers to tee off without being teed off is part of the job of
instructors and sports psychologists, who say emotional stability
is a key to a successful game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golf is a sport where there's very little release of tension
and emotion,'' said Graham, whose clients play on the PGA, LPGA,
Senior PGA and Nike tours. ``Those things have an outlet in contact
sports or in sports where you're moving at an active pace or
reacting to a moving ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``In golf, you have a lot of time to think. And the ball is just
sitting there.''
</P>
<P>
   Redmond pro golfer Rick Fehr, who is considered to be a
gentleman on and off the PGA Tour, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   NBA players can bang bodies as they battle for a rebound or
basket, he said, and frustrated athletes in team sports kick water
coolers. But outbursts stand out in golf, a game of decorum and
etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been there before,'' Fehr said sheepishly. ``Sometimes
you do something childish and immature. I'm not sure golfers are
more guilty of this than others. But maybe we're more visible.''
</P>
<P>
   John Daly, a long hitter with a short temper, broke his 5-iron
en route to one of his three double bogies during the third round
of the St. Jude Classic in Memphis earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   While the tales Wozeniak has heard about golfers accidentally
killing themselves may be more myth than fact _ a computer search
of newspaper files across the country found no cases of such
self-inflicted deaths or injuries _ stories of literal weekend
warriors abound.
</P>
<P>
   They include the reported death of a Wisconsin golfer in 1996
after a fight triggered by accusations of slow play.
</P>
<P>
   And the time in 1994 when an Ohio golfer fractured the skull of
a player with a club after a disagreement over whose group was to
tee off first. Two years later, another Ohio golfer broke the nose
of a player in a slow-moving foursome, which included a pregnant
woman.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a Pennsylvania golfer was convicted of punching a
tournament official in the face after shooting a quadruple bogey.
</P>
<P>
   The violent outbursts suggest that the aggressors may have
problems dealing with anger anywhere, not just on the course. But
even more typical expressions of frustration, such as tossing
clubs, may not be directly linked to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very often, the anger you see on the golf course has other
roots,'' Graham said. ``Very often it's suppressed anger about a
frustrating work situation, financial problems, family problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other individual sports, golf tends to attract those who
``may be a little more competitive and self-reliant, but it also
puts players in the position of being very critical of
themselves,'' said Jim Bauman, a sports psychologist at Washington
State University.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty is getting players not to dwell on past mistakes
or look too far ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell golfers, you never play the last shot. You never play
the next shot. You play one shot at a time, period,'' Bauman said.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, who evaluates the personalities of her clients and tries
to help them emulate the mental traits of champions, says those who
are used to being in command often find themselves at the mercy of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go out and try to control golf, you get into trouble,
because you can't,'' she said. ``Perfectionists can go berserk out
there. The harder he tries, the worse it gets. Golf is a game where
you've got to let it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Wozeniak likewise strives to induce steady play from his
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to get across to people that even the best golfers in
the world don't hit the shots that they want to all day long,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way you play best is at an even keel. If you hit a bad
shot, well, you just go from there. That's hard to do. That's why
there are so few great golfers. You can't tell if they're shooting
good or an 80.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Krueger, associate chaplain for the Tour Bible Study, a
Christian ministry to the PGA Tour, said pro golfers are marked by
an intense drive to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they fall short _ and this applies to the weekend golfer
as well _ they throw clubs, get sullen, withdraw,'' he said. ``I
find that the guys who are better able to handle the crisis moment
are the guys who excel.
</P>
<P>
   ``They realize they're going to hit some bad shots. They don't
let that tank them mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the average golfer who gets ticked off after topping the
third ball in a row, dealing with failure on the course is part of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia sports psychologist Bob Rotella, a consultant to PGA
golfers and other athletes, said the most frustrated players are
amateurs ``who never practice, play once a week, don't have any
skills and should not have any business expecting to play par golf.
They miss a shot and go ballistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing an extreme case, Graham recalled her horror as an
amateur client, upset over his play, bloodied himself by striking
his head with his club. She also heard of a Southwest golfer who
punished himself by plunging into a cactus.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are bordering on self-destructive tendencies,''
Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   To help the typical golfers deal with stress, instructors and
sports psychologists prescribe mental exercises or visual
reminders.
</P>
<P>
   Bauman tells college players to jot down positive thoughts on
cards and tote them in their golf bags. A card might describe a
special place or victory, a reminder of a time when the player was
in control.
</P>
<P>
   He also uses humor as a ``positive distraction,'' suggesting
that players carry a favorite cartoon or look at smiley faces that
they've drawn on the toes of their shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's clients might shred a leaf when under duress,
visualizing the release of anger.
</P>
<P>
   Wozeniak advises students to ``take a step back and breathe
deeply a few times before you get to the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Rotella put the issue of dealing with adversity in perspective
in his 1995 book, ``Golf is Not a Game of Perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Golfers must learn to love the challenge when they hit a ball
into the rough, trees or sand,'' Rotella wrote. ``The alternatives
_ anger, fear, whining and cheating _ do no good.''

SEN. GORTON PERSONALLY GOES FISHING FOR A POLLOCK AGREEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Next Tuesday, U.S. Sen. Slade Gorton will preside over
a peace conference among the entrepreneurs of pollock. Fisher men
and women, owners of factory trawlers, catcher boats, mother ships
and shore plants in Alaska will crowd into a room at Davis Wright
Tremaine law offices and have at it. No environmentalists are
invited _ and no media.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton, R-Wash., hopes to find some formula to reduce the number
of boats, especially the factory trawlers. One imagines something
like the London Naval Treaty of 1921, which called for the
scrapping of dreadnoughts and set the ratio of capital ships in the
British, American and Japanese navies at 5:5:3. No one disputes
that a similar disarmament is needed in America's highest volume
fishery, in which seasons have shrunk to just 70 days a year. The
question is how to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, fired the opening salvo a year ago
with his American Fisheries Act (S. 1221). His bill targets 18 big
boats rebuilt a decade ago in Norwegian yards or that are owned by
Norwegians. It declares its intent to ``Americanize'' the fishery,
and ejects the boats without compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton took umbrage at this, which is not surprising in that the
boats are based in Washington state. When Stevens, who chairs the
Appropriations Committee, said he would attach S. 1221 to a money
bill, Gorton threatened to filibuster it. Talking a bill to death
is not a usual Gorton tactic. Stevens agreed to let Gorton try to
work out a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides cheered. The American Fisheries Act Coalition
(www.usafish.org) was happy that Gorton had agreed to the idea of
retiring boats. The companies targeted by Stevens
(www.fairfishlaws.org) were happy that Gorton had insisted that all
sides agree that ``all present participants in the fishery are in
it legally'' and that any reduction in boats ``be done in a manner
that recognizes the economic interests of all.''
</P>
<P>
   The pro-Stevens side may try to sell Gorton on a boat buyback.
Some compensation might be possible to owners of kicked-out boats,
said maritime attorney Terry Leitzell, vice president of Victor
Seafoods. But he said the foreign-built boats have to go. That, he
said, ``is clearly Sen. Stevens' issue, and we're not in a position
to negotiate it away.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with a buyback is who pays. ``I don't think the
government is going to put down money to buy factory trawlers,''
said one boat company boss.
</P>
<P>
   The At-sea Processors Association, which represents most of the
factory trawlers, is pushing for a co-op. The fish are now
allocated among three groups _ at-sea processors, on-shore
processors and Alaskan villages. The association's proposal would
split off the mother ships, leaving just seven factory-trawler
companies _ few enough to divvy up the fish by private agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The result would be a system of individual fishing quotas
(IFQs), which boat owners have been lobbying for since the early
'90s. A formal quota is virtually a property right on the fish.
This would be something less than that, an informal quota. But in a
common-property world, even an informal drawing of fences can pay
dividends.
</P>
<P>
   Four companies _ American Seafoods, Tyson, Alaska Ocean and
Glacier Fish _ have done it already in the whiting fishery off the
Oregon coast. The result, said Glacier's manager, John Bundy, has
been that skippers have slowed down, reduced the catch of unwanted
species, increased the quality of the product and stayed in the
black. And because there was no race for fish, the harvest was done
by seven boats instead of 10.
</P>
<P>
   That's a 30 percent reduction in boats. The same plan could cut
the number of factory trawlers in the Bering Sea by 20 percent, the
At-sea Processors Association says.
</P>
<P>
   How about that? Not likely, says Leitzell: ``They get all the
operational benefits of an IFQ, and we don't. We're sitting at the
back of the truck.'' Leitzell likes individual quotas, though some
in his coalition don't. But he says: Reduce the number of boats
first.
</P>
<P>
   How to entice boats to leave? ``I don't know,'' he says. The
Stevens approach has not been to entice them to leave; it has been
to force them to leave.
</P>
<P>
   It will take a miracle for Gorton to fashion a consensus from
this. A deal is possible on one issue, though: nationality. ``We
wouldn't oppose a U.S. ownership requirement,'' said Bernt Bodal,
chief executive of American Seafoods, which is owned by Aker/RGI
Group of Oslo, Norway. ``We are willing to work practically to get
something in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Bodal's boss, Hjell Rokke, was in Seattle a few weeks ago. Bodal
would not confirm it, but several sources said Rokke talked with
representatives of Alaskan villages, which have bought interests in
other factory trawlers. They don't have the cash to buy American's
fleet, but politically they would be unassailable.
</P>
<P>
   And in fish, politics counts for a lot.

MAJORS WIN ENSURES A PLACE IN HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ It can be a major burden or a major relief.
</P>
<P>
   Winning one of golf's four coveted major titles can validate and
enhance an entire career or make every other regular PGA Tour event
and life in general seem slightly less significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rather win two majors and no other tournaments,'' said
Fred Couples, who won the 1992 Masters.
</P>
<P>
   The victory at Augusta earned Couples superstar status, but then
there are those whom Couples says ``fell off the turnip truck.''
</P>
<P>
   Players such as Corey Pavin, who won the 1995 U.S. Open but has
only one other tournament victory since. Last year, his best finish
on the Tour was a tie for eighth at the Mercedes Championships, his
only top 10 finish.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing can take away the importance of winning a major.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win a major championship is a very big deal,'' Pavin said.
``I knew I was capable of doing it and it would have been a missed
opportunity if I didn't get one. I wouldn't mind getting a few
more. I feel there is more out there for me to win.''
</P>
<P>
   But winning a major creates undue expectations from fans and the
media that the feat can be accomplished more than once.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really can't go into them expecting that you are going to
win them,'' Pavin said. ``There is a lot of luck involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning the first major is the key, even if it is the only one.
It gives players a sense that they have etched their name in the
history books.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Mark O'Meara is the latest to make history, winning
the Masters and the British Open after playing on the tour for 18
years _ 56 majors _ before breaking through. Up until this year, he
always had been known as one of the top performers on the PGA Tour
to have never won a major event.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win a major championship was a dream come true for me,''
O'Meara said upon winning the Masters. ``Hopefully (the win), put a
lot of that stuff to rest. When I come in the press room, people
won't say how you haven't won a major championship. I've got that
under my belt.''
</P>
<P>
   The list of top golfers to have never won a major title includes
David Duval, who is the winningest player on the PGA Tour over the
past year, with victories in five regular tour events. He finished
second at the Masters, seventh at the U.S. Open and 11th at the
British Open. He feels that he's close to a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be extremely special,'' Duval said of the possibility
that he could win his first major at the PGA Championship this week
at Sahalee Country Club in Redmond. ``It would certainly put a nice
asterisk next to what has been a good year for me and build on last
year, which was a very good year as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Others in the same category are Phil Mickelson (28 years old, 12
tour wins but no majors) and Jim Furyk (28 years old, two Tour
wins, no majors). Then there are those who feel that time is
catching up with them, such as Scotland's Colin Montgomerie (35
years old, 17 tournament wins and no majors).
</P>
<P>
   At age 26, Duval believes that time is on his side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't particularly feel any additional pressure right now,''
he said. ``If I have a couple more close calls where it doesn't
quite work out my way, then I might start to feel a little more
pressure. This is certainly one of the four events that you aim for
through the course of the year ... so it certainly would be a great
crowning moment of the year and probably for my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick Price, a native of South Africa, has worn that crown three
times in the past seven years, winning the 1992 and 1994 PGA
Championships, along with the 1994 British Open. It took him nearly
a decade of toiling on the PGA and European tours before he broke
through.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me at the age of 35, it did take a little bit of a monkey
off of my back,'' he said of his first PGA win. ``But let's look at
it in another light; it enhanced my career. The second one did a
little more and the third one even made it better.''
</P>
<P>
   Price believes the PGA Championships are as important as any of
the other three major tournaments because the PGA draws the best
and toughest field of golfers from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   He also likes the fact that the PGA moves its tournament to
different courses across the country, and feels proud to have won
the event at two vastly different courses: Bellerive Country Club
in St. Louis and Southern Hills Country Club in Tulsa, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hat's off to the PGA for being adventurous and trying new
golf courses,'' he said. ``If we didn't, we'd just be playing the
same courses year in and year out.''
</P>
<P>
   When he won last year's PGA Championship at Winged Foot in New
York, his first major after 11 years on the Tour, Davis Love III
called it the most important moment of his life. Even though he's
struggled this year because of back spasms, he'll never have to
answer questions about why he can't win a major.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know every time I play, I have a little more confidence
because of my win at Winged Foot,'' Love said. ``. . . I'll always
enjoy being called the PGA champion.''

GOLFER JOHN DALY IS A MAN FOR THE MASSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ It was Davis Love's turn, but John Daly wanted
to hit one more ball. After walloping drives in conventional
fashion with his unorthodox swing, Daly decided to tee up another,
this time on top of an Aquafina water bottle.
</P>
<P>
   There he stood, John Daly in front of the world again at
Tuesday's PGA champions clinic, showing his playful side. With a
loud thwack, Daly's steel-headed Callaway driver simultaneously
smacked the plastic bottle and balata ball, the impact sending
every dimple over the driving-range fence.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be when Daly wanted to take another shot, he would
ask the bartender to pour him one.
</P>
<P>
   For almost a year and a half, in his second courtship with
sobriety, Daly has been dry. His life, as errant as some of his
drives, now revolves around the ordinary. Daly has found that the
purest pleasures come from his two daughters and a reunion with his
third ex-wife.
</P>
<P>
   With Daly you rarely get the mundane snippets of his everyday
existence because he continues to pack more shrill than monotone.
</P>
<P>
   When he gets an 18 on a hole at Bay Hill, you can't figure it
out. When he rolls a 10 on the final hole at the British Open to
miss the cut, you wonder. When he busts his 5-iron and doesn't sign
his scorecard in Memphis, you hear the whispers like the ones from
a Sahalee volunteer: ``Is he back on the sauce?''
</P>
<P>
   No he's not. But Daly admitted Tuesday he still has the urge,
fighting the obsessive tendencies, realizing the glitches will be
perceived as setbacks, hoping everyone understands.
</P>
<P>
   The incident in Memphis disturbs him. It was typical John Daly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a lot of things with John, it was one step back, two
steps forward,'' said Donnie Crabtree, one of his longtime friends.
``He doesn't want to get back into the thing of: `It's the same old
John again.'''
</P>
<P>
   The temporary lapse could lead to long-term implications.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good example of what he shouldn't do,'' said Ely
Callaway.
</P>
<P>
   Daly used to walk out of Las Vegas casinos $250,000 up or
$250,000 down before Callaway gambled on him. During Daly's days of
liquor-fueled mishaps, Wilson dropped its $10 million contract with
him. Ely Callaway, who heads the Big Bertha club-making giant,
decided to take a flyer on a volatile investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He decided he wanted to live and capitalize on his talent in
golf,'' Callaway said. ``We knew if he could do that and stop
drinking, he would be a tremendous attraction because of his
appeal. Fans have a basic empathy for him, a connection even though
they don't know him. He's a very lovable character because of his
problems. We weren't gambling. He was the one gambling _ with his
life.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, Daly is the straight and Sahalee is the narrow. There
is evidence he has changed. He grinded it out at the Bob Hope
Classic, firing a 67 on Friday even when he had no hope of making
the cut.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Tour is not the cocktail circuit anymore. His saying
used to be: ``One's too many and 100 ain't enough.'' He will attend
Alcoholics Anonymous meetings while he is here.
</P>
<P>
   His difficulties with alcohol, his publicized nut-outs, his
numerous divorces have somehow endeared him to galleries who first
embraced Daly when he was the nobody who won the PGA Championship
in 1991 at Crooked Stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of who he is, the average person can relate to him,''
said Crabtree. ``He's not as far removed from some of the fans as
other professional golfers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am one of them,'' Daly said.
</P>
<P>
   In every way but one. Daly routinely launches 300-yard drives
and on one occasion reached the 630-yard uphill 17th hole at
Baltusrol in two with a driver and 1-iron.
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's clinic, he wound up and delivered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hit it hard,'' said Lanny Wadkins, the clinic's emcee. ``They
want to see the big boy one time. These people are not concerned
with accuracy right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly obliged with shots that skied as high as a 9-iron but went
so far they disappeared in the distance, right where he hopes his
past will go.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently _ because you never know with him _ a new Daly has
emerged, one who is rekindling his relationship with Paulette, his
former wife, and enjoying fatherhood.
</P>
<P>
   Shynah, his 6-year-old daughter from a previous marriage, lives
in Orlando, but Daly spent Monday with her in New York at a
tournament raising money for breast cancer. Daly made some
left-handed clubs for her, and she tagged along, hitting shots and
hanging out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just wonderful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then when he is home with Paulette, he likes to take their
3-year-old daughter Sierra to Chuck E. Cheese. ``She just loves
that place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   John Daly, a family man who seems to be ordering off the menu
instead of sampling the whole buffet. Even his appetite is
suppressed, Daly having lost 20 pounds, substituting Diet Coke for
Coke and evidently reducing those cravings for chocolate frozen
yogurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything in my life is perfect now,'' Daly said. ``But life
is a struggle. Every day is not always a great day. I'm learning
you can turn a bad day into a good day.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he has no hope at Sahalee, given the confined surroundings
and his occasionally wayward game. It bothers the competitor in him
that he has not won since 1995 at the British Open. The frustration
shows despite encouragement from his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he forgets that drive he took one night in Colorado
when Crabtree had to talk him out of careening off a cliff,
speeding along at 140 mph, contemplating suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Daly has finally slowed down and is trying to catch up again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'm so used to adversity that my game has gone to
crap,'' Daly said. ``I don't know, maybe my life's too good.''

LEHMAN: NO. 11 HOLE AT SAHALEE IS `BRUTAL' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ If Sahalee Country Club was an otherwise
spotless windshield, the 11th hole would be its small crack. Or
bug.
</P>
<P>
   Five hundred and forty-six yards of real estate. Turns to the
left. Finishes in a forest. Looks like a slalom course.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four hours from teeing it up for real, Sahalee largely
has passed inspection as host of the PGA Championship. The weather
and setting have drawn raves. The greens and enthusiasm have rated
a thumbs-up.
</P>
<P>
   Compliments stop once players journey down No. 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's 17 great holes and one brutal one,'' Tom Lehman says.
``I wouldn't even call it average _ because that hole is brutal.''
</P>
<P>
   Two maple trees guard the green to the right, two fir trees
shadow it to the left. The par-5 has a goalpost look on final
approach. Making matters worse, there's yet another wide-bodied
tree stuck in the middle of the fairway, 90 yards out. Somewhere in
the middle of all this flora and fauna, a flag sticks out.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Kite ricocheted a shot off a greenside limb on No. 11
Tuesday and dropped another ball in the fairway. He hit the trees
again. Duffy Waldorf sent two into wooded oblivion. Steve Jones
plunked one off the natural barricade. As did Fred Couples the day
before. As did nearly every other golfer brave enough _ or
foolhardy _ to try and reach the putting surface in the minimum
number of shots.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th is the first thing fans see when they jump off their
shuttle bus and enter the grounds; it's the last thing the golfers
want to look at.
</P>
<P>
   Roll an 11 in craps, and everybody's a winner. Do it at Sahalee,
and everybody ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Joey Sindelar was one of the few players who landed a second
shot on the 11th green Tuesday. You wouldn't know it by talking to
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little confused,'' he said. ``I have to have another
look at it.'' Finally, Sindelar concluded, ``It's not what I would
do if it was my hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Haas diplomatically called the 11th unique. Jim Furyk
described it as interesting. Ask any pro about the hole, and a slow
smile creeps across his face. Let us play through unimpeded, these
guys plead.
</P>
<P>
   Trees smack in the middle of fairways are fairly unique at
upscale golf layouts. Stanford Golf Club has one. Los Angeles
Country Club has one. Preston Trails in the Dallas area has one.
Sahalee is the leader in this clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking one, we're talking four,'' Sindelar said.
``You can play around one, strategize around two. But you have a
bunch of them. We'll try to birdie it somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   To obtain the PGA Championship, Sahalee agreed to remove 400
trees from the course, including a couple stuck inside bunkers.
Apparently there was a strong enough argument to save the trees
bordering No. 11, particularly the proud, leafy one blanketing the
right side of the green.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would cry if they cut down that maple tree on that hole,''
said Carl Taylor, Sahalee grounds crew member. ``It's a par-5. They
don't have to get there in two.''
</P>
<P>
   On the tour, there is always the occasional maverick who breaks
from popular opinion. Heading the committee supporting Initiative
11 is Ernie Els.
</P>
<P>
   He actually likes the testy par-5. He reached it in two shots
the first time he tried it, using a driver and 2-iron.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great hole,'' Els said. ``It's not easy. But
that's just design. We don't play on golf courses with these kind
of trees. I wouldn't want to take any of these trees out. They're
too nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Payne Stewart: ``I don't mind the 11th hole at all. But as
I say that, it might jump up and bite me.''
</P>
<P>
   Do I go for it in two or lay up?
</P>
<P>
   It's the type of obstacle, not conservative play, that has the
tour players grumbling. They're used to avoiding lakes and creeks
with half swings. Backing off from trees is not their nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was up to me,'' Lehman said, ``I'd take a chain saw to
it.''

MAKAH HUNT FOR WHALING HERITAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 (WITH WHALES-HISTORY)  
 By PAUL SHUKOVSKY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEAH BAY, Wash. _ Micah McCarty rises with the sun and slips
into the chilly waters of Waatch River, just upstream from the
untamed edge of the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   With each stroke, he mimics the movement of the whale he hopes
to slay this fall with a hand-carved wooden harpoon. And he prays
that the gray whale will be ``a kind brother or sister.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarty is preparing himself for the Makah tribe's first whale
hunt in more than seven decades. He hopes it will renew the Olympic
Peninsula tribe's spirit and traditions. Opponents call the hunt
butchery, saying it has no place in a modern world where whales are
protected by international law.
</P>
<P>
   McCarty wants to be the ``chosen one.''
</P>
<P>
   The harpooner will stand in a dugout canoe, steady himself
against 10-foot Pacific swells, heft the barbed lance, take aim and
plunge it into the back of a 38-foot leviathan.
</P>
<P>
   The kill will be a sacred moment for the Makah, honoring the
great whale. But the eight men in the canoe _ keepers of a ritual
dating back at least 100 generations _ will be encircled by an
armada of outraged animal rights activists, a swarm of
international media and a thin phalanx of security.
</P>
<P>
   The hunt's notoriety stems from a controversial decision by the
International Whaling Commission that granted the Makah the right
to kill up to 20 whales through 2002. Animal rights activists fear
the hunt will spark a wholesale return to commercial whaling,
presently banned by the commission.
</P>
<P>
   But as the 27-year-old McCarty runs barefoot along Hobuck Beach,
he does not think about the global forces aligned against the 1,800
people living in his fishing village. Instead, he meditates and
prays to make his spirit pure to receive the whale, ``an honored
guest of the village.''
</P>
<P>
   He anchors his feet in the sand of the beach and heaves hunks of
driftwood in hopes of being chosen the harpooner.
</P>
<P>
   McCarty is one of 16 men selected by Makah families to compete
for eight spots on the first tribal whaling crew since the 1920s.
He feels the excitement building on this 44-square-mile reservation
of heavily logged rain forest and spectacular wilderness beach
located at the extreme northwest tip of the contiguous United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The return to whaling will be a sort of homecoming for the
Makah, whose real name _ which cannot be written in English _ means
``people who live by the rocks and the seagulls.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarty comes from a long line of whalers. His grandfather and
great-grandfather participated in the last hunts before whaling was
suspended, because gray whales had been stalked almost to
extinction by non-Indian whalers. McCarty's father, John, until
recently was executive director of the tribe's whaling commission.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from high school in Olympia, Micah McCarty came
home to Neah Bay and immersed himself in the maritime life, working
with his father as a commercial fisherman. ``It became a passionate
connection with the waters my ancestors plied,'' McCarty said.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Makah whalers before him, McCarty prepares by purifying
himself in frigid streams such as the Waatch River. ``We look upon
the water as its own being,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While bathing, McCarty said he ``thinks about the whale moving
gracefully through the water, and I swim as gracefully as I can.
... And I pray that our whale crew will be one mind, one body, one
spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Historically, secrecy guarded every aspect of Makah whaling from
the hunt to the communal butchering and feasting, according to
anthropological texts. Tribal members today remain guarded about
saying too much about the hunt to outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is usually taboo to even talk about,'' McCarty said.
``Usually, you just prepare yourself and go whaling.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarty, like his father and the rest of the tribe, is acutely
aware of the international controversy surrounding this fall's
hunt. ``In this day and age, it's important to say something about
it,'' McCarty said.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate that whaling still defines the fabric of Makah
life, McCarty shares a few words from sacred whaling songs that
have been passed down from generation to generation and are still
sung today.
</P>
<P>
   One song says ``my canoe travels with killer whales as an
escort,'' and another says ``my canoe travels with lightning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I might get in trouble for telling you that, but it's not a
direct translation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCarty said he has wanted to hunt whales for a long time, long
before they became news to the outside world. An accomplished
carver whose art is sold at a shop called Tribes in Fremont,
McCarty frequently creates masks that call upon spirits related to
whaling and the sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I learned about our oral history, some of the songs and
dances we do, my artwork took on more meaning about who we are and
where we come from.''
</P>
<P>
   The other whalers said McCarty and crew member Darrell
Markishtum frequently lead them in ancient paddle songs as they
practice stealth and speed in the red and black dugout canoe called
the Hummingbird.
</P>
<P>
   ``The songs keep your mind off the pain'' of paddling for hours,
said Don Swan, a powerfully built man who, like McCarty, would like
to be the ``chosen one'' to heft the harpoon.
</P>
<P>
   Neah Bay, like many other Native American communities, is
struggling with unemployment rates often exceeding 50 percent, deep
poverty and the problems of crime, drug and alcohol abuse and
domestic violence. McCarty hopes the return to whaling will provide
inspiration and a new focus for the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a sacred way of life that sets an honorable example,''
he said. Whaling ``involves so much concentration, so much
preparation, that anyone who was involved in that lifestyle
(substance abuse or violence) would have to drop it.''
</P>
<P>
   On a rare sunny spring day, McCarty and seven other members of
the crew boarded the 34-foot Hummingbird for paddle practice.
</P>
<P>
   A motorized chase boat skippered by whale commissioner Arnie
Hunter trailed the canoe. Nine-year-old Eric Johnson Jr. sat near
Hunter and stared at his dad paddling in the stern. In the
background, a fog horn on Waadah Island played a haunting, two-note
tune.
</P>
<P>
   Eric would like to be a whaler someday. ``Yeah, I'm thinking
about getting some barbells with 10-pound weights,'' he said,
becoming very serious. ``I think I would want to be the harpooner.
If you're the harpooner, you have to have a lot of strength so you
can stick it in the whale.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really want to take after my ancestors,'' said Eric, one
small example of how whaling may infuse a new generation of Makah
with the old values that existed before anyone had heard of
unemployment or Jim Beam.
</P>
<P>
   Arnie Hunter let up on the throttle and the canoe came
alongside. The men passed little Eric between boats. As he
scrambled into the bow of the dugout canoe, a luminous smile
transformed his serious face.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting a couple of feet from Eric was Wayne Johnson cradling a
.50-caliber military rifle designed to penetrate armor. It will
deliver the coupe de grace once the whale is harpooned, explained
Johnson, hefting the weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The rifle is one of the concessions to the 20th century made by
the Makah. The International Whaling Commission insists on a quick
kill. Says McCarty: ``They want us to do a humane kill. That
necessitates a quick and efficient method of ushering the whale to
the next world. I believe it to be an honorable alteration to a
sacred way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   But Makah elder Alberta Thompson disapproves not only of the
gun, but also of the hunt itself. ``What are we building our
culture on by going after something we don't want to eat?'' she
asked.
</P>
<P>
   That a few elders in the Neah Bay community have publicly
opposed the tribe's return to whaling has been used by opponents of
the hunt in an attempt to discredit the tribal leadership as not
representing the will of the people.
</P>
<P>
   But people in Neah Bay point out that Native American
communities do not have a single, monolithic viewpoint any more
than other communities.
</P>
<P>
   John McCarty also notes that in December's tribal council
election, two men who support resurrecting whaling _ Ben Johnson
Jr. and Keith Johnson _ were voted into office.
</P>
<P>
   But resurrecting whaling skills that have been dormant for more
than 70 years is a daunting challenge. So the Makah are turning for
advice to other indigenous whalers.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of the Makah Whaling Commission and whaling crew
traveled this winter to Barrow, Alaska, for the native whaling
captains convention. They attended seminars on topics such as
effective kill techniques used by the few indigenous tribes still
allowed to hunt by the International Whaling Commission. The tribe
is also considering sending a couple of Makah women to Alaska to
learn recipes for preparing whale meat and blubber, said Keith
Johnson, president of the tribal whaling commission.
</P>
<P>
   The whaling crew members are also training together. They run
together on the beach and take communal sweats in a lodge they
built behind Arnie Hunter's trailer. The young men are learning to
function as a team, said rifleman Wayne Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The crew training includes paddling into the Pacific to practice
``sneaking up and backing off'' whales, said McCarty.
</P>
<P>
   But many training methods will not be shared with the outside
world. For example, beginning with the first day of a new moon, the
nascent whalers will do a ``special type of training,'' said
McCarty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four new moons prior to the hunt will be the countdown,'' said
McCarty without offering further explanation.
</P>
<P>
   A big part of what whaling is about for these tribal people is
the bridge it creates between generations. For example, John
McCarty heard whaling stories from his father and told them to son
Micah.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Makah Bay, they harpooned this whale, a big bull,'' said
John McCarty, recounting the tale he heard from his father. ``He
was big enough and strong enough that they couldn't get close
enough to give him another harpoon. He went straight out to sea
(dragging the canoe by the harpoon tether).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one fierce ride. The whale was relentless; the toughest
whale they had ever seen. They looked back and Cheeka Peak was just
a tiny bump. They gave up, cut him loose, lost their harpoon and
floats. Fortunately, there was a west wind, so they set sail and
headed home. The guys were so exhausted they were laying on the
bottom of the canoe.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the telling of such stories across the generations that
defines the Makah. When he learned how little Eric Johnson beamed
when the men passed him into the whaling canoe, Keith Johnson said:
``These are the magical moments that are happening to our youth.
How can we describe that to the world?''

WHALING RIGHT CLAMIED, PROVOKING OPPOSITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 (WITH WHALES-MAKAHS)  
 By PAUL SHUKOVSKY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEAH BAY, Wash. _ To Wayne Johnson, whaling is not just a legal
right; it is his birthright.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the rifleman who hopes to kill the first whale, says
that what protesters forget is Makah history _ and what his
ancestors fought to save almost 150 years ago in treaty talks.
</P>
<P>
   In 1855, a tribal chief, Tse-Kauwtl, spoke plainly to U.S.
government negotiators who had come to strike a deal with the
tribe: ``I want the sea; that is my country.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting treaty between the two sovereign nations spells
out the Makah's right to whale. Though some Alaska natives have
been allowed to hunt whales, the Makah is the only tribe in the
country with such a treaty right.
</P>
<P>
   Most Makah believe they need not ask anyone's permission to take
to the sea in canoes and return with a whale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I view the importance our treaty signers placed on whaling as
a last will and testament of a sacred way of life,'' said Micah
McCarty, a Makah who hopes to harpoon a whale this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge confronting the Makah was to get the world to
agree.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the tribe asked the United States to represent it
before the International Whaling Commission in its quest to resume
hunting.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move became possible the year before when the gray whale,
which had been pushed to extinction, largely by non-Indian hunters,
was removed from the federal endangered species list. The tribe
wanted a quota of whales that could be taken for subsistence and
ceremonial use.
</P>
<P>
   At the International Whaling Commission meeting in Monaco last
year, the assembled nations approved a deal by which the United
States for the first time received a quota of gray whales taken
from the stock that has been hunted by Siberian natives. And the
Russian government received a quota of bowhead whales taken from
the stock that had been hunted by Alaskan Inuit. The gray whales
were allocated by the U.S. government to the Makah and the bowheads
were allocated by the Russian government to the Siberian natives.
</P>
<P>
   National Marine Fisheries chief counsel Margaret Hayes said the
nations didn't swap whale quotas, but that's what opponents allege,
calling it a backroom deal.
</P>
<P>
   After the Monaco commission meeting, U.S. negotiators publicly
declared that the IWC had approved a Makah whale hunt. But some IWC
member nations said the commission never formally gave its stamp of
approval to the hunt.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. IWC Commissioner James Baker said the commission works by
granting quotas for subsistence hunts to member nations and leaves
it up to those nations to chose which native people qualify for
whale hunts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commission grants quotas; it does not identify people,''
said Baker, who is the U.S. Department of Commerce undersecretary
for oceans and atmosphere. After hearing of the Makah's nutritional
and cultural need to hunt, the IWC granted the quota. That, said
Baker ``is sufficient legal support for the Makahs to do their
whaling.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Makahs claim a legal right to hunt gray whales,
international opposition continues to build from those who say the
claim is bogus. More than 350 groups from around the world posted
an open letter to the Makah on the Internet asking the tribe to
withdraw its plans for a hunt. The groups that signed include the
Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals from the
United Kingdom, Dutch Society for the Protection of Animals and the
European Federation for Nature and Animals based in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs
said: ``We would argue that the IWC has not recognized a cultural
and subsistence need by the Makah to hunt those whales. A lot of
other delegations expressed similar views.''
</P>
<P>
   An animal rights group called Australians for Animals is helping
to finance a lawsuit by U.S. Rep. Jack Metcalf, R-Wash., that seeks
to halt the hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Arnold, the group's founder, said in a telephone interview
from Australia that she decided to become involved when she heard
how some U.S. animal rights groups were reluctant to take on the
issue because of a sensitivity to Indian rights.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold, who plans to be here to protest, said the Makah hunt is
raising concern around the world. ``European groups are deeply
concerned. People in Australia and New Zealand are boiling with
rage. I think you can expect there will be a migration from this
country to Neah Bay to protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``If America goes whaling in her waters, then we've lost the
whale,'' Arnold said. ``There are so many indigenous tribes waiting
for the outcome of this.''

NEWSPAPER TRADE GROUP ANNOUNCES NEW ADVERTISING SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Va. _ The Newspaper Association of America (NAA)
announced Wednesday that it will start a clearinghouse for
advertisers, ad agencies and newspapers to simplify the planning
and placement of newspaper advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The new organization _ called the Newspaper Industry
Communications Center _ will cost about $5 million and will take at
least a year to develop, according to John F. Sturm, president and
chief executive officer of NAA, the 1,700-member trade association
for the newspaper industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to make life easier for our customers in the ad
world _ and make newspapers more competitive in the multi-market
arena,'' Sturm told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The new center will collect data on circulation, readership,
demographics and rates and serve ``as a single source for all
information'' about particular advertising campaigns, Sturm said.
The center's fee will amount to 1/2 of 1 percent of any ad buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, that fee would be lowered over time,'' Sturm said.
</P>
<P>
   He said no decision had been made about where the staff of 10 to
12 people will be based.
</P>
<P>
   ``NICC will not replace existing service providers and it will
not negotiate rates,'' Sturm said. ``The NICC will streamline the
existing ad-buying process and tie together a number of
solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Another NAA subsidiary, the New York-based Newspaper National
Network, focuses on actually selling newspaper ads. Sturm said the
network is aiming for more than $100 million in sales this year,
with ads in over 600 newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   He said the NICC concept was developed by the consulting firm of
Booz-Allen and Hamilton. The firm of KPMG-Peat Marwick will put it
together, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most NAA members are daily newspapers, accounting for 87 percent
of the U.S. daily newspaper circulation.

   WHALES-MAKAHS (Neah Bay, Wash.) Micah McCarty rises with the sun
and slips into the chilly waters of Waatch River, just upstream
from the untamed edge of the Pacific Northwest. With each stroke,
he mimics the movement of the whale he hopes to slay this fall with
a hand-carved wooden harpoon. And he prays that the gray whale will
be ``a kind brother or sister.'' McCarty is preparing himself for
the Makah tribe's first whale hunt in more than seven decades. He
hopes it will renew the Olympic Peninsula tribe's spirit and
traditions. Opponents call the hunt butchery, saying it has no
place in a modern world where whales are protected by international
law.

<P>
   ``Made-to-Measure'' garments once meant a shirt, suit or gown
tailor-made for the wealthy few. In time, that custom fit may be
readily available for the average mall shopper as well, thanks to
three-dimensional body scans.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year or so, experts say, some consumers are likely to
find such computer scans available at a handful of locations
ranging from the Mall of America to Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Technology being developed in the fashion industry in the United
States and abroad is likely to make so-called mass customization a
reality rather than an oxymoron.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the capability,'' said Stephen Gray, head of the
Computer Clothing Research Center at Nottingham Trent University in
England. ``If people have been through our body scanners, we can
have their data on a smart card that gives the retailer all the
information necessary to fit the individuals, who can, in turn, use
the Internet to look at fabrics and position the garment on a
personalized mannequin of their body type.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, body scanners can be found mainly at a scattering of
research sites and special effects studios. While clothing
manufacturers and retailers are intensely interested in the new
technology, they are aware of the many roadblocks on the way to
consumer acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   One problem is what Dick Yardley, a manufacturing technology
specialist at the American Apparel Manufacturers Association, calls
the modesty factor: ``Some people don't want everyone to see what
they look like in a skintight body stocking.'' There are, too, the
inevitable glitches that will occur when consumers trust the same
technology to design their clothes that has created a new meaning
for the word ``'bug'' and threatens worldwide disruptions in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology is amazing,'' said Andree Conrad, editor of
Apparel Industry Magazine, ``but inevitably problems will occur.
And, granted that the fit is far better than off-the-rack, will
consumers be willing to pay for it?
</P>
<P>
   The American public is so price-conscious that it has pushed the
cost of garments way down. Is it actually going to say, ``I'm
willing to pay 20 percent more for a good fit? Right now, what
they're willing to do is take 40 garments into the waiting room and
try them all on _ and then say how much they hate to shop when they
get home.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Blackwood, vice president at J.C. Penney's, a nationwide
chain of department stores, agrees that price is the defining issue
for the American market. ``Europeans are willing to spend more for
their clothing than Americans,'' he said. ``When you customize, the
cost is higher. We think the scanners have tremendous potential,
but it's not going to happen tomorrow for us. We have to refine the
process to get the scanning and manufacturing costs down to what
the customer is willing to pay and shrink the scanners, too. The
amount of square footage they take up is not economical.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, problems and all, manufacturers and retailers, many of
them in the high-end office-clothes market, are starting to come
forward to embrace the body scanner, bulky though it may be,
although few have yet made a commitment to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Homi Patel, president and the chief operating officer of Hart,
Schaffner &AMP; Marx, a major manufacturer of men's clothing in the
United States, is working with a manufacturing research and
training operation in Cary, N.C., that has developed its own
scanner. That organization, called (TC)2 (for the Textile/Clothing
Technology Corp.; it is pronounced tee-cee squared) involves more
than 100 clothing manufacturers, including J.C. Penny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably we'll work with department stores to have scanning
equipment available and then connected directly into our management
information systems to develop custom garments at quick speeds,''
Patel said. ``True, the scanning machines won't have the charm of a
good salesman, but people will get acclimatized. Young people will
have no trouble; older people will need more time.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if body scanning is slow to spread to mass markets,
accurate information on body shape could have a profound effect on
the clothing industry. ``Even in the shops,'' Gray said, ``fit is
going to be better as we acquire more accurate data about our body
shapes.''
</P>
<P>
   Those interested in the new technology of digital fashion
include Edith Gazzuolo, who expects to operate her scanner at the
Mall of America, near Minneapolis; Kathryn Chase, a chemical
engineer and ardent seamstress who hopes to open her own scanning
parlor at an Atlanta shopping center, and Brooks Brothers, the home
of the button-down shirt.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Brooks Brothers has had striking success in the past year with
its fledgling computer-assisted shirt-customization program, which
began last August. Joe Dixon, a senior vice president for
manufacturing at Brooks Brothers, said, ``If you have the ability
to give people exactly what they want, it's a differentiator.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, customers for custom shirts are fitted the traditional
way, with a tape measure. Then software adapts the standard Brooks
Brothers pattern to specific measurements _ for example, making one
sleeve longer than the other _ before the material is cut and sewn.
Delivery is promised in about two to three weeks; prices start at
$75.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pleasantly surprised by the level of business we've
generated,'' Dixon said. ``We started with a catalog announcement,
and only recently rolled the program out to all the stores. We are
already seeing a nice uptake.'' He said he expected the
special-order business to grow. ``We're working with a couple of
companies on body scanners,'' Dixon said, ``and when we think it's
right for us, we'll go ahead. There's no doubt scanning works for
made-to-measure. We just need to make sure that when a customer
comes in and has to strip to underwear that the customer really
wants to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ike Behar, a high-end shirt company that has boutiques in Nieman
Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman and many other stores, already does about
20 percent of its business in custom-fitted shirts but does not use
scanners yet. Alan Behar, president of the company, said: ``Body
scanning is going to become a necessity.
</P>
<P>
   The shirt is the closest thing to the body. The shoulder, chest
and arm holes are particularly difficult to measure for comfort.''
Behar said that his customers were exercising more and that the fit
of the shirt had to reflect this. He is not worried about customer
reaction to scanners, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is Ms. Chase, who is searching for venture capital to
open her Atlanta scanning center and a related Web site. Describing
her test of a body scanner, she said: ``It's almost like a carnival
ride. The equipment is draped in black theatrical cloth to keep out
the light. You go in, get down to your underwear, put your feet on
the white marks and press the button. Lights flash, music plays _
it only takes a few seconds _ and you have all the data the
pattern-making software needs for a custom fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chase got the idea for her business in part from observing
her two daughters. ``They both have the same measurements _ waist,
hips, bust _ but there are very few items that they can trade back
and forth,'' she said. ``They don't look good in the same clothes.
With 3-D, we'll have a better way of knowing how we actually look
in the clothes we want to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Body scanners are crucial to made-to-measure clothing for the
masses; the technology extracts body measurements so patterns can
be altered for individual customers.
</P>
<P>
   `Traditionally, tailors have taken these measurements for their
own pattern-altering methods,'' said David Bruner, manager of
research and development at (TC)2, ``but when you compare one
tailor's measurements to another, it turns out each is making an
educated guess; in fact, it's all guesswork _ the measurements are
notoriously inconsistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Both two- and three-dimensional scanners are being used for the
body measurements that are the basis for mass customization. In
England, the Computer Clothing Research unit at Nottingham Trent
University has measured more than 8,000 people. The center uses a
system of side profiles and front outlines that is less expensive
than point-to-point three-dimensional scanning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were concerned that larger ladies, say size 32, would be
unwilling to expose themselves in their underwear,'' Gray said.
``But when we ran a piece on local radio two years ago, we had
women queuing at the door. They said, `No one understands our
clothing problems.' They were glad to volunteer.''
</P>
<P>
   Full-color three-dimensional scanning of the entire body is
being used by the United States Air Force. After all, pilots wear
clothing, too, and helmets. ``Everyone is interested,'' said
Kathleen M. Robinette, an anthropologist and mathematician at
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio who is managing a program
called Caesar, for Civilian American and European Surface
Anthropometry Resource, the first large-scale whole-body
three-dimensional scanning project ever done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that 3-D is here,'' she said, ``We can measure bodies
quickly and accurately in a way that tape measures could never
accomplish. The technology will be applied in ways that haven't
even been imagined yet.'' Caesar will measure 10,800 males and
females of varying weights and ages, 4,000 of them in the United
States and 6,800 in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to learn for the first time what we're shaped
like,'' said Ms. Robinette, manager of engineering anthropometry,
the study of human body measurements, for the Air Force. ``The data
will help us create realistic computer mannequins to build
made-to-measure garments on. It will yield many software tools for
the design and production of customized clothing. But it's also
going to help for better-fitting clothing in general. Right now,
there are many errors as we go from the person to a flat pattern.
We'll finally take away the guesswork. It may even lead to
consistent sizes across brands.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military has been interested in body measurement since
the 1930s because of its responsibility for uniforms and for
protective equipment that must fit properly, like helmets and gas
masks. ``By 1980, we agreed there had to be a better way than tape
measures,'' Ms. Robinette said. ``We were disposed to 3-D automated
scanning methods.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base bought a head-scanning
system and developed software for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scanner was being used for a Star Trek movie,'' Ms.
Robinette said. ``The studio was concerned with artistry, but we
wanted accuracy. So we developed software not only to drive the
scanner and analyze the data, but for applications related to
apparel.''
</P>
<P>
   The data became the basis for things like tight-fitting fighter
pilot helmets, oxygen masks and night vision goggles. ``Now we're
moving on, from head scans to full-body ones,'' Ms. Robinette said.
``Our last full-scale survey was done in 1939, and a lot has
changed since then: people's bodies, even our concept of fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray, of Nottingham Trent, agrees. ``Human size and shape have
changed in the McDonald's years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He credits a small part of the change to undergarments. ``Lycra
holds things in, but not with the supportive properties of
whalebone, so nipples are about 5 inches lower,'' he explained.
``But there's also the rest of us. Men are more round-shouldered,
and almost every person we surveyed has a stomach sticking out. In
general, we're not only taller than our parents _ we are fatter.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray says virtual reality software would be only one of many
benefits from body scanning. ``The advantages will come as well
from understanding the size of people and making patterns better,''
he said. ``As the body grows, different bits grow at different
rates. Gravity alone means a bigger bust is lower than a smaller
one. The stomach protrudes around the sides as well as the front.
People want clothing to disguise the bad and emphasize the good; we
need good data on body shape to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Caesar project is expected to yield data useful across
industries. Its partners include not only apparel companies, like
Lee, Levi Strauss and Vanity Fair, but also other companies with an
interest in body shapes and how they are changing, like Boeing and
Caterpillar.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Pollack of the Society of Automotive Engineers, which is
coordinating many administrative functions for the huge project,
said there had been no lack of volunteers to be scanned so far.
``Everyone has the experience of sitting in a car or airplane seat
that is too small,'' he said. ``People want their dimensions looked
at and used.''
</P>
<P>
   Digital fashion may one day provide not only physical benefits,
like clothes that fit better, but also psychological benefits:
shoppers may be able to to try on clothes without specifying their
size or weight, which many are reluctant to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hate to say our size,'' said Linda Freedman, vice president
for marketing at Modacad, a Los Angeles company that produces
software for electronic commerce. ``And everyone _ well, nearly
everyone _ lies about their weight. Don't you on your driver's
license?''
</P>
<P>
   Starting this August, Modacad will offer a CD-ROM that is
intended to let young women shop for clothes by using 3-D models of
different body types to try on their selections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ask them to choose a shape, but we don't use words like
`pear-shaped' or any other expressions like that. I'm a pear,
myself, but I don't want to be called one,'' Ms. Freedman said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, digital fashion has produced Kevlar-lined suit jackets
that don't rub a bodyguard's chest and snug-fitting helmets and gas
masks that would please even Darth Vader.
</P>
<P>
   As to whether scanning and virtual try-ons will transform
cabbage leaves into Cary Grants _ given a technology that routinely
messes up our monthly bills and crashes when loaded with too many
Web sites _ it's entirely possible we'll end up looking more like
Charlie Chaplin than the Duke of Wales.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every morning, Doug Liu rises at 6 and checks on the Internet to
find out about the surf near his home in Boulder Creek, Calif.
About three times a week, the news is good enough for a 25-minute
trip to the beach to catch a set of waves. The rest of the time, it
saves him a trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it shows there's no swell coming in, I'll just sleep in,''
said Liu, a system administrator for a technology company in
Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   The round-the-clock availability of information on the Internet
has spurred the success of Web sites that offer books, music, news
and the like. And it's also creating a demand for weather
information without the polish and marketing of weather forecasters
goofing off on local news shows.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of weather news appeals to Jimmy Bradley, 34, a
grocery stock clerk who participated in a recent discussion in a
weather chat room. (Of course there are chat rooms about the
weather.) Unlike the television broadcasts, Bradley said, Web
weather information has ``no opinions of meteorologists and talking
heads.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the Web was providing users with weather
information as soon as it was available, circumventing the wait for
a newscaster to make a radio or television announcement.
</P>
<P>
   In Bradley's home city, Mobile, Ala., where Hurricane Danny
dumped 43 inches of rain last year, time for storm preparation is
crucial.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he said, he got word of an approaching storm on line a
half-hour before he heard about it on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to do what I had to do outside to get ready for it,
stuff like getting the dog in and the boat tied down and the
computer shut down,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Most weather pages offer a national overview of weather,
articles on places where weather is making news, local forecasts
and more detailed information for those who need it. Many sites now
offer personalized weather pages, proving that like politics, all
weather is local.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites are more oriented toward consumers, offering pages
with easy-to-use graphics and an eye on what the average user
wants. With others, you are expected to understand weather data
without the help of lengthy explanations. Weather news is also
cropping up on general interest sites, like news services and start
pages.
</P>
<P>
   The number of hits on weather sites puts most popular sites and
Web portals to shame. The National Weather Service said its page
got one million visits a day. Disney.com, by way of contrast, said
its site got 600,000 visits a day. The Weather Channel said its
site got 87 million ``page views'' a month, which means about 20
million visitors, and about 300,000 surfers have opted for
customized pages.
</P>
<P>
   There are 250,000 personal subscribers to the Accuweather Web
site, though the company says some 25 million get their weather
from additional Accuweather displays on Snap, CNN Interactive and
The Wall Street Journal's online edition.
</P>
<P>
   The Web is going beyond traditional media by offering weather
information for users with specific needs _ for storm warnings,
crop reports and forecasts for travel destinations _ that cannot be
met by television.
</P>
<P>
   More serious weather-heads are using that information to do
their own forecasting, with mixed results: amateurs can sometimes
draw the wrong conclusions from the data.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, it's not all good,'' a user identified as
DisasterWX said in a chat room. ``Now a lot of people are doing
individual forecasting. Some know what they are doing, but many
don't.''
</P>
<P>
   The average weather hunter on the Web is most likely looking for
a temperature and conditions forecast, something to help determine
whether to carry an umbrella to the office. Here are a few Web
sites that offer that kind of information, plus some other places
to stop for additional features.
</P>
<P>
   If predictions and graphics aren't enough and you want to see
what the weather is like in a certain place, try weatherimages.org
or tvweather. com (soon to become weathercast. com). Both offer
``live'' images of weather cameras from around the globe, which are
actually still shots that are updated every so often. It's a nice
touch, though they tend toward the banal because the view usually
does not include twisters or hurricanes. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Best Part of Accuweather Site Is Its Forecasting Accuracy &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WWW.ACCUWEATHER.COM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This site, probably the most layman-oriented of the bunch, is
for people who want a thorough and easy-to-understand weather
report without a lot of frills.
</P>
<P>
   Accuweather.com offers an overview of regional, national and
world weather, graphics and maps of temperature and weather
patterns as well as personalized services like local and
travel-destination forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   You can create a personal weather page, allowing you to get the
forecast by entering your city's name or ZIP code, though
predictions won't necessarily be for what is over your house: you
can get only as close as the weather center nearest you.
</P>
<P>
   Local weather forecasts on Accuweather are much like what you
might see on local television: the sun shining or shrinking behind
clouds, sunrise and sunset, moon phases, high and low temperatures,
extended forecasts, and hour-by-hour forecasts. In addition, there
are jet-stream and precipitation maps.
</P>
<P>
   And if you are spending the next five days in Ouagadougou,
Burkina Faso, for example, you can find out that there will be
highs in the mid- and upper 90s and lows in the upper 70s. If
logging on to your personalweather page every day is too
cumbersome, Accuweather will send a forecast to your e-mail address
free.
</P>
<P>
   If you would prefer to search by weather ``product'' _ where the
hurricanes will be touching down next or where a particular storm
is _ you can do that, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Accuweather site provides updates on specific storms and
conditions, as well as archive roundups of, say, how many people
Hurricane Bertha killed in 1996 (answer: at least nine).
</P>
<P>
   There are also fee-based services like tailored aviation weather
pages and, for those who fear twisters, National Weather Service
warnings sent directly to pagers.
</P>
<P>
   The site occasionally lurches toward the technical. For
instance, it offers a measure of ``base reflectivity'' on its radar
chart, though it offers a help section if you need to understand
that. For fun, check out Weather Facts, which offers a weather
trivia question and Today's Worst Weather; on a recent day, that
prize went to Magic City, Idaho, experiencing its 14th consecutive
day hotter than 95 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising on Accuweather is restricted to a few banners, at
least for now, so loading pages does not take too long. And more
important, the site has been, as the name implies, accurate: a
glance out the window confirmed that it was indeed sunny on a
recent afternoon in Los Angeles. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lots of News and Lots of Ads &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WWW.WEATHER.COM &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The home page of the Weather Channel, Weather.com is, like the
24-hour cable station that preceded it, oriented toward breaking
weather news from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   (``More heat,'' the site recently reported. ``The heat continues
in Oklahoma and Texas. It's now 23 days in a row for triple-digit
heat in Dallas.'') The news options let you click to read a feature
article on weather or to peruse headlines and summaries.
</P>
<P>
   Weather.com also offers a Dow Jones-style scrolling ticker of
forecasts and conditions in cities; you can scroll back if your
city zips by too quickly. As with the Accuweather page, you can
type in a city name to find out the weather there.
</P>
<P>
   When you do, you get a five-day forecast of temperatures and
conditions. You can also get a video report on ``this day in
weather history.'' The site occasionally displays computer-command
gibberish on its pages after loading, though it disappears when you
click on Reload.
</P>
<P>
   In its feature section, the Weather Channel mixes news (well,
features, anyway) with what the weather will be like at events like
the current PGA Championship. It's not the most elegantly designed
page, although it blends in some interesting analyses of how high
temperatures and humidity will affect events. It also offers a
selection of weather-related tips on topics like gardening, golfing
and boating.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising is considerable, making the site a bit slow to
load.
</P>
<P>
   Weather.com offers a personalized weather page, and a revised
version is due in the fall. The new version will let you customize
the report to show the current weather in five cities of your
choice, as well as a five-day forecast and a blend of the usual
cloud and temperature maps for your local area and the whole
country. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   National Weather Service Web Site Takes Itself Seriously &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WWW.NWS.NOAA.GOV &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE is probably the most trusted and
well-known source of weather information in the country. So
naturally, its home page is focused on ... good government?
</P>
<P>
   The top of the page is emblazoned with the insignias of the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National
Weather Service. In between is an American flag and a weather vane.
</P>
<P>
   The first link is not weather maps, forecasts or conditions, but
Our Mission _ a solemn promise to provide weather information and
warnings ``for the protection of life and property and the
enhancement of the national economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Just below that is the agency's ``reinvention'' goals to be
accomplished by 2000, a response to a Clinton Administration
initiative called the National Partnership for Reinventing
government.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah, and then there's the weather.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service site gets good marks for
explaining, unlike any other site, how weather information is
actually recorded. And users can select weather observations from
individual locations, not just cities, which gives a context for
understanding how close or far the observed conditions are to you
(for instance, you can check Los Angeles International Airport, not
just Los Angeles).
</P>
<P>
   You get wind, visibility, maximum and minimum temperatures and
24-hour summaries in addition to the conditions and current
temperature (updated every hour). The National Weather Service also
provides crop summaries, earthquake and tsunami reports and
ultraviolet indexes for those who want more detailed information.
</P>
<P>
   It also issues official weather warnings. It summarizes severe
weather warnings by state, so if you are looking for a flash flood,
you will know if there is one on the way. The site offers videos of
inclement weather, but they take a long time to download.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to forecasts, the National Weather Service site
offers an ``enhanced graphics'' version, which worked with mixed
results: a page for local weather would not load because the server
was down.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, graphics on the site are nonexistent to
rudimentary. That make the pages quick to load, but they lack the
consumer-oriented bells and whistles that the average
weather-hunting Web surfer might be looking for. As far as overall
presentation goes, the site also requires looking at multiple pages
and thus consumes more time than the other sites. &QL;

AS MAC REBOUNDS, PRICKLY FANS MELLOW (A LITTLE) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa.)   (af)  
 By MICHEL MARRIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the Macworld exposition held in New York last month,
thousands of Macintosh devotees milled about, as content as cows in
sweet grass. They were ogling the new G3s and 50 or so
preproduction models of Apple's soon-to-be-shipped iMac, a
translucent gumdrop of a home computer that seems to have lifted
the spirits of Mac users.
</P>
<P>
   And it's about time. With the iMac and a few other recent
developments, life along the fault line that separates millions of
Mac true believers from those who put their trust in Windows
computers has become a whole lot easier.
</P>
<P>
   I know. I'm a longtime, avid user of Windows-based personal
computers, a PC guy through and through. But I have plenty of Mac
friends. As difficult as it might be to accept, Mac users _ famous
for their touchiness at perceived slights against their precious
computers _ are mellowing.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, last year an issue of Mac Addict, a monthly magazine
dedicated to Mac junkies, published a half-dozen articles that
offered help for coping in an overwhelmingly PC world. The chief
strategies were to relax and tone down the attacks on the dark
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Escalating the warfare only reinforces a new popular notion
that Mac owners are irrational fanatics,'' Kathy Tafel wrote in the
article, titled ``The Gentle Art of Verbal Mac Defense.''
``Fanatics, maybe. Irrational, never.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that Apple evangelists still won't punch you
a parallel port in your forehead if you rib them too roughly.
</P>
<P>
   The difference may be that Apple has scored points with its
latest computer offerings _ the iMac and the G3 line _ and is also
getting reacquainted with profit, an old friend that proved elusive
for the company at this time last year.
</P>
<P>
   So Mac users, never more proud of their computers of choice,
seem less defensive and less compelled to prove anything to PC
users.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the company has helped us out,'' an old friend of
mine who is a Mac man told me recently.
</P>
<P>
   Mac users really get a thrill, he said, ``when they see that
commercial with the steam roller.'' He was referring to an Apple
television commercial that shows a steamroller crushing a
Pentium-class laptop.
</P>
<P>
   Another source of newfound Apple peace of mind is an aggressive
advertising campaign that says simply: ``Think Different.'' That
directive is always tucked into a corner of a photograph of an icon
of originality, like Albert Einstein or Muhammad Ali.
</P>
<P>
   The implication is, of course, that anyone who would purchase a
Mac is daring to challenge the PC lemmings' dive over the cliff.
Hamilton Cloud, a Hollywood television producer, is a good example
of the recent change.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran Mac user, Cloud said that all the talk about Apple's
troubles in recent years was making him hesitant, ``scared,
really,'' about buying another Mac.
</P>
<P>
   But now he is proud to Think Different, he said. He just bought
a new G3 Power Mac, and he couldn't be happier _ or more mellow
about his decision. ``It's so-o-o fast,'' Cloud said, without once
uttering a disparaging word about PCs.
</P>
<P>
   But some suggest that Mac people's growing sense of serenity is
not solely rooted in Apple's recent improvements in its computers,
management and marketing. Instead, they point to the fact that
Microsoft, which builds the software, and Intel, which builds most
of the computing brains for PCs, have taken some sharp hits lately
from antimonopoly forces in Congress and state attorneys general.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sense that the invulnerability of the other side
has been wounded,'' my friend said recently. ``Mac people don't
feel so threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, these so-called platform battles between Mac and PC
users have raged, melting down some friendships faster than unpaid
bets.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Thomas Wagner, 16, a 10th grader who lives in Troy,
Pa., found his e-mail overwhelmed with pro-Mac newsletters after he
created a pro-Windows home page on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone signed me up for some mailing list I couldn't get
off,'' recalled Thomas, the exasperated creator of the Proudly Made
With Windows site (www.epix.net/tjwagner/win95.html).
</P>
<P>
   But in this new dawn of Mac-PC detente, such shenanigans might
become as laughable a relic of an emerging computer age as
2400-baud modems.
</P>
<P>
   At least, I hope so.

 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Most Americans are wimps when it comes to goat cheese,
preferring mild versions akin to softened cream cheese.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, the preference is for more robust varieties. By
varieties, we mean as many as 50 or 60 kinds, any of which might be
served as a savory course between the boeuf bourguignon and the
chocolate mousse.
</P>
<P>
   At his Phoenix restaurant, Vincent's on Camelback, chef Vincent
Guerithault hews to American tastes, serving goat-cheese dishes
that aren't exactly wimpish but aren't the strong, room-clearing
specimens a French customer might demand.
</P>
<P>
   However, he does magic with them. In his self-named cookbook,
Guerithault offers such treats as Goat Cheese Nachos, Black Bean
Soup with Goat Cheese and Grilled Avocado with Goat Cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Eaten for centuries in Europe, goat cheese, or the French term
chevre, has become popular in America. Little blobs of the white,
fluffy cheese are turning up in appetizers, salads, soups and main
dishes where other cheeses traditionally might be used.
</P>
<P>
   Its properties are different from those of cheese made from
cow's milk. It does not melt, but rather softens and ``puffs up.''
</P>
<P>
   When Guerithault uses chevre in some of his famous quesadillas,
he often combines it with mozzarella, which does melt and becomes
deliciously gooey.
</P>
<P>
   It is a versatile product, combining well with herbs and garlic.
It nicely accompanies such meats as salmon and duck _ as in two of
Guerithault's signature quesadillas.
</P>
<P>
   In the Phoenix area, he says, goat cheese ``has been part of the
Southwestern influence.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other cheeses, it is pliable, allowing it to be molded
and shaped.
</P>
<P>
   Chevre varies widely in taste and aroma. In America as well as
in Europe, true cheese connoisseurs prefer strong, dry varieties,
Guerithault says. He puts himself in that category.
</P>
<P>
   What wine to serve with goat cheese?
</P>
<P>
   Because the cheese is so versatile, appropriate wines also favor
a wide range of tastes, says Christie Dufault, sommelier at
Vincent's.
</P>
<P>
   She recommends primarily reds _ a French burgundy or Bordeaux,
or something from Provence or the Rhone Valley. A California wine
such as a Pinot Noir would be a nice pairing.
</P>
<P>
   Dufault warns against serving the milder goat cheeses with too
hearty a wine, as the cheese could be overpowered. A rose could be
a fine accompaniment. &QL;

 By AMY HARMON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Computer security has long been the sole province of a grizzled
clan of experts who have despaired of getting the public to take
the subject seriously. Skeptics have dismissed warnings of hacker
attacks as alarmist, cynics have figured that attacks were
inevitable, and victims have often preferred to not talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   Casual computer users have just assumed that the most likely
targets _ big businesses and the Pentagon _ could take care of
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But the recent news that simply opening an e-mail message could
nuke your hard drive has created a new concern about personal
software security among average e-mail users. One flaw in some of
the most popular e-mail programs, Microsoft's Express and Outlook
98 and Netscape Mail, became public last month. Last week, a
separate problem was discovered in Qualcomm's Eudora, the most
widely used e-mail program.
</P>
<P>
   The flaw in the Microsoft and Netscape programs, known as a
buffer overflow error, allows the sender of an e-mail message to
embed a program in the header that tricks the operating system into
running a rogue program when the receiver opens the message.
</P>
<P>
   The Eudora flaw enables a sender to insert a seemingly harmless
link to an Internet location that runs malignant code when the
receiver clicks on it.
</P>
<P>
   So far, neither flaw has led to any reports of damage, and all
three companies are distributing free software that will fix their
problems. But the glitches have made the arcane issues of computer
security crop up suddenly in the home computer user's backyard.
</P>
<P>
   As people fill their hard drives with everything from tax
returns to personal letters, the prospect of an alien invasion via
e-mail seems like a particularly nasty kind of betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest hint of a change in thinking about e-mail
security flaws can be found in Internet discussion groups. The
flaws have inspired screeds, earnest questions and paranoid
musings. Sure, the usual suspects in comp.security.misc had their
say, as did the predictable gang in alt.2600.hackerz. But since
when did soc.retirement become the site of heated debate over bug
patches and the accountability of software vendors?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about e-mail,'' said John Taber, 61, of Irving, Texas,
who took the developers of programs affected to task in a
plaintive, if furious, diatribe posted to the group, where more
typical subjects are Social Security and the ubiquitous Monica
Lewinsky issue. ``You have to get your e-mail; it ties you in with
the rest of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Add the fumbling technical talk between ``Viron'' and
``Agamemnon'' on soc.culture.greek, or the flame war the security
flaws spawned on rec.arts.dance, and you get a sense of how e-mail
security has been taken for granted by so many in such a short
time.
</P>
<P>
   Until now _ and this is the reason the discussion among the
dance aficionados got a bit out of hand _ computer security experts
have assured Internet users that, contrary to popular belief, their
data could not be harmed by just reading the text of an e-mail
message.
</P>
<P>
   A widely circulated Internet hoax known as the Good Times Virus
has periodically whipped up panic among new users who have received
an e-mail warning that if they opened an e-mail message titled
``Good Times,'' it would unleash a virus on their machine.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But until last month, wise folks knew that a virus had to be
hidden in a program that would have to be actively executed by the
user before it could cause harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It scares me to know that now you can send me e-mail and
destroy all my data,'' said Shawn Riggins, 24, a computer-science
student at Sacramento State University who runs a Web page on West
Coast swing dancing and considers himself a fairly sophisticated
computer user. ``What was once urban legend is now reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Marx, a sociologist at the University of Colorado who
writes about the impact of technology on society, said such
reactions underscored the extent to which many high-tech tools are
accepted without much question and quickly incorporated into
everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we are so enmeshed in contraptions which are beyond
our control, we take an enormous amount on faith,'' Marx said.
``There's a sort of generalized confidence in technology, whether
it's that the toothpaste hasn't been adulterated or the phones
haven't been tapped. It gets spilled over to faith in e-mail.
Obviously this is naive and dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Marx added, balancing risk with the benefits of using
technical tools is an important part of the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an ecology of suspiciousness where you don't have the
resources to continually guard against every potential breach,'' he
said. ``And the fact is there are not a lot of horror stories out
there. So you need to say, `Given that this is out there to be
abused, how does it actually get abused, and who abuses it?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Security experts say they would rather see that energy channeled
into taking basic precautions, like downloading patches for flawed
programs and using antivirus software, to safeguard the security of
computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unfortunate thing is that even after this, people will
just continue to send and receive e-mail as before,'' said Mark
Rasch, a lawyer who prosecuted Robert Tappan Morris a decade ago
for exploiting a security flaw in a program called Sendmail that is
similar to the flaw just found in the Microsoft and Netscape e-mail
programs. ``People just need to become much more attuned to the
basic insecurity of the Internet and of e-mail itself.''
</P>
<P>
   At the federally financed Computer Emergency Response Team, an
organization at Carnegie Mellon University that tracks security
problems and issues national advisories, analysts hope that the
publicity surrounding these e-mail security gaps will drum up
support for things like simple encryption that can assure a
receiver of a sender's identification.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are technologies, like digital signatures, which could
solve these problems,'' said Jim Ellis, a senior analyst with the
group. ``If you knew where your e-mail was coming from, you would
know whether or not to open it. But we just don't have a good
infrastructure for gathering trust from other places.''
</P>
<P>
   His colleague, Larry Rogers, added: ``I hope this encourages
people to vote with their dollars. If they're aware of the risk and
potential problems the next time they're looking through the e-mail
section, they'll compare the back of boxes for some section that
talks about security. That's the kind of thing that in the long
term will have an effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one need look no further than misc.activism.militia,
where the talk normally centers on Timothy McVeigh, and, yes, Ms.
Lewinsky, to find a certain flowering of consumer empowerment. Even
there, however, one could find uncertainty. One posting asked this
week: ``Who has the most effective product?''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, most of the rec.arts.dance crowd voted to
return to regularly scheduled, if potentially insecure,
programming:
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not personally wish to continue this discussion,'' one
participant wrote. ``Full technical details on this and every other
conceivable security issue about the Internet are always available
SOMEWHERE on the Web. I believe it is off-topic to bore people with
a discussion here.''

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUEEN CREEK, Ariz. - If you are friends with Rosanna Lippe and
her daughter, Joy, you know what you're getting for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Goat products.
</P>
<P>
   Goat cheese. Goat yogurt. Goat ice cream. And a nice, cold jug
of goat's milk.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in some goat chops and shredded meat for burros and you've
gone whole hog into goat cuisine. It's a healthful diet. The
``other'' other white meat is low in fat and cholesterol. The milk
is digested more easily than cow's milk.
</P>
<P>
   But these women aren't in the business for the products. They're
in love with goats.
</P>
<P>
   As they enter the pen behind their Queen Creek home, Lippe and
Joy are swarmed instantly by a curious herd that bleats
plaintively, nuzzles and nibbles. Spry young goats deftly leap onto
wooden cable spools, mimicking the climbing prowess of their alpine
cousins.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they playfully gnaw through the shirts of visitors,
which makes them only more endearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're loving, they're kind,`` Lippe says. ``They're the
sweetest animals I've ever known, and I've been around a lot of
animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing midherd with little goat feet eagerly pawing and soft
black noses twitching like bunnies, it's easy to lose your heart to
these gentle animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the personalities,'' Joy, 13, says. ``They're
forgiving. You've never really lived till you've been kissed by a
goat.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a kiss on the lips, mind you.
</P>
<P>
   Guarding the herd from predators are two titans of the dog
world: Toledo, a Great Pyrenees; and Pippi, an Anatolian shepherd.
The Lippes' rural neighborhood sometimes is plagued by roving bands
of coyotes and feral dogs. Toledo and Pippi, mild-mannered when
their masters are about, are ferociously protective when left to
perform their sentry duties.
</P>
<P>
   They bond with the kids from birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``These dogs know they're going to protect the goats,'' Lippe
says.
</P>
<P>
   Lippe, a first-grade teacher at Sousa Elementary School in
Apache Junction, began raising goats as a hobby about nine years
ago, after the parents of one of her students gave her a kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``No family is complete without a goat,'' the parent said.
</P>
<P>
   Joy was just 4.
</P>
<P>
   Lippe, widowed soon after, now tends a small herd ranging in age
from 4 months to 8 years. Most are Oberhaslis, an attractive
reddish goat with black markings. She began raising the breed seven
or eight years ago in an effort to improve the line as a dairy
animal.
</P>
<P>
   She also raises LaManchas and Alpines.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is illegal in Arizona to sell goat products from a
hobby farm, Lippe and Joy enjoy the foods themselves and bestow
them on friends. They manufacture such items as hard and soft
cheeses (Cajun, dill, garlic-herb, onion, caraway, jalapeno, green
chiles and plain); ricotta, cottage and cream cheese; yogurt; fresh
milk, milkshakes and ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   They eat goat cheese on sandwiches. They put it on pizza. They
fold it into omelets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every goat product I've ever tasted is delicious,'' Joy says.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lippe is a vegetarian, Joy eats some meat, including
the goats she has raised. But because several goats are sent to the
butcher, she doesn't know who comes back in her burros.
</P>
<P>
   December to June is kidding season. For the first week after
birth, newborns live in the family house with Lippe, Joy, Lippe's
parents and her grandfather. Lippe bottle-feeds them, helping them
to bond with her and making weaning easier.
</P>
<P>
   Then it's off to the kid pen for three months until they're
ready for the adult pen.
</P>
<P>
   Does can kid at a year, but the Lippes wait until they are 2
years old, then breed them every other year. They are milked for 10
months.
</P>
<P>
   Lippe also has three bucks that perform stud duties. Most males
are wethered, or neutered, and used for meat.
</P>
<P>
   Every goat has a name: Honey, Patchouli, Gayla Dawn, Eagle,
Rainbow, Herb. Herb's the one who favors the flavor of shirts.
</P>
<P>
   They all come when called.
</P>
<P>
   Joy plans to become a conservation biologist. But like Heidi,
the goat-herding heroine of one of her first books, she always will
keep goats.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, who was raised with horses and cherishes the cats
and dogs she now keeps as pets, says she never will live a
goat-free life.
</P>
<P>
   She smiles. ``Once you've had goats, I don't think you can live
without them. &QL;

LIGHT FARE SUITS BLAZING SUMMER DAYS

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``A Little Something'' by Susan Epstein (Morrow, $15) is just
the ticket for folks who nosh their way through the summer.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good course to take, particularly when the weather is as
torturous as it has been this summer. Several small somethings are
easier to stomach in this heat than a full, hungry-man-style meal.
</P>
<P>
   Epstein offers up snacks, hors d'oeuvres and appetizers ranging
from the savory (turkey cranberry rollwich) to the sweet (white
chocolate-covered dried fruit). And because the servings are small,
you'll have room to try more than one.
</P>
<P>
   MARINATED GOAT CHEESE WITH CRUMB CRUST
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons fresh oregano, chopped
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound goat cheese, sliced into 1-inch-thick slices
</P>
<P>
   1 cup fresh bread crumbs
</P>
<P>
   Combine olive oil and oregano in small bowl. Season generously
with pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Pour oil mixture onto cheese slices, cover and refrigerate for
at least 3 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
</P>
<P>

THE NITTY-GRITTY OF GOAT OWNERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By EDYTHE JENSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - My milk suppliers look back at me through the kitchen
window.
</P>
<P>
   For 19 years, our family's source of milk, yogurt and cheese has
been a hobby herd of dairy goats.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for a commitment to feed and milk them twice a day,
these creatures provide food, companionship and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Goats are credits to agricultural efficiency. The size of a
large dog, an average doe (female goat) can produce 5 to 10 percent
of her body weight every day in naturally homogenized, easily
digested milk.
</P>
<P>
   The fat globules in goat milk are much smaller than those in cow
milk. That enhances its digestion and allows it to blend easily
with other ingredients _ sauces are smoother, puddings and fillings
creamier.
</P>
<P>
   People sometimes buy their first goat because they're allergic
to cow's milk, their children want a 4-H project, or they
encountered one at a petting zoo and thought it was cute.
</P>
<P>
   Mine was an attempt to be more self-sufficient. Vegetable
gardening and fruit trees were the first step; I was eager to
expand the backyard grocery inventory without investing in a farm
animal that weighed as much as my car.
</P>
<P>
   Goat ownership is not for everyone. Their twice-daily milking
schedule must become their owners' schedule, and kennels don't
accept herds of goats when owners want to go on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who wants goats, here are some suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   - Check local zoning ordinances and deed restrictions to be sure
they're allowed.
</P>
<P>
   - Go to the library and read books about goats, what to feed
them, how to fence them, and proper milk-handling practices.
</P>
<P>
   - If yogurt and cheese are on your personal menu, one of the
most complete mail-order inventory of cultures, cheese molds,
cheese presses and classes for hobbyists is available from the New
England Cheesemaking Supply Co., Box 85, Ashfield, MA 01330-0085 or
at www.cheesemaking.com on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   - Rural fairs, livestock shows and 4-H clubs for children are
among the social perks of goat ownership.
</P>
<P>
   - Discuss the pros and cons of goat ownership with family
members. If frequent vacations and sleeping in on weekends are
priorities, buy your goat milk and cheese in the store. &QL;

   UNDATED -
</P>
<P>
   CHEVRE: The French word for goat. Domestically, it is a generic
term that applies to all goat cheeses; specifically, the milk-fresh
cheese. &QL; 
CABECOU: Small medallions of goat cheese aged in olive oil. &QL; 
CHABIS: Mild young cheeses aged 1 to 2 weeks. Semisoft and moist. &QL; 
FROMAGE BLANC: Literally, white cheese. Extremely young and mild.
Goat milk contains no carotene, so pure goat milk products are fine
textured and very white. &QL; 
CENDRE: A vegetable ash used on goat cheese to create a dusty,
gray-black surface. The ash tends to mellow the acidity of the
fresh goat cheese and contributes to a drier, chalkier texture. &QL; 
TOMME: A generic term for ``round,'' this is the word used to
describe hard or semihard goat cheese aged from 6 weeks to 6
months. These cheeses vary in texture and flavor from mild and
nutty to piquant and robust. &QL; 
PASTA FILATA: A category of Mediterranean-style cheeses. The curd
often is immersed in hot whey, pulled into long threads and
reworked into a variety of shapes. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Our request for the orange muffins served at the Peninsula Hotel
in Hong Kong brought several responses _ most of them with the
orange blossom muffin recipe served at the Jefferson Hotel in
Jefferson, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   This is a perfectly nice recipe, but I'm sure the chefs in Hong
Kong don't use Bisquick. So, while I wait for the hotel to e-mail

 &HT;    Mini reviews: The latest word on the latest sounds
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton, Kathy Janich, Bo Emerson, Nick Tate, and
Richard L. Eldredge
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   -- FOLK
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell Among the Yearlings''
</P>
<P>
   Gillian Welch. Almo Sounds.
</P>
<P>
   11 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Musically, this Nashville singer-songwriter's second effort
strays little from the meticulous country-folk and bluegrass sounds
of her Grammy-nominated 1996 debut, ``Revival.'' Indeed, her
adherence to tradition may be a bit too strict _ some songs have a
hermetically sealed, museum-piece feel. It's in the lyrics that
Welch gets adventurous, delving into the dark side of human nature.
``Caleb Meyer'' deals with the attempted rape of a mountain woman,
while the heartbreaking ``One Morning'' observes a Kentucky mother
as she watches her long-gone son ride up on horseback. As he draws
near, she discovers that he's dead from gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   -- POP
</P>
<P>
   ``Being Myself''
</P>
<P>
   Lena Horne. Blue Note Records.
</P>
<P>
   10 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Lena Horne has lost a few notes through the years, but it
doesn't matter on ``Being Myself,'' a disc on which she's clearly
having fun. And yet emotions run deep in this mixture of pop
standards and blues tunes. Horne is sassy on ``As Long as I Live,''
melancholy on ``Autumn in New York'' and reflective on
``Imagination.'' And don't miss her ``Sleepin' Bee,'' which begins
with a hum and builds to an all-out buzz. Horne, now 81, has
decades of tales to tell from her years as a recording artist and
stage and screen actress. They're all here, a burbling subtext that
gives each phrase, each lyric waves of meaning. Our only regret? We
get just 38 minutes of that old Horne magic.
</P>
<P>
   -- VARIETY
</P>
<P>
   ``Legends of Ukulele''
</P>
<P>
   Various artists. Rhino. 18 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe, looking at this homely little instrument,
but once upon a time the ukulele ruled. Starting with the Hawaiian
music boom of the early 1900s, the instrument crested in the 1940s
with Arthur Godfrey, who eventually sold 9 million of his plastic
ukes. This disc has plenty to argue its case, from virtuoso jazz to
humble folk to aromatic old chestnuts such as ``Do I Love You? Yes
I Do!'' Skip the obligatory Tiny Tim track and go right to the
ineffable Ohta San and ``Little Grass Shack.'' The production and
selection are impeccable, and the way overresearched liner notes
are from Jim Beloff, author of ``The Ukulele: A Visual History''
and contributor of the noirishly cute ``For the Love of Uke.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ROCK
</P>
<P>
   ``Zoom''
</P>
<P>
   The Knack. Rhino. 14 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   They're back. The West Coast crew that gave us ``My Sharona''
returns with a new set of slick, formulaic Cheap Trick imitations.
And somehow they manage the impossible: ``Zoom'' makes ``Sharona''
sound like a rock masterpiece. Just a click short of self-parody,
the Knack's keg-party mix of scattershot-fuzz guitar, sing-song
melodies and brick-handed drumming are as cliche-laden as ever.
Even the lyrics on ``Zoom'' are stone-dumb. Sample: ``Can I borrow
a kiss? I'll pay it back with interest.'' Sheesh. It's almost
enough to make you wonder what Toni ``Mickey (You're So Fine)''
Basil's up to these days. Almost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eve 6''
</P>
<P>
   Eve 6. RCA/BMG. 11 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   This L.A. power rock trio is getting a lot of mileage from its
omnipresent MTV video for ``Inside Out,'' but, unlike a lot of the
bands on the video channel, Eve 6 has legs. The group of
18-year-olds, fronted by vocalist-bassist-lyricist Max Collins,
could be labeled Hanson with distortion guitar pedals. Collins and
crew show amazing musical maturity and tightness that demonstrate
they've been studying. The memorable melodies coupled with witty,
insightful, angst-riddled lyrics prove once again that there's
nothing like the experience of being a high school outcast to
produce great rock 'n' roll.

 &HT;    Phair stretches beyond scruffy
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hey, no one's going to accuse her of being Stevie Nicks, even if
she toyed with the pose on the cover of her infamous first album.
But Liz Phair is no longer the ``exile in Guyville'' singing with
the same explicit candor about boy-girl chemistry and tossing off
sexual provocations with lo-fi glee. She got married. Had a kid.
Played Lilith Fair. And now, with her third album, is sounding
awfully slick and professional; mellow, even, compared to the
four-letter-word/scruffy-guitar quotient that previously paced her
songs.
</P>
<P>
   It's Phair's trademark audacity, though, that could have bound
her to dirty-flirty cliches. The rewarding quality of
``whitechocolatespaceegg,'' a title that would look even worse
translated into German, is the way Phair stretches herself as a
songwriter (even if she lets the multitracking get annoyingly out
of hand). Her best stuff has an introspective clarity (``Only
Son,'' ``Go On Ahead'') about life's fundamental relationships or
uses irony and narrative voice (``Big Tall Man,'' ``Johnny
Feelgood'') to break through the confessional ``I'' mode that makes
you assume a piece is autobiographical.
</P>
<P>
   I'd be lying if I said this is remotely as fun as ``Exile in
Guyville,'' though Phair's reliance on nursery rhymes, '60s garage,
bubble gum and girl-group pop, and a few guys from R.E.M. here and
there suggests that she hasn't strayed too far from her musical
roots. This is a smart record, though, almost a dose of reality in
the current climate of triviality. As Phair declares, ``I'm a
complicated communicator,'' which sure beats the daylights out of
carbonated sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   ``whitechocolatespaceegg''
</P>
<P>
   Liz Phair. Matador/Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   15 tracks.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Dogg missing `Doggy' and more
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long before this album hit the stores, it was a big record.
Master P's signing of Snoop Doggy Dogg, probably the most popular
artist in gangster rap, elevated P's independent and successful No
Limit Records label to a higher level. And Dogg's departure from
the notorious Death Row Records was the final nail in the coffin of
what was one of the most successful purveyors of violent, graphic
and drug-laced rap.
</P>
<P>
   But a big record isn't always a great record, as evidenced by
``Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told.''
</P>
<P>
   Dogg's teaming with No Limit's in-house production team, Beats
by the Pound, is too often the lulling and unmemorable experience
you'd expect when you match Dogg's languid delivery with equally
lazy rhythms. Not that Dogg rapped any differently on Death Row.
But when Dr. Dre was on the production boards, his keyboard-based
``G-Funk'' always had the kind of power that insisted you listen to
the low-key rapper. And that, coupled with hooks such as those on
``Gin and Juice,'' made even menacing lyrics easy to sing along to.
</P>
<P>
   Here, ``Gin and Juice II'' is an orchestrated yawner complete
with timpani rolls. Dogg's labelmate Mystikal proves more imposing
on ``Tru Tank Dogs,'' and his other new labelmate, Mia X, is as
compelling on the cautionary tale ``Slow Down.'' Dogg finds his
stride only when he's reminiscing, as on the muscular ``Woof!''
That's also true for the well-written reworking of Boogie Down
Productions' ``Love's Gonna Get'cha,'' titled ``Doggz Gonna Get
Ya,'' and on ``DP Gangsta,'' a take on NWA's ``Gangsta, Gangsta.''
</P>
<P>
   NWA, remember, included Dr. Dre. Are you starting to notice the
connection _ or, better yet, what's missing?
</P>
<P>
   ``Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told''
</P>
<P>
   Snoop Dogg. No Limit Records. 21 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: He may have dropped the Doggy, but on occasion
Snoop Dogg still has bite.

 &HT;    Tony Rich grows up: CD a fine effort, musically and lyrically

<P>
   When Tony Rich made his bow in 1996, many wrongly welcomed him
into the then newly titled ``retro soul'' category, a place where
other young and pioneering artists such as D'Angelo and Maxwell
dwelled.
</P>
<P>
   The funny thing was that ``soul,'' or black, radio slammed the
door on Rich and his acoustic guitar-based ``Nobody Knows.'' It
didn't have enough beat, enough ``bottom,'' programmers said, to be
played alongside Marvin Gaye-inspired Maxwell and the Hammond
organs and old Stevie Wonder sway of D'Angelo.
</P>
<P>
   It also wasn't this record. ``Birdseye'' is a beautiful
testament to Rich's musical and lyrical growth.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling the worn road of depicting the progression of a
relationship, it starts with the moment he walks into the Atlanta
Live club and sees a woman with Halle Berry's eyes (``Birdseye'').
In ``Silly Man,'' they're ``making love like instruments.'' Then,
after professing how happy he is (``If You're an Angel''), he
questions it on ``Bed of My Heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously, Rich successfully navigates his way through funk
(the title track), early Prince (``Cool Like That'') and soul
(``Blue Butterfly''), stalling only on a few retreads from his
quirky debut (``Ain't No Laughin' '').
</P>
<P>
   ``Birdseye''
</P>
<P>
   The Tony Rich Project. LaFace.
</P>
<P>
   10 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: The Tony Rich Project constructs an impressive
sophomore effort.

 &HT;    A comedy of errors results when one Lebowski is mistaken for
another.
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Big Lebowski'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   A shaggy ode to beer, bowling and bunging, this Coen brothers
comedy seems almost defiantly inconsequential after their
mesmerizing ``Fargo.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bridges plays a stoned bit of 1960s flotsam called the
Dude, though his real name is Jeff Lebowski. That's the problem.
There's another Jeff Lebowski, a rich old man whose gambling wife's
creditors crash the Dude's place by mistake ... and pee on his rug.
Demanding restitution from the big Lebowski, the Dude gets mixed up
with the tycoon's performance-artist daughter (Julianne Moore, with
a German accent), a gang of German nihilists with an attack ferret,
and, well, other things.
</P>
<P>
   The Coens seem to improvise the plot scene by scene, but their
hang-loose approach yields hilarious non sequiturs, bits of comic
bewilderment and a Busby Berkeley-style tribute to ninepins.
</P>
<P>
   The cast includes John Goodman as a 'Nam-vet pal who nudges the
Dude ever deeper into trouble; Steve Buscemi as a bowling buddy who
never gets to complete a sentence; and John Turturro in one of the
most bizarre cameos of the year. He plays a Latin, hairnetted,
purple-jumpsuit-wearing pedophile named Jesus. The peculiarity of
that one character alone should give you a sense of the movie's
wacky spirit. Grade: B

 &HT;    Mini reviews: The word on the latest video releases
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Man in the Iron Mask''(PG-13) _ Swooning teenagers might
rent it to see a double dose of Leonardo DiCaprio, playing royal
twins and wearing the worst fake whiskers Hollywood has to offer.
But the real, odd treat of this pleasant version of the Dumas tale
is the mix of actors playing the aging Three Musketeers: Jeremy
Irons, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu. How a Brit and an
American managed to get jobs working for King Louis is never
answered, but you'll be sufficiently distracted by the retro
swashbuckling. Grade: B -
</P>
<P>
   ``Niagara Niagara'' (R) _ Blame it on the Oscars. Robin Tunney
won an acting award at the Venice Film Festival for her turn as a
young woman with Tourette's syndrome. It's the latest example of
the confusion between acting and savvy displays of behavioral tics.
Tunney meets shy, awkward Henry Thomas, and they head toward
Toronto on a barely motivated road trip. Tragedy looms. While
Tunney throws herself impressively into the role, the movie falsely
suggests that Tourette's is somehow linked to mental illness.
Grade: C -
</P>
<P>
   ``An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn'' (R) _ Eric Idle
plays a director named Alan Smithee, which happens to be the
pseudonym used by filmmakers who disown their own work. That's what
Smithee wants to do with his ``Trio,'' an action film starring
Whoopi Goldberg, Sylvester Stallone and Jackie Chan (who show up as
themselves). That movie is supposed to be so bad that Smithee wants
to burn it, but anything would have to be better than this
gratingly lame satire of Hollywood, written by Joe Eszterhas, who
has given us such fine art films as ``Jade'' and ``Showgirls.'' In
one last jolt of irony, director Arthur Hiller removed his name
from this ``Player'' wannabe, so this really is an Alan Smithee
movie. Grade: F
</P>
<P>
   ``Senseless'' (R) _ Score one for truth in advertising. In this
sloppy, crude and, yes, senseless comedy, Marlon Wayans plays a
struggling college student who enrolls in an experimental drug
program to score some quick cash. The drugs give him supersensory
powers, but an overdose has the opposite result. The movie's
offensiveness _ it frequently stoops to bathroom humor _ would be
tolerable were it made with flair. But director Penelope Spheeris,
who brought a dash of panache to ``Wayne's World,'' is in
hack-for-hire mode here. Grade: D

 &HT;    COLUMN: Getting tired is a contemptible self-indulgence
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUGUST 16: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   My friend Betty says my trouble is that I take it personally
when I get tired. If fatigue ain't personal, what is? Betty rolls
her eyes and walks away.
</P>
<P>
   The inference is, there are occasions when you're supposed to be
tired. I don't believe it. I think weariness, the saggy, draggy
state where you can't pass a chair without wanting to sit down or
pass a bed without wanting to lie down, is pure self-indulgence.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I was taught by a tough, thoroughly unscientific
bunch of women who decried laziness like it was blackhearted
wickedness. They abhorred the idea of resting. When they heard that
my mother took afternoon naps _ and what could be more civilized? _
they acted like she had disgraced the family.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, more thoughtful than her sisters, decided my mother
must have been a throwback to some lily-handed, pallid,
sugar-mouthed no-better-than-she-should-be female ``On the Other
Side.'' That, of course, means the misguided souls who were so
ill-advised as to marry, instead of being born, into the family.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, I was curious about some near ancestor who took naps,
and I begged the aunts to tell me more.
</P>
<P>
   They were glad to, since her shame wouldn't spill over on them,
her being no kin. She came from a city, in the first place, and
that made her suspect right away. A woman with any gumption and
git-up-and-git would have been born on a farm.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't know how to cook, but the poor, beleaguered thing
tried. And there she made another fatal mistake. She put sugar in
her corn bread.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sugar in the corn bread!'' I cried. ``What's that got to do
with afternoon naps?''
</P>
<P>
   They acted like I had departed my senses _ another family
failing _ and let on that any fool could see both sugar in the corn
bread and afternoon naps are degenerate.
</P>
<P>
   I asked if she was a pretty woman and if her husband and
children loved her. They wouldn't even give her that. She was
tallow-faced and spiritless, too limp to take a stand on anything.
They left her, her husband and sons did, taking up with a woman who
owned her own ox and plow and could cuss like a man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my,'' I said, shocked. ``How terrible!''
</P>
<P>
   It was all right, they said. She was taking a nap when they left
and was too dumb to notice they were missing when she woke up.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, I can't believe these aunts are accurate in their
theory about laziness.
</P>
<P>
   I had to find out after I was full-grown that my mother was
wrong about depression. If you claimed you were depressed, she
would cry, ``No such thing! Go wash your hair and take a walk.
That'll take care of depression.'' Now I find out from my friends
who go to doctors that depression is a real illness like hives or
buck fever. You don't even have to apologize for having it.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe I can be tired. Personally tired, that is. But I don't
like it. It upsets me to see grass and weeds taking over my yard.
</P>
<P>
   I believe, like I believe in the Pledge of Allegiance to the
flag, that nature never intended you to leave a bed unmade and
dishes in the sink when you walk out of your house.
</P>
<P>
   But I do, and the next thing that happens probably will be
afternoon naps taking ahold of me.

 &HT;    An Alabama professor and 7,000 Yankee-loathing, God-fearing
confederates want the South to do it again
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUGUST 16: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUSCALOOSA, Ala. -- Nathan Bedford Forrest doesn't get many
kudos these days. The brilliant Confederate general was also a
slave trader and grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, and his name has
become so sullied by its association with racism that vandals have
declared war on the monument at his grave in Memphis. So his
admirers took no chances last month when they unveiled a new
tribute to Forrest in Nashville _ a 25-foot-tall statue showing the
Rebel on horseback leading a charge, sword in one hand, pistol in
the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used a special finish,'' says sculptor Jack Kershaw. ``The
graffiti wipes right off.''
</P>
<P>
   On dedication day, the Overton High School auditorium filled
with 400 uniformed re-enactors and other Confederate sympathizers.
When the master of ceremonies asked them to stand for the national
anthem, a guitarist began to strum the tune that every American
knows by heart. Not ``The Star-Spangled Banner''; he played
</P>
<P>
   ``Dixie.''
</P>
<P>
   Then it was time for the keynote speaker. Michael Hill would
never be mistaken for Bedford Forrest. At 46, Hill is a history
professor with a retreating hairline, a beard going gray and a soft
drawl with impeccable manners to match. He has never served in the
military or ridden with the Klan, yet he deeply identifies with the
fierce Confederate cavalryman and is attempting in his fashion to
``keep the skeer'' on the Yankees, as the unpolished Forrest once
put it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be no peace until we are a separate and free people
again,'' Hill told the faithful in a low, forceful tone, his tall
frame towering over the microphone. ``The day of apologizing for
the conduct of our Confederate ancestors is over.''
</P>
<P>
   When the yips and whoops died down, the meaning of his words
hung in the air like smoke after a musket shot. A separate people?
Surely he wasn't resurrecting the ``S'' word that started the
shooting six score and 17 years ago?
</P>
<P>
   He most certainly was. Hill is president of the League of the
South, an Alabama-based organization that claims almost 7,000
members and wants the former Confederate states to finish what they
started in 1861 by revisiting the option of secession. (Or, in the
words of a popular bumper sticker: ``If at first you don't secede,
try, try again.'') When Hill isn't defending the Lost Cause _ and
here comes one of those exquisite ironies that sprout through the
cracks of the South like pokeweed _ he's a professor at Stillman
College, a Presbyterian school in Tuscaloosa whose student body is
98 percent black.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a puzzle to many of us on the faculty,'' says his
colleague R.L. Guffin, a humanities professor.
</P>
<P>
   They take their stand
</P>
<P>
   Hill and a group of like-minded scholars conceived the League
four years ago. They were frustrated by Washington's expanding
power, angry over the federal siege at Waco, Texas, alarmed by the
accelerating attacks on Confederate symbols, concerned about the
homogenization of Southern culture. They were also inspired by the
breakup of the Soviet Union and the growth of separatist movements
from Quebec to Tibet; in fact, they took their name from one of
them, the Northern League of Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The organization has spread beyond the former Confederacy to
chapters in 27 states. The membership _ lawyers, doctors, farmers
and everything else from preachers to professors _ stays in touch
via the league's Web site (www.dixienet.org). The computer screen
greets them with partisan songs such as ``The Bonnie Blue Flag''
and keeps them apprised of ``heritage violations'' such as the
proposal to remove the Confederate battle flag from the South
Carolina state Capitol. All communication is carried out with
British spelling (``honourable'') because the American standard was
set by a New Englander, Noah Webster. Many Leaguers also refuse to
recite the Pledge of Allegiance (they have problems with ``one
nation, indivisible'') or use a ZIP code (they call it the Yankee
Occupation Code).
</P>
<P>
   While much of this may sound like symbolic tomfoolery, there is
a serious philosophical dissent behind it. Like the Fugitive poets
who published ``I'll Take My Stand'' in 1930, the league holds that
the South has a distinctive agrarian tradition that ought to be
preserved. And like conservatives today, the league argues that the
central government has gobbled the powers of the states and one day
will find itself threatened by devolutionary movements in
disaffected regions such as the Mountain West and the South. ``We
will be an independent nation, and trust me, our capital will not
be Atlanta,'' says Lake High, chairman of the South Carolina
chapter.
</P>
<P>
   Others are drawn to the league for darker reasons. ``We get
calls from people who think we're some kind of racial thing or a
militia group,'' Hill says. ``I've had to kick out some former
Klansmen. Any movement is going to get bad apples.''
</P>
<P>
   One of them may have dropped into the league's annual conference
in Birmingham last month. Gordon Mellish, a new member from
Clemmons, N.C., explained that he had joined because he felt
victimized by affirmative action and stagnant property values in
the integrated neighborhood where he used to live. ``The niggers
ruined it,'' he said. ``They made a racist out of me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Poverty Law Center, an Alabama civil rights
organization that keeps track of hate groups, has called Hill a
``gussied-up theocrat,'' but does not consider the League a hate
group. ``They're not dangerous in the sense that they're going to
blow up buildings or beat up black people,'' says the Center's Mark
Potok. ``The danger is that they give a false veneer of legitimacy
to bigoted views.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a charge that Hill hears frequently. He addresses it again
as he lights a Backwoods cigar during an interview in a Tuscaloosa
coffee shop. He's had telephone death threats and doesn't like
having reporters visit his home, where he keeps the League's
office. Yes, he thinks the South should have been left alone to
handle slavery and segregation as it saw fit; yes, he opposes civil
rights laws on principle; no, he's not for slavery or Jim Crow
statutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe, under any circumstances, that the government
has the right to push people together or keep them apart,'' Hill
says. ``If blacks and whites in the South had been allowed to work
it out for themselves (during the civil rights movement), it might
have taken a little more time, but the outcome would have been
better. Instead, a lot of people were poking their noses into our
business, and they were probably just trying to cover up the mess
in their backyards.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Celts and Crackers
</P>
<P>
   If Hill sounds testy about Northern civil rights workers,
perhaps it has something to do with his family's first encounter
with outside agitators. Hill grew up in Winfield, a small town in
northwestern Alabama, where his father ran a building supplies
business and his mother worked as a church secretary. During the
Civil War, according to an old family story, his great grandmother
took up an ax and faced down a pack of Union soldiers who wanted to
steal her food. Michael loved war stories, loved to read history,
loved to run through the woods imagining himself as a Rebel, with a
stick for a rifle.
</P>
<P>
   After high school, Hill attended community college and then
enrolled down the road at the University of Alabama. He met a Selma
girl, got married and dropped out to drive a truck for his father.
At his wife's urging, he returned to school and eventually earned a
master's degree and doctorate in history. He was greatly influenced
by one of his teachers, Grady McWhiney, a well-known historian
whose book ``Cracker Culture'' attributes the character of white
Southerners to their origins as freedom-craving Celts in the
British Isles. Hill made Celtic studies his specialty; he's written
two books on Celtic warfare and counts ``Braveheart'' as one of his
favorite films.
</P>
<P>
   As he began his teaching career at Stillman, Hill gradually
became acquainted with a circle of conservative Southern thinkers _
journalists like Thomas Fleming, editor of the magazine Chronicles,
and academics like Clyde Wilson, a University of South Carolina
historian who is an authority on the proto-states' righter John C.
Calhoun. In June 1994, Hill summoned 40 of them to Tuscaloosa for a
three-day organizational meeting at the Best Western motel. It was
the year of the Angry White Male, and their sessions were no
exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were at each other's throats,'' Hill remembers.
</P>
<P>
   One topic of debate was what constitutes a Southerner: Could a
Yankee join the League? A black person? ``We had a discussion about
whether blacks could be Southerners, and we decided that of course
they could,'' says Gary Mills, a University of Alabama historian.
``But we knew that blacks would probably be leery of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill believes the League has some black members but isn't
certain. The one black academic invited to the first meeting didn't
come. A dozen or so others who did come immediately seceded from
the group, and the remainder founded the League.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for hostilities to commence.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Stillman, Hill was teaching part-time at the
University of Alabama. A student chapter formed there and quickly
raised hackles when its leader marched into a professor's office
and reprimanded her for teaching anti-South propaganda. ``He took
me to task for saying that slavery was a sin,'' says Diane Roberts,
an English professor and sixth-generation Southerner. She wrote
about the incident in a magazine article and criticized the League
in newspaper columns and commentaries for National Public Radio.
Hill has come to regard Roberts as such a thorn in the side that he
posted a letter on the Web site this summer condemning her
``hysterical crusade'' and calling her a ``Jacobin.'' (That's
history prof talk for a radical.)
</P>
<P>
   The notoriety cost Hill. After the League started getting
negative publicity, the university dropped him as an adjunct
professor. ``They said it was budget, but I'm sure it was because
of the League,'' he says. ``You can be a Marxist or a homosexual,
but you can't be pro-Confederate.''
</P>
<P>
   Juggling the black, white and gray
</P>
<P>
   Stillman College, on the other side of Tuscaloosa, was in a more
awkward position. Hill had been there since 1981 and was tenured.
Furthermore, he had served as faculty president and was considered
an exemplary classroom teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the finest young Christian family men I'd ever
met,'' says Stillman president emeritus Cordell Wynn, who hired
Hill. ``I used to joke at faculty meetings that Michael was all
right for a white guy. We were very close, and I was very much hurt
to see him identified with the League.''
</P>
<P>
   Wynn and Hill had heartfelt conversations about the matter. The
administrator had grown up in segregation and once had been turned
away from the University of Georgia because of his race. After the
school desgregated, he was admitted and earned his doctorate there.
``I told him, 'Michael, if your group had its way, I never would
have attended the university,''' Wynn says. ``And he said, 'Oh, no,
that's not what I'm advocating.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hill says he was approached by another Stillman administrator 2
1/2 years ago about the possibility of taking a leave or resigning.
Hill replied with a letter proposing severence terms. He has heard
nothing else about it.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn retired in 1997 and was succeeded by Ernest McNealey, a
native Alabamian who had spent years in the North and was
astonished, upon his return, to find that he had a flaming
secessionist in his employ. He says the Hill controversy has
embarrassed Stillman and, judging from conversations with parents,
has cost it some students. But he isn't looking to fire the
professor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The views he articulates are somewhat pathetic and sad,''
McNealey says, ``but the right to speak your mind is part of
academic freedom. We have no complaints from students. As long as
he behaves himself on campus, we have no legal mechanism to limit
his activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill vows that he maintains a wall between the League and his
duties at Stillman. When students ask about the organization,
usually after class, he answers their questions. Otherwise, he
doesn't discuss it. Eyebrows may raise when he drives his red
Toyota pickup onto campus _ the one with the ``Free the South''
bumper sticker across the back _ but no one has made an issue of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Hill runs the League from a converted dining room in his ranch
house in suburban Tuscaloosa. Sara, his wife of 24 years, is his
secretary and bookkeeper. His 16-hour work days leave little time
for hobbies _ just tending a vegetable garden and reading history
and the Bible. The Hills are deeply religious and belong to the
conservative Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church. They decided
to home-school their youngest daughter, the only of three left in
the nest, after she came home complaining that her public school
teachers were running down the South. Her parents try to keep her
away from TV, too. ``I don't immerse myself in the modern world
anymore than I have to,'' Hill says.
</P>
<P>
   Should he want to withdraw himself further, the League is trying
to help. The members are raising money to pay him a salary in case
he ever elects to quit Stillman and devote himself full-time to the
cause. They call it the ``Free Michael'' fund.
</P>
<P>
   Two words: Confederate underwear
</P>
<P>
   When the Southern independence movement gathered for its annual
conference last month, the scene was rich with irony. The
latter-day Confederates met in a four-star hotel attached to a
shopping mall at the intersection of two federal interstate
highways in the suburbs of Birmingham, a city that didn't exist
when Lee surrendered at Appomattox.
</P>
<P>
   It was not your rough-and-tumble re-enactor crowd. There was
khaki and seersucker galore but very little butternut twill among
the 350 Leaguers who registered. While a few would have looked at
home in a Civil War tintype _ the men with their facial shrubbery,
the women with their hair in Victorian buns _ most of the group
could have passed for Rotarians. That is, until you walked from the
lobby into the ballroom, where Rebel flags draped the podium and a
portrait of Jefferson Davis fronted the lectern. On the far side of
the hall, a dozen vendors peddled everything from Confederate
underwear to Confederate pillow shams to Confederate literature
(''If you think Bill Clinton has a character problem,'' read one
book come-on, ``take a look at Abraham Lincoln'').
</P>
<P>
   For two days, members attended workshops and listened as a
succession of witty and sometimes hot-headed orators decried the
federal government, public schools and a host of other bugaboos. In
the president's address, Hill was coolly professorial as he quoted
Locke and Hobbes in railing against the ``Godless unitary state.''
But then he trained his fire on a target closer to home. ``Most
Southerners don't have the stomach for this,'' he said. ``They're
fat, lazy and happy.'' They'd rather worry, he continued, about
buying a new bass boat than establishing a true constitutional
government.
</P>
<P>
   The target may have hit closer to home than Hill thought. During
a break, as a few Leaguers and spouses headed off to the mall to
shop, one of the organization's board members told a story. ``One
time,'' said Thomas Fleming, ``I suggested that everyone burn their
$5 bills as a protest against Lincoln. No one took me up on it. I
guess sacrificing five Yankee dollars was too much to ask.''

 &HT;    Secession: do they mean it?
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUGUST 16: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The League of the South describes itself as
``paleo-conservative,'' with a states' rights fundamentalism that
makes members almost as contemptuous of Newt Gingrich as Bill
Clinton. If it were up the states of the former Confederacy, says
league president Michael Hill, there would be no abortion, no
income tax, no gun control, no gay rights, no affirmative action
and no restrictions on prayer in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   As controversial as those stands are, the league position that
has attracted the most attention is the call for secession. Are
these people serious?
</P>
<P>
   Yes ... but no one's unstacking arms.
</P>
<P>
   Different members interpret secession differently. Some take it
literally, foreseeing a Southern nation. Others see it as a tool to
pressure Washington into restoring power to the states in keeping
with the original sense of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Central authority is devolving around the world,'' says Donald
Livingston, an Emory University(Ga.) philosophy professor who heads
the league's educational committee. ``Why should the United States,
the last 19th-century empire, be an exception?''
</P>
<P>
   The league does not advocate rebellion or civil disobedience,
Hill says. ``We're not so foolish as to believe we can run out on
the street and yell, `Secession!' and have people fall in line.
What we're really about now is to articulate a good defense of
secession. To educate people and recruit candidates to run for
local office. We think the South would be better off as an
independent nation, but we realize it's not likely to happen
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Not judging from the poll numbers, anyway. For the past six
years, the University of North Carolina's Institute for Research in
Social Science has surveyed Southerners on whether they think their
region should be a separate nation. Secessionist sentiment has
ranged from 5 percent to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   John Shelton Reed, the institute's director, points out that the
league wasn't organized until the rise of attacks on Confederate
heroes and the Confederate battle flag _ symbols that had gone more
or less unchallenged for a century. ``I think this is as much about
defending a version of history,'' he says, ``as about attaining
Southern independence.''

 &HT;    Pearls of wisdom
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUGUST 16: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   They're classy little numbers that can come in white, cream,
even black. And while they're not known as a girl's best friend,
the right set of pearls can make all the difference in the world
when paired with a smart black dress, dangled from a Cartier
pendant or pinned on a Bill Blass jacket lapel.
</P>
<P>
   But these lustrous gems are going through rough waters.
</P>
<P>
   For the past three years, something has been killing up to 70
percent of the pearl oysters in Japan, the world's largest
pearl-producing country. Pearl dealers cite a number of culprits _
climate changes, chemical pollutants, viruses and red tide (a
discoloration of sea waters caused by microscopic organisms). Those
affected are the classic round white pearls between 3 and 9
millimeters.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage is so severe that cultivators and importers
recently held a conference in New York to discuss the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shortage is in high-quality Akoya pearls,'' says Frank
Mastoloni, a New York pearl wholesaler. ``Just getting enough is a
problem. Smaller, less expensive Akoyas cultured in China are not
affected. Neither are South Sea pearls.''
</P>
<P>
   So what does this mean for prospective pearl buyers?
</P>
<P>
   There's no time like the present to make the mother of all pearl
purchases for a bride, a graduate or, dare we say, for that special
someone for the holidays?
</P>
<P>
   As for prices, Devin Macnow, executive director of the Cultured
Pearl Information Center, says consumers can expect about a $300 to
$800 increase for cultured pearl necklaces.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Ross of H. Stern Jewelers in New York reports that their
stores are not raising pearl prices at this time. ``We have plenty
of pearl necklaces and bracelets, from $300 to over $1 million,''
he says. ``But if the supply does get worse, this could affect the
price.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Maier &AMP; Berkele jewelers is also not raising prices of
pearls in stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything new that comes in probably will be at a higher
price,'' says Eric Tyree, jewelry manager.
</P>
<P>
   According to Tom Carroll of Tiffany &AMP; Co. in Atlanta, the
jewelry store raised pearl items earlier in the year less than 10
percent and does not anticipate any more price increases this year.
</P>
<P>
   Says Ross, ``Now might be the time to buy that significant other
that strand of pearls or head to the attic and unearth Granny's
pearls.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: `Air Bud' latest in line of lovable four-legged stars
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the dog days of summer. No wonder our thoughts turn to
things furry and four-pawed. The people who made ``Air Bud: Golden
Receiver'' understand this. On Friday, they're bringing us the
further adventures of the athletically inclined golden retriever.
Let's think back on all those tales _ and tails _ that we remember
... of puppy love at the movies.
</P>
<P>
   CARTOON CANINES
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Lady and the Tramp'' (1955): Later remade with a human cast
and called ``Titanic.'' But Jack and Rose's sketching scene has
nothing on these pooches' spaghetti dinner. Listen for the one and
only Peggy Lee, who not only sings as the sultry pound-hound Peg
(``He's a Tramp'') but also provides the unforgettable voices of
the Siamese cats (``We are Siameeese, if you pleeeease'').
</P>
<P>
   -- ``One Hundred and One Dalmatians'' (1961): A movie that makes
you glad you're seeing spots before your eyes. It took 300 Disney
animators and three years to complete this story of the fur-hungry
Cruella De Vil and the pups she tries to convert into a coat. Do
not, under any circumstance, rent the live-action remake by
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Balto'' (1995): An underrated animated adventure based on
the true story of the sled dog who, in 1925, carried lifesaving
anti-diptheria serum to sick children in Nome, Alaska. The voices
include Bob Hoskins, Bridget Fonda, Phil Collins and, in an
animated moment of six degrees of ... Kevin Bacon as Balto.
</P>
<P>
   Other top dogs: ``The Fox and the Hound,'' ``All Dogs Go to
Heaven,'' Pluto, Goofy ...
</P>
<P>
   SUPPORTING PUPS
</P>
<P>
   -- Asta in the ``The Thin Man'' (1934): Asta, the wire-haired
terrier belonging to Nick and Nora Charles (William Powell and
Myrna Loy), was as fashionably art deco as his owners' apartment.
``The Thin Man,'' which spawned three sequels, offers a still
irresistibly breezy mix of murder, marriage and martini-laced
banter. Loy later recalled that several terriers played Asta and
that the first one, known off-camera as Skippy, bit her.
</P>
<P>
   -- Matisse in ``Down and Out in Beverly Hills'' (1986): It's not
easy to upstage Nick Nolte, Richard Dreyfuss and Bette Midler, but
a border collie named Mike managed the near-impossible in Paul
Mazursky's comedy of manners about the idle, overprivileged rich of
Beverly Hills. Like David Bowie, Matisse/Mike had one blue eye and
one brown eye. But has Bowie ever had his own stunt double? Mike
did: a look-alike named Davey who handled the heavy running and
jumping scenes.
</P>
<P>
   -- Jed in ``The Journey of Natty Gann'' (1985): A very young
John Cusack co-stars with Meredith Salenger in this fine family
flick about an adolescent girl traveling cross-country during the
Depression with her wolf companion, Jed. Actually, Jed was only
part wolf (and part malamute), but that half was enough for his
trainer to turn down a guest shot on ``The Tonight Show.'' The
trainer explained that Jed's mixed heritage made it difficult for
him to relate to people.
</P>
<P>
   Other top dogs: Jack Nicholson's Brussels griffon in ``As Good
as It Gets,'' Jim Carrey's Jack Russell terrier in ``The Mask,''
William Hurt's Welsh corgi in ``The Accidental Tourist.''
</P>
<P>
   SERIOUS DOG STARS
</P>
<P>
   -- Benji: He made his feature debut in 1974's ``Benji'' and was
once called ``the most appealing short actor since Dustin
Hoffman.'' Actually, the original Benji starred in only one movie;
his daughter did the rest, including the mega-star mutt's PG
breakthrough, ``Oh, Heavenly Dog'' (1980). Chevy Chase is a
murdered private eye who comes back as Benji to find his killer.
Sort of like Patrick Swayze and Whoopi Goldberg in ``Ghost.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Rin Tin Tin: Rescued as a pup from World War I Germany by his
owner-trainer, Lee Duncan, the heroically photogenic German
shepherd starred in numerous silents in the 1920s and was, for
several years, Warner Bros.' major wage-earner. Rinty's films
aren't easy to find, but a good alternative is ``Won Ton Ton _ The
Dog Who Saved Hollywood'' (1976), a spoof of his career and '20s
Hollywood, starring Bruce Dern, Madeline Kahn and Art Carney.
</P>
<P>
   -- Old Yeller, a.k.a. Spike: Get out your handkerchiefs. This is
the sort of story that scars kids for life, but that doesn't mean
they can't take it. ``Old Yeller'' (1957) is a boy-and-his-dog
story with real bite. Set in Texas in 1869, it's about the effect a
stray dog named Old Yeller (Spike) has on a lonely boy (Kevin
Corcoran) and his rural family. The cast is family-fare first-rate,
including Fess Parker (a.k.a. Davy Crockett) and Dorothy McGuire as
Corcoran's parents. The action scenes were directed by Yakima
Canutt, who staged the chariot race in ``Ben-Hur.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Let's talk Lassie: As almost everyone knows, the original
Lassie was actually a guy-collie named Pal who got his chance when
the original female lead shed her coat. The classic Lassie film has
to be the first, ``Lassie Come Home'' (1943), based on the popular
story by Eric Knight. But given the wave of Word War II nostalgia
sparked by ``Saving Private Ryan,'' a more interesting choice might
be ``Courage of Lassie'' (1946), in which Lassie/Pal _ here called
Bill for some reason _ plays a shell-shocked combat veteran
rehabilitated by a young Elizabeth Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Other top dogs: ``Beethoven'' (actually, ``Beethoven's 2nd'' is
better), ``White Fang,'' ``Greyfriars Bobby,'' ``Homeward Bound:
The Incredible Journey'' (the 1993 version with the voices of Don
Ameche, Sally Field and Michael J. Fox).
</P>
<P>
   Finally, some of you may be wondering about ``Dog Day
Afternoon'' (1975). Star Al Pacino is plenty furry _ hey, it's the
'70s _ but he still doesn't qualify as canine.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Sierra Nevada, Red Brick are summer standouts
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most people I know are ready to kiss summer goodbye if not, in
fact, kick it out the door. Who says the livin' is easy? Not when
it's this hot, not when it's this muggy and buggy. Alas, there's
another month or more left, and there are also all those summer
beers competing for attention.
</P>
<P>
   What exactly is a summer beer anyway?
</P>
<P>
   It's easy enough to see why a crackling fire and the cold of
winter turn the mind toward thoughts of hearty stouts and porters.
Even a Scottish ale, more malty than hoppy, is suited to the snow
season.
</P>
<P>
   But many people _ myself included _ drink the same beers in
summer that they drink in winter. With a certain kind of meal, I
want a certain kind of beer. One evening calls for an India Pale
Ale (quite a few evenings call for IPAs, frankly), another for a
Vienna lager. None of them will say ``Summer Brew'' on the label.
</P>
<P>
   But seasonal beers are in, and are likely to stay in. They add
variety and interest. With summer beers, you have to imagine
yourself on the deck. Or at Turner Field. Think ballgames and
barbecues. That's what these beers are made for, and it's to be
expected that some would do it better than others.
</P>
<P>
   A late-summer sample of eight such beers illustrated how varied
they can be. The eight, in no particular order, were Dogwood Summer
Brew, Samuel Adams Summer Ale, Sierra Nevada Summerfest, Sierra
Nevada Wheat beer, Pete's Summer Brew, Red Brick Summer Brew, Bert
Grant's Summer Ale and Redhook Blonde Ale.
</P>
<P>
   A minor masterpiece
</P>
<P>
   Seven of those are ales _ ironic when you consider that if
``summer beer'' suggests anything, it's crispness.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's not surprising, then, that the one lager in the
group, Sierra Nevada Summerfest, stood out. This is a minor
masterpiece of brewing, a light (but not Lite) lager, soft on the
palate and yet firm enough to stand up to spicier summer foods. The
Saaz hops give it a faintly floral aroma, entirely different from
the citrusy, Cascades character that most people associate with
Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a beer that would make me forget Sierra Nevada Pale
Ale. But the person who's not ventured much beyond mass-market
lagers can see just how well that style can be made. It's beer, not
barley pop. And it's an example of a pioneering craft brewery in
Chico, Calif., one whose reputation was built on pale ales, showing
Bud-Miller-Coors how to do it right.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to think everything Sierra Nevada attempts comes off
as a masterpiece. But the Sierra Nevada Wheat, for the aficionado,
falls a tad short of expectations _ which is to say it's likely to
suit most people just fine. It's a clean-tasting, unfiltered beer,
made from 50 percent wheat malt and 50 percent malted barley, and
its slightly tangy taste comes partly from the Strissel Spaltz
hops. ``I came across them a few years ago in the Alsace _ in
France _ when I was looking for a replacement for Saaz,'' says
Steve Dresler, head brewer at Sierra Nevada. ``I don't think
they're that, though. They have a character all their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing how well Sierra Nevada can turn out a lager or a
lighter-bodied wheat beer only confirms its stature as a
world-class brewery. But the real surprise was seeing how well Red
Brick Summer Brew stood up to the competition. Along with last
year's Christmas ale, this is the best beer the Atlanta brewery has
produced. One of the reasons is the Ahtanum hop that Brian
Buckowski, head brewer at Red Brick, found last year in Washington
state. The Ahtanum gives this light-to-medium-bodied beer a
subtlety found in few other beers.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Redhook Blonde Ale brings more to the palate, but
there's nothing obviously seasonal about it. A person not into
hoppy ales can enjoy this well-made beer anytime. And if you're
going to buy the Blonde, why not buy the far more interesting
Redhook Rye, a year-round beer I call The Perfect Deck Beer?
</P>
<P>
   More than lemonade
</P>
<P>
   The same problem arises with Samuel Adams Summer Ale. It's
spiced with lemon and Grains of Paradise, leading some to think
it's a Belgian White Ale. It's not, and it's not as complex or
spicy as Samuel Adams White Ale, introduced as a seasonal last
winter and now offered year-round.
</P>
<P>
   A Belgian White can accompany light lunches on a patio perfectly
(fruit and shrimp salads especially), and Samuel Adams' White Ale
is a good one. But so, too, is the locally made Dogwood Summer
Brew. The Samuel Adams has more bite; the Dogwood is a touch
sweeter and maybe more interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to a couple of beers that are neither
interesting nor summery. Pete's Summer Ale has a hint of lemon, but
so what? Like most of the beers under the Pete's label, it's
ordinary _ neither bad nor good.
</P>
<P>
   Bert Grant's Summer Ale, the fourth in this Yakima, Wash.,
brewer's seasonal offerings, is made with Chinook hops, which are
meant to impart a certain zestiness. What's most noticeable,
unfortunately, is the well-known flavor of Bert Grant's house
yeast. Grant is a deservedly laureled pioneer in hop development,
and his best beers _ the Imperial Stout and the excellent Scottish
Ale _ are the ones with enough hops to override that flavor. Call
it ``house character,'' if you want, but it's not for me.
</P>
<P>
   And that's as it should be. Not every kind of cheese satisfies
everyone equally, and neither should every kind of beer. For every
Sierra Nevada, there are three others that are just something to
drink on a hot afternoon. When that's the case, lemonade does it
just as well. A beer has to do something more.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Unflinching Dubus reveals hardship's redemptive power
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUGUST 16: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The name Andre Dubus rings fewer bells than it should. There are
those for whom it elicits reverence, both for his nine works of
short fiction and his passionate, unpitying essays. But he is not a
brand name in the bookstore, as predictable as he is recyclable.
There are writers who are read because they have become
well-marketed commodities, and others because they have something
to say. Dubus is the latter.
</P>
<P>
   His prose is intensely personal but makes no concessions to
fashion. He writes of the physical and spiritual, and how the one
feeds on the other; about the futility, sometimes, of a faith he
has not lost; about drawing bad cards in life.
</P>
<P>
   His own luck changed one night in July of 1986, and his life
changed with it. He was driving home from Boston when he came upon
a car broken down on the road, a young man and a woman with a
bloodied forehead standing beside it. ``He had a habit of stopping
when he saw people in trouble,'' his friend Tobias Wolff wrote in
the introduction to ``Broken Vessels,'' Dubus' collection of
nonfiction that was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping, Dubus got the young man to help him push the car onto
the shoulder of the road. Moments later another car came around a
curve, hitting Dubus and killing the other man. Dubus was struck as
he was shoving the woman out of the way. To save another's life he
lost a leg.
</P>
<P>
   He has been in a wheelchair ever since, an amputee who insists
on calling himself a cripple. For Dubus, there is no honor in
euphemisms or in evasions of hard truth. There is honor, as Wolff
writes, only in ``facing his situation honestly.''
</P>
<P>
   Real people, surmounting obstacles
</P>
<P>
   Dubus' new collection of essays, ``Meditations From a Movable
Chair'' (Knopf, $23), extends many of the themes that gave ``Broken
Vessels'' its emotional power. These are stories of real people,
sometimes of Dubus himself, struggling to live, to surmount one
obstacle after another, to succeed knowing there is every chance of
failure. In most of these pieces, religion _ or rather God _ looms
in the background. Dubus believes in God and he believes in ghosts,
and sees no contradiction.
</P>
<P>
   Life, after all, is contradictory, evil often canceling out good
in spite of priests and prayers. He has no patience with
sentimentality. Neither does he flinch from the horrors we
customarily mask with discretion. In the first of these 25 essays
he tells of his sister being raped. She has called from South
Louisiana, where Dubus grew up:
</P>
<P>
   ``In Massachusetts, I sit in my wheelchair and listen; I see her
face as though she is in the room.
</P>
<P>
   ```I said ``God bless you'' to him,' she says. `While it was
going on.' I think of Christ nailed to wood, my sister spiked to
the earth on her lawn. `I prayed for him Sunday, at Mass.'''
</P>
<P>
   She prayed for him but would also have castrated him. Would have
killed him. While he was raping her, he asked where her daughter
was, and said he might rape her too:
</P>
<P>
   ``She says if he had raped her daughter, she would have killed
him. I try to imagine her killing a big man. I can. I know a woman
whose small son was sinking in mud at the beach. Wooden pallets
were stacked on the wharf; she laid them in a line to her son,
crawled out on them, and saved him. When she tried to return the
pallets, she could not lift one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Learning to take nothing for granted
</P>
<P>
   Grace does more than sanctify; it can also transform, making the
weak strong. From his wheelchair, Dubus observes even more acutely
than in his fiction, most of it written when he was swaggeringly
physical. In his late 50s, he no longer takes anything for granted,
least of all life. In even the most casual of these pieces _ on
encountering Kurt Vonnegut, Ralph Ellison and Norman Mailer while
he was still a young writer, or one on writing workshops _ there is
an undertone of purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose wells up sometimes into a galvanizing demand that
something tangible come from all those prayers. In ``Broken
Vessels,'' he tells of his daughter crying inconsolably and his
inability to help her. It was shortly after he lost his leg, his
wife is in the hospital with a new baby and he's in his wheelchair.
The daughter, sick with chickenpox, cannot visit the hospital, and
help from above is not forthcoming:
</P>
<P>
   ``I lay helpless on my back, wanting to rise, and hold her in my
arms, and walk with her, and I yelled at the ceiling, the night sky
above it: You come down from that cross and give this child some
peace!''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Meditations From a Movable Chair,'' Dubus has found a
measure of peace himself, but no one would call it tranquillity. In
Dubus' life, every situation _ physical and spiritual _ presents
hardship, not only because he is an amputee but also because it's
his nature to butt his head against hard walls. Facing reality
doesn't mean you accept it meekly. Andre Dubus confronts it
squarely and makes the most of it.

 &HT;    In a wrenching memoir, the son of poet James Dickey comes to
terms with his dad's flawed genius
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUGUST 16: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It would have been easy for Christopher Dickey to write a
mean-spirited ``Daddy Dearest'' memoir of his famous father, the
poet and novelist James Dickey. All the horror stories were there:
the alcoholism, the womanizing, the emotional abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Dickey had lived through the glory years of the 1960s,
when his father barnstormed the country as a prize-winning poet.
And he had lived through the depressing years of his father's
destructive second marriage, when every conversation seemed to be
filtered through an alcoholic haze.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was a great poet, a famous novelist, a powerful
intellect, and a son of a bitch I hated,'' Dickey says in ``Summer
of Deliverance: A Memoir of Father and Son'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster,
$24). The younger Dickey became a foreign correspondent so he could
get as far away from his father as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 20 years, he filed dispatches for The Washington
Post and Newsweek from Egypt, Iran and El Salvador, wrote three
books, and kept his meetings with his father brief and on neutral
ground.
</P>
<P>
   What disturbed him, more than the anger, was that he still loved
his father at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept finding that everything, no matter what project I
undertook, tended to turn itself toward the question of fathers and
sons,'' says Dickey, who now runs Newsweek's Paris bureau. ``I
figured somebody was trying to tell me something. Then my wife told
me that I had to go back home and quit having those painful little
encounters that lasted only a few minutes sometimes. So we went to
South Carolina in the summer of '94 and spent a few days. It was
painful, but we got the momentum going.''
</P>
<P>
   They talked about the future, especially about how important
James Dickey's daughter Bronwen (Chris' half sister) was to him.
And they talked about the past, including that summer nearly 25
years earlier when ``Deliverance,'' the elder Dickey's best-selling
novel, was made into a movie and all the pent-up forces of
self-destruction within him were unleashed like the waters of the
Chattooga River.
</P>
<P>
   ``After `Deliverance,' it was no longer enough for him to write
muscular, virile poetry,'' Dickey says by telephone from Paris.
``There was an expectation that he would live it.''
</P>
<P>
   James Dickey, who died in 1997, became as much a part of legend
as his compelling tale of four suburbanites who plunge into a
nightmare on a North Georgia canoe trip. The Atlanta native
exaggerated his college athletic feats, lied about having been a
pilot (he was a navigator), and created a macho facade to match
Hemingway's.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had no respect for the journalistic sense of the truth,''
says Dickey, 46. ``If you're telling a story, and you tell someone,
`I was a pilot over the Pacific,' it's easier than saying you were
the second guy in the plane.''
</P>
<P>
   The lying and boasting escalated when director John Boorman
invaded Rabun County with a film crew and actors Burt Reynolds, Jon
Voight, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox. Invited at first to act as an
adviser, the author was soon banished from the set because he made
Boorman and Reynolds nervous. Eventually, he was given a bit part
as the local sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, when the film was released, Dickey had slipped
into a permanent role as macho outdoorsman. ``He wore his
purple-fringed leather jacket and his big Stetson hat with the
pheasant-feather band,'' the younger Dickey recalls in his book.
``Sometimes long strands of hair that he combed over the top of his
balding head would come loose and drop down over one ear, giving
him the look of a cowboy who had been half scalped.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Braselton, a longtime friend of the poet-novelist's, agrees
that the success of the movie changed James Dickey: ``After
`Deliverance,' he quit listening. Up until then, he took everything
in and used it in his writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Braselton, a Rome writer who was one of the poet's companions on
the canoe trip that was the inspiration for ``Deliverance,'' says
Chris Dickey's portrait of his father is not exaggerated. ``He did
drink a lot, and in his later years his stories got repetitive and
boring, but he was the smartest man I ever met,'' Braselton says.
``There were so many facets of Jim Dickey. He was like Stone
Mountain: Your impression of it depends on which side you approach
it from.''
</P>
<P>
   Braselton says his friend was always worried about not
fulfilling his fate. ``As for his drinking, he told me, `Alcohol
may be an artificial joy, but an artificial joy is better than no
joy at all.'''
</P>
<P>
   The drinking increased when James' wife, Maxine, died and he
married one of his students. Rumors of the new Mrs. Dickey's
cocaine addiction and physical abuse of her husband made their way
across the Atlantic. By the time the son decided to attempt a
reconciliation in 1994, the father was dying of liver disease and
other complications of a hard life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to write the book while he was still alive,'' Dickey
says. ``I got into this white heat of writing and we taped hours
and hours and days of interviews, and then he died. Originally, I
wanted to write it because I thought it would bring us together. I
kept on writing it because I wanted to bring him back. It was
frightening because I could feel all those memories of him slipping
away.''
</P>
<P>
   And not all the memories were bad ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the time I went to school in Atlanta as a little boy, our
lives weren't exactly like everybody else's. We'd gone to Europe,
and we'd lived on the Riviera. My father took me hunting with a bow
and arrow when I was 8. We met famous people.''
</P>
<P>
   When Chris was 16, the family made a final move to Columbia,
S.C. His father took a writing post at the University of South
Carolina and hit the road doing poetry readings around the country.
``He was loving and being loved by people we did not know,'' Dickey
writes in his memoir.
</P>
<P>
   As his father approached his 40s, Dickey says, fear of middle
age haunted him and the cumulative effects of drinking changed him:
``He feared he would lose his physical powers, his sexual powers,
his creative powers. If you tie everything up in a bundle that's
based on being big and macho and larger than life, you don't leave
yourself much room when you reach middle age.''
</P>
<P>
   Now middle-aged himself with a grown son, Chris Dickey better
understands some of the demons his father faced. He admits that he
was not a good father to his son, James, 28, but they are close now
that he's grown. ``I was too busy trying to save myself,'' Dickey
says.
</P>
<P>
   Bronwen, meanwhile, is attending a private school in
Connecticut; Chris Dickey's younger brother, Kevin, is a
radiologist at Yale Medical School; and his stepmother, Deborah,
reportedly has overcome her drug problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deborah did not want to read the book,'' Dickey says. ``She
doesn't want to relive those times, but she wanted me to emphasize
the fact that she has straightened out her life completely in the
last two years.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he says, he came to know his father and himself
better than he had before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to put the good and bad memories into some kind of
context. When he wasn't drinking, he was so inspiring, so wonderful
to be around. If he were a neutral personality, he wouldn't have
been a poet. And he wouldn't have been a genius.''

 &HT;    With a universal appeal, kebabs come in countless meaty
combinations_ limited only by taste and imagination
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You started grilling hamburgers before Memorial Day. Father's
Day, it was steaks. On the Fourth, you smoked ribs for hours.
</P>
<P>
   But you ain't grilled nothing yet.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to take a stab at the most universal of barbecue
dishes _ the kebab.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meat on a stick is probably one of the oldest food concepts in
the world,'' says Steven Raichlen, author of ``The Barbecue!
Bible'' (Workman Publishing, $18.95). ``And every country has some
version of a kebab, whether it's the sate lalat in Indonesia, with
bits of meat no bigger than a fly, or the giant kebabs of
Argentina.''
</P>
<P>
   Raichlen traveled to 25 countries over three years to research
how different cultures grill and barbecue food. He included more
than 60 recipes for kebabs and sates in his book because he found
``meat on a stick'' everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   They go by names like yakitori (chicken marinated in soy sauce
and sake in Japan), suya (fiery skewered beef in Nigeria) and kofta
(ground meat in North Africa.) They call for skewering everything
from beef heart to quail's eggs, though most involve less
intimidating meats, poultry and fish.
</P>
<P>
   Some skewered meat traditions are spare, such as the Madeira
tradition of cooking chunks of meat on the branches of bay leaf
trees (we've included a modified recipe for this inside.)
</P>
<P>
   Others are complex, such as the sate lilit in Bali, a spicy fish
mousse flavored with kaffir lime leaves and grilled on fresh lemon
grass stalks. And there's as much variety among the skewers as in
what can be skewered, from simple metal batons to sugar cane stalks
to bamboo sticks to upscale skewers with adornments on the handles.
</P>
<P>
   Many kebab recipes are related. Persian-style kebabs, with an
emphasis on yogurt-based marinades and lamb (usually ground) turn
up as far west as the Balkans and as far east as Bangladesh,
Raichlen's research shows. They are thought to have inspired the
Greek souvlaki and the Indian tandoori. ``Ground lamb kebabs are
popular on a huge swath of the world barbecue trail,'' Raichlen
said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of our family favorites are more likely inspired by global
traditions rather than authentic, which is probably how kebabs have
endured over the centuries. From the essentials _ humans, fire,
meat, sticks _ have come countless combinations limited only by
imagination and taste. So twisting tradition is a tradition when it
comes to kebabs.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, we include directions for skewering beef, shrimp, pork,
chicken, vegetables and ground lamb using ideas from Greece,
Turkey, India and Thailand, among other places. We've even included
the directions for the saffron chicken kebabs that are the
favorites at Cornucopia, a restaurant on Roswell Road, where owner
Ben Keshmirian specializes in Mediterranean-inspired kebabs.
</P>
<P>
   So while the grilling season is still in full swing, sharpen up
those skewers and sample the world a few bites at a time.

 &HT;    Kebabs: Stick 'em up
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's time to take summertime global and experiment with the
grilling traditions of the world. And there's no better way to do
it than with a kebab sampling.
</P>
<P>
   You can make the portions on each kebab as small or as large as
you'd like. And feel free to create your own combinations, pairing
favorite meats with preferred veggies or even fruits, like prunes,
figs, apricots and peaches.
</P>
<P>
   There are really only a few rules to keep in mind. It's good if
you can intersperse lean meat cubes with fatty, and cut pieces
about the same size so they will cook evenly. When using different
vegetables on the same skewer, make sure they have similar cooking
times; longer-cooking vegetables may be blanched first to start the
cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Experiment with different skewers, metal or wood. You can
usually find economical versions at grocery and discount stores.
The latest Williams-Sonoma catalog offers stainless steel skewers
adorned with brass handles in the shape of animals. A set of six is
$15.
</P>
<P>
   If you use wood skewers, soak them in water for about an hour
before using to keep them from burning while on the grill. You can
also wrap the ends in foil. It's also a good idea to grease the
grilling grate generously to prevent sticking.
</P>
<P>
   One trick: Use a kebab rack. These stand about 2 inches high,
and you place the skewers on top so they are just above the grate,
but not touching it. We spotted one at Stein Mart for $14.99.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the last trick to kebabs is the unskewering. As he
traveled the world sampling kebabs, cookbook author Steven Raichlen
discovered the best way to handle this dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   He suggests holding a skewer with one hand, and then, with a
piece of thick bread in the other, pull the meat toward you a bit
to loosen; everything should just slide off.
</P>
<P>
   Below, we give you a few of the international recipes Raichlen
discovered while working on ``The Barbecue! Bible'' (Workman
Publishing, $18.95) plus some others we tried.
</P>
<P>
   MAIN DISH
</P>
<P>
   Madeira Beef and Bay Leaf Kebabs (Espetada)
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings Preparation time: 20 minutes Marinating time:
4-6 hours Cooking time: 8-12 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Grilled beef is popular throughout Portugal, but on the island
of Madeira, this kebab is the favorite. It used to be cooked
directly on branches from bay leaf trees. Here, we stick with the
leaves. Steven Raichlen recommends serving with crusty bread for
soaking up the juices as shown below.
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2pounds beef tenderloin or boneless sirloin
</P>
<P>
   1/4cup extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1/4cup red wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1onion, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup chopped fresh Italian (flat-leaf) parsley
</P>
<P>
   4cloves garlic, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   12bay leaves
</P>
<P>
   Trim any sinews and excess fat off the beef, then cut the meat
into 1 1/2-inch cubes. Combine the olive oil, vinegar, onion,
parsley, garlic, salt and pepper in a large nonreactive baking
dish. Add the beef and toss thoroughly to coat. Cover and let
marinate in the refrigerator for 4 to 6 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the grill to high. Remove the beef and bay leaves from
the marinade and thread onto the skewers, dividing the bay leaves
among the kebabs. When ready to cook, oil the grill grate. Arrange
the kebabs on the hot grate and grill, turning with tongs, until
the meat is cooked to taste, 2 to 3 minutes per side (8 to 12
minutes in all) for medium-rare. Baste the espetadas with any
excess marinade, but not during the last 3 minutes. Serve the
espetadas on or off the skewers on slices or chunks of Portuguese
bread for soaking up the juices.

<P>
   Shrimp Kebabs
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 25 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 6-12 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Steven Raichlen found these kebabs in the Latin Quarter of
Paris, though they are believed to be Greek in origin. Here are his
specific directions for these kebabs, which are as beautiful as
they are delicious.
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon coarse (kosher or sea) salt
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon freshly ground white pepper
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon dried oregano
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon dried rosemary
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon dried thyme
</P>
<P>
   12jumbo shrimp or spot prawns
</P>
<P>
   2medium onions, peeled
</P>
<P>
   1large green bell pepper, stemmed, seeded, and quartered
lengthwise
</P>
<P>
   1lemon, cut into 8 wedges
</P>
<P>
   12large cherry tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   3tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, for brushing kebabs
</P>
<P>
   Combine the salt, pepper, oregano, rosemary and thyme in a bowl
and set aside. Rinse the shrimp under cold running water, then
drain and blot dry with paper towels. Traditionally, the heads and
shells are left on, but the shrimp are deveined. (To devein shrimp
with shells on, cut with kitchen scissors along back of shell.
Scrape out exposed vein with tip of knife.) You may choose the more
traditional, American approach without shells and heads if you
like. Cut each onion into 4 wedges and cut each wedge crosswise in
half. Cut each pepper quarter crosswise into 4 equal pieces.
Preheat the grill to high.
</P>
<P>
   Arrange the ingredients for the kebabs on a cutting board.
Here's a sequence I like (but feel free to follow any you desire):
a lemon wedge (cut edge toward you), a piece of bell pepper, a
piece of onion, a shrimp (underside facing you) with a cherry
tomato placed in the hollow space formed by the curve, another
piece of pepper and onion, another shrimp with a tomato, more
pepper and onion and, finally, another lemon wedge (cut edge away
from you). Run a skewer through these ingredients to make an
attractive kebab, then thread the remaining kebabs the same way.
</P>
<P>
   When ready to cook, brush the kebabs on both sides with oil and
sprinkle with the herb mixture. Arrange the kebabs on the hot grate
and grill until the shrimp flesh is firm and pink and the tomatoes
and onions are lightly charred, 3 to 6 minutes per side. Brush the
kebabs once or twice with additional oil and season liberally with
the herb mixture as they cook. Unskewer the kebabs onto serving
plates.

   Ben Keshmirian of Cornucopia's Mediterranean Restaurant shares
this chicken kebab, which he says is a best seller. It's no wonder;
the tangy lime juice and aromatic saffron combine to penetrate the
chicken with powerful flavor, especially if you can it marinate
overnight. We used the large holes of a regular food grater for the
onion.

</P>
<P>
   Ground lamb is one of the most popular kebab ingredients in the
world but not that common here. If you can't find some already
packaged at the grocery, ask the butcher. Most likely, he will be
willing to grind up a cut of lamb, such as the shoulder, for you.
Be sure and grease the cooking grate very well or use a rack,
because ground meats stick more than cubed.
</P>
<P>
   1pound ground lamb
</P>
<P>
   1/4cup minced red onion
</P>
<P>
   1clove garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   3tablespoons finely chopped fresh Italian (flat-leaf) parsley
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon salt, or more to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/2teaspoon ground cumin
</P>
<P>
   1/2teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or more to taste
</P>
<P>
   8Asian or other long slender eggplants (each 6 to 7 inches long
and 1 1/2 inches wide)
</P>
<P>
   Lavash or pita bread, for serving
</P>
<P>
   Preheat a generously oiled grill to high. Place the lamb in a
large bowl and mix in the onion, garlic, parsley, 1 teaspoon salt,
cumin and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Knead and squeeze the mixture with
your hands until thoroughly blended, 3 to 4 minutes. To test the
mixture for seasoning, saute a small amount in a nonstick skillet
until cooked through, then taste, adding salt or pepper to the
remaining mixture as necessary; it should be highly seasoned.
</P>
<P>
   Trim the ends off the eggplants and discard; cut each eggplant
crosswise into 1 1/2-inch rounds. Thread each round, through the
cut sides, on a skewer, 4 to a skewer, spacing about 1 1/2 inches
apart.
</P>
<P>
   Line a baking sheet with plastic wrap. Divide the meat mixture
into 24 equal portions. Lightly wet your hands with cold water,
then take one of the portions of meat and mold it around a skewer,
between 2 eggplant rounds, making it as much as possible the same
size and shape as the eggplant. Repeat with the remaining portions
of meat so each skewer contains 4 eggplant rounds alternating with
3 portions of meat. Place each kebab as it is made on the prepared
baking sheet.
</P>
<P>
   When ready to cook, arrange the kebabs on the grate and grill,
turning with tongs, until nicely browned and cooked through, 12 to
16 minutes in all. Use a lavash or pita bread to protect your hand
as you slide the meat and eggplant off their skewers onto serving
plates. If desired, trim away the charred eggplant skin before
eating. Serve accompanied by lavash and pita. _ From ``The
Barbecue! Bible'' by Steven Raichlen (Workman, $18.95)

   When I think grill, I don't think cauliflower. But this recipe
produced the best cauliflower I've ever put in my mouth. The
marinade can be used for almost anything, meat or vegetable.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Bring a medium-size pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add
the potatoes and boil for 3 minutes. Add the cauliflower to the
potatoes and boil for 3 minutes. Add the carrots to the potatoes
and cauliflower and boil for 2 minutes more. Drain immediately,
plunge into cold water to stop the cooking, and drain again.
</P>
<P>
   Place the vegetables, including the onion, in a large bowl. Add
the marinade and toss to coat. Let stand at room temperature while
you prepare the fire. (Alternately, the marinating vegetables can
be refrigerated for up to 12 hours.) Prepare a medium-hot fire in
the grill. Thread the vegetables onto skewers. Grill the
vegetables, turning occasionally, until browned and tender, about 8
minutes. Serve hot, with raita on the side if desired.

</P>
<P>
   CUCUMBER PICKLES:
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup white vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup water
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   6small (Kirby) cucumbers or 1 large hothouse cucumber or
Japanese cucumber
</P>
<P>
   3tablespoons coarsely chopped shallot or purple onion
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon finely chopped fresh hot chiles
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon finely chopped dry-roasted peanuts
</P>
<P>
   A few fresh cilantro leaves
</P>
<P>
   Prepare the meat: Combine coconut milk, fish sauce, sugar,
cumin, coriander and turmeric in a bowl and stir well. Add the pork
slices, mix well, cover and refrigerate for 1-2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare the sauce: Warm the coconut milk in a small saucepan
over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until it reaches a gentle
boil, about 5 minutes. Add curry paste and stir occasionally until
it dissolves into the coconut milk, about 3 minutes. Add peanut
butter, stock and sugar and cook gently until the sauce is smooth,
about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and season with lime juice, fish
sauce and salt. Taste and adjust seasonings. Cool to room
temperature. (May be made ahead and refrigerated up to 1 day.)
</P>
<P>
   Prepare the cucumbers: Combine the vinegar, water, sugar and
salt in a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a gentle boil,
stirring to dissolve sugar and salt. Remove from heat and cool to
room temperature. Just before serving time, peel the cucumbers,
slice them crosswise about 1/4 inch thick and cut the slices in
half. Combine cucumber slices with the vinegar dressing, shallot
and chiles. Divide between two serving bowls. Sprinkle with chopped
peanuts and a few cilantro leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Grill the meat: Generously oil the grates of a charcoal or gas
grill. Prepare fire or preheat on high setting. Thread a slice of
the marinated meat onto each soaked bamboo skewer and grill until
cooked, 4-8 minutes total. Arrange on a serving platter. Set on
table along with the peanut sauce and the cucumber pickles. _

ROADSIDE AMERICA WEB SITE ROAD TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sage who came up with ``The journey is the reward,''
obviously never took a long road trip with his family. And he
probably never got to see the World's Largest Replica Cheese,
either.
</P>
<P>
   Surely you remember that post-war American rite of passage: The
whole crew wedged into the family's wood-paneled station wagon on
the way to someplace grand. Mom and Dad are meditatively counting
the mile markers to the next rest stop or tourist trap as the kids
wage territorial wars over the backseat while pelting each other
with Stuckey's pecan logs.
</P>
<P>
   If all this has you pining for the good old days, steer your
browser to the Roadside America Web site (www.roadsideamerica.com)
and enjoy a fun-filled trip that may take you not only down memory
lane, but to more than 6,000 of the most popular highway
attractions from all 50 states. Yes, here you can finally see Rock
City, right on your desktop.
</P>
<P>
   A thoroughly enchanting guided tour of American goofiness, the
site is an interactive multimedia companion piece to the books,
``Roadside America,'' published in 1986, and ``New Roadside
America,'' in 1992 (both Simon &AMP; Shuster).
</P>
<P>
   The authors, Doug Kirby, Ken Smith and Mike Wilkins, continue to
add new attractions to their database, which also includes pages on
tourism news and travel tips. The Electric Map page in the Roadside
Rotunda has links to each state's memorable landmarks, and special
sections devoted to favorite road-themed film clips.
</P>
<P>
   It even has a Pet Cemetery area that counts the ``Noble Dog
Mausoleum'' and ``Elephant Burial Ground'' among its treasures.
</P>
<P>
   Other sights on the site include a page called Big Bovines,
devoted to the American preoccupation with building enormous cow
statues, the largest of which _ the 38-foot-tall Salem Sue _
overlooks Interstate 94 in North Dakota. Sue's not alone: When it
comes to tourist attractions, many celebrate humongous objects:
giant chairs, balls of twine and chicken sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   For those overwhelmed by the vast wealth and quality of the
kitsch here, and unsure where to begin, Roadside America offers a
guided tour. Users with at least a 28.8 modem connection can opt
for a Trans Orbital Tour on a specific theme (the ``Wiener Fever
Dream'' was recently offered).
</P>
<P>
   The host, the Travel Brain also offers a tour called ``Probe My
Lobes'' that opens a new browser window and rotates through some
possible destinations, allowing the user to click on whatever looks
good.
</P>
<P>
   If the virtual visit through Roadside America inspires you to do
some more sightseeing on the Web, you can get your clicks on Route
66 (route66.netvision.be). That site is devoted to the legendary
stretch of well-traveled asphalt that once spanned Illinois to
California. Billed as ``Where the Mother Road Meets the Information
Superhighway,'' the Route 66 site offers a trunk load of nostalgia,
links and lore.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps as evidence of the international appeal of the American
road, the site comes to you from Belgium.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Sierra Nevada, Red Brick are summer standouts
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most people I know are ready to kiss summer goodbye if not, in
fact, kick it out the door. Who says the livin' is easy? Not when
it's this hot, not when it's this muggy and buggy. Alas, there's
another month or more left, and there are also all those summer
beers competing for attention.
</P>
<P>
   What exactly is a summer beer anyway?
</P>
<P>
   It's easy enough to see why a crackling fire and the cold of
winter turn the mind toward thoughts of hearty stouts and porters.
Even a Scottish ale, more malty than hoppy, is suited to the snow
season.
</P>
<P>
   But many people _ myself included _ drink the same beers in
summer that they drink in winter. With a certain kind of meal, I
want a certain kind of beer. One evening calls for an India Pale
Ale (quite a few evenings call for IPAs, frankly), another for a
Vienna lager. None of them will say ``Summer Brew'' on the label.
</P>
<P>
   But seasonal beers are in, and are likely to stay in. They add
variety and interest. With summer beers, you have to imagine
yourself on the deck. Or at Turner Field. Think ballgames and
barbecues. That's what these beers are made for, and it's to be
expected that some would do it better than others.
</P>
<P>
   A late-summer sample of eight such beers illustrated how varied
they can be. The eight, in no particular order, were Dogwood Summer
Brew, Samuel Adams Summer Ale, Sierra Nevada Summerfest, Sierra
Nevada Wheat beer, Pete's Summer Brew, Red Brick Summer Brew, Bert
Grant's Summer Ale and Redhook Blonde Ale.
</P>
<P>
   A minor masterpiece
</P>
<P>
   Seven of those are ales _ ironic when you consider that if
``summer beer'' suggests anything, it's crispness.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's not surprising, then, that the one lager in the
group, Sierra Nevada Summerfest, stood out. This is a minor
masterpiece of brewing, a light (but not Lite) lager, soft on the
palate and yet firm enough to stand up to spicier summer foods. The
Saaz hops give it a faintly floral aroma, entirely different from
the citrusy, Cascades character that most people associate with
Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a beer that would make me forget Sierra Nevada Pale
Ale. But the person who's not ventured much beyond mass-market
lagers can see just how well that style can be made. It's beer, not
barley pop. And it's an example of a pioneering craft brewery in
Chico, Calif., one whose reputation was built on pale ales, showing
Bud-Miller-Coors how to do it right.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to think everything Sierra Nevada attempts comes off
as a masterpiece. But the Sierra Nevada Wheat, for the aficionado,
falls a tad short of expectations _ which is to say it's likely to
suit most people just fine. It's a clean-tasting, unfiltered beer,
made from 50 percent wheat malt and 50 percent malted barley, and
its slightly tangy taste comes partly from the Strissel Spaltz
hops. ``I came across them a few years ago in the Alsace _ in
France _ when I was looking for a replacement for Saaz,'' says
Steve Dresler, head brewer at Sierra Nevada. ``I don't think
they're that, though. They have a character all their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing how well Sierra Nevada can turn out a lager or a
lighter-bodied wheat beer only confirms its stature as a
world-class brewery. But the real surprise was seeing how well Red
Brick Summer Brew stood up to the competition. Along with last
year's Christmas ale, this is the best beer the Atlanta brewery has
produced. One of the reasons is the Ahtanum hop that Brian
Buckowski, head brewer at Red Brick, found last year in Washington
state. The Ahtanum gives this light-to-medium-bodied beer a
subtlety found in few other beers.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Redhook Blonde Ale brings more to the palate, but
there's nothing obviously seasonal about it. A person not into
hoppy ales can enjoy this well-made beer anytime. And if you're
going to buy the Blonde, why not buy the far more interesting
Redhook Rye, a year-round beer I call The Perfect Deck Beer?
</P>
<P>
   More than lemonade
</P>
<P>
   The same problem arises with Samuel Adams Summer Ale. It's
spiced with lemon and Grains of Paradise, leading some to think
it's a Belgian White Ale. It's not, and it's not as complex or
spicy as Samuel Adams White Ale, introduced as a seasonal last
winter and now offered year-round.
</P>
<P>
   A Belgian White can accompany light lunches on a patio perfectly
(fruit and shrimp salads especially), and Samuel Adams' White Ale
is a good one. But so, too, is the locally made Dogwood Summer
Brew. The Samuel Adams has more bite; the Dogwood is a touch
sweeter and maybe more interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to a couple of beers that are neither
interesting nor summery. Pete's Summer Ale has a hint of lemon, but
so what? Like most of the beers under the Pete's label, it's
ordinary _ neither bad nor good.
</P>
<P>
   Bert Grant's Summer Ale, the fourth in this Yakima, Wash.,
brewer's seasonal offerings, is made with Chinook hops, which are
meant to impart a certain zestiness. What's most noticeable,
unfortunately, is the well-known flavor of Bert Grant's house
yeast. Grant is a deservedly laureled pioneer in hop development,
and his best beers _ the Imperial Stout and the excellent Scottish
Ale _ are the ones with enough hops to override that flavor. Call
it ``house character,'' if you want, but it's not for me.
</P>
<P>
   And that's as it should be. Not every kind of cheese satisfies
everyone equally, and neither should every kind of beer. For every
Sierra Nevada, there are three others that are just something to
drink on a hot afternoon. When that's the case, lemonade does it
just as well. A beer has to do something more.

MANY AMERICANS AREN'T BUYING TRIPP'S SELF-IMAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems like everybody has an opinion about Linda Tripp. Some
of the opinions are favorable. Most are not.
</P>
<P>
   It would appear that Tripp's claim that she's a victim of the
Clinton-Lewinsky sex scandal didn't win her much sympathy. And
Tripp's assertion that she epitomizes the ``average American''
didn't go over with average Americans.
</P>
<P>
   I discovered this after writing an anti-Tripp column that found
its way into a number of newspapers around the country; reader
reaction has been vociferous, to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   The letters and phone calls are still coming in, but readers so
far have sided with me by a 3-to-1 ratio. Actual ``average
Americans'' clearly don't have much use for somebody who would
tape-record private conversations with a friend and use the tapes
to make the friend a target in a criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Which is what Tripp did to Monica Lewinsky, the former White
House intern who says she had a sexual relationship with President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp and New York book agent Lucianne Goldberg _ who said she
urged Tripp to record her conversations with Lewinksy _ teamed to
expose the matter to the media, to independent counsel Ken Starr
and to lawyers representing Paula Jones in her sexual harassment
lawsuit against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's investigation of sex-and-lies allegations involving
Clinton and Lewinsky _ not to mention the accompanying media frenzy
_ directly resulted from Tripp's decision to tape her conversations
with Lewinksy.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp was one of the instigators of the situation that is
supposedly victimizing her. She set out to implicate her ``friend''
Lewinsky and the president, even going so far as to brief Jones'
attorneys to help them ambush Clinton with questions about Lewinsky
when the president gave his sworn deposition in the sexual
harassment case.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Tripp stood on the steps of the courthouse after
testifying before Starr's federal grand jury last month and
declared: ``I never, ever asked to be placed in this position.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing herself as ``an average American who found herself in
a situation not of her own making,'' Tripp whined about her
treatment at the hands of TV comics and ``legions of paid
prevaricators.''
</P>
<P>
   I opined that Tripp not only asked to be in the position she's
in, she demanded it.
</P>
<P>
   One reader left a message on the voice mail informing me that
the column was ``way off base.'' One said the column was ``very
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Tripp is ``taking a very bad rap,'' another said.
</P>
<P>
   ``After reading your opinion on Linda Tripp,'' wrote a
Pennsylvania reader, ``it is obvious to me you are one of the 90
percent liberal media, reporting things your way and the hell with
right, wrong or the USA.''
</P>
<P>
   The naysayers were in the minority, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was one of the rare times that I've ever agreed with
you,'' one like-minded citizen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right on,'' said another. ``Write more articles like that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to agree _ Linda Tripp is no victim by any means,''
wrote a reader from Highland, Ind. ``And this is an average
American's point of view: President Clinton is on my time, right
now. Let him do his job. I don't care who he sleeps with.''
</P>
<P>
   And there was this from a reader in San Luis Obispo, Calif.: ``I
thoroughly enjoyed your column on Linda Tripp. Ken Starr was
searching for a deceitful person to help him in his endeavor and he
most certainly found one.''
</P>
<P>
   A retired Air Force veteran from Trinity, N.C., added that Tripp
``deserves everything that is thrown at her _ her security
clearance should have been pulled, she should be run out of the
Pentagon, fired, and barred from ever working for the government
again. ... All this taping was about a multimillion-dollar book
deal, not the security of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg says that Tripp is not hawking a book. But it's hard to
believe that there won't be one, sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
   So here's a question: If she writes a book, who's gonna buy it?
</P>

HOME WEB SITES THRUST STUDENTS INTO CENSORSHIP DISPUTES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ohio, N.Y., Mo., Texas, Ga.)   (af)  
 By TERRY MCMANUS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sean O'Brien had a beef with a high-school teacher. He thought
that the 36-year-old band instructor, Raymond Walczuk, tended to
blame him unfairly for problems around school. In response,
O'Brien, 17, a baritone horn player from Westlake High School in
Ohio, last spring set up a home-based Web site that insulted
Walczuk.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, for instance, ran a photo of Walczuk and described him
as ``an overweight middle-age man who doesn't like to get
haircuts.'' O'Brien also said Walczuk ``likes to involve himself in
everything you do.'' He included Walczuk's home address and phone
number.
</P>
<P>
   When word of the site got around school, the administration
suspended O'Brien for 10 days, told him to remove the Web site and
threatened to expel him. He and his parents took action, accusing
the school district of violating his right to free speech and suing
the district for $550,000.
</P>
<P>
   The broad outlines of the O'Brien case may have a familiar ring.
Legal experts say school censorship of student Web sites outside
schools is on the rise, giving civil liberties advocates plenty of
reasons to fret _ and intervene.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Beeson, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer in New
York, said, ``These Web cases have become somewhat analogous to the
student newspaper cases of the past, where the school tries to say,
`You can't talk about condoms in the school newspaper.' Except that
with Web sites, people tend to become more alarmed because people
outside the school find out about them.''
</P>
<P>
   While the United States Supreme Court issued a decision in 1988
on the censorship of student newspapers, it has yet to deal with a
case involving school censorship of a Web site set up by a student
outside school.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1988 case, it ruled that a high school principal in
Hazelwood, Mo., could control the content of the school newspaper
because an article interfered with the school's ``basic educational
mission.'' But when students publish outside school, on the Web or
elsewhere, they are covered by the First Amendment right to free
expression.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, a number of Web-censorship incidents have
occurred. In McKinney, Texas, a middle-school student, Aaron Smith,
was suspended for setting up a Web site called CHOW, for Chihuahua
Haters of the World, on a school computer.
</P>
<P>
   In a more serious case, a 15-year-old in Statesboro, Ga., was
accused of posting terroristic threats against his high-school
principal on a personal Web site and was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   An Internet magazine called Bolt Reporter (www.boltreporter.com)
runs school-newspaper articles that have been banned by
administrators and gives students a forum to discuss school
censorship.
</P>
<P>
   While the courts have made no definitive rulings on how much
discretion schools have in such cases, civil libertarians say that
they expect students, and the First Amendment, to prevail if they
ever go before a jury with censorship complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU of Eastern Missouri will file a First Amendment suit
soon in a dispute similar to the O'Brien case, said Denise
Lieberman, a legal director with the group. The case involves a
Marble Hill, Mo., student who was forced to remove a personal Web
site in February by Woodland High School.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the student, Brandon Beussink, used his Web
site to poke fun at Woodland High's official Web site. He also
encouraged visitors to tell the principal that the page was bad and
used profanity in describing the school and faculty members.
</P>
<P>
   Woodland High officials complained about the vulgarity and
``open disrespect.'' Woodland High disciplined the teen-ager even
though he immediately complied with its order to remove the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The school suspended the student for 10 days and failed him
for the entire semester,'' said Deborah Jacobs, executive director
of that ACLU district. Beussink will start school in the fall as a
second-semester junior instead of a senior.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jacobs said the law was clear on issues of free speech for
students. Schools cannot interfere with what students say on their
own time outside school, she contended, adding that the principle
extended to statements made on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Woodland High School's lawyer, Kenneth McManaman, sees the
Beussink matter in a different light. In a May 5 letter to Ms.
Jacobs, he said: ``There is no doubt in my mind that the school
district had the right, authority and even obligation to prohibit
this sort of activity by Brandon Beussink. Instead of continuing to
whine, I would suggest Beussink take his punishment like a man, get
back to school and start behaving like he should in the
classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   In a later interview, McManaman said, ``If the ACLU thinks they
can come down here and win a case, let them come.''
</P>
<P>
   In the O'Brien case, an out-of-court settlement was reached last
April in which the district reinstated the student, issued an
apology and paid him $30,000 in damages. A judge had earlier said
that O'Brien could re-establish his Web site, but he decided
against that.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Reep, the former superintendent of the Westlake School
District, said the district believed that it had technically
violated O'Brien's constitutional rights. ``And whether you believe
something is right or wrong, it's irrelevant to the degree that
there was a technicality in his favor,'' she said. ``We made a
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The district's lawyer, John Britton, added, ``The First
Amendment was overlooked.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Ms. Reep said Walczuk had been demeaned by
O'Brien's Web comments, and some agree with her. In an anonymous
letter posted to the Cleveland Live Web site, a student in
Walczuk's class said: ``Sean has always had an attitude toward
Walczuk, but why did he have to make a Web site about him? If a
teacher was to make a Web site about a student that they didn't
like, I can guarantee you that they would be fired or suffer severe
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, O'Brien feels vindicated by the settlement _ he
split the award evenly with his lawyers and donated a portion to
the ACLU _ but the experience has left him far from sanguine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it would've been nice if the whole thing didn't happen
and I just went to school like normal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said that facing Walczuk in class after the suspension
had been awkward. He said that he would not return to band next
year. ( Walczuk did not reply to repeated requests through his
lawyer for an interview.)
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien's advice for anyone firing a Web broadside at a school
or teacher? ``Keep it true,'' he said. ``Don't lie.''

WEB EROTICA AIMS FOR NEW FEMALE CUSTOMERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Wash.)   (af)  
 By PAMELA LI CALZI O'CONNELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, a Web site with an evocative name _ Purve _
began selling its own brand of sexual stimulation to anyone with a
credit card and claiming to be 18 or older.
</P>
<P>
   The site is just another drop in the deep well of sexually
explicit content that runs beneath the mainstream online world and,
some would argue, occasionally threatens to drown it.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a twist: Purve is the first sexually explicit
subscription site designed specifically for heterosexual women. And
that makes its debut something of a cultural signpost.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the most apparent sexual point of view on the Web has
been male, especially in the lucrative world of sex-oriented
commercial sites. But statistics on Web use show that women are
slowly closing the gap with men in terms of their interest in
sexually explicit online material.
</P>
<P>
   According to Media Met-rix, a research company, nearly 20
percent of female Internet users 18 and older visited a sex site in
May, up from 15 percent in January, compared with 45.4 percent and
41.3 percent for men.
</P>
<P>
   Although women have long been active participants in
sex-oriented chat rooms on America Online and elsewhere, sites with
content designed for women represent a minuscule portion of the
Web's thousands of commercial sexually explicit sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of trouble finding sites created for women by
women,'' said Jane Duvall, whose site, Jane's Net Sex Guide,
reviews sexually explicit content of all kinds. ``And that's a pity
because the Net lets you be anonymous and look at material from the
safety of your home. So it's tailor-made for women _ who wouldn't
be caught dead in an adult video store, say _ to work out their
sexual inclinations.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Duvall said her weekly e-mail newsletter had a readership of
at least 30 percent women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are interested in exploring their sexuality on line, but
what has clearly been lacking is adult entertainment on the scale
of what is found for men,'' said Anne Semans, co-author of ``The
Woman's Guide to Sex on the Web,'' scheduled to be published next
spring by Harper San Francisco. ``To be frank, the naked pictures
of men are all targeted at gay men, not women.''
</P>
<P>
   In researching her book, Ms. Semans said, she saw signs that
more and more sexually explicit content was available for women.
She found a thriving world of erotic stories, for instance, and a
small but growing number of free sites incorporating soft-core
pictures, chat and shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ms. Semans said, she has received several responses from
women who said the Web ``had already changed their lives sexually''
despite the fact that there are not many sites focusing on women.
</P>
<P>
   What women will pay for on line will be tested by Purve, which
charges nearly $100 for a one-year subscription. The site is the
work of an Australian company, Images Marketing Group, which
produces some of the largest sex-oriented pay sites for men, which
have significantly higher subscription rates.
</P>
<P>
   Purve was ``designed, developed and written entirely by women,''
said Carla Paterson, who runs the site. Ms. Paterson was spurred to
start a site for women after working for several years in the
sex-oriented Internet industry and finding ``there was nothing for
me to look at.''
</P>
<P>
   Purve's main page is noticeably tamer than those of many sites
for men. Highlighted areas devoted to sex quizzes, erotic stories,
chat and astrology are meant to set a female tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been told by women that they like to feel like the
site will be a community rather than a bunch of naked pictures,''
Ms. Paterson said. Of course, Purve's photo gallery contains
numerous examples of the latter.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Purve has received ``hundreds of e-mails from women
saying, `It's about time,''' Ms. Paterson said, adding that the
site averaged 5,000 visits a day with little promotion in its first
week. In contrast, Images Marketing's sites for men each receive
nearly a half-million visits a day on their main home pages.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Semans, for one, is not sure that a subscription model
will work in this market. ``Women are not used to paying for sexual
materials,'' she said. ``At least they haven't off line'' in
anywhere near the numbers that men have.
</P>
<P>
   To some, it may seem odd to view the emergence of sex-oriented
sites for women as something positive. Don't all such sites
objectify the people pictured? What can be healthy about that?
</P>
<P>
   A sex site of one's own is nothing to sneer at, said Regina
Lark, assistant director of the Center for Feminist Research at the
University of Southern California and a contributor to a zine
called Her Salon, which contains a popular ``Herotica'' section
aimed primarily at lesbians. A subscription to the site costs $15 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lark said she was ``frustrated and tired of viewing sites
that may appear to be for women but are really just other avenues
for male enjoyment.'' She added, ``I would much rather view erotica
made by and for women than by and for men.'' Based on requests,
Herotica plans to add a new section geared to heterosexual women by
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Women are achieving a higher profile behind the scenes in the
world of online sexually explicit entertainment as well. For
example, one of the most popular sex-oriented sites on the Web, a
links directory called Persian Kitty, is maintained by Beth
Mansfield, a former accountant who lives in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mansfield takes a pragmatic view of her involvement in
sex-oriented content, saying, ``It's a great economic
opportunity.'' Whether such sites for women succeed or fail, she
said, is purely a matter of whether such ventures make business
sense.
</P>
<P>
   Most consumers of sexually explicit content are unaware that
Persian Kitty is run by a woman and are incredulous when they find
out. ``People are always intrigued by the fact that I'm a woman _
though less so as time goes on,'' Ms. Mansfield said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the day is coming that I can finally kill off the
rumor that I'm a guy named Bill,'' she said.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Clinton mystery that consumes an elite slice
of America's architectural and entertainment establishment these
days has nothing to do with DNA and everything to do with bricks
and mortar. Or glass and steel. Or granite and marble.
</P>
<P>
   The list of suspects is impressive. Will it be Charles Gwathmey
with the girder? Or Frank Gehry with the facade? Or I.M. Pei with
the pyramid?
</P>
<P>
   So far, only the scene is known: 26 acres of warehouses and
vacant lots on the banks of the Arkansas River in Little Rock have
now been set aside for the home of the William J. Clinton
Presidential Library.
</P>
<P>
   But that has not stopped the buzz about who will win Clinton's
commission to design the complex, which will one day hold his
presidential papers, a museum, offices and an ``educational and
outreach'' program to preserve the legacy of the 42nd president.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a great deal of interest, a great deal of
excitement,'' said Skip Rutherford, an old Friend of Bill, who is
the local coordinator for the library project in Little Rock. He
has been besieged with proposals from architects famous and
anonymous. ``Because, you know, these are signature pieces, and
they come along rarely.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the trail of clues in this who'll-do-it starts just
north of here, at the Malibu beachfront home of Jeffrey Katzenberg,
the Dreamworks movie mogul. It was designed by Gwathmey, and White
House aides say the president was captivated by it when he stayed
there last fall, especially by the way it embraces the waterfront,
since the library is to be built along a river.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in February, the president, his wife, Hillary Rodham
Clinton, and their daughter Chelsea, spent a weekend in another
Katzenberg house designed by Gwathmey in Park City, Utah, and 10
days ago, the Clintons put up in a third Gwathmey house, Steven
Spielberg's on Georgica Pond in East Hampton, N.Y..
</P>
<P>
   But the architectural world really went atwitter when Gwathmey
was seated at the president's table at a White House dinner June 17
for the presentation of the Pritzker Architecture Prize to Renzo
Piano, the Italian architect, whose best-known works include the
Pompidou Center in Paris. Gwathmey has never won the prize, widely
considered the profession's most prestigious, but was seated with
the president and Piano all the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sort of obvious,'' said Gehry, the Los Angeles-based
creator of the wavy titanium steel facade of the new Guggenheim
Museum in Bilbao, Spain, a Pritzker winner who was also at the
dinner, along with Pei, who designed the John F. Kennedy Library in
Boston. ``Everybody said, `Oh, he's doing the library!'''
</P>
<P>
   Still, with his trademark easy empathy, the president gave Gehry
some reason for hope, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came up to me and waved his arms like he was describing
Bilbao and said, `I can see it all now in Arkansas,''' Gehry
recalled with a chuckle. ``I think he's probably gone from
architect to architect.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Gwathmey, 60, a principal in the New York firm of
Gwathmey, Siegel &AMP; Associates, which learned last week that it had
won the commission to build the U.S. mission to the United Nations,
professes puzzlement at the origins of the buzz. He has not even
seen the proposed site, though he readily acknowledges that it
would be ``a fantastic commission.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea where it came from,'' he said by telephone from
New York. ``I know that the president stayed in three of our
houses. I know for a fact that he loved the Katzenberg house in
Malibu. I've met him once, at the Pritzker Prize dinner. And that's
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not quite all. Since Katzenberg, Spielberg and the third
Dreamworks partner, David Geffen, are all expected to play a role
in giving and raising money to build and endow the $100 million
privately financed library, their architectural patronage is seen
as carrying special weight, and they arranged for Gwathmey to meet
the president. Geffen has offered to give a party to help start the
campaign for the library next winter at his newly renovated house
in Beverly Hills, the old Jack Warner estate, which he bought for
$47 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these guys are going to be paying a lot of the cost, they
sure ought to have a say,'' said one White House aide, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The Katzenberg beach house that Clinton liked is a collection of
pavilions, with a cylindrical, glassed two-and-a-half-story living
room, which opens onto the Pacific. A Gwathmey, Siegel monograph
describes it as ``eroding a traditional courtyard house and
exposing its cut edge to the water.''
</P>
<P>
   Rutherford said that the final decision rests with and Mrs.
Clinton, and that they have been poring over books and portfolios,
and talking architecture with almost anyone they meet. Rutherford
declined to discuss the names of architects who have sent
proposals, but Gwathmey confirmed that he had sent a portfolio to
Rutherford, and so did Gehry.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is, subject to change, that ultimately a small number
will be invited to come to Little Rock and tour the site, to meet
with local officials and look at surrounding areas, then have an
opportunity to present their thoughts and ideas to the president
and the first lady,'' Rutherford said.
</P>
<P>
   Rutherford, who happily confessed that ``I know absolutely
nothing about architects,'' is getting lots of calls from them
these days. In fact, moments after the writer telephoned Gwathmey
to ask about the library, Rutherford called to ask, ``What was the
name of that architect you said you were writing about?'' When told
it was Gwathmey, Rutherford just laughed and said, ``You've started
quite a buzz.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People call me and say, `Am I on the list?''' Rutherford said.
``I say, `What list?'''
</P>
<P>
   Gwathmey and Gehry both said they were impressed by Clinton's
remarks at the Pritzker dinner, in which the president recalled
that it was Thomas Jefferson, the designer of Monticello, who also
designed the American creed that ``we are all created equal,
endowed by God with the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words, we dedicate ourselves to an act of creating
and building that will never be finished,'' Clinton added. ``An
architect conceived of that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To have somebody as brilliant as Clinton to play with, and
somebody who'd devour information as he apparently does, would be
an amazing experience,'' Gehry said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, Gwathmey said, ``I just hope he picks a modern
architect and not a traditional architect, to be a patron of modern
architecture and not to go backward and do a replicative
building.''

AN AUDIO EXTRA FOR SPORTS CARDS

<TEXT>
<P>
   A sports trading card collector who examines a trading card
series featuring a star athlete like Michael Jordan may be startled
to find a metallic surface where printed scoring statistics are
expected. And the collector would probably be even more surprised
to hear the voice of the athlete when the card is placed inside a
compact disk player.
</P>
<P>
   Power Deck sports cards, manufactured by the sports memorabilia
company Upper Deck, are believed to be the only audio trading cards
on the market that approximate the size and look of traditional
sports cards. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition to images of professional athletes, the cards
include recorded interviews, trivia questions, commentary and
live-action sound from athletic competitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to take trading cards into the 21st century,''
said Howard Farfel, senior director of marketing at Upper Deck,
based in Carlsbad, Calif. ``People tend to put regular trading
cards in their closet and leave them alone. The idea here is to
interact with the cards and have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The reverse side of the cards contains digital sound data that
can be scanned by a compact disk player. But because the cards are
rectangular and pliable, they work only when placed on a compact
disk adapter, available free at trading-card shops.
</P>
<P>
   After pushing the play button, card owners can listen to
commentators breathlessly recount the accomplishments of the
athlete featured on the card. They can also hear interviews with
such athletes as Troy Aikman, quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys,
who, on the card featuring his image, said at one point during the
five minutes of audio, ``I think my strengths are probably my
competitiveness and my desire to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Upper Deck, which is a privately held company, first released
these cards in 1997. The company declined to say how many cards it
has made. The digital cards are not sold separately, but rather are
included randomly _ with no indication on the packaging that one is
inside _ in packs of traditional sports cards produced by Upper
Deck.
</P>
<P>
   The company said a customer's chances of getting a digital card
in a traditional-card pack are about 1 in 22 for the common cards,
and 1 in 120 for rare versions.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the cards for Jordan and Aikman, there are cards
featuring Ken Griffey Jr., outfielder for the Seattle Mariners, and
Rusty Wallace, a leading Nascar driver.
</P>
<P>
   At least two other companies produce high-technology sports
cards.
</P>
<P>
   Donruss, a sports memorabilia manufacturer in Texas, sells
CD-ROM baseball cards featuring video highlights, player statistics
and personal profiles. Cyberaction, an Internet company, offers
downloadable sports cards with video and sound
(www.cyberaction.com).
</P>
<P>
   But are high-tech sports cards necessary when paper-based
trading cards have been popular for so long? If the market is any
indicator, the answer may be yes and no for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids certainly like them,'' said Fred Engelhaupt, a clerk
at the Beverly Hills Baseball Card Shop in Beverly Hills, Calif.,
who checked a collectibles guide book and found that the most
valuable Power Deck card, Michael Jordan, sells for a minimum of
$12. ``But I haven't had a big adult response.''

 &HT;    RELIGIOUS LEADERS DECRY HOMOSEXUALITY
 &HT;    By DANIELLE SHOOK
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Citing the Bible, religious leaders from several
faiths Wednesday said homosexuality is a sin and declared
``homosexuals should become straight and get married.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not homophobic,'' said Bishop Harold Ray of the
non-denominational Redemptive Life Fellowship in West Palm Beach,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here to promote the biblical alternative, which is
male-female marriage. We are not attempting to condemn people,''
Ray said at a news conference sponsored by the Family Research
Council, headed by conservative activist Gary Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   Supporting Ray's view were two panelists _ Yvette Cantu, a
policy analyst for the council, and Anthony Falzarano of the
Transformation Ex-Gay Ministries _ who spoke of their own
conversions.
</P>
<P>
   A former lesbian activist, Cantu said she was ``concerned about
my many gay male friends who were dying of AIDS, yet still
maintaining active sex lives. I was concerned about the fact that
many of my gay and lesbian friends were involved in heavy
recreational drug and alcohol use. It concerned me that many of my
lesbian friends were involved in obsessive-compulsive behavior in
their relationships, that some were violent with each other, and
that some were seducing their friends' girlfriends.''
</P>
<P>
   Cantu said her ``turning point'' came when she was a nursemaid
to two dying gay friends and took a hard look at her lifestyle.
``Only much later did I come to realize that the moral law as
expressed in almost every major religion is to protect us, not
repress us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Falzarano described a similar transformation after maintaining a
gay lifestyle for 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``God did not want me to be gay. I could no longer participate
in such an act, and I never looked back,'' said Falzarano, who has
been straight for nine years, is married, and has a daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Other panelists were: Rabbi Yehuda Levin of the Union of
Orthodox Rabbis of the U.S. and Canada, Brooklyn, N.Y.; Victor
Stanley of Calvary Baptist Church, Woodbridge, Va.; the Rev. Robert
McFarland of Excel Ministries, Washington, D.C.; the Rev. Thomas
Morrow, Catholic Archdiocese of Washington, D.C.; and the Rev. J.
Philip (CQ)Ashey (CQ) of the Church of the Apostles Episcopal
Church, Fairfax, Va.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who said she was a member of a gay and lesbian group was
denied an opportunity at the press conference to respond to the
comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hold your own press conference,'' Rabbi Levin said.

<P>
   Humans have lived in what is now California for at least 7,000
years, and the land they live on was formed over a few million
years of geologic time. But modern California _ the boisterous,
roiling, polyglot place of dreams that so fills the American
imagination _ was born on the morning of Jan. 24, 1848, at a
sawmill on the South Fork of the American River in the foothills of
the Sierra Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   ``This day some kind of mettle was found in the tail race that
looks like goald,'' Henry Bigler, a Mormon worker at the mill,
wrote in his diary. And from the moment that Bigler's boss, an
itinerant carpenter named James Marshall, found two tiny nuggets,
the first one about half the size and shape of a pea, in the water
channel of the mill owned by John Sutter, nothing was ever the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years, more than a quarter million migrants from
all over the world had come to seek their fortune, and though much
of the boom went bust within a decade and population centers moved
west and south, the settlers never really stopped coming. Today,
the Marshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park in Coloma, a tiny
village 50 miles east of Sacramento, readily recaptures the
excitement of Marshall's find, with a reconstruction of the mill _
now run by electricity _ and a small museum with blown-up
reproductions of Bigler's journal and other documents. It is as
good a place as any to begin a sesquicentennial tour of the
territory that made California the Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   The patient _ or the merely romantic _ can still pan for placer,
or particle, gold along the riverbank with wide, flat pans
available at shops throughout the region, and the weary can swim in
the Sierra-fed stream at a small campground across the way from the
mill site. But Coloma is only the chronological starting point for
visiting a region that, like the Cotswolds or Tuscan hill towns,
best yields its treasures to unhurried exploration.
</P>
<P>
   Stretching for more than 300 miles along California Route 49,
the Golden Chain Highway, the Gold Country today is a collection of
well-preserved Victorian frontier towns, historic museums, pristine
parks and rivers for hikes and whitewater rafting _ and even a
growing wine country _ all within easy reach of the grander
splendors of Lake Tahoe and Yosemite National Park.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent long weekend, my wife, Dee Dee, and I barreled north
from Los Angeles in our own private stagecoach, a trusty Ford
Explorer, racing across the vast agricultural expanse of the Great
Central Valley into the rolling foothills northeast of Fresno. We
drove almost the whole of Highway 49 over three and a half days,
but confined our official wanderings to the northern half of the
territory, the stretch from the town of Angels Camp north to Nevada
City, with frequent stops in between.
</P>
<P>
   It was in Angels Camp, in Calaveras County, that a young
prospector with a literary bent first heard the tale of a
celebrated jumping frog. A monument across the street from the old
Angels Hotel on Main Street commemorates Mark Twain's inspiration,
and an annual May Jumping Frog Jubilee at the county fairgrounds
draws competitors from all over to re-enact the legend. Just south
of town, atop a rise called Jackass Hill, a well-marked road off
Highway 49 leads to a reconstructed cabin that may or may not be
where Twain wrote the story that helped begin his career.
</P>
<P>
   A short drive east on Route 4 lies the picturesque town of
Murphys, where we stayed on an earlier trip to the region, with its
old Main Street shaded by giant elms and locusts and looking
unchanged from its heyday. There, the Murphys Historic Hotel, which
once played host to Twain, Ulysses S. Grant, J.P. Morgan and
others, still functions, and though guidebooks often cite its
charm, it seemed a bit musty to us, and a steak and salad dinner in
its restaurant was only passable. A far better redoubt is the
Dunbar House 1880 bed-and-breakfast, a white frame Italianate
cottage lovingly restored by Bob and Barbara Costa, who serve a
delicious breakfast of home-baked goods in a peaceful garden.
</P>
<P>
   Route 4, which heads up into the Sierras and in summer can be a
delightful back-country route to Tahoe, with cattle wandering
across the road in the high reaches of Ebbetts Pass, is a diverting
detour, with at least one truly spectacular sight: the Calaveras
Big Trees State Park. This stand of giant sequoias has neither the
tallest nor the most-visited examples of this tree, but in the
1850s they were the first to be discovered by white settlers and
for a time thought to be the only such specimens in the world.
There are two groves in the park, one in the north with 150 trees,
easily accessible from a parking lot; the other, in the south, with
more than 1,000 trees, is reachable only by an easy milelong walk
through an old-growth forest.
</P>
<P>
   Back on Highway 49, the road continues north to the pretty,
unspoiled town of Sutter Creek, named for the Swiss emigre whose
sawmill started it all, but whose own efforts at mining here ended
in dismal failure. A local merchant named Leland Stanford was
luckier: he took a share of a nearby mine as payment for a
customer's debt, and it ultimately became the basis of a fortune in
railroading that propelled Stanford to the governorship and to the
founding of Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Sutter Creek's Main Street is abuzz with a four-block
stretch of gift shops, bed-and-breakfasts and antiques shops, and
is home to what may be the finest luncheonette in North America,
the Chatterbox Cafe. Sharing the name of Garrison Keillor's
fictional restaurant but founded in 1946, long before ``Lake
Wobegon'' was invented, it was taken over in 1991 by Mike Gill and
his wife, Michele, longtime Keillor fans from the Los Angeles area
who spied it on a visit and couldn't resist the name. It serves
breakfast and lunch only, slowly, has just 14 stools and 5 tables,
closes at 3 p.m. (4 p.m. weekends) and is practically perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gill presides over an old-fashioned soda fountain that
still pumps out syrup and seltzer in separate streams, requiring
hand-dashing with a long spoon over crushed ice. In the kitchen,
Gill grills fresh-made hamburgers on homemade buns with skinny,
hand-cut fries from a bin of russet potatoes that juts out into the
only passage to the tiny, immaculate bathroom. The waitresses are
agreeably jaded and lippy, and virtually everything is homemade,
from the iced tea to the cinnamon buns and biscuits, and after a
lunch of two ``Prospector'' burgers (with thick locally smoked
bacon and Jarlsberg cheese), and fresh blackberry and coconut-cream
pie, we rolled out the door in a state of purest bliss.
</P>
<P>
   Stuffed and sleepy after our indulgence, where did we go next?
To a wine-tasting, of course, in the no-nonsense metal barn of
Domaine de la Terre Rouge, just outside the haunting remains of
Fiddletown, near Plymouth, in neighboring Amador County. Along with
Calaveras and El Dorado Counties, Amador constitutes a growing
local wine-producing region that dates back at least to the 1860s,
when some of the immigrants _ Basques and Italians, for example _
brought grape cuttings with them; today it makes award-winning
zinfandels, syrahs and other varietals.

   LOS ANGELES _ Disney has another winner on its hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World,'' arriving on video
Aug. 25, continues the story of the American Indian princess who
fell in love with a white man.
</P>
<P>
   Now home in England, John Smith has been accused of treason and
faces death, but after he escapes, the king turns to the matter of
defeating the Americans and claiming the land for England. But it
is John Rolfe who convinces him not to battle the savages until he
meets with their chief.
</P>
<P>
   The king dispatches Rolfe to bring the chief back to Britain but
it is Pocahontas who decides to go to England in his place.
</P>
<P>
   Irene Bedard reprises her role of the spirited teen, Russell
Means is back as Chief Powhaten, David Ogden Stiers again plays
Gov. Ratliffe, Michelle St. John returns as Nakoma, along with
Flit, Meeko and Percy.
</P>
<P>
   Several new characters are introduced in this sequel including
Billy Zane as the dashing British diplomat Rolfe, Jean Stapleton as
his kindly housekeeper Mrs. Jenkins and Donal Gibson, real-life
brother of Mel Gibson, in the role of Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Five new songs are introduced including ``Where Do I Go From
Here?'' and ``What a Day in London!''
</P>
<P>
   And Disney has spared no expense in re-creating a breathtaking
1600s England, complete with cobblestone streets, lush greenery and
colorful costumes.
</P>
<P>
   This sequel to the 1995 film completes the Pocahontas story.
Viewers will enjoy the young woman's English adventures, her new
love interest and the appearance of a friend from the past.
</P>
<P>
   STIRRING THE POT: Disney has also released its 1985 animated
feature ``The Black Cauldron'' ($26.99; one hour, 20 minutes) whose
failure at the box office put the chill on animation projects until
it heated up in 1989 with ``The Little Mermaid.'' This sword and
sorcery tale was aimed at kids who were gaga over ``Star Wars,''
complete with a farm boy, actually a pig boy in this case, who's
called upon to save the world. The plot's a little confusing, and
there are no catchy songs, but some of the animation is quite
lively. (Director Tim Burton was one of the animators). ``The Black
Cauldron'' isn't for the little ones, but the 8-and-older crowd
should enjoy it.

 UNDATED: other varietals.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In fact, the growing conditions are not unlike the long, hot
days of Provence, and Terre Rouge specializes in Rhone varietals
like grenache, syrah and mourvedre. We were inspired to visit after
tasting its Vin Gris d'Amador, a delightfully crisp dry rose. The
winery is owned by Bill Easton and Jane O'Riordan, former wine
merchants in Berkeley. The afternoon we visited, a friendly, though
not especially knowledgeable, employee happily poured a half-dozen
samples, and we went home with a case and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to make our Friday night's destination in Nevada City, we
sped up the road, breezing through famous towns like Placerville
(originally named Hangtown, for its rough justice), where my
great-great-grandfather sought his fortune in vain in the Gold Rush
but saw the money-making potential of the dry-goods business and
returned to rural Illinois where he eventually opened a store of
his own.
</P>
<P>
   Having made our reservations on short notice for a crowded
summer weekend, we had little choice of accommodations in Nevada
City, a picture-book Old West town whose main thoroughfare, Broad
Street, rises sharply up a steep hill. We stayed at a
bed-and-breakfast called The Parsonage, and it was adequate, but we
envied the inviting look of another, Grandmere's, in a sprawling
house just up the street that was full that weekend, and decided it
would be the preferred destination on our next trip.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada City is best seen by walking its hilly streets, and there
is plenty to see, from the small brick Nevada Theater, at 401 Broad
St., which dates from 1865 and is the oldest operating theater in
the state, to the National Hotel, at 211 Broad, said to be the
oldest continuously operating hotel west of the Rockies, with a
broad upstairs porch. The Nevada County Historical Society Museum
in Firehouse No. 1, at 214 Main St., has a charming collection of
old photographs and pioneer relics.
</P>
<P>
   But by far the most interesting attraction in the area _ and one
of the most compelling in all of the Gold Country _ is the Empire
Mine State Historic Park down the road in nearby Grass Valley. This
splendid 800-acre park is the site of the state's oldest, richest
hard-rock gold mine, which operated from 1850 to 1956, when the
price of gold made mining unprofitable. Here visitors can see what
a big industrial business mining became after the era of the early
49ers, when technology made it possible to dig deep into
underground quartz deposits, out of which gold was then laboriously
``stamped'' with giant smashing machines. We spent a fascinating
half-day here, with an enthusiastic and articulate state park
ranger as our guide, peering down a shaft of the abandoned mine.
The mine, stretching 11,000 feet below ground, contains 367 miles
of shafts, most of which are now flooded with groundwater.
</P>
<P>
   There are plans for a ride that would carry visitors through
part of the underground labyrinth, but even a tour of the mineyard
is enough to sense the hardship of the miners, most of them emigres
from the tin and copper mines of Cornwall, England. They brought
with them their beloved meat pie, the pastie, which is still a
staple in Grass Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Just outside the mineyard, in a class juxtaposition worthy of
Shavian drama, a gate leads to the lushly landscaped grounds and
stone-and-brick cottage of the Bourn family, which owned the mine
for much of its life. The family stayed here in Gilded Age luxury
during their periodic visits to the mine, ensconced in gardens and
a grove of trees but, even so, unable to escape the round-the-clock
pounding of the giant stamping machines. Today there are tours and
perpetual quiet.
</P>
<P>
   After a quick lunch of delicious hot pasties at Mrs. Dubblebee's
in Grass Valley, we headed off to Coloma, and then to a refreshing
dip in the canyons of the North and Middle Forks of the American
River at the Auburn State Recreation Area just east of Auburn on
Route 49.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, we wandered the winding streets of Nevada City, and
then took one last stroll through natural beauty in the South Yuba
River State Park at Bridgeport, a quick drive north of town on
Pleasant Valley Road off Highway 49. Bridgeport is home to a
beautiful 252-foot covered wooden bridge from 1862, one of the
longest single-span covered bridges in the country, and offers a
series of hikes and swimming holes in cool pools set back from the
bubbling rapids of the South Fork of the Yuba River.
</P>
<P>
   As we paddled from boulder to boulder in the soothing stream, we
could feel the powerful tug of the current and couldn't help
wondering if it still carried flecks of treasure. Reluctantly, we
dried off with spare T-shirts and turned south to Sacramento for
the long drive home down Interstate 5, the Golden State Freeway.

   Q. What happens to abandoned Web sites? Do they stay on the Web?
</P>
<P>
   A. Orphaned sites are a sad thing, indeed. Ignored by its
creator for whatever reason, a stranded page will just sit there
until someone (or some program) deletes it from the host Web
server.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the company that is the host of a particular site
will pull the plug if the site's creator neglects to pay the bills
or to update the site over a certain period of time. A once popular
page might be voluntarily shut down as its creator moves on to
other things, leaving a dead end from another page that links to
it.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet Archive (www.archive.org) is an organization that
is trying to find, record and store a copy of every public document
on the Web, dead or alive. The group's own site offers a link to a
free program called Alexa, which runs with your browser. If a dead
page is in the archive, Alexa can show you what it looked like.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Smoke gets in their eyes _ and that's only part of the
attraction. Once man cooked over an open fire in a cave. Some time
later came the 1950s backyard grill, a mammoth creation etched on
the landscape in brick or stone. In the '60s, more mobile chefs, or
those without backyards, swore by their portable hibachis and Weber
kettle grills. And then came the '80s and the portable gas-fired
grills that turned summer cookery into something as romantic as,
say, lighting the kitchen range.
</P>
<P>
   And now? After two decades of growth, the U.S. economy has
brought a return to the backyard barbecue. Fire-hungry homeowners
who want to keep up with the Dow Joneses are moving beyond rusty
iron grills to a new generation of built-ins. They want fish
baskets, wood-fired pizza and bread ovens, smokers and rotisseries.
They may even want a designer fire pit.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the experience of cooking over wood or charcoal
is powerful. ``The mingling of the fragrances with the air, the
unique quality of the smoke and the aroma of charcoal is very
healing and purifying,'' said Barrie Kavasch, a Native American
food historian who maintains that fire is ``emotionally magnetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's done in a primitive oven in a hole in the ground or
in a rooted-in-stone artisanal outdoor command post of the sort
that is becoming popular today, cooking over fire is in fact
booming. Steven Raichlen, author of ``The Barbecue! Bible''
(Workman, 1998), says he believes that the ``grill mania'' sweeping
the country is a reaction to the high-tech lives people are living.
``Grilling has a timelessness about it,'' he said. ``It appeals to
a primal yearning for fire-cooked food.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hamilton, Mass., a seaside town north of Boston, a tall stone
fireplace has a shiny stainless-steel grill and a fancy rotisserie.
Its owner, Boston chef Frank McClelland, lives in a year-old house
built with an outdoor hearth. ``I wanted to experience the great
pleasure of cooking outside during the spring, summer and fall
months,'' McClelland said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Martin, the owner of Martin Grill and Oven Works, in
Providence, R.I., recently made a fish basket for McClelland that
attaches to the rotisserie. Martin said that the demand for
expensive outdoor cooking areas is increasing and that outdoor
ovens for the home have risen to 20 percent of his business, from 5
percent five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Ross, a food historian who has taught courses in
historical cookery in Smithtown, N.Y., for 20 years, noticed the
change about two years ago. ``All of a sudden there was an interest
specifically in building brick ovens and learning how to bake and
cook in them,'' Ms. Ross said. The demand was so great that she has
added a course on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   When McClelland and his family moved to Hamilton from an
apartment above his Boston restaurant, L'Espalier, he hired Peter
Giordano, who describes himself as a muratore. (The word is Italian
for mason.) Giordano, born in Palermo, Sicily, has been building
with stone since he was 14. Now 53, he and his son Peter Jr., 26,
built a fireplace for McClelland that is an update of a traditional
design.
</P>
<P>
   The fireplace is made primarily of local field stone. The stone
chimney and grill area are built on a brick base; counters and the
grill are standard height, 36 inches. High-quality iron spot
bricks, which cost $1.35 apiece as against 40 cents for standard
bricks, was chosen. The top of the chimney is made of the same
bluestone as the surrounding terrace, and a food preparation area
is also made of bluestone.
</P>
<P>
   Although the design is simple and timeless, it includes modern
modifications, particularly inside the fireplace. For the walls,
the masons used cement blocks rather than solid stone. ``If we
would have built this using the ancient method, we would have had
12- to 16-inch solid walls on both sides,'' said Giordano Sr.
Instead they determined that stone veneer over cement blocks would
be more efficient and less expensive. Yet, the cost for the
fireplace still ran about $5,000, or $35 a square foot.
</P>
<P>
   Worth it, McClelland said. ``When I cook at home, I love to let
my hair down,'' he said. ``The idea of coming out here when the
weather is cool and roasting game or meat is fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, Texas, June and Mark Chandler purchased a house four
years ago and found a crumbling outdoor fireplace held together by
little more than ivy. They hired Gardens, a local landscape design
and construction concern, to recreate and embellish an outdoor
cooking area where one had been built 70 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bauer, an architectural designer at Gardens, was inspired
by traditional Italian stone techniques to create a new oven,
entertainment area, grill and terrace. He said his emphasis was on
using stone the way it is supposed to be used. ``There is nothing
fancy here,'' he said. ``We used the simplest materials: limestone,
galvanized metal and pea gravel. What this is really about it is
how it is executed.''
</P>
<P>
   Using blocks of white Texas limestone measuring 24 by 12 by 6
inches, Bauer made the walls of the oven tower 12 inches thick.
``Stone is meant to be heavy and big and support itself,'' he said.
``In today's world, stone is often used as a veneer. In our
construction, all of our stone becomes load-bearing walls.''
</P>
<P>
   When the quarry stone arrived, it was in a rough rectangular
shape; stonemasons reworked each block by hand to make certain the
corners were crisp and straight.
</P>
<P>
   The limestone blocks in the Chandlers' original terrace had been
pushed up by tree roots. The masons were able to recycle the blocks
for the new terrace; pea gravel was used to fill in where the roots
were intruding.
</P>
<P>
   The $2,500 wood-fired pizza oven the Chandlers selected came
from Italy in terra-cotta sections. Although they fit together
tightly, Bauer had stonemasons seal the oven entirely with a layer
of cement.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The tower that houses the oven looks like a folly sitting in a
Tuscan garden. It is 10 feet high with a standing-seam metal roof.
Ivy climbs its walls, and the whole thing looks as if it had been
on this spot for years.
</P>
<P>
   The terrace is 30 feet square, including the area for the
barbecue grill, storage cabinets and galvanized metal counter tops,
which won't rust, set along a 19-foot-long limestone wall. Cabinet
doors are made of teak and wire mesh. The total cost was about
$38,000.
</P>
<P>
   When Donald and Virginia Sohn were renovating a 60-foot-long
terrace behind their home in Beverly Farms, Mass., ``it seemed to
need a fireplace,'' Mrs. Sohn said. What she had in mind was quite
different from what her architect, John Pears, drew for her. Pears,
who was born in South Africa, presented a hybrid of several
different fireplaces he had seen in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Particularly in Malawi, they don't do structures,'' he said.
``They make a pit in the ground. Here the sunken terrace that
already existed became like the pit.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone walls surrounded the area, and would provide seating. It
was the congeniality of a circle around a fire that inspired Pears.
``Everyone faces inward and looks at each other across this event,
while people cook together,'' he explained. In the end, he adapted
an African concept to fit an American life style.
</P>
<P>
   The fireplace consists of a 48-inch circular drum, built with
bricks recycled from a chimney in a nearby carriage house. Firewood
is stored on a bluestone cap above the drum. The firebox is a
conical steel structure that contains the fire. Topping that is a
42-inch rotating steel grill. The grill gently spirals up and down,
so food can be raised high when the fire is hot and lowered as it
cools. Pears also designed a circular steel ledge, at counter
height, to hold implements, plates and drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Custom fabrication added to the costs. With the architect's
design fee, the tab for the Sohns' grill was nearly $15,000. But it
was an instant success.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first party we had was in October, and the night was
brisk,'' Ms. Sohn said. ``As the evening drew on, the crowd sat on
the walls around the fireplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether a fire pit, a pizza oven or a fish basket added to a
fireplace well anchored to the land, the new accouterments have
attracted fans of entertaining outdoors. ``If you are cooking your
very chic buffalo burgers on a very chic outdoor grill,'' said Ms.
Kavasch, the food historian, ``they do taste better.''
</P>
<P>
   An outdoor oven is usually dome-shaped and gets as hot as 600 to
700 degrees. Wood is set inside and fired up, and afterward the
coals are raked out. Baking is done directly on the oven floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Correct dimensions when building an oven are critical,'' said
Frank Martin, owner of Martin Grill &AMP; Oven Works in Providence,
R.I. ``The door height should be no more than 65 percent of the
height to the top of the oven.''
</P>
<P>
   Outdoor ovens begin at $5,000. Sources for them include Martin's
company, at (401) 724-1491; Peter Giordano of Gloucester, Mass.,
(508) 283-2793, and Gardens in Austin, Texas, (512) 467-9934.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (Take 1 -- in two takes)
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported that Monica Lewinsky was given
``transactional immunity'' to testify about her relationship with
President Clinton in Kenneth Starr's investigation. What does that
mean, and how does it differ from immunity in general?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Transactional immunity'' is a form of blanket protection so
comprehensive it is rarely granted by prosecutors. Basically, it
means that there can be no prosecution under any circumstances in
connection with events coming out of the entire ``transaction'' _
hence the term. For her part, Lewinsky promised her full and
truthful testimony and must answer any and all questions Starr
might raise before the grand jury. She will not have the option of
invoking the Fifth Amendment, which protects citizens from
self-incrimination, because with no prospect of being prosecuted
there's no possibility of self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   A more limited and more widely used immunity, known as ``use
immunity,'' is not an absolute guarantee. Under that form of
protection, prosecutors cannot use anything witnesses say to
prosecute them or to seek evidence to prosecute them. But the
witnesses can still be prosecuted if other evidence surfaces
independently that they have committed a crime.
</P>
<P>
   So, the former White House intern will not go to jail as long as
she tells the truth, regardless of any evidence against her.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the five states with the lowest number of prison
inmates per 1,000 population, and the five with the highest?
</P>
<P>
   A: The highest rates per 100,000, ac-- ording to 1997 figures
from the U.S. Department of Justice, are the District of Columbia
at 1,682; Louisiana, 672; South Carolina, 636; Nevada, 618; and
Oklahoma, 617. The lowest rates are North Dakota, 112; Minnesota,
113; Maine, 124; Vermont, 140; and West Virginia, 174.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Have scientists discovered the cause of the huge upwelling of
cold water in the Gulf of Mexico along the Florida Panhandle? After
only one news report a few days ago, nothing has been mentioned in
the media.
</P>
<P>
   A: In the words of one researcher, ``In a nutshell, no.'' Both
Beverly Roberts of the Florida Marine Research Institute and Sneed
Collard, a biologist at the University of West Florida in
Pensacola, agree that as yet there is no hard scientific data
supporting a theory of what caused the 15-to-20-mile-wide band of
cold water that stretched along the coast for nearly 200 miles in
June and July.
</P>
<P>
   Collard, who has been charged by the federal government with
investigating the phenomenon, says remnants of the cold water _
which may have come from the 10,000-foot deep DeSoto Canyon _ are
still hanging around, but not in the concentrations seen earlier.
He cautions that news reports may have made the event seem more
ominous than it was. He fielded calls from dozens of reporters and
heard possible explanations ranging from pollution to a giant hole
in the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico. His best guess? ``There are no
coherent theories out there at this time. It's an anomalous cold
water event. I've got to leave it at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Iraqi flag, which I see often on CNN, has three stripes,
and in the center there are stars and what I imagine are Arabic
words. What do the words mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: The inscription, on the white (middle) stripe, means ``God is
great.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: On Vice President Al Gore's recent trip to Ukraine, it was
reported that Chernobyl was the world's third-largest nuclear
reactor before the explosion there in 1986. What are the world's
largest reactors now?
</P>
<P>
   A: These are the world's top 15 reactors in terms of energy
generation (measured in magawatts heat), as reported in the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission's 1997 Information Digest: Phillipsburg-2, in
Germany; Neckar-2, Germany; Palo Verde-3, Arizona; Emsland,
Germany; Grondhe, Germany; Brokdorf, Germany; South Texas-2, United
States; Isar-2, Germany; South Texas-1, United States; Unterweser,
Germany; Ohi-3, Japan; Seabrook, New Hampshire; Penly-2, France;
Ohi-2, Japan; and Gralenrheinfeld, Germany.

<P>
   Q: Can you tell me if ``Lord of the Dance'' is playing now?
Anywhere I could see it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Better rent the videotape, or plan on taking a trip. The
closest place to see it currently is Las Vegas, where one of the
troupes has set up shop in the Broadway Theatre of the New York-New
York Hotel/Casino. It's a ``permanent'' run, meaning it will play
there as long as audiences come. Two other troupes tour worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Flatley, who created ``Lord of the Dance'' after
splitting with ``Riverdance,'' doesn't perform in the Las Vegas
show, but he remains artistic director. The Las Vegas cast includes
Conor James Smith as the Lord of the Dance; Geraldine Bergin as
Saorise, the Irish colleen; Decklan Bucke as the Dark Lord;
Catriona Hale as Morrighan, the Temptress; Ashling Dunney as the
Little Spirit; and Rosemary Collier as Erin the Goddess.
Information: 702-740-6815.
</P>
<P>
   Other troupes are on tour. Here are some of the places you can
fly off to and see ``Lord'' this year: Cardiff, Wales, Sept. 7-8;
Glasgow, Scotland, Sept. 11-12; Sheffield, England, Sept. 15-16;
Newcastle, England, Sept. 18-19; Hamburg, Germany, Oct. 1-2;
Stuttgart, Germany, Oct. 6-7; Munich, Oct. 9-11; back to Hamburg,
Oct. 13-17; Berlin, Oct. 19-21; Brussels, Belgium, Oct. 23-24;
Frankfurt, Oct. 26-27; Vienna, Oct. 29-30; Innsbruck, Austria, Nov.
1-2; Cologne, Germany, Nov. 4-6; Ghent, Belgium, Nov. 10-11; Paris,
Nov. 24-25; Oslo, Norway, Nov. 27-29; Gothenburg, Sweden, Dec. 1-2;
Stockholm, Dec. 4-6; Copenhagen, Dec. 8-9; and Helsinki, Finland,
Dec. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Flatley, meanwhile, is busy with a film project under the
working title ``Dream Dancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: ``Inside Edition'' recently featured a woman who had lost a
good bit of weight. She started her own business with a cookbook
and menus for overweight people. I didn't see all the program, so
could you provide any details? How can I get her book?
</P>
<P>
   A: The woman you saw is JoAnna M. Lund, author of a series of
cookbooks under the Healthy Exchanges banner. At one time she
tipped the scales at 300 pounds, and when three of her children
were called to active duty during Operation Desert Storm in the
Persian Gulf, Lund resolved to make a drastic change. She devised a
method of what she called ``exchanges'' to enable her to eat all
the food that she loved, while exchanging the fats and sugars with
healthier choices, thus reducing the calorie intake. She lost 130
pounds, and the idea for her Healthy Exchanges cookbook was born.
</P>
<P>
   Lund now has written eight books and a series of booklets,
writes a syndicated newspaper column, has a radio show, has
produced two inspirational audio tapes, and operates several
businesses. Her latest book, ``Dessert Every Night,'' will be
published in September. She plans a book-signing visit to Atlanta
in October, her publicist said.
</P>
<P>
   Information: Healthy Exchanges, P.O. Box 124, DeWitt, IA 52742;
or call 1-800-766-8961 or 319-659-8234.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has there been an official inquiry into the fire last month
on the Carnival Cruise Lines ship Ecstasy?
</P>
<P>
   A: The National Transportation Safety Board is continuing to
investigate the July 13 fire, which caused no deaths but left 78
people, mainly crew members, complaining of various trauma-related
ailments. A formal report is nine months to a year away, said James
Scheffer, a NTSB marine investigator.
</P>
<P>
   The vessel, which remained afloat after the fire broke out just
2 miles offshore after leaving Miami, was taken to Newport News,
Va., for repairs. Cruises have been canceled through Sept. 11.
Authorities initially discounted, but did not exclude, speculation
by the ship's owners that the fire was started by a welder in a
lower laundry area and spread upward through vents to an open-air
deck where flammable mooring ropes were stored.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB also is checking into the ship's firefighting
procedures and passenger communications. Jim Garrett of the Coast
Guard, which helped Carnival crew members fight the fire, said the
Ecstasy's mechanical protections appear to have performed well.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the address to write Senate Majority LeaderTrent
Lott? A newspaper editorial suggested that we inundate his office
with letters imploring him to allow a vote on the Shays-Meehan bill
concerning campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   A: Write: Sen. Trent Lott, Russell Building/487, 1st and C
streets N.E., Washington, D.C. 20510.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (Take 2 -- in two takes)

 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service

<P>
   UNDATED: Russell Building/487, 1st and C streets N.E.,

<P>
   Q: I'm curious about the American Heritage Rivers program. What
is it all about? How are rivers selected?
</P>
<P>
   A: The idea, according to Environmental Protection Agency and
other government officials involved, is to channel federal
resources to local communities ``to help them preserve the
historic, cultural, recreational, economic and environmental
values'' of their rivers. The initiative was announced Feb. 4,
1997, by President Clinton. Communities nominate their areas to the
program; if their rivers receive the designation, the communities
will receive streamlined, focused support to access existing
programs and services. It's not a ``land grab'' for rivers,
according to the EPA, and no foreign governments or international
organizations are involved.
</P>
<P>
   If you have Internet access, check this site _
www.epa.gov/OWOW/heritage/rivers.html _ for complete information.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was it ever revealed what brand of golf ball astronaut Alan
Shepard hit on the moon? He had always kept it secret.
</P>
<P>
   A: It wasn't your ordinary Wilson or Maxfli. The three balls
Shepard used Feb. 6, 1971, when he made his shot heard 'round the
universe, were not identified by NASA, but described by only as
``special and heat-resistant. We can tell you some other things
about the feat, however. He missed the first shot, connected on the
second and third, and estimated that the balls went ``miles and
miles and miles'' in the moon's weak gravitational pull. Scientists
later said possibly a half-mile,at most.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the club? The secretly prepared, customized
Wilson 6-iron Shepard used was created by Jack Harden, head pro at
a Houston country club frequented by National Aeronautics and Space
Administration personnel. He was approached by a NASA engineer who
said Shepard was toying with the idea of hitting a golf ball, but
the problem was how to smuggle a golf club along. Harden was given
the end portion of a utility tool similar to the one Shepard would
be carrying on the moon. Cutting off a small shovel from its end,
Harden was able to grind the stem so it would fit into the socket
of the club head.
</P>
<P>
   Although Shepard wasn't the first man in space (that was Soviet
cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin), he was the first American, and he was
always proud of his golfing exploit. ``Probably I'm a hell of a lot
more famous for being the guy who hit the golf ball on the moon
than the first guy in space,'' Shepard said in a 1996 interview.
</P>
<P>
   Q: ``Buffalo Bob'' Smith, the creator of ``Howdy Doody,'' died
recently. Can you print the words to his program's theme song?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's set to the tune of ``Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay'':
</P>
<P>
   It's Howdy Doody time,
</P>
<P>
   It's Howdy Doody time.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Smith and Howdy, too,
</P>
<P>
   Say howdy doo to you.
</P>
<P>
   Let's give a rousing cheer,
</P>
<P>
   'Cause Howdy Doody's here.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to start the show,
</P>
<P>
   So kids, let's go!
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has there been a change in entry requirements for a U.S.
citizen traveling to Canada? My wife recently was denied boarding
for a flight to Canada from Atlanta because she didn't have proof
of citizenship, although she had flown there in previous years
without it.
</P>
<P>
   A: The requirement for proof of citizenship has always been in
effect, according to the Canadian Consulate General. Passports are
recommended, because they verify citizenship and have a photo, but
citizens or permanent residents of the United States aren't
required to have passports. If a passport is not available, some
sort of original identification papers or certified copies proving
citizenship (birth, baptismal or naturalization certificates) are
required, along with an ID card containing a photo. Permanent
residents of the United States are advised to carry their Resident
Alien Card (U.S. form 1-151 or form 1-551).
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was told that Monica Lewinsky gained access to the White
House because of the government shutdown. Can you confirm?
</P>
<P>
   A: Lewinsky already was a White House intern at the time, but
the story goes _ and President Clinton confirmed it in a deposition
in January _ that Lewinsky and other interns once brought him pizza
in the Oval Office during the federal government shutdown in 1995.
This was before she was transferred to the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Associated Press in March, Monica
Lewinsky's father, Dr. Bernard Lewinsky, said he believes his
daughter moved from her internship to a full-paying job because she
received accolades for volunteering during the shutdown to answer
phones inside the White House in then-Chief of Staff Leon Panetta's
office. ``She was commended not only by Mr. Panetta but by
everybody on the staff for the outstanding job that she did
answering over 1,000 telephone calls that day correctly,'' he said.
``On the basis of that, I believe, she was able to apply (for) and
receive the position that she got.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I want to visit Althorp, in England, next year to see
Princess Diana's burial site. When will tickets for next summer go
on sale?
</P>
<P>
   A: Details for 1999 haven't yet been announced. A spokesman for
Althorp House told Q&AMP;A that the site probably will be open again in
July and August, as it was this year, but he wasn't sure. He
advised those interested to call in January or afterward to inquire
about specific details, including ticket arrangements. The number:
011-44-1604-592020. Another option is to call the British Tourist
Authority in New York: 800-462-2748.
</P>
<P>
   When you make your travel arrangements, you need to know that
Althorp House is 100 miles from the little village of Althorp, so
don't get them confused.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What states are involved in Powerball?
</P>
<P>
   A: We're printed it before, but since Powerball hysteria breaks
out every so often when jackpots rise to astronomical heights,
here's the list again. In the most recent jackpot frenzy, it was
documented that many players drove long distances and even bought
airline tickets to states where they could buy tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The states are: Arizona; Connecticut; Delaware; Idaho; Indiana;
Iowa; Kansas; Kentucky; Louisiana; Minnesota; Missouri; Montana;
Nebraska; New Hampshire; New Mexico; Oregon; Rhode Island; South
Dakota; West Virginia; and Wisconsin. Plus, the District of
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that Rezulin, a diabetes drug, has been banned
in Europe, and liver problems have been reported in the United
States. Do you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was widely reported recently that consumer advocates in
the United States, including Public Citizen, had urged the
government to ban Rezulin, citing 26 deaths worldwide from liver
failure. The call to ban the drug, which has been widely touted as
a way to help some patients reduce their need for insulin, came
seven months after Britain banned it because of liver risks.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration strengthened its testing and
labeling requirements in an advisory Dec. 1, saying patients taking
Rezulin (troglitazone) should be monitored more frequently for
signs of injury to the liver. It also issued a requirement for
warning information about potential liver toxicity to be more
prominently displayed in the drug's labeling.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturer Parke-Davis, which insists the drug is safe when
used properly, sent letters in late July to 500,000 doctors saying
the FDA had upgraded its warning for doctors to test patients'
livers for signs of toxicity for the first eight months of Rezulin
use. The tests need to be made monthly, according to the
manufacturer.

<P>
   A new house is a major investment. All home buyers are concerned
that their money will be well spent. They dread the prospect of
discovering major flaws or defects after they buy and move in. The
problem is that most people don't really know what to look for when
buying a house.
</P>
<P>
   Start by considering the style of house. It is important to
understand that even though a house looks elegant, it may not fit
your needs.
</P>
<P>
   Ranch houses, for example, are the most popular houses in
America, but they do have some drawbacks. Since the entire house is
on one level, it has a larger roof area than a two-story house. The
big expanse of roof allows more heat to escape in the winter and
absorbs more sunlight in the summer, so heating and cooling bills
can be higher than for other houses. These costs may not be
excessive, however, if the attic has adequate ventilation and
insulation. Also keep in mind that if you have to replace the roof,
it can be a costly proposition
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, ranch houses are easy to maintain because all
the rooms are on one level. Exterior painting, roof repair and
gutter cleaner can be done from a step ladder. Ranch houses are a
good choice for older people or those individuals who find stair
climbing difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Most real estate agents call any two-story house a ''colonial''
as long as both floors are the same size, with the bedrooms on the
upper floor. Two-story houses are cheaper to heat and cool than
large one-story houses.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining the exterior of the house can be a lot of work. You
will have to raise an extension ladder to paint the upper story or
clean the gutters.
</P>
<P>
   Bi-level houses are essentially ranch houses raised so the
basement/lower level is largely above ground. The lower level may
also include a garage and storage area that, although convenient,
cuts into the living space. Bi-levels are ideally suited to sloping
lots, where the upper level opens directly onto the backyard.
</P>
<P>
   The Cape Cod house is a one-and-a-half story structure. The top
half story is the attic, which may or may not be finished. If the
attic is converted into living quarters, the rooms will be small
because part of the sloping roof serves as the walls. These top
rooms may be difficult to heat or cool if the roof is not properly
insulated. Cape Cods are attractive to first-time home buyers
because they are less expensive than larger houses. A large family,
however, will probably feel cramped in one.
</P>
<P>
   Many home buyers love the elegance of Tudor-style houses. The
stucco and wood trim, leaded-glass windows, roof gables and angular
chimneys create a romantic facade, but these features also make
Tudors expensive. Take time to carefully inspect a low-priced Tudor
that seems like an exceptional bargain. Often the stucco surfaces
are made of thin layers of metal lath and cement that may
deteriorate in a short time.
</P>
<P>
   Most Tudors have slate roofs that are extremely durable, but the
valley flashing between the many gables and dormers is not as
rugged and is subject to leaks.
</P>
<P>
   Today many home buyers are rediscovering the architectural
beauty of older Victorian houses. The problem with many Victorians
is that the plumbing and electrical installations may not be
adequate to meet today's needs. Larger Victorians may be difficult
to heat, especially if they are inadequately insulated.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it can be expensive to match or replace the elaborate
fixtures and ornamentation throughout the house if you have to make
major repairs or renovations. Another problem with older period
homes is that it is difficult to upgrade them with new
low-maintenance materials. Tudors, for example, do not look good
with vinyl siding.

`DOGS OF DOW' GURU SWITCHES HIS INVESTMENT STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: With DOW-O'HIGGINS-SUIT)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLAIRE HUGHES  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLONIE, N.Y. _ When Michael B. O'Higgins is losing a round of
golf, he tries to persuade opponents to settle their scores and
start the betting anew at the next hole.
</P>
<P>
   If the well-known financial adviser times it right, he can play
worse than his competitors, but come out a winner _ at least
monetarily.
</P>
<P>
   It's how a contrarian financial strategist plays the fairways,
the 51-year-old O'Higgins explained recently at Schuyler Meadows
Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the cyclicality of golf, as is the case with
(financial) markets, as in life in general,'' O'Higgins said. ``You
don't have too many straight lines in this world.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Higgins, a native of Venezuela who lived in Cuba and the Far
East before settling in Loudonville, N.Y., and then Miami, has a
preference for the squiggly route.
</P>
<P>
   The approach has won him plenty of attention _ both bullish and
bearish _ and has him poised for the spotlight again.
</P>
<P>
   His new book, detailing an updated twist on his contrarian
investment strategies, is scheduled to hit bookstores this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, O'Higgins became well-known in financial circles in
the early 1990s, when his book ``Beating the Dow'' spawned a
multibillion-dollar industry based on strategies called ``Dogs of
the Dow.''
</P>
<P>
   His ideas have brought him supporters and detractors in the
Albany area, where he once lived and worked.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Apkarian remembers O'Higgins attending annual meetings of
Mechanical Technology Inc., which Apkarian formerly headed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's evaluating a particular investment, he does a
thorough analysis of it, and he's bright enough to understand what
he sees and hears,'' Apkarian said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Madarasz, a spokesman for the New York Civil Service
Employees Association, extols O'Higgins' abilities, saying the
adviser has done well by the public employee union's funds.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Capital District Physicians' Health Plan
won a $2.7 million judgment against O'Higgins last year. The HMO
claimed he improperly invested the health maintenance
organization's money.
</P>
<P>
   O'Higgins and the HMO reached a confidential settlement
agreement this year.
</P>
<P>
   O'Higgins said it was not news to him that people either love
him or hate him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are like that _ they have strong personalities,
and they bring out strong reactions,'' he said about himself.
``I've never been a shrinking violet.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps controversy is to be expected when the subject is a
contrarian.
</P>
<P>
   What's almost certain is that he'll be a conversation topic if
``Beating the Dow with T-Bonds, T-Bills and Stocks'' does as well
as the first book, which has sold more than 200,000 copies. For the
new one, HarperCollins paid him an advance of nearly $500,000, the
New York Post has reported.
</P>
<P>
   This time, O'Higgins said, anyone using the new strategy with
clients will owe him a fee. While O'Higgins earned much attention
from ``Beating the Dow,'' he earned no money from financial
managers who used it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm patenting this one. ... They're going to get sued next
time,'' O'Higgins said.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't patent the first book, he said, because it never
occurred to him it would become so popular.
</P>
<P>
   The idea began gestating in the 1970s, when O'Higgins lived in
Loudonville. He had arrived in 1965 to attend Siena College,
founded by Franciscans, at the recommendation of two uncles who
were Franciscan monks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't the most serious student,'' O'Higgins said. ``Chasing
money and chasing women were my interests then. Now it's just
making money.''
</P>
<P>
   He stayed after graduation, he said, because he liked the region
and met his wife here. His wife, Donna, graduated from the State
University of New York at Albany.
</P>
<P>
   O'Higgins started his career in 1971 at investment research firm
Spencer Trask &AMP; Co. During 1973 and 1974, when a bear market hit
and stocks plummeted, O'Higgins began questioning the firm's
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   He opened his own firm in 1978 and began using the contrarian
ideas that were published later in ``Beating the Dow.''
Essentially, O'Higgins purchased stocks he calculated to be
momentarily out of favor, with the thought of buying low and
selling high.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was pleased with the results. He was sued twice in
federal court for investments he managed in the 1980s, accused by a
physician and two dentists for breaching his fiduciary duties in
connection with their pension and profit-sharing funds.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, O'Higgins was accused of not following his
clients' wishes, which resulted in big declines in the funds'
value.
</P>
<P>
   Also in both cases, federal judges decided in O'Higgins' favor.
In a 1992 decision, Judge Frederick J. Scullin Jr. wrote, ``The
plaintiffs were well aware of the risks. They were well aware of
the defendant's investment philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, O'Higgins had published some of that contrarian
philosophy in ``Beating the Dow,'' igniting an entire industry.
</P>
<P>
   A consortium of large brokerage firms offer funds called unit
investment trusts tied to the `Dogs' method. O'Higgins helped
market Merrill Lynch's funds initially, said Roberta Hess, vice
president of defined asset funds in the company's Princeton, N.J.,
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have almost $20 billion following the `Dogs of the Dow'
strategy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry King, associate vice president of investment at Prudential
Securities in Albany, said it's easy to understand why the ``Dogs''
method took off running.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a simple concept, the fees are extremely reasonable, and
it's easy to explain and it works,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``Dogs'' strategy began slipping in 1993 as the stock
market headed upward, according to a Wall Street Journal report.
Merrill's so-called ``Select 10'' strategy saw returns over the
last year and the five-year period ended Dec. 31, 1997, of 27
percent and 21 percent, below the Dow's return of nearly 30 percent
in 1997 and nearly 28 percent in the five-year period.
</P>
<P>
   O'Higgins not only is the first to concede this, he also said he
sent a letter to his clients last August _ when the Dow hit 8,200 _
urging them to dump the ``Dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of reasons the ``Dogs'' bark has outpaced
their bite, O'Higgins said. First, the stock market overall has
become overvalued, due to a flood of investments from retirement
plans and amateur speculators. Second, too many people are
following some form of the strategy he set out in ``Beating the
Dow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea behind this is to buy things that are cheap,''
O'Higgins says. ``But if something becomes too popular ... it
usually rises in price to a point where it's no longer cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not revealing much about the new book before it hits the
stores. But he said the new strategy considers investments in bonds
and Treasury bills as well as stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the Valley Forge Management Corp. of Wayne, Pa., has
signed a contract with O'Higgins to establish the The O'Higgins
Fund Inc. using the strategy.
</P>
<P>
   O'Higgins points out that this is a way for investors who can't
afford his own $1 million minimum to use his method.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, are undecided, among them Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have talked to him about it. ... But at this point there's
just been discussions,'' Hess said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Sivy, Wall Street editor for Money magazine, said
variations on O'Higgins' ``Beating the Dow'' remain a good
long-term investment method, even if they're not doing as well as
the Dow right now. The relative downturn, he believes, is due not
to the strategy's popularity but the current dominance of
big-growth stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Sivy is not convinced a new strategy that includes bonds and
T-bills will necessarily be better.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sort of doesn't matter how you draw up the rules, as long
as they give you a universe of big established companies and they
give you a way of selecting the ones that are the cheapest,'' Sivy
said. ``I'm not sure that adding more wrinkles and more
complications makes it better.''

HMO NO FAN OF `DOGS' THEORIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLAIRE HUGHES  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Nationally, Michael B. O'Higgins' name is no
doubt most associated with the investment strategy known as the
Dogs of the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Albany area, he has most recently received attention
for a lawsuit brought against him by the Capital District
Physicians' Health Plan in 1994 and settled this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Albany-based health maintenance organization ended up
selling $2.4 million securities it had bought for $5.1 million
under O'Higgins' management. In January 1997, a federal judge
ordered O'Higgins to pay up to the tune of $2.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he did was not within what we told him our policy was,''
said Dan Colacino, the HMO's vice president of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Though that charge was similar to two previous lawsuits brought
against O'Higgins in federal court, in this case a judge ruled
against O'Higgins based on a separate issue: The investment adviser
had neglected to reveal that he was using his brother, James
O'Higgins, then a First Albany Corp. vice president, as the
commissioned broker-dealer for the purchases. The judge determined
Michael O'Higgins breached his duty in not revealing the potential
conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   O'Higgins appealed, and a confidential settlement was reached
earlier this year. O'Higgins would offer no information, but said
the HMO would have prospered if its administrators didn't get
scared when the bonds he invested in were down.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sold at bottom, and then sued ... which is incredible to
me,'' O'Higgins said. ``And then this bond subsequently
skyrocketed.''
</P>
<P>
   The HMO sold, Colacino said, because it was concerned about an
outside-its-policy expenditure of its members' money.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we saw the performance of the investment, we sought
outside financial advice, and their advice was to sell, and we just
took their advice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   E. Stewart Jones, a lawyer who knows O'Higgins socially, said
lawsuits are part of the game when your job is investing clients'
money at some risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the nature of that business; people become
dissatisfied,'' Jones said.

SPINOFF GAMES THAT OUTSHINE A FILM PARENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was inevitable that the Hollywood blockbuster
licensing-cross-promotional-merchandise machine would someday
create a movie that looked cheap, tacky and shallow next to its
spinoff products.
</P>
<P>
   Witness ``Small Soldiers,'' a popcorn film about cybernetic
action figures on a malignant rampage. The movie is egregious. But
the plastic toys that come with a Burger King meal are great.
</P>
<P>
   And the video games are excellent.
</P>
<P>
   Small Soldiers Globotech Design Lab and Small Soldiers Squad
Commander (Hasbro Interactive, $29.95 each, Windows 95) outshine
their celluloid namesake by several orders of magnitude.
</P>
<P>
   Globotech Design Lab is a combat game with build-your-own action
figures. Half of it is a design exercise, a virtual model shop
where you combine plastic body parts to build the ultimate fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Each arm, leg, head or torso has different attributes. It's
possible to match parts from prebuilt characters, but it's much
more fun to combine arms and legs from different action figures
into your own cubist collage of cyborg appendages.
</P>
<P>
   My own virtual Frankenstein's monster, Klaatu, consisted of a
roaring chain-saw arm, a Kung Fu Grip arm, one robot implant leg,
one satellite communications leg and the head of Chip Hazard,
leader of the Small Soldiers' Commando Elite.
</P>
<P>
   From there, your character goes to the paint shop, where you
pick from an array of colors and textures for each body part. You
then select a computer chip to snap into the figure's back and
choose from a menu of fighting moves.
</P>
<P>
   Punches and blocks consume computer power and chip capacity is
limited, so these are resource management decisions. The design
process allows each custom-built character a number of taunts
(``Show me what you're made of, soldier!'' ``Who wants some?'') for
attitudinal posturing in battle.
</P>
<P>
   Once your action figure is assembled and animated (It's alive
... alive!), the game shifts into battle phase, a Mortal
Kombat-style free-for-all in which anything, even an opponent's
fallen limbs (or your own), can be used as a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   As you rack up victories in single combat, additional chip sets
become available, allowing you to equip your action figure with
more power, increased damage resistance and better moves.
</P>
<P>
   It's all about upgrading your technology _ trading up to faster
processors, upgrading peripherals and reconfiguring the machine to
perform in new ways. When you hit a plateau in combat, it's
probably time to go back to the model shop and switch parts.
</P>
<P>
   The tinkering options are endless. It's still the same
character, but by the end of the game, all the original parts have
probably been replaced. Which begs the old freshman philosophy
question about the ax handle: You replace a broken ax handle, then
the blade breaks. If you replace the blade, is it the same ax?
</P>
<P>
   In the ontological scheme of Small Soldiers Globotech Design
Lab, the answer is, ``Yes, because I can use it to beat the
Gorgonite boss on level five.'' Or, ``Yes, because I can print it
out as a trading card.'' Or, ``Yes, because I can download it onto
a floppy disk, take it over to my friend's house and beat up his
action figure with it.''
</P>
<P>
   With a modicum of technical savvy, you could replicate any one
of these virtual fighting robots and post it to the Web. It makes
the film look retrograde. In the movie, these action figures are
made of plastic and silicon in factories and shipped around the
country in trucks.

 &HT;    LIVING THE DIPLOMATIC LIFE; ONE 'SOLITARY PACKAGE' AWAY FROM
VIOLENCE, INSECURITY
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (w) Washington
categories.
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman  
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Coffee cup in hand, I was practicing my French with
some of my new colleagues at the Hotel Talleyrand -- the U.S.
consulate in Paris -- one lazy late summer morning when the
courtyard beneath our window all of a sudden emptied.
</P>
<P>
   A solitary package remained.
</P>
<P>
   A moment later, a loudspeaker told us to move away from the
windows. Then, a muffled explosion. Back to work.
</P>
<P>
   Someone had forgotten a bag in the building's fabulous
courtyard. Authorities did not wait long before they blew it up.
</P>
<P>
   That was the closest, fortunately, I would come to terrorism in
my brief career as an American diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   Although nothing approaching the tragedies in Africa last week,
there are, even in Paris, constant reminders that the diplomatic
life could turn swiftly and grotesquely violent.
</P>
<P>
   Paris in 1986 also was the scene of a wave of terrorist
bombings, some linked to Middle Eastern groups, some the work of
native radicals. Americans were thought to be at risk.
</P>
<P>
   There was the threat of retaliation after U.S. warplanes bombed
Libya in April in retaliation for an earlier terrorist attack. Two
years earlier, a Lebanese man tried to kill the top American
official in Strasbourg, France. By 1986, he was also awaiting trial
in the murders of another American and an Israeli diplomat. In
September alone, 11 people died in bombings in the French capital.
</P>
<P>
   In our training sessions in Washington, we received the basics
about security: Vary your comings and goings. Take a good look at
the street when you leave your residence in the morning. We heard a
couple of lectures and watched a film about becoming hostages, but
it all seemed so unreal.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, we put ordinary license plates on our cars, forgoing
the special diplomatic plates because it didn't seem wise to hang a
bull's-eye on your back and front.
</P>
<P>
   But because we were in a European capital, we didn't stand out
as much as we might elsewhere. Apart from the ambassador and a
couple of others, we moved around freely and without guards.
</P>
<P>
   We certainly didn't have to travel to work in armored vans, as
American diplomats in South America routinely do.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy and the French authorities took precautions as best
as they could, it seemed to this inexperienced eye, without locking
the gates of the magnificent embassy building on the Place de la
Concorde or the doors of the nearby Hotel Talleyrand.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people seeking visas, and American tourists looking
for help came through the consulate courtyard each day.
</P>
<P>
   They moved past the French police who carried semi-automatic
weapons at the ready, past the metal detector and French guards who
searched handbags. If they wanted access to Americans in the
building, they had to pass through another security stop, this one
manned by Marines. If they merely wanted a visa, they walked into a
large waiting room and sooner or later (usually later), an American
summoned them to a thick, bullet-proofed window.
</P>
<P>
   Security at the embassy itself was, if anything, tighter since
it is not open to the general public in the same way as the
consulate.
</P>
<P>
   Packages and people got a thorough going-over. Only in hindsight
do some of the episodes seem comical. One Saturday before Christmas
a man dropped off what he said was a tin of cookies for the
ambassador's wife, then quickly disappeared into the crowds on the
street. A Marine called my friend, serving as the embassy duty
officer that weekend.
</P>
<P>
   As my friend told it, he asked the Marine to open the package to
make sure it was baked goods. The polite, but firm, reply made
clear that if anyone was going to open the tin, it would be my
friend.

 UNDATED: in trucks.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the game, the real-world product, they are made of software
and can be transmitted digitally. The action figure is basically a
name and a bit of stored information. Dueling code.
</P>
<P>
   In the second Small Soldiers game, Squad Commander, the action
figure is a tactical resource. As in real-time strategy games like
Command and Conquer, or Warcraft, which are geared toward adults,
Squad Commander is about deploying your troops in a series of
missions to neutralize the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the grown-up games, this one is less about amassing
wealth and building fortresses than it is about obstacles and
puzzles. The deductive reasoning required is equally sharp, if not
sharper. But the terrain is considerably more whimsical.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, if you play on the Gorgonites' side (you can play
either of the film's two opposing factions, the Gorgonites or the
Commando Elite), there is a scenario in a convenience store. The
objective is to free a kidnapped comrade, who has been locked in
the back room safe.
</P>
<P>
   To accomplish that, you have to navigate a maze of spilled
candy, work your way over to the Slurpee machine, climb that and
blow up a TNT barrel. That will knock over some cups, forming a
bridge to the nacho area. Run your troops one by one across the
nacho counter with perfect timing to avoid the intermittent, deadly
bursts of scalding nacho cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Find the cash register, figure out how to open it, grab the key,
unlock the back room and fight your way back to the safe, then
unlock it with a combination that you saw flashing on the lotto
machine. The entire time, you are under fire by heavily armed
plastic soldiers. It makes Command and Conquer look like a parade
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Toy Story,'' the landscape of Squad Commander is littered
with references to name-brand games. Here, virtual toys become
elements of the game. In one instance, you have to hit the right
combination of lights on a Simon machine to get a door to open. A
deadly field of zooming remote-controlled cars in an electronics
store refers to Frogger.
</P>
<P>
   There's a system of secret passageways, a la Clue, a chess board
and a puzzle game that looks a lot like Perfection. And of course,
there are sly product placements throughout. If you scrutinize the
toy shelves in the background, you will see boxes of Potato Head
and Candyland, both made by Hasbro Interactive's parent company,
Hasbro Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Squad Commander is a game about toys. And it points to the
distinction between a game and a toy. Games have rules, objectives,
winners and losers. Toys have none of these things. Toys are
objects, physical or virtual. A toy is a noun. Games are verbs.
That's why games are easier to translate into interactive media _
the pieces you push around are just place holders. Action is
everything.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Globotech Design Lab and Squad Commander are more
entertaining than Barbie Fashion Designer. Barbie Fashion Designer
is a virtual doll. It's a toy. And as a toy, it doesn't measure up
to its plastic counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   The Small Soldiers CD-ROMs are not toys. They're games. And as
games, they rival anything you can do with a G.I. Joe. These
characters truly are action figures.
</P>
<P>
   There is a certain poetic justice in the fact that Small
Soldiers' publisher is the same company that manufactured the
original G.I. Joe doll on the heels of Mattel's success with
Barbie. Toy history repeats itself _ first as plastic merchandise,
then as licensed interactive media.

   NOTE: Martha Stewart, as every American knows, is a living
brand. In fact, with a 2.3 million-circulation magazine and
syndicated column bearing her name, a river of books and a stream
of television shows, Martha Stewart is a force of nature, the most
influential person alive in terms of giving shape to our living
spaces. She certainly has a knack for articulating our habitat
dreams. And she is way into materials _ premium, well-crafted stuff
such as flower-crystallizing kits. But what about liquid-crystal
displays? Any plans to expand from bedsheets to spreadsheets? I
caught up with the lifestyle queen on her car phone as she
navigated the streets of New York en route to a dinner party.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KEVIN KELLY: Why are tech-minded people so interested in your
ideas?
</P>
<P>
   MARTHA STEWART: It is the technological age, but it is still an
age of people wanting to know how things are done. My readers think
in a modern fashion about old-fashioned values.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you of the school that says flaunt your computer
equipment, or hide it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh, absolutely put it out in the open. Or hide it in the most
effective way possible. My office at home is an office in a closet.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So you hide it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, no, it is always out, except when I am having a dinner
party _ then I roll the shelves back in and close the door without
disturbing anything. I want real practicality and real simplicity.
So, invisible, appropriate, and simple, simple, simple.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the appropriate color to go with computer beige?
</P>
<P>
   A: Why are you thinking only of beige? I have a beautiful new
black computer with all black components. And 1 have a very
beautiful new silver one. I think computers certainly could be more
appealing aesthetically and fit into rooms nicer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Any thoughts on smart houses?
</P>
<P>
   A: I am restoring a house now that was a 1962 Bunshaft modern.
I've gutted it and am now installing silence.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Silence? How do you install silence?
</P>
<P>
   A: I want to have a silent environment where you don't hear
furnaces, you don't hear refrigerators, you don't hear dishwashers.
I am working very closely with all the different companies trying
to get them to enter the 21st century with a sense of adventure and
silence. It is a very difficult directive.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Besides silence, what else are you after? How about having
your refrigerator talk to your stereo?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't want my refrigerator talking to me period. I don't
want it telling me that I am low on meatballs. I do have a brain.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do the same design principles you use in your other projects
also apply online?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. People respond to a pretty Web site, and they respond to
a simple Web site. I don't want talking parrots. I want it to be a
gentle, soothing kind of place _ functionality has to be good, but
it doesn't have to be invasive.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you find the Web sympathetic to that kind of soothing?
</P>
<P>
   A: I want to get across as much information as possible in as
short a period of time. I want it to be straightforward _ I don't
want to open drawers or doors. I hated ``Myst.'' It was so queer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So you'd find no use for a virtual walk through a house?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, it isn't that. I do have plans for being able to wander
around a home. But I want to do it in a simple, very beautiful way
and a real way, not distorted. You could click on something in a
closet and be told what it was and where to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about e-mail?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh, I have a server in my basement. I am really connected,
but I find the software to be abominably inadequate. I complain
about it a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you find yourself surfing the Net much?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't have a lot of time to sit and just sort of fool
around. When I get home at 11 p.m., which is normal, I go to my
computer to read mail, then answer as much as I have the energy to.
I'll usually get my answers in the morning before I go to work,
because I have a lot of friends and business associates on the West
Coast and in London.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Yet your magazine doesn't give the impression that you are so
techie _ you don't see computers on the table in your photos. Why
this disconnect?
</P>
<P>
   A: It is a little bit sparse, I must admit. But they are there
if you really look. Besides, there is still a big gap between the
35 percent of the public who have computers and the 65 percent who
don't. When that fault is fixed, I think you will see a lot more in
the way of female users and older people. And yet our readers know
that we are technically savvy. More than 50 percent of our
correspondence is reaching us by e-mail now, about 130,000 pieces
of e-mail correspondence a year. Which is very easy to respond to
and very pleasant to receive.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The question of the season: Microsoft monopoly _ thumbs up or
thumbs down?
</P>
<P>
   A: Listen _ if anybody who wants to be an explorer or a pioneer
has to go through what Microsoft is going through, I feel really
bad about it. Man wouldn't have gotten to the Moon, or invented the
telephone, if there had been a check at every step of the way. I
don't believe in this action at all.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Management guru Tom Peters preaches the ``brand of you'' _ if
there is anyone this applies to, it's you. What happens if you get
hit by a bus? Does the brand of you continue?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm trying to make sure that my brand extension is broad
enough that if anything happens, or I decide to check out, it can
continue. We have taken the next five years of photographs of me
already, so if anything happened to me we have those closets full
of photos.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You could have yourself scanned to create a virtual
character.
</P>
<P>
   A: Cloning hasn't worked yet, but I'll be the first. The first
human Dolly will be me.

   NOTE: Martha Stewart, as every American knows, is a living
brand. In fact, with a 2.3 million-circulation magazine and
syndicated column bearing her name, a river of books and a stream
of television shows, Martha Stewart is a force of nature, the most
influential person alive in terms of giving shape to our living
spaces. She certainly has a knack for articulating our habitat
dreams. And she is way into materials _ premium, well-crafted stuff
such as flower-crystallizing kits. But what about liquid-crystal
displays? Any plans to expand from bedsheets to spreadsheets? I
caught up with the lifestyle queen on her car phone as she
navigated the streets of New York en route to a dinner party.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KEVIN KELLY: Why are tech-minded people so interested in your
ideas?
</P>
<P>
   MARTHA STEWART: It is the technological age, but it is still an
age of people wanting to know how things are done. My readers think
in a modern fashion about old-fashioned values.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you of the school that says flaunt your computer
equipment, or hide it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh, absolutely put it out in the open. Or hide it in the most
effective way possible. My office at home is an office in a closet.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So you hide it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, no, it is always out, except when I am having a dinner
party _ then I roll the shelves back in and close the door without
disturbing anything. I want real practicality and real simplicity.
So, invisible, appropriate, and simple, simple, simple.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the appropriate color to go with computer beige?
</P>
<P>
   A: Why are you thinking only of beige? I have a beautiful new
black computer with all black components. And 1 have a very
beautiful new silver one. I think computers certainly could be more
appealing aesthetically and fit into rooms nicer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Any thoughts on smart houses?
</P>
<P>
   A: I am restoring a house now that was a 1962 Bunshaft modern.
I've gutted it and am now installing silence.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Silence? How do you install silence?
</P>
<P>
   A: I want to have a silent environment where you don't hear
furnaces, you don't hear refrigerators, you don't hear dishwashers.
I am working very closely with all the different companies trying
to get them to enter the 21st century with a sense of adventure and
silence. It is a very difficult directive.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Besides silence, what else are you after? How about having
your refrigerator talk to your stereo?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't want my refrigerator talking to me period. I don't
want it telling me that I am low on meatballs. I do have a brain.
</P>

also apply online?

it doesn't have to be invasive.

BOMBINGS ARE A SAD REMINDER THAT PEACE IS ELUSIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA FRAZIER ANDERSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The horror I felt upon reading about the deadly terrorist
bombings that took place in Kenya and Tanzania last week is
indescribable.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday morning, I opened my newspaper to a gruesome photo
depicting an eerie collage of bodies, buildings and blood. Tears of
sorrow hindered my efforts to read the eyewitness account of the
fatal blasts.
</P>
<P>
   As of this moment, the world is not sure who is responsible or
why the perpetrators thought that this act of evil would resolve
their turmoil. During troublesome moments like these, I withdraw to
a place deep inside myself and ponder the unknown variables of
life.
</P>
<P>
   This time, in a flight of pure fancy, I climbed aboard an
imaginary aircraft and set out in search of Peace. Perhaps if I
could find Peace, I could persuade it to settle down and dwell
among us for more than a fortnight. Surely, that photo alone, those
mangled torsos, the silent screams, would persuade Peace to settle
in.
</P>
<P>
   We left New York and cruised low over the choppy waters of the
Atlantic until we arrived at our first stop, historic Northern
Ireland. I saw Protestants, Catholics and fresh graves, but Peace
was nowhere to be found.
</P>
<P>
   So we jetted over France, passed Italy, and crossed the Adriatic
Sea before we landed again, this time in the former Yugoslavia.
Bullet casings littered the streets filled with hundreds of
thousands of homeless civilians. There were reports of a Serbian
crackdown on Albanian separatists, but there was no talk of Peace.
</P>
<P>
   Still hopeful, our optimistic pilot cruised south past the
fighting in Turkey and Syria to the country of Iraq. We asked the
United Nations arms inspectors if they had found Peace hiding out
somewhere during their searches. ``No,'' they said. ``If Peace had
been here, the sanctions wouldn't have been necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Distressed, we refueled and looked eastward. We flew over Iran
to Afghanistan, which looked hopeful from a distance. Up close,
however, we discovered that years of civil war had brought too much
sorrow for Peace to remain in that place.
</P>
<P>
   Farther we traveled, to China, then Russia. We tasted salty
tears in the Pechora River. I smelled poverty and heard politics
but, alas, again, no Peace.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Pacific Ocean in record time, we landed in a
drug-infested area of South America where artificial Peace grew
tall in a field of dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's go to Mexico,'' I said to the pilot. ``If we don't find
Peace there, take me home.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorful villas and beautiful beaches welcomed me to Mexico.
Surely, Peace is here, I thought. However, when I ventured away
from the resorts and the lavish lifestyles of the upper class, I
found many desperate, impoverished people clamoring for a ride back
to the States with me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace is in America,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   Peace is in America! I have gone all over the world looking for
Peace, and I could have found it right at home.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, we rushed to the West Coast _ no Peace; over to the
East Coast _ no Peace; along the Bible Belt, where the hate groups
chased me away _ no Peace.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, alone in my room, I hung my head in defeat. Then, a
small voice whispered to me, ``Here I am. I'm the one you're
looking for. I am Peace. I was with you all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace is not an object that you can find. Peace is an ideal
that you must create. When there is peace inside of all of you,
there will be peace outside of all of you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace,'' I said. ``That's too much for even me to imagine.''

   HOLLY SPRINGS, Miss. _ I guess I know more about Elvis than
Elvis knew about himself,'' said Paul MacLeod, who over the last
few years has turned the antebellum house he inherited here into
Graceland Too, a shrine run by the self-described ``universe's, the
galaxy's, the planet's, the world's No. 1 Elvis fan.'' Given the
King's conviction that the unexamined life was indeed very much
worth living, this may not be hard to claim. But MacLeod, who went
to 126 Elvis concerts, certainly knows a lot about him, as does his
son Elvis Aron Presley MacLeod. Touring Graceland Too, $5
admission, I heard it in a stream of numbers and slogans.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers like 42, the age at which Elvis and, to hear MacLeod
tell it, an amazing number of other people died. Or 140 million,
the number of Elvis stamps that were issued; many now cover the
kitchen ceiling. Or 197,000, the number of square inches of carpet
that once covered the floor of the Jungle Room at the ``other''
Graceland. MacLeod purchased the carpet _ ``the rubber backing,
too'' _ when it was replaced. Portions of the carpet, cut into
one-foot squares, are mounted in gilded frames that hang throughout
the house. Or ``busloads,'' the number of visitors he expects this
week, the anniversary of the King's death.
</P>
<P>
   But as much as a shrine to the singer, it's a shrine to the
MacLeods, as the Medici chapel glorifies the Medici family as much
as the deity. Graceland Too has ``made their lives complete,'' the
MacLeods say.
</P>
<P>
   I found the house with its twin chimneys in a quiet neighborhood
of this quiet town about an hour's drive south of Memphis, where
Elvis died, and about the same distance north of Tupelo, Miss.,
where he was born, in a now white-washed shotgun house. MacLeod
sets great store by this geographical symmetry. In a window above
the front door hung what appeared to be a beach towel of the late,
Vegas-era Elvis. The sign said to come right in, but a knock
brought no response. The back door was ajar, and I stepped into a
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Then I caught sight of MacLeod _ Elvis hairdo, rapid-fire
speech, holding a cordless phone. He showed us some highlights of a
collection estimated, he said, to be worth more than $10 million:
rare records, clothing, one of Elvis' school report cards. He took
us to the photo room, lined with snapshots of visitors, and we
posed for his flash. I noted that in each of those photos you could
see the photos on the wall behind and in those photos were photos
on the wall and so on. He also pointed out the gold suit, identical
to one on an Elvis album cover, in which he plans to be buried.
</P>
<P>
   Graceland Too does not attempt to duplicate the ``other''
Graceland. For one thing, it's far older, 144 years old, and not a
20th-century replica of an antebellum mansion. For another, it's
not surrounded by the used-car dealerships and fast-food joints of
Elvis Presley Boulevard, but by a sleepy neighborhood of modest
1840s houses with low porches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where Elvis never sleeps'' is one of the MacLeod slogans _ and
the MacLeods rarely do either. They take turns monitoring the media
for all references to Elvis, recording them on one of a dozen VCRs
and logging in hundreds of books every time a deejay plays a
record, every time he shows up in a movie. Against one wall,
footlockers containing tapes are stacked high. Media logs bearing a
complex system of letters and numbers on their spines line the
room, documenting millions of references ``from the obvious to the
minuscule,'' as MacLeod puts it. He can tell you, say, ``that on
6:30 p.m., Dec. 23, 1995, a poster of Elvis appeared in the back of
the set of the TV show ``Entertainment Tonight.'' The result is a
level of domestic deshabille that struck close to home for me _ and
my own media-monitoring decor, my stacks of magazines, tapes and
notebooks.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite a home, not quite a museum, Graceland Too may be more
like all our houses than it would seem. Its decor is only a larger,
more obsessive version of any number of shrines to athletes or rock
stars in teen-agers' rooms, of bulletin boards devoted to Derek
Jeter or dresser tops to Princess Diana. But it's also like a
grandiose enlargement of the sports fan's den, with his Dallas
Cowboys satellite TV package and ESPN. It's a monitoring station, a
media equivalent of a radar post on the Distant Early Warning Line,
or mission control Houston, tracking the trajectory of the Elvis
legend.
</P>
<P>
   MacLeod has another probably inevitable slogan: ``Elvis will
never leave this building.'' But I was plenty happy to leave.

SOMETHING OLD IS NEW AGAIN FOR GREAT-GRANDDAUGHTER'S WEDDING DAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARK LOWRY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Even in a time when wearing hand-me-downs is
trendy, the item of clothing that Jeniffer Todd received from her
great-grandmother is extra-special.
</P>
<P>
   It's a wedding dress made for Loretta Pavero in 1932, when she
married in upstate New York at age 15. Pavero's granddaughter,
Darlene Todd, wore it for her ``simple backyard wedding.'' And on
Aug. 8, Pavero's great-granddaughter Jeniffer wore it in a larger
wedding at Genesis United Methodist Church in southwest Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Pavero's daughter, Joyce Anthony, opted not to wear the dress
because her wedding happened too quickly. She was also too tall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wore the dress because we didn't know if she'd ever get to
see someone else in it,'' Darlene said. ``Now she gets to see her
great-granddaughter as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeniffer, 23, has wanted to wear the dress since she was a
little girl. ``I saw the picture, and she looked absolutely
gorgeous. I knew then.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just lucky enough to have the same build.''
</P>
<P>
   Simple and straight-lined, the dress remains almost entirely in
its original state. The lace, imported from Italy, is a little
brown around the seams. The satin trim and slip are in mint
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and there's the stain on the front from the stuffed
mushrooms that Darlene ate at her reception. (Jeniffer also had
stuffed mushrooms at her reception.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't stored under proper conditions,'' Darlene said. ``We
found it in a cedar chest in (Pavero's) house. No cleaner would
touch the dress. They didn't want to take the risk.'' One cleaner
wanted $75 for the insurance alone.
</P>
<P>
   When Darlene resurrected it for her wedding, it had a small hole
in the front, which she quickly repaired by sewing lace from the
train in its place.
</P>
<P>
   For Jeniffer's wedding, Darlene revived the veil, which hadn't
been worn since 1932. About 10 feet long, it was reconstructed with
new netting and the original lace around the edges. Darlene spent
10 hours getting the dress ready for her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   After 15 months of planning, the Big Day came. Unnerved,
Jeniffer sat in the dressing room with her bridesmaids and maid of
honor, who wore purple floral dresses in the same style the
bridesmaids wore at her great-grandmother's wedding. About 15
minutes before the wedding, Pavero and her daughter arrived and
were taken to see Jeniffer.
</P>
<P>
   Pavero, 81, has trouble speaking, but she brightened up when she
saw her great-granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you remember looking like that?'' Darlene asked.
</P>
<P>
   Softly touching the dress, a glimmer of nostalgia in her eye,
all Pavero could manage was a drawn-out, ``Nice.''
</P>
<P>
   But she didn't have to say even that much. Her smile did all the
talking.

A FILM FESTIVAL'S HOMETOWN FEEL
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What do Toronto, Telluride and Tinseltown have in
common?
</P>
<P>
   Each has a film festival, though it might come as a surprise
that Tinseltown's is the baby of the bunch. The 2-year-old
Hollywood Film Festival closed its showcase of fresh filmmakers,
new productions and tributes to industry icons at an awards gala
Monday night at the Beverly Hilton Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   And the winners were:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sugar Factory,'' written and directed by Australian
filmmaker Robert Carter, and director Nick Pearcy's ``Paradise
Falls'' took home the honors for best features over $1 million and
under $1 million, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Penelope Ann Miller, who plays a sister caring for her widowed
brother's family in ``Rhapsody in Bloom,'' earned a special jury
award for best acting in a feature. ``Rhapsody'' was directed by
Craig Saavedra and written by Eric Tuchman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goreville U.S.A.'' was named best documentary, with ``Holiday
Romance'' by English filmmaker JJ Keith chosen best short film, and
director Steven Ayromlooi's ``Return of the Sun Devil'' best
animated film. The 24-year-old Ayromlooi also was chosen best young
filmmaker for his short ``Nathan Grimm.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hollywood Independent Filmmaker Award was presented to
director-writer L. Alan Fraser for ``Next Time.'' Special-effects
duo Rob Legato and Crystal Dowd received a Hollywood Digital Award
for ``Titanic,'' while Entertainment Tonight Online was named best
entertainment Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Academy Award-winning actress Shelley Winters accepted a
Lifetime Achievement Award, saying, ``It's about time Hollywood
started to pay less attention to special effects and violence, and
more attention to human beings and relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Zanuck and David Brown each received awards for
outstanding achievement by motion-picture producers. Brown returned
the pat on the back, saying ``It's about time Hollywood would
produce its own major film festival.''
</P>
<P>
   Honorary awards also went to director Norman Jewison and
award-winning film composers Dave Grusin and Stewart Copeland.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For nearly two years, my friend Nancy Bendit has blamed me for
persuading her to buy a Macintosh Performa. Her complaints fall
into three categories:
</P>
<P>
   1. There is not enough cool software to run on the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   2. Not enough software.
</P>
<P>
   3. Software! Software! Where is the software?
</P>
<P>
   Whenever Ms. Bendit brings this up _ to be fair, no more than
three or four times a day _ I flash back to my own very different
experience with my first Macintosh.
</P>
<P>
   On Christmas Day 1992, stuck in a motel near the Phoenix
airport, I passed the grim time playing a game called Glider on my
brand-new Powerbook 160.
</P>
<P>
   Deceptively simple, Glider required the player to pilot a paper
airplane through a house, avoiding such dangers as electric fans
and burning candles. In some rooms, you had to figure out how to
turn on a light switch; in the kitchen, you had to avoid the
certain death of a sizzling toaster.
</P>
<P>
   Glider embodied all the charms of the first-generation
Powerbook: Quirky and adorable, it sneaked up and hooked you on its
elegant simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   What Ms. Bendit needed, I reasoned, was to find a program like
Glider, one that would allow her to undergo a similar communion
with her Macintosh machine. Would that be possible, given the
ferociously anti-Mac climate of software development today? I went
in search of more recent Mac programs whose lure might be powerful
enough to invoke such an epiphany.
</P>
<P>
   Online stores were the obvious place to start. While retail
stores have become notoriously parsimonious about allocating shelf
space to Mac ware, big shareware archives like those at Tucows
(www.tucows.com) and at ZD Net (www.macdownload.com) do not suffer
from space constraints.
</P>
<P>
   Preston Gralla, the editor of ZD Net's software library,
acknowledged that ``the amount of Macintosh shareware has been
dwindling,'' but the site still has more than 5,000 titles. I asked
ZD Net's resident Macintosh expert, Richard Curtis, about his
favorite programs, and then downloaded and tested three on my old
Power Macintosh 7100/66.
</P>
<P>
   One program that stood out was Spell Tools 1.2.1, which creates
a floating window on screen. Click on the window to check spelling
in any application on your computer. If you highlight text, Spell
Tools will read it out loud in a tone that sounds vaguely like
Marlon Brando in ``The Godfather.''
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: an enjoyable tool, certainly, but not enough to
alter anyone's world view. I needed something quirkier.
</P>
<P>
   I visited two smaller shareware sites maintained by die-hard
Macintosh boosters, www.macupdate.com and www.ualberta.ca/mmalowan.
I downloaded Debt Wizard to analyze and find suggestions for
eliminating pesky credit-card debt, a 401(k) planner only too happy
to predict retirement income based on wild guesses about future
returns on investments, and My Precious Baby, for recording
milestones like the first tooth.
</P>
<P>
   But these programs were teases. Until a user paid a registration
fee, the programs were hobbled. A window shopper could sample only
a portion of their features. Disregarding the shareware tradition
of allowing users to fully test software free seemed to me to be a
very non-Mac attitude.
</P>
<P>
   On www.trickfx.demon.co.uk, I did find a very quirky freeware
program called Ivolution. A snapshot of an abstract image appears
on screen and then automatically mutates in five ways. Each
mutation includes different colors and patterns. Click on one, and
it will evolve in five more directions. This cycle continues for as
long as your attention span holds.
</P>
<P>
   I applauded the purely useless but amusing nature of Ivolution.
But in the end, it wasn't enough. Perhaps the only kind of program
that would have truly transformative properties would be a really
good game.
</P>
<P>
   Even in this Wintel-centric world, there remain a few software
companies known for their Macintosh games. Freeverse Software, at
www.freeverse.com, sells bizarrely offbeat versions of such
standard card games as hearts and solitaire. But although I have
spent hundreds of hours playing Hearts Deluxe over the years, I
didn't think the concept was original enough to qualify as Ms.
Bendit's software Rosebud.
</P>
<P>
   Ambrosia Software, at www.ambrosiasw.com, sells arcade-style
games guaranteed to provoke nostalgia in anyone who ever pumped
quarters into a Galaga machine. But after I downloaded and became
addicted to two of Ambrosia's longtime best sellers, Swoop (think
of Space Invaders) and Bubble Trouble (Pac-Man), my only question
was: Where is the new stuff?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have five we're working on,'' the company's spokesman,
Jason Whong, assured me in a phone interview. ``We have a
role-playing game called Cythera that's going to be a lot of fun.
And we've got Smithereens, where you're a snake and you have to eat
other snakes and you can eat eggs and other stuff, too.''
</P>
<P>
   That game sounded as if it could be just what I was looking for
_ a product that melded Ambrosia's high-quality programming with a
totally weird premise. When would it be available?
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope they both will be out in 1998,'' Whong said. ``But
then, Cythera was announced by the company back when I was still a
junior in college, so ....''
</P>
<P>
   As a last resort, I found the creator of Glider, John Calhoun.
In an e-mail message, I asked Calhoun, who is now a programmer at
Apple Computer, if he had written any other Mac games that I could
offer to Ms. Bendit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scads,'' he wrote back. ``Most of it was not very interesting.
But there you are _ Glider looks dated to me now, too. I think
games are really for the moment, like bad sitcoms you grew up
watching as a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Dated or not, at least Glider is still available, distributed by
Casady &AMP; Greene (www.casadyg.com). A new CD-ROM version for the Mac
costs $34.95, plus shipping and handling. I will order it for Ms.
Bendit. Will it be enough to keep her from replacing her Performa
with a Windows machine?

YOUNGER GOLFING CROWD EMBRACES ELEGANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Swingers are getting younger and younger, so it's
par for the course that golf fashion would take a new stance.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas golf was once jokingly referred to as an old man's
sport, the National Golf Foundation has noted that since 1996 the
tables have turned. There are now more players under 29, than over
50, according to the NGF's latest report, which shows there are 8
million players between the ages of 12 and 29.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these young players have become stylemakers, including
dapper Phil Mickelson, sporty Tiger Woods (Nike has already named a
collection after him), and the buffed Se Ri Pak, the 20-year-old
who is the youngest winner of the U.S. Women's Open. And none are
wearing their father's loud plaid pants or their mother's
seersucker culottes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the new generation of fashion-savvy golfers are TV stars
T.C. Warner, who won the 1997 Soap Opera Digest's Best Young
Actress Award for her role as a troubled teen on ``All My
Children''; and Robert Ri'Chard, who has a Daytime Emmy Award for
his role in Showtime's ``In His Father's Shoes'' and a new comedy
series on Nickelodeon called ``Cousin Skeeter.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Warner, ``Golf is not a dork's game anymore. Thanks
to players like Tiger and Se Ri, it's cool.''
</P>
<P>
   On a more serious note, the recent graduate of California State
University, Northridge, observed, ``I think young people stayed
away from golf in the past, not only because of the clothes, but
because it was too slow. They didn't think of it as a game of
concentration, which it certainly is.''
</P>
<P>
   While Warner admits she quickly learned the sport because of a
boyfriend, Ri'Chard says it was golf star Tiger Woods who inspired
him to learn the game from his neighbor Bill Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger is phenomenal. He made the game look attractive to me
... he's a young African-American male who I can look up to,''
Ri'Chard explained.
</P>
<P>
   And the clothes help, too.
</P>
<P>
   He says, ``I like the idea that you wear different clothes for
golfing than you would for just hanging out or playing basketball
with your friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner says, ``Where else can you look good, conduct business
and be surrounded by men?''
</P>
<P>
   Now, about those link looks.
</P>
<P>
   While they took a break from their respective shows, and played
a game of miniature golf (it's also in again) at Nickelodeon's
Animation Studio in Burbank, the pair tried on some of the game's
newest fashions by designers who are looking to Old Hollywood
(think Cary Grant and Grace Kelly) for inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Among the mainstream fashion designers now offering golf
collections are Ralph Lauren (favored by Justin Leonard and Davis
Love), Bugle Boy (worn by Paul Stankowski), Tommy Hilfiger,
Nautica, Brioni, Hugo Boss. Even Italian superstars Armani and
Ferragamo have fall collections at department stores that include
cuffed cotton khaki pants, quiet checks on wool trousers,
soft-collared shirts with Missoni-like weaves, argyle sweaters and
vests, checked jackets that can pass as sport coats for him, and
tailored dress slacks or wool plaid skirts topped with cashmere
twin sets for her. And they're all elegant enough to go from the
office to the golf course and stay for dinner at the country club.
</P>
<P>
   Although today's golfers say the look is new to them, any
fashion maven will tell you it's right out of the '50s, when one
might have teed off on a Valley course with the likes of Bing
Crosby or Bob Hope.
</P>
<P>
   Even the shoes these young swingers wear are retro. According to
Warner and Ri'Chard, the must-have shoe is Nike's brown-and-white
saddle oxford. The shoe style is made by a number of manufacturers
with traditional metal spikes or the newer plastic spikes that are
considered kinder to courses and easier for beginning golfers.
</P>
<P>
   But like other types of fashion, golf fashion is fickle. It's
not always a dressy sport, says Ri'Chard, who usually prefers
Docker khakis with a geometric print knit shirt by Nautica or Tommy
Hilfiger. And Warner agrees, adding that she often wears white
linen ensembles.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like model Cindy Crawford and David Spade of TV's ``Just
Shoot Me,'' are buying alternative golf fashions at Golf Punk, the
hip hangout on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles. According to store
manager Brian Shine Abell, ``Our clothes put the fun back in golf,
with bucket hats (sort of like fishermen's hats) in pastel yellow
and blue, baby tees with Golf Punk logos that feature butterflies,
and action sports-inspired shorts and shirts featuring themes like
Hole in One, and GPA (instead of PGA).''
</P>
<P>
   However hip, clothes that bare midriffs or too much thigh may
not be accepted at some golf courses, says Troy Rodvold, the head
professional and instructor at Family Golf Center in Encino. At
this local, city-managed course, Rodvold says there is a very
relaxed dress code, but the funny thing is that few follow it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the older players who wear the loud, informal clothes,
while younger players, especially women, are wearing professional,
tailored looks like you'd see at the office,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To keep your eye on what's hot on the golf course, look at
fashion magazines as well as golf publications. And also watch what
rookie swingers are wearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really the players who start the trends,'' observes Craig
Davies, manager of the Roger Dunn Golf shop in Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   Says Davies: ``When Tiger Woods was hot, so was Nike. But who
knows who and what brands are coming up next.''

BACK TO THE OLD NEIGHBORHOOD

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Luke Perry insists that his ``Beverly Hills,
90210'' character does not have an evil twin.
</P>
<P>
   So the actor's return to the series that made him a matinee idol
can mean only one thing: The Hills will be chillin' with Dylan
again.
</P>
<P>
   Perry signed an overall deal with Fox that will bring the often
brooding Dylan McKay back to the series, allow him to develop his
own show and lead to television and theatrical movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was as surprised as everybody else, let me tell you,'' Perry
joked about his return to the show. ``I was pretty clear never to
say never. (Fox entertainment president) Peter Roth extended
himself in a major way here. He showed me loyalty and that's all I
ever wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry, who left ``90210'' in 1995 to pursue a feature-film
career, didn't exactly blow up into the next Tom Hanks, but he
didn't bomb like David Caruso, either. Perry was in pictures such
as ``The Fifth Element,'' ``Normal Life,'' just finished filming
``Florentine,'' and is working on ``Storm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best thing for me,'' Perry said about his return
to the ZIP code.
</P>
<P>
   Executive producer Aaron Spelling apparently has not given Perry
much information on the circumstances surrounding Dylan's return.
</P>
<P>
   When we last saw McKay, the show's moral center, he was driving
away from his bungalow in England with a cat on board after his new
bride (played by Noxzema girl Rebecca Gayheart) was murdered.
</P>
<P>
   In Perry's estimation, McKay didn't stay long in England (``with
Amsterdam that close?'') and he traded the cat off while in the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Perry would not divulge the terms of his deal other than to say,
``I'm still gonna call Anthony Edwards and ask to borrow some
money. It ain't all about the money, bro.''
</P>
<P>
   ``90210'' will need Perry and the buzz surrounding his return to
hold off its direct competition at 8 p.m. Wednesdays, especially
``Dawson's Creek,'' the latest in teen dramas that is helping the
WB network build quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Priestley, the show's star, will leave the show early this
season before Perry's comeback and Shannen Doherty turned down a
spot on the show to start up a new Spelling drama, ``Charmed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been a day since I left that at least one person
has said to me, `When are you coming back'?'' Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   When he and Spelling started talking a few weeks ago, ``It was
music to my ears. He said, `Hey, pal, wanna saddle up again?' I
said, `Hey, boss, when do I start?' We have had our ups and downs,
both personally and professionally, but at the end of the day, he
is someone I have a lot of respect for.''

`FULL DRESS GRAY': BURROWING THROUGH DIRTY LAUNDRY AT WEST POINT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 Maureen Corrigan, who teaches literature at Georgetown University,
is the book critic for the National Public Radio program ``Fresh
Air.''  
 (bl)  
 By MAUREEN CORRIGAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps those beleaguered Modern Library judges would have come
in for less criticism if, say, instead of choosing the 100 best
English-language novels of the 20th century, they had aimed their
esthetic sights lower and assembled a list of the 100 best ``kinda
dumb but thoroughly engrossing'' English-language novels of the
same period.
</P>
<P>
   Few culture guardians would have roused themselves to attack
such a humble list, and the judges would certainly have had more
fun reading, or rereading, James Michener's ``Hawaii'' than they
did Thornton Wilder's ``Bridge of San Luis Rey,'' which was kinda
dumb and not at all engrossing.
</P>
<P>
   This happy-go-lucky list might well have included Lucian K.
Truscott IV's best-selling 1978 thriller, ``Dress Gray,'' along
with its just-published sequel, ``Full Dress Gray'' (ranking
somewhere in the paramilitary vicinity of Mickey Spillane's ``I,
the Jury'' and Herman Wouk's ``Winds of War'').
</P>
<P>
   Like its predecessor, which was praised for its insider's view
of West Point, ``Full Dress Gray'' takes readers deep into the
bowels of the military academy, paying special attention to the
dirty laundry room.
</P>
<P>
   The ambivalence with which Truscott, himself a West Point grad,
regards the place gives nuance both to the closed world of the
cadets he so vividly evokes and to his lively suspense story. But,
although he avoids sentimentality in his writing, Truscott wallows
in the other vices that even the greatest Victorian novelists
cultivated: melodrama, inflated language and coincidence,
coincidence, coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Full Dress Gray'' is a book whose cliffhanger chapters should
rightfully end with italicized phrases (and some do).
</P>
<P>
   In its most overheated moments, the novel resorts to the same
feudal diction that Paul Fussell in ``The Great War and Modern
Memory'' identified as emblematic of soldiers' writings during the
early, idealistic years of World War I. Truscott words and phrases
like ``foe,'' ``unvanquished,'' ``to lay down my life'' and
``cowardly'' are tossed around with, as one of Fussell's subjects
might say, nary a trace of remorse.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidence announces its flashy presence in the first chapter
of the novel. The new superintendent of West Point, Ry Slaight, is
reviewing the cadets on parade when a female cadet named Dorothy
Hamner keels over and dies. It turns out that her death, at first
ascribed to heat stroke, may be a case of homicide.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't you know it? Thirty years ago, when Slaight was a cadet
(and the rebellious hero of ``Dress Gray''), he investigated the
strange death of a fellow cadet who turned out to be the victim of
a homosexual cover-up. Now, Slaight is the ``supe,'' happily
married to that murdered gay cadet's sister, and, on his very first
day on the job, he's got another suspicious murder to investigate.
And, his daughter, Jacey, is a cadet at West Point and was Hamner's
company commander!
</P>
<P>
   To paraphrase A.E. Housman, a poet who struggled manfully to
free himself from those same Victorian literary excesses that
Truscott enthusiastically carries forward, ``this is stupid
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that coincidence as a literary device is always a bad
thing: the outlandish symmetries that undergird Dickens' novels,
for instance, don't so much close off his worlds as open them up to
life's marvelous possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   And, as David Lodge points out in his elegant 1992 study ``The
Art of Fiction,'' the ``audiences of comedy will accept an
improbable coincidence for the sake of the fun it generates.''
Truscott, though, is writing a thriller, not a comedy, and his
novel's overabundance of amazing-but-true occurrences jars with its
otherwise realistic atmosphere. (As for not measuring up to
Dickens, well, who does?)
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, ``Full Dress Gray'' is a novel whose stylistic
faults are cast into shadow by the grandeur of the brooding,
labyrinthine vision of the West Point it creates. Because Slaight
is a military man of action, wiped clean of any traces of subtlety,
he's constantly in motion. As he's mentally unraveling the
mysteries behind Hamner's death, he's surveying the mess hall,
striding past cliffside barracks or heading home to Quarters 100.
</P>
<P>
   With every step Slaight takes, the sense of place here
intensifies. Slaight's West Point is as hermetically sealed as a
medieval monastery, structured by sacred customs and its own arcane
hierarchy of ``plebes,'' ``yearlings'' and ``cows.'' It's an
institution where, as Slaight (melodramatically) puts it, ``the
world'' the cadets ``knew had only one color, gray.'' A place this
Gothic in atmosphere naturally attracts the minions of evil _ in
this case, a group of rogue cadets and officers hell-bent on
expelling undesirables from the academy.
</P>
<P>
   Slaight cannot deploy all his resources to rooting out these
apostates, for he's simultaneously fending off another threat to
West Point's integrity. Rep. Chuck Thrunstone, an old mastodon
serving on the House National Security Committee, has been lobbying
for a bill that would close down or consolidate all the service
academies.
</P>
<P>
   Thrunstone's ostensible reason for advocating this drastic
action is that the academies, and West Point in particular, have
been ``feminized'' by the changes made to accommodate female
students. In reality, the dastardly Thrunstone and his political
allies want to redirect the federal monies allotted to the military
academies into juicy weapons contracts with industries in their
home states. The scandalous circumstances around Dorothy Hamner's
death might just provide Thrunstone with the ammunition he needs to
take down West Point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cannon to the right'' and ``Cannon to the left'' and still
Straight, like the Light Brigade, thunders forward, determined to
save the academy from its internal and external enemies. Naturally,
both the corrupt cadets and the wicked Thrunstone begin waving
their sabers at Slaight's Achilles' heel: his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Jacey has been conducting her own investigations into Hamner's
homicide and, in a truly harrowing scene, she's kidnapped and
sexually assaulted while on guard duty. Jacey, however, is made of
the right stuff. She recovers to take her place behind her father
in time to witness sexism, pork-barrelism and homophobia defeated
by West Point's progressive best and brightest.
</P>
<P>
   In his address to the assembled cadets after their outlaw
comrades have been exposed, Slaight proclaims: ``I am merely a
temporary custodian, pushing a broom behind the Long Gray Line.
It's up to you cadets to keep West Point alive by making over your
lives in its image.''
</P>
<P>
   This living image of West Point as a place in tension _ where a
masculine warrior tradition is clashing with the invading
post-patriarchal hordes _ remains long after characteristically
hyperbolic speeches like this one fade from memory.

ON THE THIRD FLOOR AT HARRODS: ABC CARPET 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JULIE V. IOVINE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The intimate world of Oriental rug dealers is about
to get even cozier. As of Aug. 31, ABC Carpet &AMP; Home of Manhattan
is taking over the rug department at Harrods in London. This
late-blooming marriage between centenarian retail giants seems to
be far from impulsive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This signals that Europe wants to buy the American home
furnishings look,'' said Leslie Stroh, editor of Rug News, an
industry newsletter. ``Where the rugs are actually made doesn't
matter anymore; it's where they are designed and packaged.''
</P>
<P>
   This will be the American retailer's first venture beyond
familiar turf. ABC, a purveyor of carpets, furniture and
housewares, has been cautiously expanding from its anchor on lower
Broadway, opening stores in Delray Beach, Fla., in 1997 and
Westbury, N.Y., this year. And while the legendary Harrods seems
more packed with tourists than ever, its Persian rug department had
been losing luster because of the upheavals in Iran, where most of
its rugs came from, and the recent disintegration of a wholesale
supplier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have over 330 departments,'' said Peter Willasey, a Harrods
spokesman, ``And history dictates that with some specialties, it is
better to bring in an outside company rather than buying yourself.
ABC will offer a wider selection of Oriental rugs, carpets and
accessories to our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   The new department will be called ABC Carpet at Harrods. It will
comprise 8,000 square feet on the third floor, offering more than
20,000 handmade rugs. ``Harrods is the third-most-visited site in
London,'' said Jerome Weinrib, the chairman of ABC Carpet and Home.
``We're going to cover the world in carpets.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Oakley, a third-generation rug manufacturer in India,
said that in recent years consumer attitudes have changed, with
Oriental rugs now being perceived as precious collectibles rather
than cheap and ubiquitous goods. ``Harrods Oriental rug department
used to have a reputation second to none,'' Oakley said, ``but as
the years have gone by, the Orientals have looked rather boring and
ordinary. ABC coming into Harrods should create waves.''

Dyslexic children have a friend in Joe Griffith 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joe Griffith says he got through school by cramming and cheating
and feeling stupid. He figures he missed out on a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a good memory, and I came up with unbelievable ways to
cheat. We dyslexics are very creative,'' Griffith said.
</P>
<P>
   He recalls how angry he became at age 9 or 10 when his mother
gave him a copy of the book ``Black Beauty'' as a gift.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never read a complete book for pleasure. Reading was
drudgery. I had to read aloud to myself, and start over and read
the same thing 10 times before I could get through it. I crammed
for tests all night,'' Griffith said. ``Teachers passed me for
trying hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The learning disability went undiagnosed until 12 years ago.
Despite that, Griffith, 57, has worked as an actor and TV talk-show
host. He recalls co-hosting America's first business program
offering stock market advice on Channel 39.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day they asked me to read the noon news, and I was out of
a job,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith is still not a good reader.
</P>
<P>
   But he is a professional motivational speaker from Dallas, who
recently published his third book, ``How Dyslexic Benny Became a
Star'' (Yorktown Press, $12.95).
</P>
<P>
   A previous book, ``Speakers Library of Business Stories,''
published by Prentice-Hall, is in its seventh printing. The book is
dedicated to dyslexics.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a relief, to have one of the largest publishers in the
world publish your book when you can't read,'' Griffith said.
``That's when I came out of the closet and admitted I was dyslexic.
It's amazing how many people still don't admit it. I'll give a
talk, and people come up to me afterward and whisper that they too
are dyslexic.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffith said that dyslexia practically ruined his life _ all
those fears and insecurities _ but that he has been successful
despite all. That's the message he gives to children with dyslexia:
They can succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Since the book came out in January, he has been speaking at
schools, talking with children and explaining to teachers what
dyslexia is like.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teachers think they understand, and the kids know they don't,
so they don't trust the teachers,'' he said. ``Most school systems
today fail to recognize and help dyslexics. If you can catch it in
kindergarten or first grade, it doesn't have to be a problem, but
teachers aren't trained to recognize it.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 12 to 15 percent of the population has some degree
of dyslexia, an inability to process written material. Those who
are most severely affected are the most likely to get help. Those
with mild to moderate problems just start dragging slowly behind,
Griffith said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, they are twice as likely to become juvenile
delinquents, drug addicts and school dropouts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Griffith began working as a consultant to the Texas
Department of Corrections' program to deal with illiteracy in the
prison system. An estimated 80 percent of the people in Texas
prisons are illiterate, and Griffith said 60 to 70 percent of
illiterates are dyslexic.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith heads an organization known as CODE, or Concern Over
Dyslexic Education. CODE works with school systems to help them
comply with the federal Individuals With Learning Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   His book is available through most bookstores.

 By CHRISTIAN BERTHELSEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every morning, Doug Liu rises at 6 and checks on the Internet to
find out about the surf near his home in Northern California. About
three times a week, the news is good enough for a 25-minute trip to
the beach to catch a set of waves. The rest of the time, it saves
him a trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it shows there's no swell coming in, I'll just sleep in,''
said Liu, a system administrator for a technology company.
</P>
<P>
   The round-the-clock availability of information on the Internet
has spurred the success of Web sites that offer books, music, news
and the like. And it's also creating a demand for weather
information without the polish and marketing of weather forecasters
goofing off on local news shows.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of weather news appeals to Jimmy Bradley, 34, a
grocery stock clerk who participated in a recent discussion in a
weather chat room. (Of course there are chat rooms about the
weather.) Unlike the television broadcasts, Bradley said, Web
weather information has ``no opinions of meteorologists and talking
heads.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the Web was providing users with weather
information as soon as it was available, circumventing the wait for
a newscaster to make a radio or television announcement.
</P>
<P>
   In Bradley's home city, Mobile, Ala., where Hurricane Danny
dumped 43 inches of rain last year, time for storm preparation is
crucial.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he said, he got word of an approaching storm on line a
half-hour before he heard about it on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to do what I had to do outside to get ready for it,
stuff like getting the dog in and the boat tied down and the
computer shut down,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Most weather pages offer a national overview of weather,
articles on places where weather is making news, local forecasts
and more detailed information for those who need it. Many sites now
offer personalized weather pages, proving that like politics, all
weather is local.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites are more oriented toward consumers, offering pages
with easy-to-use graphics and an eye on what the average user
wants. With others, you are expected to understand weather data
without the help of lengthy explanations. Weather news is also
cropping up on general interest sites, like news services and start
pages.
</P>
<P>
   The number of hits on weather sites puts most popular sites and
Web portals to shame. The National Weather Service said its page
got one million visits a day. Disney.com, by way of contrast, said
its site got 600,000 visits a day. The Weather Channel said its
site got 87 million ``page views'' a month, which means about 20
million visitors, and about 300,000 surfers have opted for
customized pages.
</P>
<P>
   There are 250,000 personal subscribers to the Accuweather Web
site, though the company says some 25 million get their weather
from additional Accuweather displays on Snap, CNN Interactive and
The Wall Street Journal's online edition.
</P>
<P>
   The Web is going beyond traditional media by offering weather
information for users with specific needs _ for storm warnings,
crop reports and forecasts for travel destinations _ that cannot be
met by television.
</P>
<P>
   More serious weather-heads are using that information to do
their own forecasting. Their efforts can be met with mixed results:
amateurs can sometimes draw the wrong conclusions from the data.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, it's not all good,'' a user identified as
DisasterWX said in a chat room. ``Now a lot of people are doing
individual forecasting. Some know what they are doing, but many
don't.''
</P>
<P>
   The average weather hunter on the Web is most likely looking for
a temperature and conditions forecast, something to help determine
whether to carry an umbrella to the office. Here are a few Web
sites that offer that kind of information, plus some other places
to stop for additional features.
</P>
<P>
   If predictions and graphics aren't enough and you want to see
what the weather is like in a certain place, try weatherimages.org
or tvweather. com (soon to become weathercast. com). Both offer
``live'' images of weather cameras from around the globe, which are
actually still shots that are updated every so often. It's a nice
touch, though they tend toward the banal because the view usually
does not include twisters or hurricanes. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Best Part of Accuweather Site Is Its Forecasting Accuracy &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WWW.ACCUWEATHER.COM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This site, probably the most layman-oriented of the bunch, is
for people who want a thorough and easy-to-understand weather
report without a lot of frills.
</P>
<P>
   Accuweather.com offers an overview of regional, national and
world weather, graphics and maps of temperature and weather
patterns as well as personalized services like local and
travel-destination forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   You can create a personal weather page, allowing you to get the
forecast by entering your city's name or ZIP code, though
predictions won't necessarily be for what is over your house: you
can get only as close as the weather center nearest you.
</P>
<P>
   Local weather forecasts on Accuweather are much like what you
might see on local television: the sun shining or shrinking behind
clouds, sunrise and sunset, moon phases, high and low temperatures,
extended forecasts, and hour-by-hour forecasts. In addition, there
are jet-stream and precipitation maps.
</P>
<P>
   And if you are spending the next five days in Ouagadougou,
Burkina Faso, for example, you can find out that there will be
highs in the mid- and upper 90s and lows in the upper 70s. If
logging on to your personalweather page every day is too
cumbersome, Accuweather will send a forecast to your e-mail address
free.
</P>
<P>
   If you would prefer to search by weather ``product'' _ where the
hurricanes will be touching down next or where a particular storm
is _ you can do that, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Accuweather site provides updates on specific storms and
conditions, as well as archive roundups of, say, how many people
Hurricane Bertha killed in 1996 (answer: at least nine).
</P>
<P>
   There are also fee-based services like tailored aviation weather
pages and, for those who fear twisters, National Weather Service
warnings sent directly to pagers.
</P>
<P>
   The site occasionally lurches toward the technical. For
instance, it offers a measure of ``base reflectivity'' on its radar
chart, though it offers a help section if you need to understand
that. For fun, check out Weather Facts, which offers a weather
trivia question and Today's Worst Weather; on a recent day, that
prize went to Magic City, Idaho, experiencing its 14th consecutive
day hotter than 95 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising on Accuweather is restricted to a few banners, at
least for now, so loading pages does not take too long. And more
important, the site has been, as the name implies, accurate: a
glance out the window confirmed that it was indeed sunny on a
recent afternoon in Los Angeles. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lots of News and Lots of Ads &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WWW.WEATHER.COM &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The home page of the Weather Channel, Weather.com is, like the
24-hour cable station that preceded it, oriented toward breaking
weather news from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   (``More heat,'' the site recently reported. ``The heat continues
in Oklahoma and Texas. It's now 23 days in a row for triple-digit
heat in Dallas.'') The news options let you click to read a feature
article on weather or to peruse headlines and summaries.
</P>
<P>
   Weather.com also offers a Dow Jones-style scrolling ticker of
forecasts and conditions in cities; you can scroll back if your
city zips by too quickly. As with the Accuweather page, you can
type in a city name to find out the weather there.
</P>
<P>
   When you do, you get a five-day forecast of temperatures and
conditions. You can also get a video report on ``this day in
weather history.'' The site occasionally displays computer-command
gibberish on its pages after loading, though it disappears when you
click on Reload.
</P>
<P>
   In its feature section, the Weather Channel mixes news (well,
features, anyway) with what the weather will be like at events like
the current PGA Championship. It's not the most elegantly designed
page, although it blends in some interesting analyses of how high
temperatures and humidity will affect events. It also offers a
selection of weather-related tips on topics like gardening, golfing
and boating.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising is considerable, making the site a bit slow to
load.
</P>
<P>
   Weather.com offers a personalized weather page, and a revised
version is due in the fall. The new version will let you customize
the report to show the current weather in five cities of your
choice, as well as a five-day forecast and a blend of the usual
cloud and temperature maps for your local area and the whole
country. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   National Weather Service Web Site Takes Itself Seriously &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WWW.NWS.NOAA.GOV &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE is probably the most trusted and
well-known source of weather information in the country. So
naturally, its home page is focused on ... good government?
</P>
<P>
   The top of the page is emblazoned with the insignias of the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National
Weather Service. In between is an American flag and a weather vane.
</P>
<P>
   The first link is not weather maps, forecasts or conditions, but
Our Mission _ a solemn promise to provide weather information and
warnings ``for the protection of life and property and the
enhancement of the national economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Just below that is the agency's ``reinvention'' goals to be
accomplished by 2000, a response to a Clinton Administration
initiative called the National Partnership for Reinventing
government.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah, and then there's the weather.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service site gets good marks for
explaining, unlike any other site, how weather information is
actually recorded. And users can select weather observations from
individual locations, not just cities, which gives a context for
understanding how close or far the observed conditions are to you
(for instance, you can check Los Angeles International Airport, not
just Los Angeles).
</P>
<P>
   You get wind, visibility, maximum and minimum temperatures and
24-hour summaries in addition to the conditions and current
temperature (updated every hour). The National Weather Service also
provides crop summaries, earthquake and tsunami reports and
ultraviolet indexes for those who want more detailed information.
</P>
<P>
   It also issues official weather warnings. It summarizes severe
weather warnings by state, so if you are looking for a flash flood,
you will know if there is one on the way. The site offers videos of
inclement weather, but they take a long time to download.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to forecasts, the National Weather Service site
offers an ``enhanced graphics'' version, which worked with mixed
results: a page for local weather would not load because the server
was down.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, graphics on the site are nonexistent to
rudimentary. That make the pages quick to load, but they lack the
consumer-oriented bells and whistles that the average
weather-hunting Web surfer might be looking for. As far as overall
presentation goes, the site also requires looking at multiple pages
and thus consumes more time than the other sites. &QL;

 &HT;    Elton John, Disney, and Alliance Theatre start the creative
juices flowing for ``Aida''
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York
</P>
<P>
   Crammed into the corner of Studio 4-3 _ the same
turn-of-the-century loft where Michael Bennett created
``Dreamgirls'' _ a rehearsal pianist bangs some rocking, chiming
chords on a scuffed upright. The sound may not be Steinway, but it
is unmistakably Elton. A brand-new, never-performed-in-public Elton
John song is struggling to compete with the old A/C window units
that labor on this wickedly humid day and dribble water four
stories onto lower Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Gyrating across the smudgy wooden floor, stealing glances in the
mirrored wall that stands in for the audience, are singer-dancers
in tank tops, cutoffs, sweats, sneakers and soft boots that look
thick enough for a mountain hike. They represent the people of
Egypt in grim excitement about the upcoming execution of Radames,
the white Egyptian soldier, and Aida, the black Nubian slave girl
best known from her namesake Verdi opera, whose forbidden love is a
betrayal to their nations and families.
</P>
<P>
   It's Week 4 of rehearsals. ``Elaborate Lives: The Legend of
Aida,'' the new pop-rock musical co-produced by Walt Disney
Theatrical Productions and Atlanta's Alliance Theatre Company, is
in full creative heat.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Georgia, the sets (glittering obelisks, a multi-use
pyramid) are being assembled on the Alliance stage, where the show
begins previews Sept. 17. The dancers are kept steadily aware of
that destination by the thin red line of tape that angles across
the floor, mirroring the precise outline of the Alliance stage. The
stand-in obelisks are cardboard; a folding chair is labeled
``Throne.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a stripped-down, make-believe version of the dazzling
make-believe world to come. And Act 2 is literally taking shape in
the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point we're working on different approaches to the
ending,'' says director Robert Jess Roth, who at a boyish 35 may be
the youngest director with a long-running Broadway hit (``Beauty
and the Beast'') in production. ``So everyone's still involved,
still putting in ideas, from Linda (Woolverton, the book writer,
also from `Beauty') to the designers, to (lyricist) Tim Rice, to
Elton. I e-mail him every other day and it's wild not being quite
sure where he is; once it was Nice (France) and once it was Austin,
I know that. For a man who's never written directly for the stage
his theatrical instincts are astonishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The late) Michael Bennett owned this building and this is the
way he worked: wide-open collaboration, hectic but stimulating,''
continues Roth, a longtime director for Disney theme parks still
looking to make his artistic mark in the New York theater world.
Sweeping his hand toward the T-shirted dancers who look as if they
stepped right out of Bennett's `A Chorus Line','' he added, ``I get
inspired just being in Michael's room.''
</P>
<P>
   Another strong unseen presence is John, who has said he wanted
the premiere in Atlanta, his adopted hometown _ `So that I can keep
an eye on it'' _ a remark that didn't amuse Disney producers. (John
reportedly will watch rehearsals when they move to the Alliance
next month.) Judging by portions of three songs, John's ``Lives''
score is more reminiscent of his classic 1970s sound, both in the
uptempo rockers and love ballads, than the family-oriented numbers
he wrote with Rice for ``The Lion King.'' There is a tender duet
for Radames (played by Hank Stratton, 30, who appeared in the
Alliance's ``Angels in America'') and Aida (Heather Headley, 27,
the original Nala in ``The Lion King''), sung as they are about to
be sealed in the tomb, which seems destined to melt teen hearts.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly melts Woolverton's. As Roth instructs the lovers to
``Hold hands, so that's the last thing we see'' as the tomb is
closed, the 45-year-old author lets out a cry/sigh/laugh that shows
she's both moved and amused at herself for getting teary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up with Elton's music, I'm such a fan,'' says
Woolverton, who worked on ``Beauty and the Beast,'' and who keeps
her 7-year-old daughter, Keaton, at her side during rehearsals and
then asks her artistic counsel at home. ``When my father died,
(John's hit song) `Daniel' was playing on the radio, and to this
day if I hear that song I have to pull over to the side of the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   When work on ``Lives'' began in earnest two years ago,
Woolverton was summoned to John's Buckhead apartment _ ``Or his
floor of the building, I guess would be more accurate!'' _ to meet
the British rocker and hear him play the songs he'd just composed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so excited and nervous,'' recalls Woolverton
delightedly. ``So now, it's not just his music, it's Elton's voice
I'm hearing. Even though he's not here, it's an intimate
partnership for me.''
</P>
<P>
   How does ``Lives'' stand apart from ``Aida,'' Verdi's grand 1871
opera?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to contemporize the story, and popularize it,''
Woolverton says. ``Now, is that a bad thing? No, I don't think so.
Even if people know the title `Aida,' not many know just how
powerful and timeless a love story is at the center of it. My
version is a truer love triangle . I'm interested in the
relationship between Aida and Amneris (the Egyptian princess,
played by Sherie Scott, a veteran of ``Rent''), not just as slave
and master, or rivals for Radames, but as women who were both born
into the role of princess, who are equals. I've developed their
bond to raise the stakes of the situation even higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Woolverton added that Disney chairman Michael Eisner _ who will
see the show at the Alliance and rule on its Broadway-readiness _
has been faxing script suggestions as the project unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   Alliance artistic director Kenny Leon is also on the scene in
his role as co-producer _ offering the occasional comment or two
from the line of folding chairs along the mirrored wall, softly
humming a catchy John refrain. Woolverton accepted his critique
that the script repeated the word ``slave'' too often. ``That will
have a harsh ring to many people in my audience,'' Leon says. Three
Alliance stage managers are also posted on the line, recording the
lighting, sound and set-change cues.
</P>
<P>
   That's about the extent of the Atlanta presence. The only
Atlanta-based performers are three children who will join the cast
later. At first, Leon claims to have no problem with this ``best
cast we could have found.'' A moment later he concedes he's
disappointed that two Atlantans turned down offers to join the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, ``Lives'' is a Disney endeavor, pulling equipment and
manpower from corporate outposts in New York, Los Angeles, Toronto
and Orlando. The Mouse is footing most of the bill, which is
top-secret but will obviously run over $1 million. Director Roth
was impressed by the Alliance-bred production of Alfred Uhry's
``The Last Night of Ballyhoo'' on Broadway and refers to the
oft-maligned Alliance stage as ``a fantasyland _ a combination of
stage depth and relatively intimate house that's hard to find. I
jumped up and down when I saw it.''
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate destination for ``Elaborate Lives'' is Broadway _
it closes Nov. 8 at the Alliance _ but the timetable is up in the
air. Disney's line producer in Atlanta, Marshall Purdy, said last
weekend that the company is circling, ``vulture-like'' around the
few Broadway stages that are deep enough to handle ``Lives,''
hoping that one will become available after the new year.
</P>
<P>
   But a spring transfer to the Great White Way, ``Would be the
ideal scenario, only if the show works ideally,'' says Stuart Oken,
Disney vice-president for creative development. ``Only when we get
the show on its feet in Atlanta will we know what we've got.''
</P>
<P>
   -- WHAT IT'S ABOUT: Based on the 1871 Verdi opera of the same
name, ``Aida'' tells the story of a black Nubian slave girl and her
forbidden love for a white Egyptian soldier, Radames
</P>
<P>
   -- BEHIND THE SCENES: Elton John and lyracist Tim Rice _
partners in ``The Lion King'' _ collaborated on the music for
``Aida,'' with the book written by Linda Woolverton, who also wrote
the stage version of ``Beauty and the Beast.'' It is being directed
by ``Beauty'' director Robert Jess Roth. Heather Headley, the
original Nala in ``The Lion King,'' plays Aida; Hank Stratton, who
appeared in ``Angels in America'' at the Alliance, plays Radames.
</P>
<P>
   -- THE PRODUCTION'S COST: A closely guarded secret, but likely
more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   -- F YOU WANT TO GO: For single tickets to ``Elaborate Lives:
The Legend of Aida,'' call 404-733-5000. Single tickets $17-$35.

   A WIRED WOODSTOCK &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This time, Woodstock fans probably won't be worrying about
getting slowed down in the mud on Max Yasgur's farm in upstate New
York.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it might be on the bandwidth.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning tomorrow, Infoseek Corp. should expect plenty of
fiftysomethings to log on to its simulcast of the 29th anniversary
concerts for the original Woodstock music festival in Bethel, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The ``A Day in the Garden'' (actually three days) is the first
concert to appear on the site of the original Woodstock in nearly
30 years. Back when the original took place, some computers were
the size of school buses.
</P>
<P>
   Woodstock buffs can access pre-festival information from
Infoseek (concert.infoseek.com), the search-engine people. The site
includes diaries of Woodstock stories, artist profiles, a chat
room, links to artist and fan sites, and retrospectives on the
original Woodstock. Fans can also buy tickets or purchase CDs by
the performing artists on the site.
</P>
<P>
   The coolest feature is the Shockwave-powered game designed to
get Woodstock fans in the mood. Using the arrow keys on the
keyboard, players must move a guy wearing a Rasta hat from the back
of the crowd to the front of the stage before time runs out.
Pushing and shoving are allowed.
</P>
<P>
   It's far out. It is like Woodstock _ without the mud.

</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II will go online Sunday to recite his Angelus
prayers as the Vatican begins cybercasting from its site
(www.vatican.va) Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Vatican site is an interesting visit. Its
Holy Father option gives visitors images of John Paul II, John Paul
I, Paul VI and John XXIII.
</P>
<P>
   The site, designed with a parchment theme, also examines the
Vatican Museums, the Jubilee 2000 celebration and historic Vatican
documents.

   ARE YOU AN INTERNET ADDICT? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before you call up that next Web site, consider the findings of
Kimberly Young, assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh
and co-founder of the Center for Online Addiction
(www.netaddiction.com).
</P>
<P>
   Young promotes her book, Caught in the Net, on her extensive
site. In her book, Young points out that middle-aged homemakers and
college students are likely to become addicted to the Internet,
which she says has become as serious a problem as alcoholism and
compulsive gambling. Young also reports that nearly 14 percent of
college students meet the criteria for addiction.
</P>

   On her site, Young offers counseling and seminar information.
Visitors can also take tests to determine whether they are addicted
to the Internet.

 &HT;    MOST AMERICANS SAY ADULTERY IS WRONG UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite President Clinton's high approval ratings
in the face of alleged marital infidelity in the White House, a
huge majority of Americans have been telling pollsters for years
that they believe adultery is wrong under any circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   And among average American couples, adultery appears to occur
far less than might be suggested by the flurry of recent news
accounts about the president and such other public figures as Bill
Cosby, Frank Gifford and Bruce Willis, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't appear to be all that common,'' said Dave Murray,
director of the non-profit Statistical Assessment Service in
Washington and an anthropologist whose speciality is family
structure. ``If anything, attitudes toward adultery in the 1990s
have hardened, possibly as a backlash to the sexual revolution of
the 1960s,'' added Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Reliable data on adultery in the United States are limited.
Probably more than any other human behavior, adultery is cloaked in
secrecy and, therefore, researchers can hardly count on complete
candor from subjects. In addition, much of the research that has
been done in recent years has been colored by ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a 1994 survey by the National Opinion Research Center at
the University of Chicago, and a host of public opinion polls
conducted since, portray Americans as moralistic and conventional
in sexual matters _ ''essentially monogamous,'' as the University
of Chicago researchers summarized their findings.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, recent research by sociologist Judith Treas of the
University of California in Irvine found that
</P>
<P>
   American attitudes about adultery are closely aligned with those
of Ireland, Northern Ireland and Poland, three nations with
conservative Catholic populations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The much-hyped sexual revolution apparently failed to loosen
American adults' non-permissive attitudes toward sex outside
marriage,'' Treas said.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts aren't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ''The general population seems to say, 'Oh, no, adultery is not
the right thing to do,' but a lot of the people saying that are
engaged in extra-marital relationships,'' said Albert Watson, a
University of Cincinnati professor who teaches family counseling.
</P>
<P>
   How many Americans commit adultery is difficult to quantify. But
a frequently used starting point is the 1994 National Opinion
Research Center survey.
</P>
<P>
   In a face-to-face survey of 3,432 adults who were born between
1933 and 1974, the center asked: ''Have you ever had sex with
someone other than your husband or wife while you were married?''
About 24 percent of men and 11 percent of women answered yes.
</P>
<P>
   Those percentages, if applied to the current population of
adults in the United States, would mean that about 19 million men
and 12 million women have committed adultery at least once in their
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures may be low, however, since polls of any kind do
not always elicit the truth. ''If your wife is in the next room,
you're not going to be completely candid,'' said Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the University of Chicago survey findings are similar to
those of public opinion polls conducted since. For instance, about
80 percent of those surveyed by the University of Chicago for its
1994 report agreed that adultery was ''always wrong'' while 10
percent said it was ''almost always wrong.'' A Gallup Poll last
December, before the Monica Lewinsky investigation of Clinton
began, found that 79 percent of Americans believe adultery is
''always wrong,'' 11 percent believe it is ''almost always wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Pew Research Center for The People and The Press,
found recently that 85 percent of Americans ''agree'' or ''mostly
agree'' that they have ''old-fashioned values about family and
marriage'' _ a figure that has been remarkably constant since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   But Father James Heft, chancellor and a professor of faith and
culture at the University of Dayton, notes that there is nothing
old-fashioned in the way Americans speak of adultery today.
Consequently, he believes, there is little public outrage arising
from the allegations that Clinton had an affair with Lewinsky, and
tried to conceal the affair from Whitewater investigators and
lawyers representing former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones in
a sexual harassment suit against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''We usually don't speak of adultery or fornication anymore,''
he said. ''We use more neutral terms like extra- and pre-marital
sex _ clinically descriptive and morally contentless. (CQ) That's
been part of our problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mary Ellen Balchunis, a professor at LaSalle University in
Philadelphia, said, ''Americans can and do separate their attitudes
toward infidelity and their politicians.'' Their attitude is ''they
didn't vote for Clinton to be pope,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for Clinton's continued high standings in the
polls may be the growing importance of privacy to most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a twist on the concept that we Americans hold our leaders
to a higher standard _ that Americans are afraid that the same
standards will be applied to them,'' said Nate Lenow, a private
investigator in Memphis, Tenn., with experience in adultery-related
divorce cases.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, for the past 30 years, American society has been
moving away from what University of Chicago sociologist Edward O.
Laumann calls the ''public guarantee of morality through law.''
With that movement has come a secularization of adultery laws, most
notably the no-fault divorce statutes of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who did what to whom no longer plays a part in the finances of
a divorce settlement,'' said
</P>
<P>
   Barry Schatz, a nationally known divorce attorney with the
Chicago firm of Kalcheim, Schatz &AMP; Berger. ''It may be an issue in
terms of emotions and it can set the tone for a case, but not the
finances.''
</P>
<P>
   Schatz said most divorces are not brought on by adultery, but by
the decay of relationships, which sometimes leads to adultery.
</P>
<P>
   ''If spouses work at being friends and supporters, respect each
other and have some common interests, they can sustain some of that
early romance,'' he said. ''They won't need extra lovers, and they
won't have to come see me.''

STOCKTON ROLLS OUT THE RED CARPET FOR 49ERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CRUMPACKER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKTON, Calif. _ It didn't matter to the 30,000 cheering fans
who showed up that they were paying good money to see a mere
football practice.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did they mind that what they got Tuesday night was a World
Wrestling Federation match with a little football thrown in.
</P>
<P>
   What was important was that this was the event in town _ and it
involved the San Francisco 49ers, the team all of Stockton has been
nuts over since it opened its first training camp here 21 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   In what was billed as the ``Stockton Super Bowl,'' the 49ers and
San Diego Chargers met Tuesday night for a joint practice session
at sold-out Amos Alonzo Stagg Memorial Stadium and, at least
briefly, gave the fans, paying $10 each, their money's worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Roman circus with a little practice mixed in,''
said Berkeley sociologist and 49ers consultant Harry Edwards as he
watched the action. ``The people here being as community minded as
they are, to have 30,000 people out here for a practice, yeah, it
was predictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys have gotten into the spirit of the thing. They're
battling. This is basically the Roman Coliseum. Let's not fool
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco tackle Derrick Deese and San Diego defensive end
William Fuller turned a pass-blocking drill into a tussle that
developed into a mass scrum as players on both sides joined in
support of their teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We showed that we aren't going to take any mess going into the
season,'' the feisty Deese said. ``He pushed me over on my back and
tried to drive me into the ground. I turned him over and we went to
work. I thought it was cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   Next, 49ers tight end Shonn Bell and Chargers defensive end Van
Tuinei went at it at the end of a drill. Each man took a swing at
the other, always a futile gesture since the advent of the helmet
and face mask.
</P>
<P>
   More players joined in on this one, nearly enough to qualify as
a brawl. San Francisco tackle Chris Ruhman had his helmet ripped
off. Missing were bodies flying out the swinging doors of a saloon
and balsa-wood chairs being smashed over heads _ another milieu,
perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, 49ers rookie guard Phil Ostrowski tangled with Chargers
defensive tackle Henry Taylor, but by then, the spirit waned and
fewer players joined in.
</P>
<P>
   After each pointless skirmish, the fans cheered wildly. Death to
the infidels, they seemed to be saying.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the practice was mundane, but typical by football
training camp standards. The teams worked on running plays, passing
plays and punts.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the evening was a special one for some of the
approximately 120,000 fans who showed up at 38 practice sessions
spread over 21 days at the University of the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Retired linebacker and new radio analyst Gary Plummer handled
the public address system and, at one point, exhorted 49ers coach
Steve Mariucci to let wide receiver Jerry Rice participate in a
team drill. Rice, rehabilitating from major surgery on his left
knee, was limited Tuesday night to individual drills only.
</P>
<P>
   Equipment manager Kevin Lartigue sang the national anthem _
perhaps a first for an NFL training camp practice _ as a
parachutist descended into the stadium. Planes flew over Stagg
stadium airspace, though not the Blue Angels as advertised.
</P>
<P>
   The entire evening was the culmination of a month of good will
flowing freely from the people of Stockton to the 49ers'
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we developed was a rapport and a relationship with
the city of Stockton and the University of Pacific,'' Mariucci
said. ``Everybody here is bending over backwards to make it work.
The hospitality here has been second to none.''

AT THE NEW KIDS CAFE, THERE IS SUCH AS THING AS A FREE DINNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In news footage, the children stare back at you, naked, with the
inevitability of death hovering around them like bees around
flowers.
</P>
<P>
   You are at once saddened and relieved that hunger's haunting
face sits in some faraway country with a name like Bosnia or
Somalia, places distant and unfamiliar.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that hunger also lives here. It is next door
and down the street and around the corner. Its face _ although
sunken _ looks a lot like that snapshot of you when you were a
little girl or boy making mud pies, climbing trees or both. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It feels like a dull, blunt needle in your stomach, that pang
you get just before a late breakfast or lunch. Only it is much
worse and lasts much, much longer.
</P>
<P>
   Sonjia Dickerson knows that pang and sees that face with
shocking regularity. It is no worse than a Bosnia or Somalia, she
says, but it's not a whole lot better.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, hungry children live in communities all over the United
States. More than 12 million, according to estimates by the Second
Harvest National Network of Food Banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the former coordinator of business operations for the Fort
Worth school district's nutritional services, I got to see it
firsthand,'' Dickerson says. ``Children were much hungrier on
Monday because they hadn't had food, or very little food, over the
weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Kids are heading back to school lunch programs, but even then,
it's a long time between lunch one day and breakfast the next.
</P>
<P>
   And it gets even worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hunger in children is not just about an empty stomach,''
Dickerson says. ``It also means not reaching the appropriate
heights and weights, and it leads to poor school performance.''
</P>
<P>
   That is where Dickerson hopes the Tarrant Area Food Bank's Kids
Cafe can make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Launched nationally in 1993 by the food bank's parent company,
Second Harvest, Kids Cafe provides meals exclusively to children at
risk of malnutrition. In the Morningside community, where the first
cafe opened in May, that's 77 percent of all children.
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the reasons why the food bank chose the area to
begin its work, Dickerson said. The other reason is HOPE Farm, a
mentoring program for African-American boys ages 5 to 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we had to do was go in and add a food component to a
program that was already making a difference in the lives of
children,'' she said. ``Before we came there, they were giving them
a snack. We'll add to that a nutritional meal.''
</P>
<P>
   The local cafe will provide dinner to about 50 children a day.
The food bank will celebrate its grand opening at 4:30 p.m. Aug.
18. At that time, sites for two additional cafes in North Texas
will be announced. Those are scheduled to open in September.
</P>
<P>
   The food bank will supply food, administrative support and
salary for the kitchen coordinator at each site. But none of it
could be done, Dickerson said, without the $100,000 grant it
received from Capital One, a financial services company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we have a one-year commitment,'' she said. ``And so
we've budgeted ourselves so we can maintain these programs for one
year.''
</P>
<P>
   But surely there are others like Capital One who can guarantee a
longer run. There must be, because it IS a long time between lunch
one day and breakfast the next.

ADJUSTING A 401(K) FOR RETIREMENT DRAWDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for Long Beach and all needing)  
 (For release Sunday, August 09, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am 69 years old and will be retiring next January. I will
receive Social Security and a company pension, I would like to know
the approximate maximum that I could expect to receive from my
401(k) each month without drawing from the principal. I attach a
statement, and a breakdown of the investment alternatives that are
available.
</P>
<P>
   F.H., Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, if you wanted to get a strong income stream from your
401(k) with very little prospect of a reduction in principal, you'd
have to rearrange the portfolio fairly substantially. It s pretty
well positioned right now for a person in your situation -- just
approaching retirement. You have 59 percent of the money in stock
funds, with the largest stock position in Fidelity Equity Income
fund. On the fixed-income side, you have a total of 41 percent --
most of it in an Interest Income fund, but I also counted 37
percent of your holdings in Fidelity Puritan as fixed-income
holdings.
</P>
<P>
   To get the highest prudent income stream, you might put all of
the money in offerings such as the Interest Income fund and the
GNMA offering, (which I assume, like most of the offerings, is
Fidelity s,) and Fidelity U.S. Bond Index. Such a portfolio ought
to produce a yield of about 6.5 percent, which would mean $21,981,
or $1,832 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem with doing that is that while good bond funds
should retain their value over the long haul (although some
short-term periods can be very bumpy) there s very small prospect
for principal growth, and growth of principal is what you need when
inflation starts digging into the buying power of your income
stream.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason I hope you can work out a budget that calls for
only about $1,500 monthly withdrawals from the fixed-income side.
This would allow you to leave about $50,000 of your 401(k) savings
in a solid fund such as Fidelity Equity Income, and should make
your situation more solid in the long term.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. We are 55 years old and my husband will probably work 10 more
years. We have $110,000 in IRAs in American Century-Benham Target
Maturity 2005, $15,000 in Vanguard Wellington fund, $27,000 in
Vanguard High-Yield Municipal Bond fund, $10,000 in Vanguard Asset
Allocation fund, and $25,000 in a CD. My husband has $13,000 in a
401(k) program at his place of employment.
</P>
<P>
   As you can tell, our investments are very conservative because
we have little investment knowledge. Do you suggest any changes? We
have $30,000 in a savings account we would like to invest now. We
feel we have waited too long to prepare for retirement. Please
help.
</P>
<P>
   How much do we need to have invested to receive $25,000 a year
to supplement my husband s pension and our Social Security?
</P>
<P>
   R.H., Allentown, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, since the answer to your last question is a little less
than $385,000, and since your current portfolio is likely to take
you well beyond that point during the course of the next 10 years,
you haven t done so poorly. To get that figure, I presumed that you
could achieve average 6.5 percent returns from a fixed-income
portfolio with a mild smattering of stocks -- a portfolio very much
like the one you now hold.
</P>
<P>
   Let s suppose your current savings of $226,000 achieves that 6.5
percent target over the next decade; its value would then be
$428,011, nicely above the target figure. Moreover, that figure
doesn t include the effect of any ongoing savings you might make,
or of continuing contributions to your husband s 401(k) program.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do those figures it include that $30,000 that you re
thinking of investing more aggressively. I have long noticed a
frequent common denominator in my mailbag -- that people who feel,
correctly or not, that they ve waited too long to focus directly on
retirement are most prone to make mistakes; just at the time they
should be beginning to reduce risk they want to crank it up in
hopes of catching up.
</P>
<P>
   As I outlined above, you are in a good position to meet your
target of having $25,000 income to supplement your pension and
Social Security. So what remains for you to worry about is the
effect of inflation on your income stream after retirement. For
that reason I suggest this: Treat your current portfolio (plus the
401(k) as your primary retirement pool, and keep it invested
substantially as it is. Then take that $30,000 account and treat
that as your inflation-fighting account. Given your current
portfolio, I m not going to suggest anything more aggressive than
you now have. The most volatile (and most potentially rewarding)
segment of your current portfolio is the holding in Vanguard
Wellington, a balanced fund that has a little more than 62 percent
of its portfolio in stocks and the rest in bonds and other
fixed-income issues. This fund has a long and excellent record,
easily demonstrating the summary of Morningstar Mutual Funds --
above-average, with average returns and below-average risk. But don
t jump in all at once. If you ve read this column very often, you
know I m very jumpy about the current market. Therefore I suggest
you employ a discipline called dollar cost averaging. For example,
you might initially put $833 of the money into Wellington, moving
the balance to Vanguard s Prime Money Market fund. You could then
instruct Vanguard to move a similar amount into Wellington each
month. If we presume average 5 percent returns from the money
market, this would spread the investment period out over the course
of 36 months, and the slow process of establishing your investment
would reduce the carnage if the market took a spill at some point
during that period.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if all goes according to schedule, you won t have to think
about that money when you retire. You ll have your other funds to
supplement your pension and Social Security. It s another 10 years
down the road that you re worried about -- when inflation will have
cut the buying power of the pension, and when that $25,000
supplement isn t doing so well either. That s when you can look to
the pool you established in Wellington for help. And if you
achieved average 10 percent returns from this pool over those 20
years (and I think this is a reasonable expectation, even counting
in the current markets and the dollar-cost- averaging hedge at the
beginning) it would amount to $201,824 -- a nice present for
yourselves on the tin anniversary of your retirement.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What suggestion do you have for someone 38 years old who is
inheriting $10,000 and who wants to retire well? Where to put the
money to keep it multiplying fast but safely?
</P>
<P>
   S.D., San Diego
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. When you re 25 years or so away from retirement, the question
of safety becomes relative; it s such a long investment time frame
that what would seem like a fairly risky vehicle over any four- or
five-year period becomes a great deal less risky. I m speaking, of
course, about the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   But before we get into considering the thousands of possible
market investments, it s better to begin by thinking about taxes.
If you simply bought a stock, or shares of a mutual fund, you would
face potential tax bills during each of those 25 or so years --
every time you got a dividend, or swapped stock holdings, or got a
capital gains distributions (if you chose a mutual fund), Uncle
would have his hand out. If you qualify for to open an IRA, I
suggest you put $8,000 of the money into a money market mutual fund
and the other $2,000 into a Roth IRA invested in Vanguard Index 500
portfolio -- a mutual fund which seeks to duplicate the results of
the Standard and Poor s 500 Index, which tracks the nation s
largest 500 companies. Each year as you become eligible to do so,
move another $2,000 into the Roth IRA. The result? By the time you
re 65 years old you should have $109,365, a calculation that
presumes 5 percent returns from the money market fund for the six
years during which you will have the account in existence, and 10
percent average annual returns from the Index 500 fund. Obviously,
$109,365 isn t enough to allow anybody to retire well, but it sure
wouldn t hurt, would it?

<TEXT>
<P>
   Detroit and Hollywood have invented scores of words and phrases
that have become part of America's speech and psyche. Tail fin,
mini-series and sitcom quickly come to mind.
</P>
<P>
   Now that role falls to Microsoft. The company that has shaped
the way hundreds of millions of people use computers is helping to
shape the way people talk as well, with words like facemail and
self-toast, and new meanings for terms like dog food and ask.
</P>
<P>
   Microspeak is a slangy company jargon made up of dozens of words
and phrases commonly used at Microsoft. This Microjargon, which
includes word usages unique to Microsoft as well as usages from
elsewhere in the high-tech and low-tech worlds, has been documented
in an informal lexicon written by current and former workers at the
company, based in Redmond, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   At Microsoft, ``dog food'' means software not fit for public
consumption but good enough for internal purposes. ``Code warrior''
refers to a developer who writes code for software. The workers at
the Redmond campus now utter sentences like, ``It's kind of a
klugey solution, but we don't have the cycles to clean it up.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen current and former Microsoft blue badges
(permanent Microsoft employees) and orange badges (temporary
workers and independent contractors) are among the contributors to
the lexicon of Microspeak, which can be seen on the Web at
cinepad.com/mslex.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Barnes, the principal compiler and editor of the lexicon,
was editor of Microsoft's Music Central site when he left the
company in June; he gave Circuits permission to reprint some of the
definitions.
</P>
<P>
   While the lexicon began life as a semi-underground enterprise,
it eventually won some kind of company sanction. The company's
corporate newsletter, Micro News, ran a story on it, and it was
posted on Microsoft's company Web site, in all its irreverence _
around the time that the company, Barnes said, undertook to create
its own similar list.
</P>
<P>
   This may prove two things: not only that the lexicon is a good
read but also that language is the ultimate software.
</P>
<P>
   Adminisphere: Organizationally speaking, the levels starting
directly above you, characterized by their general cluelessness
about issues you're well versed in and tendencies to make policy
decisions that ignore your expert input. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ask: Used as a noun, preceded by ``the,'' as in ``What's the
ask?'' which basically means ``What are you asking?'' or ``What's
the question?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bandwidth: A cumbersome synonym for ``time,'' as in ``I don't
have the bandwidth to deal with that issue,'' but with implications
beyond the merely temporal, encompassing the larger issue of mental
resources or capacity. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Binary problem: A method of paring down a complex issue to a
two-possible-solutions scenario (yes or no, 1 or 0). Described by a
resident Microsoft philosopher as ``classic MS reductivism ...
clearly an economical way of thinking, since it eliminates all need
to consider the vast gray area that occupies the psychic space of
most issues and problems.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bitstorm: A volume of traffic on a service high enough to cause
the digital equivalent of gridlock. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Black hole: A project requiring infinite amounts of work. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bleeding edge: Synonym for ``cutting edge,'' with an added
implication of the pioneer's vulnerability. Example: ``We're really
on the bleeding edge with this product. Hope it sells through.''
</P>
<P>
   Bloatware: Software that takes up a huge amount of space on your
hard drive. Synonym: spacehog. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blue badge: (sometimes, slightly derogatorily, blue badger)
Synonym for full-time Microsoft employees, the Brahmins of the
deeply ingrained Microsoft caste system, whose card keys have a
blue background rather than the orange used for contractors and
green for vendors. Derivative terms include ``turn blue,'' meaning
to earn full-time status. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOOP: One of at least 10,000 peculiar-to-Microsoft acronyms.
There are so many casually-tossed-off acronyms (mostly of three
letters, like OOF, for Out of Facility) in daily use that there is
even an acronym for the concept itself: TLA (three-letter acronym).
This particular four-letter acronym is especially disarming; it
stands for ``Bill and the Office of the President,'' meaning Bill
Gates and his three top honchos. After a reorganization on Dec. 3,
1996, BOOP was replaced by the less-endearing Executive Committee. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bouncing: Cybernetic equivalent of going off the air for
repairs, a new app or other internal tinkering. ``The system is
bouncing at 4:30 and should be up in 20 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Braindump: A process by which a departing Microsoft employee or
contractor imparts the essential information vital to performing
his or her job to the designated replacement. The process normally
consumes no more than five minutes immediately prior to the
incumbent's departure from the company, nevermore to return.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Bug: All-purpose term for mistake, error, glitch. Despite its
universal acceptance, the term is deliberately avoided by Microsoft
technical support personnel when referring to Microsoft software.
Employed instead are such euphemisms as ``issue'' or more highly
evolved doublespeak terms like ``undocumented feature,''
``challenge'' or ``design side effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Company loyalists insist, however, that one reason for this
circumlocution is that in Microspeak, ``bug'' has the all-inclusive
definition of any problem or complaint filed about a product,
whether valid or not, as opposed to the general usage, which refers
only to actual problems.
</P>
<P>
   Build: The drive to complete a project or new version of a
product. ``The IE 4.0 build is eating up all our dev resources.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bump: Synonym for ``push back,'' i.e., readdress an issue after
an unsatisfactory or dilatory response. As in ``You'll need to bump
legal again on the permissions issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Buttoned Down: Compliment, meaning tightly reasoned, clear,
concise, etc. Not often heard of late.
</P>
<P>
   Buyoff: Approval from above; green light. ``We need BOOP's
buyoff before this project's a go.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CLM: Three-Letter Acronym for ``career-limiting move.''
Badmouthing adminispheric dictates, no matter how ill-considered,
can be a CLM.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Context-switch: A verb, unbelievably, meaning ``change
subjects.'' Example: ``Enough about outsourcing issues. Let's
context-switch to planning the rollout.''
</P>
<P>
   Crisp: Well-reasoned, precisely reasoned. Opposite of random.
</P>
<P>
   Cycles: Another approximate synonym for ``time,'' as in ``There
aren't enough cycles in the day to drive this issue.'' Often used
in tandem with the verb ``burn,'' as in ``He's really burning a lot
of cycles trying to resolve those UI issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Death march: The long, lingering final countdown to a ship date,
involving 16- to 25-hour days, catnaps on couches and plenty of
``flat food'' (food, mostly from vending machines, that you can
slip under people's doors so they can keep working).
</P>
<P>
   Disambiguate: A remarkably unclear way to say ``clarify.''
</P>
<P>
   Drive: To push; to captain the initiative on a particular issue
or project. ``Ed is driving the HTML issue for the product.''
</P>
<P>
   EOD: Endemic TLA (three-letter acronym) meaning ``end of day.''
Example: ``I need your take-away from the off-site by EOD
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Eye candy: A commonly used term denoting visually attractive
material, analogous to ``ear candy'' in the music business.
</P>
<P>
   Facemail: Technologically backward means of communication,
clearly inferior to voice mail or e-mail. Involves actually walking
to someone's office and speaking to him or her face to face.
Considered highly inefficient and declasse.
</P>
<P>
   Feature: Euphemism for bug. Dysfunctional attributes in a
product are often ``explained'' away by apologists with the phrase
``It's not a bug, it's a feature.'' As a result, ``it's a feature''
became synonymous with ``it's a bummer.''
</P>
<P>
   Feewall: A barrier of demarcation for financial responsibility.
``Does this project fall on our side of the feewall?'' translates
directly as ``Do we have to pay for this?''
</P>
<P>
   Fiber media: Material published on the hopelessly archaic medium
of paper. Example: ``Yeah, I used to be a writer in fiber media,
but now I'm a content provider in cybermedia.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeze: Point in a project's times pan after which no more
changes can be permitted. Or, as Cityspeak Dictionary puts it,
``Point in product development after which the answer to all great
new ideas is no.''
</P>
<P>
   Generating content: Writing. ``We'll need to hire some content
providers to generate content by Milestone 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Global fix: A programmatic trick to correct all instances of a
recurring error. ``Ed's working on a global fix to turn all the
commas in the CD-ROM into semicolons.''
</P>
<P>
   Granular: Generally used in tandem with the verb ``to get,'' as
in ``We need to get granular on this issue,'' meaning to examine
the fine details.
</P>
<P>
   Gronk The sound of a computer embroiled in bandwidth issues. ``I
tried to reboot, but my computer just sat there gronking until I
had to call Help Desk.''
</P>
<P>
   Issue: All-purpose term for practically anything relating to a
product, from a particular characteristic or bug to a delicate
diplomatic initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Klugey: (also kludgey; pronounced CLUE-gee) Clunky, inefficient,
inelegant. ``It's kind of a klugey solution, but we don't have the
cycles to clean it up.'' Also used in noun form as kluge or kludge.
</P>
<P>
   Live: Odd biomorphic usage, sort of an electronic half-life.
``Where will this data live?'' means ``Where will this data be
located?''
</P>
<P>
   Mapping: Targeting. ``Mapping a user group'' is synonymous with
``targeting an audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Media: Content that isn't words. Media can include photos, song
clips, illustrations.
</P>
<P>
   NDA: For Nondisclosure Agreement, meaning Keep Your Mouth Shut.
A legal document, invoked by Microsoft lawyers for anything more
sensitive than setting a lunch date, that allows them to crucify
anyone who reveals confidential information.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Net: Summarize. ``Ed really knows how to net a presentation.''
Related command: Net it out, meaning boil it down.
</P>
<P>
   New paradigm: Pompous way of essentially saying ``unique'':
``This Web site establishes a new paradigm on the Net.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nonlinear: Becoming nonlinear means becoming irrationally angry.
``When he found out the RTM date was slipping, Ed went totally
nonlinear.''
</P>
<P>
   Offline: A synonym for ``in private'' or ``confidentially'';
``Let's take this offline'' equals ``Let's talk about this in
private.'' Often used as a semipolite way of saying, ``Shut up
about that, you impolitic idiot.''
</P>
<P>
   OOF: A TLA (three-letter acronym) that has turned into a word of
its own. Stands for ``out of office.'' Historians tell us that OOF
originally meant ``out of facility.'' Occasionally used, rather
irritatingly, in conversation: ``I'm OOF next Friday; you'll have
to drive on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Open the kimono: A marvelous phrase of non-Microsoft origin,
probably stemming from the rash of Japanese acquisitions of
American enterprises in the 80s, that has been adopted into the
Microspeak marketing lexicon. Basically a somewhat sexist synonym
for ``open the books,'' it means to reveal the inner workings of a
project or company to a prospective new partner. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Orange badge: Contractor, temp. From the background color of the
photo ID badge-card key used for temporary workers.
</P>
<P>
   Own: To take responsibility for an issue. Ownership is even more
serious than drivership; you can drive an issue without owning it,
but it's unlikely that you would own it without also driving it.
</P>
<P>
   Ping: A reminder, or (used as a verb, which is slightly more
common) to remind: ``I need to ping my program manager to get some
more test help.''
</P>
<P>
   Quality bar: The remarkably flexible level of acceptability in a
product. Tends inexorably to drop as the pressure of an impending
milestone or other deadline builds.
</P>
<P>
   Random: A pejorative term to describe poorly reasoned analysis.
Antonym: crisp. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Randomize: To distract or throw off track by constantly changing
course or emphasizing irrelevant details. ``Marketing randomized
him by shifting the goalposts every week.''
</P>
<P>
   Reality distortion field: When a team deludes itself that it can
achieve impossibly tight milestones and solve insurmountable tech
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Self-toast: To fatally contradict yourself. Extension of the
widespread mainstream usage of ``toast'' as ``history,'' ``dead,''
``burned out.''
</P>
<P>
   Showstopper: A function, object or issue important enough to
jeopardize a ship date. In other words, a really big bug.
</P>
<P>
   Spec: Used as both noun and verb: as verb, to analyze a field of
information prior to the commencement of a project; as noun, the
analysis of that information. Also, a preliminary plan or
prospectus. ``Ed will spec the song clips to see which ones we need
to swap out''; ``Ed, have you finished the song-clip spec yet?''
</P>
<P>
   Take-away: Not, as might be suspected, food to go, but
impressions gleaned from a meeting or message. ``My take-away from
his e-mail was that he wasn't ready to drill down yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Taxonomy of options: A greatly murkier (and therefore infinitely
preferable) way of saying ``range of choices.''
</P>
<P>
   TLA: Three-letter acronym. A widespread general term in
computer-speak, but refined to a way of life (if not a
metalanguage) at Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Touch skin: Same basic meaning as facemail or face time. A
meeting arranged to counter the austerity of communicating in
cyberspace. ``We flew that guy to Redmond just so we could touch
skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Truline: (from screenwriting jargon) One-sentence summary of a
project's projected appeal or purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Uninstalled: Fired, canned, dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Vaporware: A Microsoft classic, dating back to at least the
early 90s), and now escaped into the world at large. Software that
was conceived (and probably promoted and advertised) but never came
to fruition; by extension, a foolish or fanciful conceit.
</P>
<P>
   Weasel text: A message on a Microsoft Web site explaining why a
popular feature or option has been discontinued.
</P>
<P>
   Weasel user: What the outside world has learned to label
``computer nerd.'' Specifically, a buyer of a Microsoft product who
bombards PSS (the company's customer support apparatus) with
constant and generally ludicrous technical complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Zero-bug release: Not, as you might suspect, a version of a
software product that's error-free, but a release with the major
bugs eliminated, retaining plenty of less significant problems.
</P>

MARKET CAN HELP INFLATION-PROOF A RETIREMENT FUND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for Long Beach and all needing)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I are 57 and 53. I make $77,000 a year and she
earns $100,000. We would like to retire in three years and have a
retirement income of $6,000 per month. We have checked with Social
Security and both of us will be qualified for benefits at nearly
the highest level. With the information below, how close can we
come to achieving our goal? We own three houses, worth $315,000,
$95,000 and $82,000; we have four mutual fund accounts totaling
$159,500. We have two late-model cars worth $30,000, and I own
$200,000 worth of S stock in the small company where I work, which
can take out over a 10-year-period.
</P>
<P>
   N.B., Beaverton, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. This is going to be a little iffy, since some of the values
appear (at least to me) to be imprecise. But one things does seems
clear to me -- you re pretty far away from a comfortable retirement
along the lines you propose. If we add up all of your assets
(except the cars, which as you know represent a fast- depreciating
asset,) I come up with a grand total of $851,500. Since you wouldn
t be eligible for Social Security until two years after you retire,
and your wife not until three years after that, let s start with
what it takes to generate a $72,000 annual income stream. If we
presume a 6.5 percent income stream from a retirement portfolio,
the number would be a little more than $1.1 million. Now of course
you might decide that you wouldn t need quite that much, since you
could dip into principal in the early years of retirement and then
begin rebuilding your savings after Social Security kicks in.
</P>
<P>
   But there s also the question of that S corporation stock. Does
the stock pay dividends? Or would your sale simply represent a
contract under which you were entitled to $20,000 a year for 10
years, or perhaps $1,666 a month. If such is the case you might,
with the sale of some of the real estate, be able to work out a
plan to take you through those 10 years -- but at that point your
finances would fall off the table.
</P>
<P>
   Here s where I end up: If you were to sell the two lesser-valued
real estate parcels and add the proceeds to your current mutual
fund portfolio, the total would be $336,500 -- enough, if invested
in a fixed-income portfolio, to produce $1,822 a month. If you were
to use your $1,666 a month from your company stock for living
expenses during the first two years, that would mean withdrawals of
$4,333 a month from that pool, and your principal would fall to
$271,115 by the time your Social Security kicked in. Let s suppose
that during the next three years you were to then cut withdrawals
to $2,733 a month. The result is that by the time your wife s
Social Security eligibility begins you would be down to $219,449 in
principal and you would have used up half of the money from your
company stock. It s a position from which you would not recover.
You might manage to stay near that $6,000 monthly level for the
next five years, but when the last payment from the company stkck
arrived, you d be cooked.
</P>
<P>
   Blacker still, none of these calculations take inflation into
consideration. A rough rule of thumb is that a people have a nice
degree of financial security in retirement if they have two sides
ing expenses, and a $275,000 growth portfolio designed to protect
you from inflation in later years.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry to be such a grouch, but at bottom the only advice I can
propose is, first, to save like mad until you do retire, and
second, consider whether you might not be better off in the long
run if you deferred retirement a few more years than you now plan.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Q. I m 64, single, and retired last year. I have pensions from
two companies totaling $23,000 a year and $12,000 from Social
Security. My IRAs consist of $100,000 in Fidelity Growth and Income
fund, $50,000 in a Fidelity money market fund,, and $50,000 in a CD
currently paying 5.75 percent. Non-IRA investments consist of
$25,000 in AARP Capital Growth fund $50,000 in AARP Growth and
Income, and $25,000 in a CD paying 6.08 percent. The pension and
Social Security money currently provides for all my needs, and
income from investments is reinvested, with the occasional
withdrawal for overseas travel.
</P>
<P>
   However, the pensions are fixed, and buying power will suffer in
the event of inflation. Further, I have reservations about the bull
market continuing. I had consisted selling Fidelity Growth and
Income and the AARP funds and buying bond funds, but this would
leave me paying capital gains taxes on the AARP funds. What do you
suggest?

<P>
   A. I can understand your nervousness about the market, but I
think you may be going too far. As a recent retiree, one of your
major concerns should be protecting yourself against the ravages of
inflation in the later years of your retirement, and unless you
have a terrific amount of money, the stock market is certainly the
best bet. If you were to move most of the $100,000 of IRA money
that s now in Fidelity Growth and Income fund to the fixed- income
side, the two AARP stock funds would represent only 25 percent of
your retirement savings, and especially since you re not counting
on any of these savings for a day-to-day income stream, I suggest
you stay put with them. One reason for this is that it s almost
impossible to time the market; if you get out now and you re like
most investors, you ll probably mis-time your re-entry, and the
worst part of such mis-timing is that people tend to come in too
late, missing the first few heady days or weeks of the next bull
market.
</P>
<P>
   The second reason, of course, is that I assume you hate paying
taxes as much as the rest of us do, and there s no way to exit from
the two AARP holdings without tax consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Notice that I suggested you move most of the money from Fidelity
Growth and Income. As I m sure you know, that excellent fund is now
closed to new investors; therefore I suggest you leave the door
ajar, leaving the minimum required to hold your account open. This
would allow you to restore your investment in this fund should you
become more comfortable with the market in the future.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Q. My grandchildren have shares of Lindner Growth Investors fund
in trust accounts. The results have been poor, with changes of
managers, etc. Should we wait for a hopeful improvement or sell? If
we sell, where should we put the proceeds?
</P>
<P>
   M.K., Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, the last management change at Lindner Growth Investors
came late last year, and it s hard to see any improvement since.
Entering this week, year-to-date figures for the fund showed an 8.1
percent loss, which puts it in the bottom quartile of the small-cap
value fund arena. The average small-cap value fund had a 3.3
percent loss year-to-date, and even the top quartile wasn t getting
anywhere, showing an average return of precisely -- nothing. Do you
blame it on a tough market sector and wait a little longer of do
you head for the doors?
</P>
<P>
   Let s look at the longer record. Over three years the fund had
average annual gains of 8.1 percent, comparing unfavorably to a
peer average of 17.5 percent. Its last above- average performance,
according to Morningstar Mutual funds, came in 1994 (and it lost
money that year, albeit losing a bit less than its peers).
Mornignstar rates it below average overall -- above-average for
risk, low for performance. Yes -- that s enough; I d dump it.
</P>
<P>
   As an alternative investment, if you want to stay in the
small-cap arena (and if your grandchildren are at least 10 years
away from college age) I d suggest Vanguard Small-Cap Index. If
they re older than that, I d look at a balanced fund such as
Vanguard Balanced Index. And if you want to stay within the Lindner
family, Lindner Dividend Investor seems to me to be its strongest
offering.

A SHRINE TO PLASTIC LAMINATES _ WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (lb) 
 By BARBARA FLANAGAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everyone knows what decorative laminate is. That's the plastic
stuff renovators rip out when they restore a historic house.
</P>
<P>
   But take note. It's none other than those garish old plastic
laminates, circa 1959, that have just qualified the Ralph Sr. and
Sunny Wilson House, in Texas, for a plaque from the National Park
Service. At this rate, today's aqua vanity is destined to become
tomorrow's Victorian mantel: a period piece invariably trashed by
insensitive modernizers, and then painstakingly rescued.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the National Register of Historic Places _ the
official federal list of districts, buildings and objects that best
exemplify American culture _ bestowed landmark status on the Wilson
house, a local shrine to the heritage of high-pressure plastic
laminate, often called Formica.
</P>
<P>
   But Formica this house is not. Ralph Wilson Sr., the late
founder of Wilsonart International, now the United States' largest
producer of decorative laminates, built the 3,000-square-foot model
home in Temple, Texas, about 100 miles northeast of Austin, as an
experimental showcase for Ralph Wilson Plastics.
</P>
<P>
   Together with his daughter, Bonnie, he drew up the plans and
masterminded the extensive use of pink, turquoise, lemon, pumpkin,
glitter, marble and maple laminates as alternatives to conventional
building materials: drywall, wallpaper, paint, wood, ceramic tile
and linoleum.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, laminates were used mostly on horizontal surfaces _
tables and counters. Wilson plastic-laminated most of the rest of
his house: the kitchen and bath cabinets, the shower stalls and
most of the walls, which were made of a special grade of plastic
that replaced the standard Sheetrock.
</P>
<P>
   The doorless garage of the Wilson house served as lab within a
lab. There Wilson covered the walls with new grades of laminate,
using the open garage to test his products' ability to withstand
the elements.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most model houses, which are built for marketing and then
dismantled, Wilson actually lived in the house, monitoring the
laminates until his death. His widow, Sunny, lived there until she
sold the house to the company two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   How did preservationists discover this anomaly _ a trove of
historic laminate gone ungutted for 40 years? During demolition, of
course.
</P>
<P>
   Wilsonart had hired Grace Jeffers, a New York art historian and
Formica expert (and the daughter of a Formica salesman), to help
build its corporate archives. Ms. Jeffers visited the house by
chance, and then avidly pursued its preservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I was in Texas, some company people were making fun of
the house,'' she said. ``They told me, `For a hoot, let's go over
to the founder's house because they're gutting the interior today.'
</P>
<P>
   ``When I walked into the house,'' she continued, ``I couldn't
breathe. I've been looking at laminates forever, and this was the
most stellar example. My eyes were all glassy and blinky, and I
said, `You can't hurt this!'''
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to some scholars, Ms. Jeffers believes it is the Wilson
house _ not the Formica House at the 1964 World's Fair _ that
pioneered the lavish use of plastic laminates. After being turned
down by the Brooklyn Museum of Art to add part of the Wilson house
to its collection of period rooms, Ms. Jeffers finally asked
Wilsonart, ``Why don't you just let me save the whole house?''
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that the house was a superb example of midcentury
modern architecture, with its open floor plan directly inspired by
the experimental Case Study Houses of California, Ms. Jeffers
persuaded the company to buy, renovate and furnish the house, to
turn the bedrooms into the company archives and to open the house
to public tours.
</P>
<P>
   Tours, by appointment only, are to start in November;
information will be available after Oct. 15 at (254) 773-9898.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Through her documentation, Ms. Jeffers convinced the National
Register that the house was nationally significant. Working with
horticultural consultants, she restored the grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifties landscaping had a lot in common with '50s interiors,''
she said. ``All the textures and the nubbiness of things like
grasses and Scandinavian rugs.'' The period landscape includes
yucca, pampas, liriope, mimosa, Chinese holly, irises and calla
lilies, plus peach and pecan trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The house has become the company mascot,'' Ms. Jeffers said.
``We had no idea the project would take on these proportions. But
the company sees itself as a family, and the house has become a
symbol of community for the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynne Wilde, an office worker at Wilsonart whose father has been
with the company for 40 years, thinks the house inspires pride in
the products. (The retro ``Brady Bunch'' style, she noted, is
``already coming back.'') Ms. Wilde said that the Wilson house
embodied a truism: ``What's ugly to one person is beautiful to
another.''

SHAW FESTIVAL: RECONSTRUCTING A BYGONE ELITE AND ITS FOLLIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NIAGARA-ON-THE-LAKE, Ontario _ Swelter-as-you-stroll season has
descended on the muggy streets of this unlikely summer theater
mecca on Lake Ontario, just over the Canadian border. Yet inside
the town's playhouses, a perennial chilliness prevails, and it has
nothing to do with the efficiency of the climate control.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's the plays occupying the theaters of the Shaw Festival,
an ambitious operation that has been presenting the works of George
Bernard Shaw and his contemporaries for 36 years, that are
responsible for a certain pervasive coolness.
</P>
<P>
   Bound by a singular mission _ producing only plays written
during Shaw's long (1856-1950) lifetime _ the festival, with eight
major shows in repertory on three stages, specializes in a style of
well-upholstered drama, primarily British in origin, that was a
mainstay of the theatrical times in which Shaw lived.
</P>
<P>
   These plays, by Shaw and Wilde, John Galsworthy and Christopher
Fry, are well-suited to the gold-plated settings the festival
favors, lavish, impeccably designed affairs that unfold with
everything but a royal warrant: tea services that would not look
out of place in the display windows of Asprey, fur-ruffed overcoats
inspired by the likes of Cecil Beaton.
</P>
<P>
   There is a reassurance in the plushness _ all the trouble
they've gone to! _ and a danger of irrelevance, too. For as you sit
through your third drawing room comedy or well-made social drama in
as many days, waiting for a tertiary character named Morrison or
Rose or Parker to announce the duchess or clear the silver or light
his lordship's cigar, your patience with the theater of the
absurdly wealthy can wear a little thin. You find yourself caring
less and less whether Lady Pompom runs off with Sir Brylcreem. You
long for a clear view out the gleaming mansion windows, for a
glimpse of what else might be going on in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Shaw does not limit itself to the British upper crust _
Kaufman and Hart's ``You Can't Take It With You,'' for instance, is
among the season's mainstage offerings _ but it's clear in the
sheer volume of depictions of the leisure classes (in Wilde's
``Lady Windermere's Fan,'' Shaw's ``Major Barbara,'' Galsworthy's
``Joy'' and Fry's ``The Lady's Not for Burning'') that the
festival's designers and directors enjoy standing on ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   And in its best presentations, like a lyrical, ravishing version
of ``Lady's Windermere's Fan,'' distinguished by Fiona Reid's
fascinating Mrs. Erlynne and an ornate carousel of a set by William
Schmuck that spins in two directions, the company succeeds in
adding beguiling new flavors to a genre that at times is as hard to
swallow as week-old oysters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lady Windermere's Fan,'' in the skillful hands of the Shaw's
English-born artistic director, Christopher Newton, reveals itself
as more than a showcase for droll repartee. The 1892 comedy,
Wilde's first London triumph, can seem a rather severe yet
rewarding morality play, as it reflects on the scandalous choices
made by Mrs. Erlynne, who abandoned an illegitimate daughter at
birth, a character and incident based, incidentally, on the
playwright's great friend, the socialite and actress Lillie
Langtry.
</P>
<P>
   It also skims the surface of tragedy: Newton's production
positions Lady Windermere (the lovely Colombe Demers) and her
husband (Ben Carlson) as the rich, stately partners in an enchanted
marriage whose spell is broken with the arrival of the mysterious
Mrs. Erlynne and her legacy of desertion.
</P>
<P>
   The tone of the play grows more rueful with the piling up of
secrets and suspicions that define its emotional fault lines and a
rigid moral and social code that Wilde deplores. ``Between men and
women there is no friendship possible,'' declares Lady Windermere's
suitor-in-waiting, Lord Darlington (the persuasive Gordon Rand).
``There is passion, enmity, worship, love, but no friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Reid's portrayal of the play's pivotal character _ whether
she will disclose her identity to her daughter, and what the
decision reveals about her, are the evening's most intriguing
questions _ proves to be the play's bridge to that world outside
the mansion windows.
</P>
<P>
   It's crucial because of all the fancy people who waltz across
Wilde's marbled foyers, only Mrs. Erlynne speaks with true
authority, a conviction forged in a real world of risk and loss.
With the casual, careworn bearing of one who fully grasps but does
not necessarily regret her youthful folly, Ms. Reid is, as Wilde
intended, a breath of fresh air, a self-possessed (and Ibsen-esque)
harbinger of modernity, blowing through the musty aristocratic
hallways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lady Windermere's Fan'' is the best reason for the trip to
Niagara-on-the-Lake, where the Shaw entertains about 300,000
theatergoers each year from April to November. Its focus on 100
years of plays, from mid-century to mid-century, gives it a unique
raison d'etre and helps to distinguish it from its better-known
rival, the Shakespeare-centric Stratford Festival in Stratford,
Ontario. And if a smooth and sumptuous version of the Wilde play
shows the Shaw off to best advantage, a few of its other offerings,
though solidly produced, underline some of the pitfalls in the
constraints imposed on play selection.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the well-known works it presents at its large house,
the Festival Theater, the Shaw Festival offers an assortment of
obscurer plays in two smaller theaters, across from each other on
the town's main thoroughfare of 1950s charm, Picton Street.
</P>
<P>
   While some are neglected mini-classics and other curiosities,
they are all lovingly attended to: ``Waterloo,'' Sir Arthur Conan
Doyle's one-act play, now in previews, about an elderly veteran of
the famous battle in which Napoleon was defeated, is notable both
for its author and its performances. Still, in some instances, the
productions only cement the plays' less-than-stellar reputations.
There's a reason, it turns out, many of these plays are not revived
more often.
</P>
<P>
   The works of the period do not lend themselves easily to
reinterpretation; what you are left with in plays like ``Joy,''
Galsworthy's arcadian slice of upper-class life, circa 1907, are
earnest reconstructions, with recordings of birdsong added. It's
theater of the mildest sort, not deadly theater, but not completely
alive either. ``Joy'' concerns the sexual and emotional awakening
of an 18-year-old girl, convincingly played by Severn Thompson, on
an afternoon of faint intrigue in a, yes, sumptuous English garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joy'' may have been jarringly realistic 90-odd years ago. But
today, regardless of how astute its character studies seem, the
genteel pacing turns it into a dreamplay, a trivial exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lady's Not for Burning,'' while set in the year 1400, was
written in the 1940s, and at the Shaw Festival plays like another
drawing-room comedy. It's easy to see how London audiences,
benumbed by decades of a compulsion to chronicle the private lives
of the privileged, would have been shocked out of their seats by
the plays of John Osborne and the other angry young men who burst
on the scene in the 1950s. From gentlemen in starched collars to a
lout in his underwear!
</P>
<P>
   The Shaw Festival could not exist without the plays of its
namesake; this season, the presentation is ``Major Barbara,'' which
receives a beautifully designed if workmanlike revival under the
direction of Helena Kaut-Howson. No performance is unfortunate, and
Joel Hechter, as the effete son of an amoral arms maker, and Bill
Walker, as a downtrodden bully who challenges Major Barbara (Kelli
Fox) to a Salvation Army showdown, bring an active creative force
to their supporting roles.
</P>
<P>
   But as demonstrated by Schmuck's zanily effective sci-fi
rendering of Undershaft's munitions works, there's a lot more
scenery happening here than anything else.

TANGLEWOOD INNOVATION, MUSICAL AND OTHERWISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LENOX, Mass. _ The administrative battles at the Tanglewood
Music Center during the last 18 months seem to have had little
effect on the center's annual Festival of Contemporary Music, held
here this past week. That's not to say that the festival has
proceeded without change; and clearly there is more change to come.
But this festival has evolved steadily over decades, and few of
this year's changes seem to be echoes of the broader skirmish over
control of the center.
</P>
<P>
   One change that clearly is linked to the shake-up is Seiji
Ozawa's involvement. His conducting the student orchestra in
Takemitsu's ``November Steps'' in the final concert was regarded as
emblematic of the Boston Symphony Orchestra's assertion of dominion
over its summer music school, and the consensus here is that this
is a change for the better.
</P>
<P>
   A lesser change is that the festival, once a week long, has been
compressed to five days. But by offering concerts in the afternoons
and evenings _ and on Sunday at 10:30 a.m. _ it offered the same
number of performances as in recent years: six concerts and three
preconcert recitals, plus a partly related Boston Symphony
performance.
</P>
<P>
   There was, however, a troubling paucity of student works. In
past years, a few were heard on the main programs, including an
annually commissioned orchestral work. No commission was made last
year, and at this year's festival the only work by a recent
Tanglewood student was the String Quartet No. 3 by Shih-Hui Chen (a
1996 alumna), performed by the Arditti String Quartet in the
opening concert.
</P>
<P>
   The involvement of the Arditti and Reinbert de Leeuw, the Dutch
conductor who has directed the festival since 1994, argues that it
has not lost its credibility in new-music circles, as did an
appearance by Peter Serkin and the presiding presences of two
composers in residence, Henri Dutilleux and Mauricio Kagel, and
several other composers, among them Elliott Carter, Charles
Wuorinen and George Perle.
</P>
<P>
   This was de Leeuw's final festival; although he described the
recent administrative upheaval as saddening, he said that he had
always intended to hand over the reins after five years.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, he has used this year's festival to restate an
inclusive view of contemporary music in which abstraction and
programmatic writing, intellectual severity and inviting populism,
soulfulness and mechanical intricacy, and sobriety and pranks
intermingle freely and draw on one another's ideas.
</P>
<P>
   One of Kagel's works, ``General Bass,'' for solo accordion,
moved slowly; used easy, repeated intervals, and sounded like a
merciless parody of Minimalism. Yet Minimalism also had an honored
place at the table. de Leeuw led the orchestra in an account of
John Adams' ``Shaker Loops'' (1978, revised 1982) that brought out
the work's shifting chromatic nuances beautifully.
</P>
<P>
   Adams' newer piano duet, ``Hallelujah Junction'' (1998), though,
seemed oddly plodding; it could be that the student pianists were
unable to create the rhythmically pointed barrelhouse effect that
Adams was seeking, and ended up pounding instead.
</P>
<P>
   The younger generation of composers has grafted Minimalist
practices onto other styles: ``Song X,'' a piano work by Kenneth
Lampl, brought together Minimalist figuration and chordal melodies
that would be at home on a Dave Brubeck album. Jazz with an early
Miles Davis accent, as well as stylized references to flamenco,
made fleeting incursions by way of Thomas Ades' programmatic
dreamscape, ``Living Toys.''
</P>
<P>
   And rock found a back door into the festival through Matthew
Guerrieri's String Quartet (1998), a gorgeous, harmonically
ambiguous work in which the central movement is based on the chord
progression from the Beach Boys' ``God Only Knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Kagel's ``General Bass'' was unlike any of his other works at
the festival, yet a quirky sense of humor came through virtually
all of them. Often he amuses through harmonic surprises and
peculiar juxtapositions. In Quartet No. 4 (1993), which the Arditti
gave a tightly polished reading, the clever dissection of a
folklike melody was among the tricks in his arsenal. ``Westen,''
which Kagel conducted, hints at a cultural exchange gone haywire:
percussion instruments evoke African rhythms, and the rest of the
orchestra brings a European perspective. But while the interplay
suggests curiosity on both sides, the two styles never find common
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Another of Kagel's works, ``Fuerst Igor, Stravinsky'' (1982),
memorializes Stravinsky by way of a laconic, almost spoken
resetting of an aria from Borodin's ``Prince Igor.'' And his
``Etudes for Large Orchestra'' (1992-96) _ the final works played
at the festival, on Monday evening _ traded in big gestures and
strange combinations: a slow tuba melody, for example, overlaid
with a flurry of flutes. Kagel's ``Etudes,'' conducted by de Leeuw,
was also the most vivid display of how finely polished the
Tanglewood Music Center orchestra is.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the evidence was otherwise lacking. All through the
festival, the young musicians gave mostly stunning performances of
a demanding slate of chamber works, and when they came together for
the finale, they communicated freshness, excitement and a sense of
occasion. They supplied all the color and energy Peter Lieberson
demands in his ``Fire'' (1995), conducted by Stefan Asbury.
</P>
<P>
   And in Dutilleux's violin concerto, ``L'Arbre des Songes''
(1983-85), conducted by de Leeuw, they supplied the gossamer
textures necessary to support Irvine Arditti's eloquent reading of
the angular yet melodic solo line.
</P>
<P>
   In Takemitsu's ``November Steps,'' the players at first seemed
slightly at sea, but after a tentative start, Ozawa was able to
draw a confident performance from them. Like Kagel's ``Westen,''
this is a cross-cultural work in which assimilation proves
impossible. The Japanese instruments _ the lutelike biwa, played by
Kakujo Nakamura, and the shakuhachi flute, played by Katsuya
Yokoyama, both flown in from Japan for the performances _ hold the
spotlight so thoroughly that the orchestral music seems almost an
afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   Dutilleux's music was plentifully represented, and argued that
he should have a higher profile in the standard repertory. In works
like ``Ainsi la Nuit'' (1976), played by the Arditti, or ``Les
Citations'' (1985-90), a chamber piece with a supremely beautiful
oboe line, rendered with graceful virtuosity by Carolyn Banham, one
had to admire Dutilleux's magically shifting textures.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath his appealing surfaces though, Dutilleux speaks of
troubling issues: the second movement of ``Les Citations'' and
``The Shadows of Time,'' in which Ozawa led the Boston Symphony on
Sunday afternoon, come to terms with the dark side of the soul
through allusions to war and death.
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights are too numerous to discuss, but a few that
should be noted are Serkin's impassioned reading of Messiaen's
``Couleurs de la Cite Celeste'' (1963), with de Leeuw conducting;
Robert Zuidam's ``Nella Citta Dolente'' (1998), with its
magnificent eight-part vocal counterpoint; Wuorinen's ``River of
Light'' (1997), a shimmering, dramatically propulsive dance work,
and Carter's tough-edged and surprisingly lyrical Clarinet Concerto
(1996), played with vibrant virtuosity by Thomas Martin, with
Asbury conducting.

   SAN ANTONIO _ A one-on-one basketball face-off between a federal
judge and actor Woody Harrelson is not necessarily an ethical foul
shot, some legal experts said this week.
</P>
<P>
   Another expert, however, said judges must not only do nothing
improper, but avoid the appearance of impropriety.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Fred Biery enjoyed the half-hour game last
week at a hotel in Denver, where he had gone to preside over a
hearing on the latest appeal of two life sentences by the actor's
father, convicted hit man Charles Harrelson.
</P>
<P>
   The judge _ a high school basketball player who went on to the
basketball program at Texas Lutheran College _ said the pick-up
game with Woody Harrelson occurred after a chance meeting with the
actor in the hotel health club.
</P>
<P>
   The judge freely discussed the game and the situation that led
to it, saying he did not believe it raised any ethical concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all at the same hotel, the FBI agents, the
prosecutors, the defense attorneys and Woody Harrelson,'' Biery
said. ``I would have had to lock myself up not to run into someone
involved in the case every day at breakfast, dinner and in
between.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Harrelson is appealing his 1982 conviction and two life
sentences for killing U.S. District Judge John H. Wood on May 29,
1979. Harrelson is an inmate at the federal prison in Florence,
Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Harrelson, whose movie credits include a film about
basketball called ``White Men Can't Jump'' and who played a
bartender on the television comedy ``Cheers,'' acknowledged last
week that he is footing the bill for his father's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had heard about the game, Assistant U.S. Attorney
Ray Jahn, one of the prosecutors in the case, replied: ``I did not
see that.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Harrelson's attorney, David Michael, said he had no
comment about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Biery said he was getting ready to leave the gym on Aug. 5 when
Woody Harrelson came in.
</P>
<P>
   Biery, who works out several times a week by shooting baskets,
said they began to talk and decided to play a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did say he felt kind of awkward, and I told him we could
play as long as we did not discuss the case,'' Biery said. ``I also
had breakfast twice that week with FBI Special Agent Claude Martin,
who was there to testify. We also did not discuss the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Joan Bohl, a judicial ethics expert and instructor at
Southwestern University School of Law in Los Angeles, said though
no impropriety may have occurred, that is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a clear appearance of impropriety, and judges are held
to the standard of avoiding the appearance,'' she said. ``I was
shocked by this. He wasn't trapped in an elevator. He could have
said hello and cordially walked off, but he didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   University of Texas School of Law Professor Charles Silver,
however, said that as long as Biery is telling the truth that they
did not discuss the case, he sees nothing wrong with the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an appearance of impropriety issue for judges, but I
am always reluctant to assume there has been impropriety,'' Silver
said. ``Judge Biery has been around a long time, and he knows the
rules. In principle, there is nothing wrong with him and Woody
Harrelson being on opposite sides in a pick-up game _ or on the
same side, for that matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The Code of Conduct for federal judges requires them to avoid
impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all activities,
but sometimes chance encounters are unavoidable, a federal appeals
court judge said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Circuit Judge Jerry Buchmeyer, who serves on the federal
Committee on Codes of Conduct, said the restrictions require only
that a judge and parties not discuss the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do run into parties in a lawsuit, and I think judges in
small towns have the problem more than others, usually,'' he said.
``You might even go have a drink with a lawyer, but (neither) you
nor the lawyer discusses the case before the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Biery said about 20 other people were in the gym while he and
Harrelson played basketball for a half hour.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors that his law clerk took pictures of the game are false,
Biery said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has a 13-year-old nephew in Denver, and he came by and had
his picture taken with Woody and his two brothers,'' Biery said.

BUMPED FROM WHITNEY, SHOW ON THE NUDE GOES TO CONNECTICUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, a small museum in
Ridgefield, Conn., plans to present a variation of an exhibition on
the nude in 20th-century art that was canceled last month by the
Whitney Museum of American Art. The show, opening next June, will
include an installation by Karen Finley, a drawing class in which
she and others will participate as nude models.
</P>
<P>
   In canceling the exhibition, ``The Great American Nude,'' the
Whitney said it was trying to cut costs so it could devote more
resources to its forthcoming Project of America, a series of shows
about the history of American art in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was announced days after Ms. Finley and three other
performance artists lost a case before the U.S. Supreme Court, with
justices voting 8-1 to uphold a decency test for federal arts
grants.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitney said the cancellation had nothing to do with the
court case and that the show might eventually even be rescheduled.
But Ms. Finley and other artists criticized the Whitney's move as a
form of censorship and predicted that it would make it more
difficult for them to receive backing from the National Endowment
for the Arts and other agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Philbrick, the director of the Aldrich, said the museum's
exhibition was partly a response to the Whitney withdrawal. ``When
I heard about the cancellation, that jolted me in different ways,''
he said. ``I had wanted to do a show on the nude for some time, and
it dovetailed with our discussions about the issue of censorship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people think there is freedom of expression, but there is
a more insidious form of censorship, in terms of funding,'' he
said. Although nudity in art has ``been a staple for thousands of
years,'' Philbrick added, he expects the exhibition to be
controversial. The show is scheduled to run from June 13 to Sept.
12, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks after the cancellation, Willard Holmes, acting
director of the Whitney, acknowledged that there had been ``a
reaction from the art community and from people interested in
preserving First Amendment rights.'' His response was that there
was ``absolutely no chill at the Whitney'' and that the museum was
not acting as a censor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The importance of First Amendment rights and free speech has
been a continuing theme of this museum since it was founded by
Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney,'' Holmes said. ``If there is a
tradition in this museum, it is supporting the new voice, the
iconoclast, the person who goes against the grain.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently the Whitney named Maxwell Anderson as its new director,
replacing David Ross, who resigned last spring to become director
of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitney exhibition would have included art from the museum's
collection as well as Ms. Finley's drawing class. Because the
Aldrich does not have a permanent collection, the artworks in its
show will be drawn from other sources. Philbrick said it would
include sculpture, paintings, photography and probably video,
mostly by by American artists.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The exhibition will occupy the entire museum, some 5,000 square
feet encompassing nine galleries, and an illustrated catalog is to
be published. Visitors will be invited to participate in the
drawing class.
</P>
<P>
   The show at the Whitney would have cost $300,000 to $400,000.
Mounting the smaller Aldrich exhibition will cost around $60,000,
Philbrick said.
</P>
<P>
   The drawing class installation, titled ``Go Figure,'' was first
presented last year at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los
Angeles. Ms. Finley has shown other work at the Aldrich. A copy of
her 1990 sculpture ``Black Sheep'' is in the museum's sculpture
garden.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking by telephone from Los Angeles, where she will soon be
directing her first film, ``Creating Kali,'' Ms. Finley said that
she was pleased that the Aldrich was mounting the exhibition but
that she was focusing her energies on other aspects of her career,
beginning with the film (written by Ms. Finley and Kamala Lopez and
starring Rosanna Arquette and Ms. Lopez).
</P>
<P>
   Still discouraged by the Whitney episode, she said, ``I have to
transform myself and leave the museum world for a while.''

MORRISON WOULD BE RIGHT AT HOME HERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Friday Aug. 14)  
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I read in Time magazine that officials at Pere-Lachaise cemetery
in Paris (France, not Texas), tired of picking up beer cans and
condoms left behind by mourners, have decided to disinter the
remains of Jim Morrison, the late lead singer of the Doors, when
the 30-year lease on his grave expires on July 6, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   No decision has been made as to where the Lizard King should be
reburied, which is why I am putting in my nomination early for
Sarasota.
</P>
<P>
   Sarasota has a lot of things going for it as a final resting
place for drugged-out rock stars, not the least of which is an
abundance of cemeteries.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the all-important local connection. Morrison was
born in Melbourne, a Sarasota-wannabe city located on Florida's
dreary East Coast, and he spent a year in junior college in St.
Petersburg, a suburb of Sarasota and home of the Sarasota Devil
Rays. (Morrison was preoccupied with the themes of evil and death,
so the ``devil'' part is another selling point for Sarasota.)
</P>
<P>
   Morrison was the son of a military officer, an occupation that
is heavily represented among Sarasota's retirees.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison is currently buried in France. For several years,
Sarasota hosted the French Film Festival. Coincidence? I hardly
think so.
</P>
<P>
   There is a Morrison's Cafeteria in Sarasota Square Mall.
</P>
<P>
   There are 67 listings under the name ``Morrison'' in the
Sarasota phone directory.
</P>
<P>
   Several copies of books written by Toni Morrison can be found in
the new Selby Library in downtown Sarasota, assuming they haven't
been stolen, checked out or banned.
</P>
<P>
   A quick check of some random quotes and song lyrics by Jim
Morrison further convinces me that Sarasota deserves to be his
final resting place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke up this morning and I got myself a beer.''
</P>
<P>
   This lyric should resonate among Sarasota's retirees, some of
whom nip at a rate well above the national average.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may eat your chicken
</P>
<P>
   ``Eat your pork and beans
</P>
<P>
   ``I eat more chicken
</P>
<P>
   ``Than any man ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't know if Sarasotans have one of the highest per capita
chicken-consumption rates of anyplace in the country, but I do know
that we eat a heck of a lot of chicken. At least I do, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a killer on the road
</P>
<P>
   ``His brain is squirmin' like a toad.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the driving habits of Sarasotans, many have brains
that squirm like toads once they get behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of myself as an intelligent, sensitive human with the
soul of a clown.''
</P>
<P>
   This sentiment fits in nicely with Sarasota's circus heritage,
though Morrison's behavior, which included exposing himself
onstage, the symbolic slaughter of a sheep and jumping drunk out of
windows, diverges rather sharply from traditional clown acts, which
consist mostly of squirting flowers and goofy unicycle riding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of hooked to the game of art and literature; my
heroes were artists and writers.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarasota is lousy with artists and writers to the point that you
can hardly throw your morning beer can out the window without
smacking one upside the head. In short, it is Jim Morrison's kind
of place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of us as erotic politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarasota could certainly use some erotic politicians. After all,
why should Washington, D.C., have all the fun?
</P>
<P>

Herald-Tribune.)

IN YIDDISH MUSIC, A RETURN TO ROOTS OF TORMENT AND JOY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 16)  
 (bl)  
 Barry Singer writes frequently about American popular music.  
 By BARRY SINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For more than a century, Yiddish music has survived
in America. The melodic vernacular of displaced Jews from Eastern
Europe, it is a music of secular wit and religious fervor, the
music of a people in a conflicted dance with assimilation.
</P>
<P>
   From the 1880s into the 1900s _ the earliest decades of
immigration _ Yiddish music remained indistinguishable from Jewish
ancestry, its riotous ceremonial stomps (freylakhs), the comic
patter tunes (kuplets) and the warm, homey (heymish) ballads, all
written and performed as they had been in Europe _ for Jewish
audiences in Jewish ghettoes.
</P>
<P>
   In a breathtakingly brief time, though, Jews in America began to
assimilate and Yiddish music mutated. Blended with ragtime,
interlaced with the blues, melted down, by the 1930s and '40s, in a
Tin Pan Alley cauldron of American popular music, it finally seemed
to disappear. But it was never entirely gone.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are stirrings of a Yiddish music renaissance. Klezmer,
the Yiddish bluegrass music, leads this revival, taken up by a new,
young generation; bands with names like the Klezmatics and Klezmer
Madness record prodigiously and tour widely. Even the classical
violinist Itzhak Perlman, in the company of klezmer's brightest
young performers, was moved to revisit this seemingly lost world on
his 1996 album ``In the Fiddler's House.''
</P>
<P>
   Among avant-garde and experimental musicians, like John Zorn and
Steve Reich, Yiddish music has become a means for exploring their
Jewish roots via unlikely, cutting-edge reinterpretations. The
Knitting Factory, New York's leading venue for alternative music,
pursues its own Jewish music agenda with an annual Passover Seder
at Avery Fisher Hall, ``Radical Jewish Culture'' tours of Europe
and Israel and a festival in part devoted to self-consciously
contemporary performances of Yiddish music, under the rubric ``Who
Is the Jew?''
</P>
<P>
   It is the actor and singer Mandy Patinkin, however, who is
engaged in perhaps the most personal and revealing program of
Yiddish music restoration. On his new CD ``Mamaloshen'' (``Mother
Tongue'') Patinkin tackles an extraordinary range of Diaspora
melodies, from warhorses like ``Yome, Yome'' and ``Papirosin'' to
Paul Simon's ``An American Tune'' _ all sung, for the most part, in
Yiddish. The album has sold more than 75,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   Patinkin is currently performing music culled from
``Mamaloshen'' in a riveting evening at the Orensanz Center for the
Arts, a former synagogue on the Lower East Side. His kaleidoscopic
medleys trace the history of Yiddish music's intermingled
influences from Europe to America. (The show's five-week run
concludes Saturday, Aug. 22.)
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the Yiddish music revival mirrors a millennial
fascination with ethnic music. From Kazak choirs to Cuban conjuntos
and Irish clog dancers, such explorations command increasingly
large audiences, proving that they are not merely revelatory but
marketable as well. In a culture that many people perceive to be
compromised by rampant inauthenticity, ethnic music satisfies a
yearning for authentic, rooted expression. Yiddish music is no
exception.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, clearly, something more is going on here. Renewed interest
in Yiddish music is part of a widespread reclaiming of Jewish
identity in the arts: Steven Spielberg in Hollywood, Art Speigelman
in what he calls his ``cartoon novels.'' Generations removed from
the immigrant Jews who hid their Jewish roots in exchange for
acceptance in America, these artists, now securely American, pursue
a heritage that more profoundly defines them, beyond their mere
Americanness. In doing so they unapologetically embrace the rich,
centuries-old, Jewish cultural otherness that as a grotesque
stereotype has long fueled anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   For the Jewish songwriters who conquered Tin Pan Alley during
the first half of this century, the fear of anti-Semitic exclusion
made any backward glance anathema. ``It's madness to be always
sitting around in sadness, when you could be learning the Steps of
Gladness,'' wrote Ira Gershwin (with B.G. de Sylva) in the 1922
song ``Stairway to Paradise.'' An immigrant's mantra, to be sure:
Why hold on to the past, the song urged, when you can learn to be
an American and happiness will surely follow?
</P>
<P>
   Yet, sadness and gladness are the twin emotions underlying much
of the best music that emerged from Tin Pan Alley at this time.
Wistful ambivalence undercuts exultation at every turn in the songs
of Israel Baline (Irving Berlin), Hyman Arluck (Harold Arlen),
Jacob Gershwine (George Gershwin) and so many other immigrant
Jewish songwriters, darkening the attainment of happiness with the
profundity of loss.
</P>
<P>
   It is this skein of ambivalence that the Yiddish revivalists
seek to unravel. When Mandy Patinkin sings ``Oyfn Pripetshik,'' he
is cutting through centuries of persecution in a spirit of triumph
and celebration. Yet the essence of Jewish music has always been
the capturing of Jewish suffering and loss in sound.
</P>
<P>
   Musical tradition in Judaism is at least as old as the biblical
word shira (song), used in scripture to connote both poetry and
music. With the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, where
singing and the playing of instruments were central to services,
the tradition of the hazzan, or cantor, evolved. The hazzan is a
designated prayer leader, versed in the liturgy, who chants aloud
for the congregation. The artistry of his incantations reached a
zenith in Eastern Europe, where masterful cantorial improvisers
ecstatically ornamented the traditional melodic patterns (nusakh)
in a musical style called fragesh.
</P>
<P>
   A sort of blues for Jews, fragesh progressions are major-scale
compositions with haunting minor overtones. Their sense of yearning
is an essential part of the harmonic vocabulary generically
identified today as ``Jewish.'' It is a music of longing and
lamentation, the music of a people who, as the conductor Michael
Tilson Thomas has observed, ``once upon a time heard God's voice
and are still waiting to hear it again.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Yiddish music projects this sound overtly. But it has been a
subliminal fact of American music throughout the 20th century. The
composer and scholar Jack Gottlieb has spent more than 30 years
sifting this presence to identify its components.
</P>
<P>
   In his view, the songs that Jews created for Tin Pan Alley
represented a turnabout in the history of Jewish vocal music.
``Whereas Jews in the past often assimilated melodic elements of a
host culture into their sacred and secular music,'' he said, ``Jews
in 20th-century America, for the first time significantly
contributed to the music of the mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a contribution made altogether surreptitiously. Sometimes
songwriters merely reshaped an existing Yiddish song for American
consumption, as in Sammy Cahn's and Saul Chaplin's swinging hit
adaptation for the Andrews Sisters of the Yiddish composers Jacob
Jacobs and Sholom Secunda's ``Bei Mir Bist du Schon.'' More often,
these songwriters drew on what Gottlieb calls ``a reserve of
idiomatic memories,'' piecing together new American songs from
fragments of Yiddish melody.
</P>
<P>
   The process could be fraught with anxiety. The Hollywood
composer Bernard Hermann recalls George Gershwin expressing grave
concern that audiences would find ``Summertime,'' his operatic
lullaby in ``Porgy and Bess,'' ``too Yiddish.'' Gottlieb speculates
that Gershwin had drawn on an old Yiddish lullaby, ``Lu, Lu
Lulinki,'' whose melody powerfully echoes ``Summertime,'' as does
its lyric, beginning with the words: ``What will Papa buy? A calf
and a cow. Who will milk her? The Daddy? No, little baby. You and
I.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a lullaby that today's Yiddish revivalists would perform
without apology. Similarly, when Patinkin sings Abraham Ellstein
and Jacob Jacob's ``Alter Tzigayner'' (``The Old Gypsy'')
juxtaposed with Irving Berlin's ``White Christmas,'' Gottlieb's
point is illustrated perfectly: Gypsy cadences and fragesh harmony
yield to Americanized sentimentality. The transformation is
complete.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn-born George Gershwin never composed for the Yiddish
stage. Nor did Berlin, an immigrant from Russia whose first
language was Yiddish and whose early Tin Pan Alley songs included
titles like ``Yiddle on Your Fiddle, Play Some Ragtime.'' Yiddish
music for both, nevertheless, retained a primal pull that, as
Patinkin observes, is common to all ethnic music.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I didn't feel I had any history with this at all in
terms of my own life,'' Patinkin conceded. ``Then I began looking
to follow the journey of these Jewish composers to America in terms
of music and in terms of family. I realized I wanted to pay back my
heritage. But beyond that, I believe this music has the power, for
all of us, to say: `Listen to my past and hear in it your past.'''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even for the revivalists, a certain religious reticence
lingers. Yiddish music in America remains largely a secular matter
_ hardly a correlative to contemporary Christian pop. For the
Yiddish revivalists, like their Tin Pan Alley predecessors, the
issue of religion is largely left offstage, yet another irony in
this ongoing cycle of disavowal and reclamation. For beneath the
surface, religious references abound in Yiddish music, as they did
even on Tin Pan Alley.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the American immigrant cantor's son who called himself
Harold Arlen. He, no doubt, knew as much about Yiddish music as any
of today's revivalists, yet his own music was far more celebrated
for its jazz influences. Arlen also clearly knew quite a bit about
Jewish liturgical music, including the traditional nusakh for the
Kiddush, the benediction that generations of Jews have sung over
wine to welcome the Sabbath every Friday night. Composed in
19th-century Poland by cantor Louis Lewendowsky, its concluding
words offer solace to a wandering nation: ``Ki Vonu Bocharto
V'otanu Kidashto Mikol Ha'amim'' (``For You have chosen us and
sanctified us above all nations.'')
</P>
<P>
   Unconsciously or not, Arlen invokes this nusakh as the opening
for ``It's Only a Paper Moon,'' one of his biggest hit tunes,
written in 1932. With words supplied by a pair of immigrant sons,
Isidore (Yip) Harburg (ne Hochberg ) and Billy Rose (ne Rosenberg),
a whimsical Depression-era declaration of love also comes to
suggest a wishful invitation from God to a newly resettled people:
``Say, it's only a paper moon/ Sailing over a cardboard sea/ But it
wouldn't be make believe/ If you believed in me.''
</P>
<P>
   This yearning to believe is at the heart of all Jewish music.
Whether it is expressed in Yiddish or in English, on Tin Pan Alley
or in Eastern Europe, its survival powers are eternal. In his
biography of Arlen, Edward Jablonski recounts an observer's
witnessing the composer, who had a majestic cantorial voice
himself, sing ``Paper Moon'' at a party. It was, he said, as if he
were praying.

SCORCHING TEXAS SUMMER FRIES OUTDOOR ENTERTAINMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PERRY STEWART 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In terms of quality and vitality, Fort Worth's Shakespeare in
the Park was hot this year. Its stagings of ``Henry V'' and ``As
You Like It'' earned high numbers artistically.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the weather was also hot. Higher numbers on the
thermometer meant that fewer people ventured out to Trinity Park to
see the plays.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth actors did not scorch alone. With the exception of
Waxahachie's Scarborough Faire _ whose closing date of June 14
enabled it to avoid the heat wave _ outdoor entertainment entities
in most parts of Texas suffered from this summer's onslaught of
three-digit temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Some fought back. Water misters and electric fans have been
installed at Hip Pocket Theatre _ where, in her welcoming talk,
producer Diane Simons reminds audiences that they'll be wearing
coats and jackets when they attend the October season finale.
</P>
<P>
   The Tablerock Festival in Salado passed out fans and sold ``cool
collars'' for audience members to wear around their necks. Concerts
in the Garden in Fort Worth cooled off symphony players by waiving
the dress code.
</P>
<P>
   Most just toughed it out.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth Shakespeare season that ran from June 10 to July
12 drew 9,200 people, compared with 11,000 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not a devastating year,'' said executive director
Robert Fass. ``But we did take a beating from the weather.''
</P>
<P>
   Brothers in the Bard, the Shakespeare Festival of Dallas, played
to a season total of 71,500 in Samuell-Grand Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was down about 22,000 from last year,'' said Sandra
Greenway, acting director of marketing and development.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Shakespeare does not charge admission. But it still took
a hit financially, because smaller crowds meant lower sales of
refreshments and souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was much cooler when the sun went down,'' said Greenway.
``But it was hard to convince people of that when the `Dallas
Morning News' had the heat death toll on the front page every
morning, and TV stations led off with the heat wave every
evening.''
</P>
<P>
   Attendance was down at the Fort Worth Symphony's Concerts in the
Garden. This series of 16 performances, over four long weekends
between June 11 and July 5 in the Fort Worth Botanic Garden,
featured music ranging from the ``nuclear polka'' of Brave Combo to
Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody is wearing black armbands at the symphony office _
perhaps because in a time of potential disaster, survival is a
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Koonsman, executive director of the symphony, uses terms
such as ``extremely fortunate'' and ``great success'' when
assessing the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got this loyal group of patrons who turn out _ rain or
shine, sleet, hail, whatever,'' Koonsman said. ``Our numbers were
down. We had over 45,000 last year, and we had 38,000 this year.''
</P>
<P>
   One visible casualty of the heat was the symphony players'
normally dapper attire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did everything in our power to combat the heat for
musicians on stage,'' said Koonsman. ``We brought in electric fans,
we put coolers of bottled water on stage, and we pretty much tossed
aside our normal dress code _ which is black slacks and skirts and
white shirts and blouses. This summer, many of the musicians wore
shorts.''
</P>
<P>
   At least these organizations' heat troubles are over. Some
performance venues are still watching the thermometer nervously.
</P>
<P>
   On July 10, Hip Pocket Theatre opened ``Fatty in Babylon'' in
the 175-seat Oak Acres amphitheater at 1620 Las Vegas Trail N.
Attendance at the previous show _ Eugene Ionesco's absurdist
classic ``The Rhinoceros'' _ caught the brunt of the heat wave.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ran July 10 through Aug. 2,'' said producer Simons.
``That's pretty much the time frame of the worst heat. Our crowds
were down. But, strangely, not every night. We had some very good
houses late in the run. Our director, John Moore, thinks they just
got cabin fever and wanted to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   This is nothing new to Hip Pocket, which has staged plays
outdoors in the summer for more than two decades. In the benchmark
broiling summer of 1980, for example, the hardy Hipsters performed
``Captive Wild Women,'' which featured a campfire on stage.
</P>
<P>
   Godly subject matter does not guarantee heavenly weather. The
religious pageant ``The Promise,'' which runs through October at
the Texas Amphitheatre outside Glen Rose, has watched its crowds
diminish during the summer. David Sanders, president of Promise
Productions, wasn't available at press time. But an unidentified
staffer, when asked if ``The Promise'' had experienced lower
attendance due to the extreme heat, said: ``Common sense will tell
you that we have.''
</P>
<P>
   The Smith/Ritch Point Theatre near Ingram, in the Texas Hill
Country, is currently featuring ``The Music Man'' on its open-air
stage along the Guadalupe River bank. The show runs through Aug.
29, with former Fort Worth actor/composer Douglas Balentine in the
title role. Crowds are good, but they probably would be better
under normal weather circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're selling about 60 percent of our seats,'' said Bruce
Bicknell, executive director of the Hill Country Arts Foundation,
parent organization of the theater. ``Without this heat, we'd be
selling 70 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tablerock Festival performs the historical musical drama
``Salado Legends'' every year in Salado _ south of Fort Worth
between Waco and Austin. This year's shows were July 18, July 25
and Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only have three performances,'' said playwright and board
President Jackie Mills. ``So we were very conscious of how the heat
affected our attendance. Crowds were down the first two shows.
People were saying they wanted to wait and see if it got cooler. It
didn't. So they all came to the last show. We can seat 450 in our
amphitheater, but somehow we got 494 in for that performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we're not the only ones affected by the heat. I
spoke with the Institute of Outdoor Drama. They say theaters are
complaining about the heat all over Texas _ except in El Paso,
where they say: `What else is new?' ''

PLUNGING MARKET TAKES FUNDS ALONG FOR THE RIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Corrects total 1998 return of the S&AMP;P 500 through Tuesday, in 5th
graf, to 11.15 percent.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Check your mutual funds lately?
</P>
<P>
   It's no suprise that stock funds have taken a beating in the
last month as the market's leading indexes slumped. But it's one
thing to watch abstract market measures slide and quite another to
see real money disappear out of your shareholder account.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the general stock funds at Fidelity Investments are
still outperforming their market index benchmarks, but the gaudy
returns of just a month ago have been slashed since stocks peaked
July 17.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity's Retirement Growth fund, up 31 percent for the year on
July 17, was ahead by only 19.6 percent by Monday. Contrafund's
1998 gain was cut from 25.4 percent to 15.3 percent during the same
period, and returns for Magellan, the world's biggest mutual fund,
were trimmed from 24.9 percent to 13.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, up 23.3 percent at its July 17
peak, had earned 11.15 percent as of Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity's funds have lots of company. The performance of
practically every general stock fund managed from Boston and
elsewhere has slipped by 10 percentage points or more.
</P>
<P>
   Even funds that lean toward big ``Nifty Fifty'' stocks have been
stung in the last month. Massachusetts Investors Growth, which
usually invests in large stocks, saw its gains trimmed from 32
percent to 18.2 percent between July 17 and Monday. Pioneer Growth,
another strong performer in the big-stock category, has trimmed its
1998 return from 30.4 percent to 19.6 percent over the same time
period.
</P>
<P>
   But small-stock funds, which already trailed the performance of
funds that invest in big companies, have gotten hit even harder at
practically every turn in the last month.
</P>
<P>
   Managers said the adverse investor sentiment toward small stocks
give them no choice but to buy attractive companies at cheap prices
and hope for the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not making up ground,'' said Russ Kinnel, equity
editor at Morningstar Inc., the mutual fund research firm. ``Even
before (Tuesday), small-capitalization funds were in the red when
the average large-cap fund was up 10 percent or so. There's a
tremendous gap.''
</P>
<P>
   Putnam OTC &AMP; Emerging Growth was up 18.2 percent on July 17, a
gain that had shrunk to about 1.5 percent after another tough day
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``What continues to amaze me is negativity'' toward small
stocks, said Mike Mufson, a co-manager of the fund. ``The glass
isn't half empty, people just think it's empty.''
</P>
<P>
   Putnam OTC is hardly alone. John Hancock Special Equities, a
concentrated portfolio of small stocks, was already struggling on
July 17, up 4.8 percent for the year. But it's been hit hard since
and posted a year-to-date loss of about 12 percent by the end of
the day Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time now that small stocks have
underperformed,'' said Robert Freedman, chief investment officer at
John Hancock Mutual Funds. ``At the moment, there's not much light
at the end of the tunnel.''
</P>
<P>
   Fund managers like Bart Geer, who invests in midsize companies
for the State Street Research Alpha fund, said they can't do much
in sharp market declines except to spot stocks that briefly fall
even harder for no apparent reason. But most of their time is still
spent in the normal process of analyzing companies for their
longer-term prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life goes on,'' said Geer. ``You can't spend your life in
front of a (computer) screen.''

   _From the personnel file: Karen Schwartzman, the chief
spokeswoman of BankBoston Corp., is leaving after seven years with
the bank. Effective Sept. 8, Schwartzman becomes a senior vice
president with Fleishman Hillard, the St. Louis-based public
relations firm that opened a Boston office six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   _On the move: Stock in Zoll Medical Corp. is up 40 percent in
the last two days although there has been no news on the
Burlington, Mass. maker of heart defibrillators. As we reported
last week, Zoll is facing a possible proxy fight lead by Elliott
Associates, an aggressive New York hedge fund. The stock closed
Tuesday at 10, up from 7 1/8 on Friday on about four times normal
volume.

MEXICAN LAWMAKERS CONSIDER EXCEPTIONS FOR TOUGH GUN LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PHILIP TRUE  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mexican lawmakers are poised to relax strict laws
on the importation of firearms that could mean the early release of
dozens of Americans now held in prisons on gun charges.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, part of a wide-ranging package of reforms to
Mexico's firearms law proposed by President Ernesto Zedillo, has
already passed the Senate, and congressional sources say it stands
a good chance in the Chamber of Deputies, which is expected to
begin negotiations on it next month.
</P>
<P>
   While the package of reforms would not repeal the stringent
gun-control laws, it would grant a one-time exception to those who
live outside Mexico and who inadvertently bring a gun or ammunition
into the country.
</P>
<P>
   But the exception would not apply when the gun or ammunition
involved is specifically reserved for the use of the Mexican police
or military.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than facing a stiff prison sentence, those found with a
weapon or ammunition would pay an administrative fine of less than
$1,000 and be allowed to return to the United States with the gun
and/or ammunition, said Sen. Alvaro Vallarta Cecena, of the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking about people who have committed an error rather
than a crime,'' Vallarta said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should understand that we should not allow injustices
to occur with someone who inadvertently leaves his gun under his
seat or a couple of boxes of ammunition in his trunk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Judicial sources say that, if passed, such a law would apply
retroactively, allowing many of the more than 80 Americans now
jailed here on gun charges to apply for early release.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush raised the subject with his Mexican
counterparts at the Border Governors' Conference in Brownsville
last month. Bush urged the Mexican governors to support a lessening
of the penalty for those who were forgetful or ignorant of Mexican
law.
</P>
<P>
   The federal firearms law of 1972 permits civilians licensed by
the Mexican military to carry semi-automatic pistols and ammunition
up to 9mm, ``with the exception of .38 caliber Super ..., .38
caliber Comando ... and 9mm Mauser, Luger, Parabellum and Comando,
and similar models manufactured by other makers.''
</P>
<P>
   It also permits licensed civilians to carry revolvers up to
.38-caliber Special and ammunition, ``with the exception of .357
Magnum.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who live in rural areas are permitted to carry .22-caliber
rifles and up to .12-gauge shotguns with normal barrels, the law
states. Licensed hunters also are allowed semi-automatic rifles and
ammunition up to 7.62mm or .30 caliber
</P>
<P>
   All other weapons are reserved for the police or the military.
</P>
<P>
   Those carrying a .45 caliber or 9mm pistol or an M-16 rifle
would not be eligible for the one-time exemption.
</P>
<P>
   Under present law, unless importation permits are presented at
the time a foreign resident crosses the border, anyone found
carrying any firearm or ammunition by Mexican Customs officials can
be charged with smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican authorities have tightened the application of such laws
with the rise of violent drug-smuggling cartels and the advent of
guerrilla movements in several states since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans, including at least one Texas law enforcement
officer, have been arrested crossing the Mexican border and charged
with carrying guns and ammunition they are legally permitted to
carry in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Many times, jail sentences of more than 5 years have been
imposed for as little as one or two boxes of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   The reform package sailed through the Senate, dominated by
Zedillo's PRI.
</P>
<P>
   But certain aspects of the whole package face opposition in the
Chamber of Deputies, controlled by a majority of opposition
parties, said Juan Carlos Gutierrez Fragoso, from the conservative
National Action Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that we will have to call in (Zedillo's)
representatives to negotiate out certain points,'' Gutierrez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't think that there is anyone who is opposed
specifically to that part of the initiative,'' he said of the
one-time forgiveness provision.
</P>
<P>
   If the law is passed, those already serving sentences would have
to petition the Interior Ministry for early release, an official
said.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bed has gone to its head.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional, boatlike bed that saw you through life's
journey _ from birth to death, from stem to stern, from side to
side _ is becoming a more minimal platform for modern living. It is
now basically a flat barge for layered bed linens.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no trend more dominant right now than the clean,
casual lifestyle collections _ modern, midcentury furnishings _
that lend themselves to trimmer, leaner beds,'' said Brian Carroll,
an editor of Furniture Today, an industry journal, who covers the
case-goods market, which includes beds. ``The duvet dresses the
bed. If you want a design statement, it's the headboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Ready to seize the moment, the headboard is grabbing the
spotlight and going solo. From couture-end home-furnishing
designers like Dakota Jackson, Vicente Wolf for Casa Bique and
Christian Liaigre for Holly Hunt to mass-market retailers like
Pottery Barn and Spiegel, the headboard is being sold on its own,
as an option for the bed, and making itself widely available.
</P>
<P>
   Independent of the bedding, the headboard has become its own
piece of furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Bilhuber, a New York decorator, designed a large
three-panel lacquered wood headboard for a young New York architect
and his wife. It stands freely like a low, monumental wall at the
head of the bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives the bed the ability to float in the room,'' Bilhuber
said. ``In New York there often isn't even a headboard wall
available, or there's a radiator under the window.'' Bilhuber's
headboard, which he now sells by special order, hides the radiator
in the bedroom it was designed for.
</P>
<P>
   With the headboard's new popularity, the choices of materials
are proliferating stylishly _ from John Hutton's wrapped wicker
Merbau for Donghia to Barbara Barry's cream-colored leather for
Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Large furniture manufacturers like Ethan Allen and Stickley
offer headboards without beds, as do smaller companies like John
Kelly Furniture Design, Park Furniture and Ted Boerner Furniture
Design. Purchased separately, headboards are less expensive _
generally 50 percent to 60 percent of the cost of full beds.
</P>
<P>
   Artists like Stephen Whisler, a New York sculptor, are
investigating the headboard as billboard, with furniture works like
his ``Thought and Speech'' headboard _ a maple plywood panel with
cartoon cut-outs of a thought bubble and a speech bubble, each
above its respective side of a bed _ a different kind of design
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always seems in a relationship that one does the talking
and the other one does the thinking,'' Whisler said.
</P>
<P>
   For many, the headboard is as much of a bed as is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier to use a headboard than find the right bed,'' said
Christopher Coleman, a New York decorator. ``Nobody uses a
footboard anymore. Most mattress companies give you a frame; you
just screw it on. It takes up less room, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend for statement headboards has been given a healthy push
by recent ``boutique hotel'' designs. William Sofield of Studio
Sofield has, by his estimate, designed more than 50, including
headboards for the SoHo Grand in New York and a woven leather and
gun-metal headboard for the Hard Rock Cafe Hotel in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels know that headboards work well in tight spaces, to
enhance decor and enable the bed to be used as a sitting surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the back of a sofa,'' said Christian Liaigre. ``The
feeling that one can sit and watch television or take breakfast.''
Liaigre designed two models for a recent project, the Mercer Hotel
in New York, including a low, linen-upholstered headboard based on
an English wing chair, that gently embraces the head of the bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It protects people when they sleep,'' he said. ``It's very
psychological.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Murphy, the vice president of Parish-Hadley Associates in
New York, found a more pragmatic reason for the popularity of
headboards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The king-size mania,'' he said. ``Even single people want a
king-size bed, which is really an ungainly shape. To do a
four-poster bed, for instance, you have to have a very high ceiling
to make it look at all elegant. Instead, you do a beautifully
shaped headboard, in a beautiful fabric.''
</P>
<P>
   King-size beds also complicate the issue for those who would
wish for a handsome antique. There aren't a lot of wonderful
antique beds that are large. ``I personally prefer sleeping in a
king-size bed,'' William Sofield said. ``But you're faced with few
options.''
</P>
<P>
   Sofield designed a headboard for himself. ``An extremely
built-in one,'' he explained, with compartments ``like `In' and
`Out' boxes, to organize myself. The bed is where I spend my few
waking hours at home _ taking notes for the next day, last-minute
ideas before I go to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   For others, the headboard is a straightforward solution to
stylistic confusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at all these different beds; I wanted something clean
and peaceful,'' recalled Martha McCully, the beauty director of
Allure magazine, of shopping for furniture for her house in East
Hampton, N.Y. ``A lot of older beds are fantasy-oriented. I got
sick of seeing carved, painted wood.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCully designed her own headboard instead _ a simple slab
of polished mahogany, which she had made at Richomme, a custom
furniture fabricator on Vestry Street in New York.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. McCully, the 47-inch high, queen-size headboard is also
a kind of vertical desk. She sits against it, with a laptop
computer.

   Custom headboards are not news to decorators; they are an
important tool of the trade.

   ``By designing a headboard, the bed can become a continuation of
the architecture of the room,'' said Christine Cain, a senior
associate at Jed Johnson and Associates.

 &HT;    Braves latest team to undertake Beanie Baby craze
 &HT;    Jeffry Scott
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the craziest buzz around the Atlanta Braves since Andruw
Jones got a bad haircut.
</P>
<P>
   And it's all about Beanie Babies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The switchboard has been ringing off the hook, and we've been
getting hit pretty hard with e-mails,'' said Miles McRea, the
team's senior director of promotions.
</P>
<P>
   It all started three weeks ago when the team announced it would
be giving away the Beanie Baby ``Chip the Cat'' to the first 12,000
youngsters who attend Wednesday's Braves game with the San
Francisco Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the team has sold another 10,000 tickets. On
Wednesday, the game was about 5,000 seats short of a sellout.
</P>
<P>
   That's no surprise to Braves and league officials, who have seen
Beanie Babies become one of the biggest draws in Major League
Baseball this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nineteen teams have had Beanie Baby giveaways, and they've
been a phenomenal success,'' said Mark Gorris, MLB's vice president
of team services.
</P>
<P>
   ``On average they've boosted attendance between 10,000 and
12,000 a game.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure they'd get into games before all the dolls were
snapped up, Beanie-crazed fans have camped overnight at stadium
gates. ``I was at a Texas Rangers game last week, and people were
in a line that went around the stadium three times,'' said Lori
Tomnitz, spokeswoman for Ty Inc., the maker of Beanie Babies.
</P>
<P>
   Braves officials say fans need not camp out by Turner Field. If
the 12,000 dolls are taken, they can tap an extra supply.
</P>
<P>
   The clamor for Chip the Cat comes despite the fact that the same
doll has been on sale for about $5 in stores for two years. Braves
officials are keeping their stash in ``safekeeping'' at an
undisclosed location.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves will limit the giveaways of Chip to youths 14 or
younger. ``They're not for adults,'' said McRae. ``This is a
promotion to get kids to come to games.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the dolls, kids will get an enlarged baseball
card of Braves's First Baseman Andres ``Big Cat'' Galarraga.
</P>
<P>
   The team has scheduled a second Beanie Baby night for Sept. 2,
when the Braves play the Houston Astros.

<P>
   In addition to strengthening decorative motifs or composition,
upholstered headboards are an opportunity to introduce fabrics or
unusual materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love things that are soft behind the head,'' said Keller
Donovan, a New York decorator who uses upholstered headboards
almost exclusively. ``Headboard fabric is another way of bringing
color and pattern into a room; it creates a focal point.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Mindel, a New York architect with Shelton, Mindel and
Associates, has used chenille on a custom headboard for a client,
and suede on a headboard for a guest bed in his own loft.
</P>
<P>
   Nice work, if you can get it done. The best headboard resources
for designers and decorators are largely to-the-trade only.
Businesses like Charles H. Beckley, Avery Boardman and Sanderson,
based in the Design and Decoration Building in New York, offer
dozens of standard, upholstered shapes, and wood beds with
headboard options _ if you are working with a professional.
</P>
<P>
   Waverly, a fabric company, makes custom headboards available to
the trade and several standard shapes are available at retail,
through its Waverly Home stores.
</P>
<P>
   Many furniture upholsterers also make headboards, as a part of
their service. Prices vary according to the amount of detail. A
modest queen-size design should be about $700; a king-size, $900.
The cost of the fabric, which the client supplies, is additional.
(In comparison, Spiegel's slip-covered velveteen headboard is $299
complete for a queen or king size. Barbara Barry's leather
headboard for Baker is $3,127 for a queen size; $3,896 for a king.)
</P>
<P>
   What should one know about having a headboard custom made?
</P>
<P>
   ``Use a hardwood frame; the most common is ash,'' said Claude
Mailloux, a fabricator at Ernest Studio in New York. ``For an
upholstered headboard, use a Dacron or foam fill _ not down; it
settles.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Melkun, the general manager of Bielecky Bros., a
furniture manufacturer, stressed one of a headboard design's most
important points: getting the height right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bedding height is not standard anymore,'' Melkun said.
``Measure at least 20 inches from the top of the bedding to the top
of the headboard.'' Total height will typically be about 42 inches.
``Remember, you're going to be losing some of that height with bed
linens,'' Melkun said. ``Forty-two inches isn't that excessive. It
tends to be the best level for reading or watching television. It
gives you the best back support. Your shoulders hit a comfortable
spot, not the top of the headboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Melkun recommended about 4 inches of padding in an upholstered
headboard. Bielecky Bros. will also sew an additional panel of
matching fabric to the top of a headboard, to hang behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can flip it forward to the front, to protect the
upholstered fabric,'' Melkun explained. ``As a antimacassar of
sorts. If the fabric is expensive _ and your husband's hair is
oily.''

<P>
   FISH CREEK, Wis. _ It came swooping across the stage just as the
police inspector made his entrance, a little black bat, wheeling
past the secret bookshelf compartment where the dead body was
stashed, paying no attention at all to the fact that there was a
murder investigation going on.
</P>
<P>
   An Agatha Christie murder investigation at that, the kind where
the actors must memorize rivers of rapid dialogue and quicksilver
twists of plot.
</P>
<P>
   The impromptu bat cameo was absorbed without a hitch, though, as
the inspector briskly ad-libbed ``Oh, I see you have a window
open,'' and turned back to the bloody deed at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody understands that bats are part of the package here on
the rustic pinky of land that is Wisconsin's Door Peninsula, bathed
by Green Bay on one side and Lake Michigan on the other. And
Peninsula Players, which calls itself the country's oldest
residential summer theater, has not survived for two-thirds of a
century by flouting the nature around it.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the theater insists on ingratiating itself physically,
artistically, even spiritually, with the shimmering water and the
velvet canopy of cedars sheathing its little promontory of land.
That approach is part of what has made Peninsula Players a thriving
stalwart in a genre that is fading from the American landscape: the
summer theater as part commune, part camp, where the cast and crew
spend every moment living, eating, working together.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years ago there were more than 100 summer stock theaters.
Many had their entire casts living on site for the summer, doing a
different show each week; some, particularly in the Northeast,
hired a star who played the leading role and who then moved on to
another resident theater company on what was known as the straw hat
circuit.
</P>
<P>
   But over the decades, theater changed. The big, splashy Broadway
musicals that became so popular were a tough fit for many summer
theaters _ too expensive and logistically untenable with their huge
choruses, multiple sets and costume changes, said Robert Bruyr,
executive assistant for member communication and education at
Actors Equity. Summer theaters found it hard to compete, especially
as production costs skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   Some summer theaters started playing year-round to accommodate
new audiences and save the cost of closing up for the winter. Some
scrapped their resident companies and played host to more transient
casts. Nowadays, while there are nearly 400 places to see a show in
the summertime, said Jill Charles, editor of the Summer Theater
Directory, there are only about a dozen places like Peninsula
Players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nature works very well with art,'' said Amy McKenzie, an
actress and director who grew up with Peninsula Players as the
daughter of one of the group's star actresses and the man who has
been its executive producer for nearly 30 years, James B. McKenzie.
``My commute to work is a half-mile old Indian path along Green
Bay. How can you be in a bad mood, whatever you might be obsessing
about? This whole place has been endowed like a prop, just like you
endow a prop as an actress on stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Atmosphere and attitude are so important here that actors,
directors, costume designers and others are chosen partly by how
well they can handle the rhythm and temperament of the place.
Everyone is expected at the dining hall when the breakfast, lunch
and dinner bells ring. Until recently no one had a private
bathroom. Some sleeping quarters are squeezed above the box office,
the set design workshop and the prop rooms. And telephones,
televisions and other bells and whistles are few and far between.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the only theater that I know of where talent is really
second to who you are,'' said Ms. McKenzie. ``You can be brilliant,
but if you don't know how to interact with people, then this isn't
the place for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Each year, after auditions for the summer season, Greg Vinkler,
the artistic director, decides which actors would be best for the
parts and then talks to people who know them, trying to find out
whether they are affable and easygoing enough to fit in in Fish
Creek.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call a lot of people and really grill them,'' Vinkler said.
``A few years ago, we had a fabulous actress up here. No problems
with her work onstage. But she had no interaction with people here.
She'd come get her meal and go back to her room. It's a fine line.
We try to let everyone be themselves, but they have to get along
with people. It's a huge part of our decision-making process.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet with unusual consistency for a summer theater, Peninsula
Players has also managed to pull together exceptionally talented
casts, including some of the top actors in Chicago, one of the most
exuberant theater towns in the country. Auditions, held each year
in Chicago, a good five-hour drive from Fish Creek, always brim
with about 300 people.
</P>
<P>
   This year's 11-member cast includes three winners of Joseph
Jefferson awards, Chicago's version of the Tony, and actors who
have starred in or directed productions at the city's best
theaters, Steppenwolf, the Goodman, Shakespeare Repertory. The star
of the first two plays of the season, Sarah Underwood, 34, had a
major role in the national touring company of ``Angels in
America.'' Another actor, Howard Platt, 59, has had regular roles
in sitcoms like ``The Bob Newhart Show,'' ``Sanford and Son'' and
``Evening Shade,'' and will be producing and directing a revival in
New York of ``A Couple of Blaguards,'' written by Frank and Malachy
McCourt.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Peninsula Players' production of the London hit
``The Woman in Black'' was so well received that it was brought to
Chicago for a winter run.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Gold, 40, an actress and New Yorker who knew nothing about
Peninsula Players, having moved to Chicago this year to teach
acting at Northwestern University, was expecting what she called a
typical summer stock experience: ``20-year-olds having all these
crises. One big gland.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she said, offering a visitor the bug spray she carries
with her here, while she is ``not a nature gal,'' she has delighted
in the ``tremendous opportunities for acting'' and ``people who
know what timing is.''
</P>
<P>
   Like any theater, Peninsula Players has to please its audience,
in this case the summer vacation crowd that surges into Fish Creek
(which has a year-round population of about 300) to take advantage
of the Door Peninsula's charming combination of rugged seacoast,
family farms, lush wooded trails and a vibrant artistic community
that has sprung up around the Peninsula Players over the last few
decades. Audiences expect a certain amount of tradition from a
theater that began in 1935 in a small Fish Creek motel and has been
on this 15-acre site, a former boys' camp, since 1937.
</P>
<P>
   The performances don't start until dark, so as not to interrupt
the pleasure of some of the regular patrons, who come before the
show to picnic, stroll through the day lilies and trilliums in the
garden and lazily watch the kaleidoscopic sunsets over the bay from
Adirondack chairs. As the audience files into the open-sided
auditorium, with its sagging canvas director's chairs for seats,
bug spray is as readily available as programs for the night's show.
Even the posters have stayed the same _ yellow and green on white _
after an attempt at a splashy four-color number proved too dramatic
a change for patrons.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, audiences have seen a few famous names _ Sam
Wanamaker, Harvey Korman _ before they were famous. But they also
have lesser-known favorites, like Bob Thompson, now 81, who has
acted with the theater since 1938, appearing in everything from the
1957 production of ``Inherit the Wind'' (when monkeys in the play
escaped from their cages) to the recent performance of ``On Golden
Pond.'' Thompson routinely gets applause when he walks on stage.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the shows are calibrated for a common-denominator
audience, like this year's musical, ``The Fantasticks,'' and under
the theory that any Agatha Christie play packs them in, ``Spider's
Web.''
</P>
<P>
   But the theater also has to please its high-caliber cast, which
rehearses one play during the day while performing another at
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that we couldn't get the good-quality actors to come
up here if they came up and did one silly British sex farce after
another,'' said Todd Schmidt, the general manager.
</P>
<P>
   This season, there is only one British farce, ``Tons of Money,''
about a man who fakes his death and pretends to be his cousin so he
can inherit his own fortune.
</P>
<P>
   And there is always an actors' favorite. This season, it is
``Rain,'' a drama based on the W. Somerset Maugham story about the
relationship between a strait-laced minister and a vamp on a
tropical island. While playing loopy British blue-bloods in
``Spider's Web'' at night, the actors rehearsed Maugham's lush tale
of lust and sin in Polynesia during the day. The company wasn't
able to perform ``Rain'' for more than two weeks because, Schmidt
said, ``financially, we know we couldn't sustain it. It just
wouldn't draw the audience.''
</P>
<P>
   The theater also tries to do new plays, often scheduling them
for the last four weeks of the season, the sleepier post-summertime
stretch from September to October. This year's will be ``Romance in
D,'' a new romantic comedy by James Sherman, who wrote ``Beau
Jest.''
</P>
<P>
   And Peninsula Players often gets an early crack at the rights to
Broadway shows because it is so far off the beaten track that
there's no chance of competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people,'' said Ms. McKenzie, ``say Fish Hook, where?''
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, Peninsula Players has felt the inexorable
pull of the modern age tugging at its barnlike buildings and
rough-hewn setting. This year, the theater invested in
walkie-talkies so that staff members could communicate without
standing next to each other. More significantly, the theater
recently built new housing for the actors, simple wooden apartments
with private bathrooms. A new septic system was added, along with
new public restrooms and expanded rehearsal and storage space.
</P>
<P>
   But in some ways, Peninsula Players is sticking to tradition.
With ``Rain,'' for example, Vinkler, the director, considered ways
to simulate the constant precipitation of the rainy season in Pago
Pago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have rigged it up so the rain came gushing down over
a trough,'' Vinkler said. ``But then I said, `Let's not have real
rain at all. Let's have sound instead.' It was more important to
get the set up rather than kill ourselves over a special effect.''
</P>
<P>
   And after a couple of seasons of performing big, popular
Broadway shows _ ``Guys and Dolls,'' ``Amadeus,'' ``Crazy for You''
_ with multiple sets and huge casts, the Peninsula Players has
returned to more bite-size productions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought, `Let's do what they do in New York,''' Vinkler
said. ``But I've come to realize that we can't do that. We don't
have the set, the resources or the time. So this year the biggest
cast is 11, and it's all one set. We should do the kinds of things
we do best.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt chimed in: ``For the sanity of everybody here.''

   ``Following Jesus Without Embarrassing God''
</P>
<P>
   By Tony Campolo
</P>
<P>
   Word, $12.99
</P>
<P>
   Here's the trouble with ``Following Jesus Without Embarrassing
God:'' For every time that you want to cock an eyebrow and say to
Tony Campolo, ``Maybe we better think that one over again'' (and
there are indeed such instances), he can say the same thing to you
about six times on half a dozen topics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which of us can deny that, even as we are trying to follow
Jesus, we sometimes behave in ways which must make God and
Christianity seem ridiculous to those outside the faith?'' the
Eastern College sociologist asks. What follows is advice on how to
(among other things) talk about prayer without making God look bad,
be politically involved without losing your soul, and be sexually
attractive without being obscene.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have heard this intense Italian-American speak know
that his words can be entertaining and pointed, and ``Following
Jesus Without Embarrassing God'' only furthers that reputation.
Agree with his arguments or don't _ either way, Campolo will make
readers think twice, and maybe even thrice.

<P>
   ``When God's Children Get Together''
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi Children's Choir
</P>
<P>
   Malaco Records
</P>
<P>
   The Mississippi Children's Choir was formed in 1990 to open for
the world-famous Mississippi Mass Choir _ then flourished on its
own. Since 1992, the choir has released three CDs, the first two of
which have done very well on the national gospel charts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When God's Children Get Together'' is the third, and it should
do at least as well as the second effort, 1994's ``A New
Creation,'' which sold nearly 100,000 copies. Once again, the MCC
(which has more than 200 members, all ages 7 to 17), has a strong
selection of mainly traditional-sounding songs, and once again,
there's a nice balance of tempos and old-sounding and more modern
instrumentation.
</P>
<P>
   What is most impressive, though, is the variety of strong
soloists, and how smartly the songs are arranged to show off their
talents and the choir's power. Felicia Brister, for example, powers
the group through the quietly building ``All We Have;'' the more
modern-sounding, funk-oriented ``I'm Blessed'' features an assured
vocal from Onitsha Shaw and, near the end, a rap from Dathan
Thigpen.
</P>
<P>
   At times, it is extremely hard to believe that these are high
school kids, so assured are their vocals. But that is often the joy
of hearing young people perform: They don't know they're not
supposed to be as good as they are, so they just go ahead and do it
anyway. That's certainly the case here.

   Different Way to Look At the Browser Wars
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom says Netscape is the rabbit and
Microsoft is the tortoise in the race to create the dominant
browser, albeit a large, extremely powerful tortoise that is
gaining rapidly. But a new survey puts the browser race into a
different light.
</P>
<P>
   Positive Support Review, a Web design and consulting company in
Los Angeles, has found that, by one measure anyway, Microsoft
Internet Explorer has a greater share of the browser market and
that Netscape's Navigator browser is now the one playing catch up.
</P>
<P>
   Positive Support Review's atypical conclusion is based on
measuring market share in a different way: instead of looking at
the absolute number of people who use a given browser, looking at
how much time they spend using the respective browsers.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, which looked at 450,000 hits a month at a broad
range of Web sites, found that visitors used Microsoft 55 percent
of the time in July, up from 42 percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Microsoft has taken the lead in usage patterns, there is
a recent bit of good news for Netscape, said Victor Janulaitis,
chief executive of Positive Support Review. Janulaitis said
Netscape had been gaining, which he attributed to people
gravitating to the latest release of its browser.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in July, usage of Microsoft dropped from a peak of 62
percent. ``Up until last month, it had been a steady climb,'' he
said. ``Microsoft won't be happy about the last month.''
</P>
<P>
   Janulaitis said Positive Support Review (www.psrinc.com)
undertook the project so it could tell its Web design customers
whether to focus on features for Netscape Navigator or Internet
Explorer. The company also plans to charge $299 for the complete
survey results. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New Search Engine Is Placing Its Focus Outside U.S. Borders &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It may be the World Wide Web, but more than half of the activity
and traffic on the Web is based in the United States. A growing
number of search engines are emerging that emphasize regions
outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   One such engine comes from Black Box (www.theblackbox.com),
based in Hong Kong, which is the creator of the Orientation Asia
and Orientation search engines for Africa, Central and Eastern
Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, it went live with Orientation Middle East, which
offers news updates, discussion groups and hot links pertaining to
15 nations in that region.
</P>
<P>
   Orientation's creators say their search engines differ
fundamentally from most search engines based in the United States
because they search for Web sites with a regional bias. The engine
weights its response to search inquiries in favor of Web pages that
originate from a given region, said Phil Ingram, marketing manager
for Black Box.
</P>
<P>
   The site culls its news from local sources and employs local
stringers to search for and rate sites of regional interest in the
hopes of becoming a regional portal, or point-of-entry, to the Web.
The site is also capable of searching in native languages, even if
the characters are not derived from the Roman alphabet.
</P>
<P>
   Black Box is not alone. A growing number of region-centric
search engines and traditional search engines, like Yahoo, are also
expanding their regional news and Web offerings. Black Box says one
of the advantages offered by its Orientation sites is a particular
sensitivity to local cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, however, the front page of Orientation Africa offered
a less-than-sensitive reader poll that asked visitors whether they
thought the Hutu rebels in Rwanda should be forgiven, hanged or
shot.
</P>
<P>
   Ingram, when informed of the poll, said it would be immediately
removed. ``The polls are meant to be a little tongue-in-cheek,'' he
said. ``But that one has to come down right away.'' &QL;

   Textbooks for Sale Online Are Aimed at College Students &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   College students will soon be able to order their textbooks from
the warm confines of their dorm rooms. On Monday, Varsity Books
(www2.varsitybooks.com/textbookclub/index.asp) went live with a
site that permits students to order textbooks on line in an
academic version of Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the site has reading lists for specific courses only
for colleges in the Washington area, but the company plans to add
schools nationwide for the spring semester.
</P>
<P>
   Varsity Books, a start-up backed by private investors, said it
would get the class reading lists from schools nationwide so
students with credit cards could just log on and click on their
colleges to find out what books they needed to read. For now,
students can search the site for individual books.
</P>
<P>
   The company is marketing its service as a way to avoid lines at
the campus book store while saving money. It says it can deliver
textbooks in as few as two days. Now, if the company could figure
out how to send along pizza. ... &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Offering Old-Fashioned Values For Teen-Agers Using the Web &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No sex? No violence? No computer hackers?
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely not, says Ira Kaufman of Legacy International, a
nonprofit organization that develops leadership skills among
promising teen-agers. Kaufman is director of a new Web-based
project at Legacy that is scheduled to go live on the Internet
today.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman wants the site (www.legacyintl.org) to use the latest
technology to promote old-fashioned values and to help teen-agers
on line develop a sense of community. The site has several facets:
free Web design for teen-agers, global chat rooms, a program that
helps visitors volunteer in their local communities and an
entertainment area that lets visitors download rock, jazz and other
music.
</P>
<P>
   A more unusual component is yet to come. The site will soon
start a life-simulation game
(www.globalrewards.org/ggame/index.html) designed to show
teen-agers how their lives might turn out, based choices they make.
Four teen-agers, who won a contest on Yahoo, will help design the
simulation with consulting help from the Rand Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq, Hewlett Packard and Earth Link were among those
companies that donated $80,000 in cash and equipment to help get
the Legacy site up and running. Kaufman said the general idea was
to give teen-agers an alternative to nefarious influences on the
Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the alternatives cater to the darker side of things,''
Kaufman said. ``We're trying to give them a lighter side _ we want
them to be conscious that there are choices.''  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You Can Let Your Smile Be Your Security Password &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Your password can be stolen, but only you have access to your
body.
</P>
<P>
   That's the general philosophy behind the technology that uses
fingerprints, facial features and other physical markers as a basis
for entry or access. Now a new application of this technology has
come to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Miros (www.Miros.com), a biometrics company in
Wellesley, Mass., is shipping the first copies of True Face Web
($199 each for 1 to 25 users). The software is intended to permit
access to secure Web servers only to those who have registered
their faces on the server.
</P>
<P>
   The software works in conjunction with a camera, measuring the
shapes of a person's facial features and, more significant, the
relationships between those shapes, said Michael Kuperstein, chief
executive of Miros.
</P>
<P>
   ``It works the same way babies recognize faces,'' he said. ``It
looks at the gestalt, the holistic pattern of the face.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuperstein knows a thing or two about measuring people's mugs.
Face-recognition software made by Miros is already used to guard
transactions at 150 automatic teller machines in the South and
West. Several companies are testing Miros face-recognition software
as a way to protect access to internal company networks.
</P>
<P>
   The process has several steps. A camera on top of _ or inside _
a monitor takes your picture, which the software loaded on your
computer analyzes and sends to a secure server at, for example, an
online brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   When you want access to your personal account, you sit in front
of the monitor for another picture. That image is then matched
against the already stored record.
</P>
<P>
   Kuperstein, who has a PhD in neuroscience from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, said that the software could not be fooled
by a photograph and would be unlikely to mistake one person for
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't differentiate between twins,'' he said. ``But how
many evil twins are out there who are going to perpetrate a crime
against their twin?''

TREASURY SECURITIES GAIN AS INVESTORS SEEK HAVENS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Treasury securities turned slightly lower Wednesday,
as the dollar fell against the yen before steadying itself, making
dollar-denominated investments like government securities less
attractive to foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   Also putting some pressure on bonds was the Treasury's $11
billion auction of new 10-year notes, which followed a
disappointing auction of five-year notes on Tuesday. Wednesday's
auction results turned out to be not as good as hoped.
</P>
<P>
   A third factor was that the stock market showed signs of
recovery, easing the flight to bonds. Still, bonds held fast after
a manufacturing report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta
suggested that the nation's economic growth was slowing and
inflation was subdued.
</P>
<P>
   By late in the day, the 30-year bond was down a half-point to a
price of 107 1/32, while the yield, which moves in the opposite
direction, rose to 5.63 percent, from 5.60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers and traders expect the market to remain uncertain
through the Treasury auctions this week as investors may be wary
not only of the 10-year note Wednesday but also the 30-year bond
Thursday, since everything is currently at the high side of the
recent price range.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, even though many people believe the dollar will
strengthen again and the Asian markets will get worse before they
get better, the 10-year issue was awarded at a price to yield 5.428
percent, a little behind what was hoped for, traders said.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Burtnick, managing analyst with Thomson Global Markets,
said Wednesday's auction, because it was a reopening of an existing
issue of 10-year notes, was considered a dealer-driven event,
rather than one for smaller investors. ``It was better for those
wanting to buy large amounts without moving the market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market behaved well late in day because of a rumor that
the Russian ruble might be devalued, which spurred a late flight to
quality into Treasuries,'' he said. ``Regarding tomorrow's auction
of 30-year bonds, the closer we get to a yield of 5.50 percent on
the long bond, the harder it is to sell. Dealers might have to
cheapen the issue to make it more attractive.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ MTV wants to reassure the city of New York that it
doesn't have anything against it. When the cable network announced
its annual Video Music Awards on Tuesday, some eyebrows were raised
by word that the awards, which have been held in New York for the
last four years, are being shifted to Los Angeles. The decision had
particular resonance because of the transfer of next year's Grammy
Awards from New York to Los Angeles after the event's organizers
squabbled with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   But Marnie Jakubowski-Malter, a spokeswoman for MTV, said that
the network simply decided ``to switch things around'' to keep the
event fresh. ``We made our decision well before that Grammy
thing,'' she said, adding, ``We love New York.'' The awards will be
held Sept. 10 at the Universal Amphitheater. The actor Ben Stiller
will be the host.
</P>
<P>
   Marsalis Immemorial
</P>
<P>
   He's had hit albums and won a Pulitzer Prize, but the latest
honor bestowed on the jazz trumpeter Wynton Marsalis may top the
lot: His music is being set in stone. Thursday, in the small town
of Marciac in the south of France, officials are expected to unveil
14 stone engravings, each etched with a page of Marsalis' ``Marciac
Suite,'' which he composed last year in honor of the town's annual
jazz festival. Marsalis, who will perform there Thursday, said he
had attended the festival for the last 18 years. ``I love it,'' he
said. ``I like the food, the sunshine, the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Philologically Fertile
</P>
<P>
   It may be a hippy-dippy attempt at spin by a bunch of Blairite
mouse potatoes, but the editors of the New Oxford Dictionary of
English are calling the edition to be published Thursday the most
important in years. The dictionary includes some 2,000 new words
and phrases _ including those used above _ and took six years to
compile.
</P>
<P>
   Helen McManners, a spokeswoman for Oxford University Press, told
Agence France-Presse that the project cost $4.8 million and was the
first edition written from scratch in more than 70 years. In
addition to Blairite (of Tony Blair, the English prime minister)
and mouse potato (a consistent computer user), the dictionary
includes new definitions for some of the old words. It weighs over
six pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Uncovered, Again
</P>
<P>
   For the last two years, visitors to the Pergamon Museum in
Berlin have found one of the museum's principal attractions, the
Pergamon Altar, under an unsightly scaffold. But on Tuesday, a
newly renovated altar began to emerge, as museum officials unveiled
a third of the ancient Hellenic frieze. The altar, which stands 7
feet high and dates to 180 B.C., was excavated in Asia Minor by
German archeologists in the late 19th century and transported to
Berlin in 1902. The renovation is expected to take three more
years.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the steering winds of the jet stream almost completely
locked over Canada, the lethargy of the current weather pattern
across the contiguous states will persist.
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of showers and thunderstorms will bubble up along and
south of a stalled front spanning east from the southern Plains to
the Carolina seaboard. Near the western edge of the front,
temperatures at Dallas will likely stay below 100 degrees as clouds
and perhaps sluggish showers develop. Farther east, slow-moving
storms will raise the risk of flash flooding in a few areas over
the Deep South as lethargic winds aloft promote slow-moving
thunderstorms.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in the absence of energetic high-altitude winds,
thunderstorms will generally stay below severe limits, except for a
single renegade storm or two that will produce large hail and gusty
surface winds. Over Florida, isolated strong storms will erupt,
mainly in association with sea breeze fronts forging inland from
the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Late-afternoon and evening thunderstorms will flare over the
high ground of the Southwest as tropical moisture holds steady.
Storms will then drift westward from mountains over Arizona and
southern California. Farther north, heat will continue to build
across the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Generally low humidity will prevail across the Northeast as
Canadian high pressure ridges south from Quebec. Temperatures will
average near or slightly below seasonal levels. Meanwhile, clouds
and a few showers will gather in the western Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: A Memorable Trace
</P>
<P>
   The lyrics of a popular song proclaim that it never rains in
southern California. At Bakersfield in the San Joaquin Valley,
these lyrics have long rung true on August 11. On Tuesday evening,
however, a trace of rain was observed, marking Bakersfield's first
rainfall on August 11 since weather records began in 1938. Earlier
on Tuesday, moist air resting atop the high Sierra was heated,
becoming buoyant compared to surrounding cool air. In turn, heated
air rose rapidly, forming thunderstorms. As the decaying remnants
of one storm drifted west, it brought a trace of rain to
Bakersfield.
</P>
<P>
   Extended Forecast Text for Thursday
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Sunday: The Northeast will be seasonably warm with
some afternoon thunderstorms as a weak cool front moves across the
region. The Southeast will stay very warm and humid with scattered
afternoon thunder. Clusters of thunderstorms will bring locally
heavy rain to parts of the southern Plains while northern areas
stay very warm with isolated thunder. Most of the West will stay
hot, but the Northwest will turn much cooler.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Tuesday: Dry and seasonal conditions will be followed by
a warming trend in the Northeast. The Southeast will be sultry with
clusters of slow-moving thunderstorms. Potent thunder will develop
in the hot air over the northern Plains, while southern sections
have seasonable heat. The Rockies will stay very warm with isolated
mountain thunderstorms. The Pacific Northwest will be cool and
mainly dry. The Southwest will stay hot.

   ``The Legend of Sleeping Bear''
</P>
<P>
   Author: Kathy-jo Wargin
</P>

   Publisher: Sleeping Bear Press
</P>
<P>
   Cost: $16.96
</P>

   Ages: All
</P>
<P>
   If you are the kind of parent who weeps at Kodak moments, ``The
Legend of Sleeping Bear'' will bring more than a tear to your eye.
The people who normally tease you will probably be moved, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legend'' is a gentle retelling of the Indian legend of the
great mother bear who sleeps on the shores of Lake Michigan. Driven
by a forest fire to swim across the lake with her two small cubs,
the mother bear exhorts her children to keep swimming. They swim
all day, the mother constantly looking back to check on the cubs'
progress. Night falls, and still she looks for them. When the sun
rises, her cubs are gone.
</P>
<P>
   The mother bear reaches the shore, where she begins pacing up
and down at the water's edge. ``My children, can you hear me? I
will wait for you forever,'' she shouts into the wind.
</P>
<P>
   And she does. The seasons come and go, but the mother bear will
not be moved. After a time, the ``great spirit of the land'' sees
her devotion and rewards it in a most marvelous way.
</P>
<P>
   The way this book rewards you _ in a most marvelous way.

AN ARTIST ASKS: WHAT WOULD MALIBU LOOK LIKE WITHOUT THE HOUSES? 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Jantzen, a California designer and conceptual artist,
was driving down the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu one day when
he had an unusual vision. ``I was looking at all the ugly houses
blocking the view of the ocean,'' he said, ``and I thought,
wouldn't it be nice to see the ocean on the facade?''
</P>
<P>
   The result _ a millennial flight of fantasy yet to be built _ is
the world's first video beach house, in which the 50-year-old
designer grapples with an existential question: What would it be
like to live in a Web site?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to present some possibilities of what we might do
with all these new toys,'' said the designer, who lives in a normal
apartment in El Segundo, Calif., and is an instructor at the Art
Center College of Design in Pasadena. ``I'm interested in the idea
of changeable, responsive architecture.''
</P>
<P>
   Jantzen's concept for a beach house takes the idea of a video
wall to its logical conclusion. Although video images have become a
part of everyday life, from theme restaurants to virtual biking,
Jantzen advocates going one step further. In what is perhaps an
architectural critic's dream, a ho-hum building could seem to
disappear. In this case, video monitors pointing toward the ocean
in the back of the house provide images of waves and sky that are
projected onto the front of the house. The images could be
manipulated by the homeowner. ``If it's cloudy,'' Jantzen said,
``you could put on a prerecorded sunny day from the day before.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, reality and virtual reality might frolic with each
other. Cameras situated around the house would send real-time
images to video ``windows.'' A virtual bonfire would be surrounded
by real logs. In a double-height atrium with skylights, Jantzen
proposes a wood-plank boardwalk suspended over real sand. Part of
the boardwalk would incorporate a flat video monitor displaying
images of fish. The planks would lead the homeowner, or others who
dare to tread, to a real indoor pool. ``The idea is to let the
beach experience flow into the house, both in reality and through
media,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To Jantzen, the ability to morph both real and virtual images
will be part of the house of the future, as will the ability to
visit a home as if it were a home page. The concept includes access
through the Internet. ``You could put your 3-D glasses on and go
for a walk on the beach,'' he suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Jantzen's previous conceptual designs include a backyard office
pod, a module for working outside. In real life, he has designed,
among other things, numerous solar houses and a climbing structure
for children modeled on DNA for the Hall of Science at the
University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Technologically, he said, the video beach house is doable _ at
what price he didn't know. ``The only way to find out is to build
it,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He said he believes in the potential of technology to create
more humane, responsive architecture. He does not picture house
fronts with projected images of Bruce Willis writ large, he said,
but rather houses that would reflect images of ``what the site
would look like if the house wasn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   If it were to be built, Jantzen's beach house would be able to
bring the Malibu way of life to the masses (though he has yet to
invent a virtual lifeguard). In addition to Internet access, videos
placed throughout the house could project images from the interior
onto the facade.
</P>
<P>
   The implications for the Hamptons alone are earth-shattering.
``You could have a party sometime and include everybody,'' Jantzen
said.

ALASKANS SAY GLOBAL WARMING IS AFFECTING THEIR WAY OF LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NICOLE TSONG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Global warming is not making some people in the
nation's coldest state happy.
</P>
<P>
   As higher temperatures melt some of the ice in Alaska, natives
who live in or near the Arctic Circle said here Wednesday they are
worried that their way of life will disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling Golongergen, 43, a community development worker in
Savoonga, an island town in the Bering Sea, said at a news
conference that as the ice melts, hunting gets more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two sons who are being taught, hands on, by their
father, uncles (and other elders) to hunt walrus, seal, whale,
birds and fish,'' she said. ``But this year the ice packs left
sooner. There was very little game for them to hunt, (which) cut
short our food supply'' and the time that her sons had to learn
``how to continue this way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``We do not really understand the science or the
politics of environmental change, but it affects our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   John Kulowiyi, 76, a whaling captain also from Savoonga, said
ice around the village is slowly getting thinner year-round.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never go out (to hunt) this year by walking on the ice,''
he said. ``It's too dangerous for us.''
</P>
<P>
   So in order to hunt, the men must travel 50 to 80 miles from the
village, which makes the trips expensive for them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Amy ``Kalee'' Kreider, director of the U.S. global warming
campaign for Greenpeace, an environmental organization which
sponsored the news conference, said, ``In most of the lower 48
states, ice is seen as bad. That's not the way things are seen in
Alaska.''
</P>
<P>
   A new report on global climate change released by Greenpeace
said that as the seas warm up and glaciers melt, animals such as
walruses seals, and caribous move north to colder temperatures.
These animals are a staple food for villagers in the Bering and
Chukchi Seas region near Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   The report said some plants are dying as tundra dries out
because permafrost, ground that is frozen all year, is thawing and
water is draining off. Kreider also said the pesky sprucebark
beetle has moved further north as temperatures climb. She said it
has already ``devastated a huge swathe of forest in southern Alaska
(and) ... as far north as Fairbanks.''
</P>
<P>
   The report cited interviews with natives in eight villages in
the Bering and Chukchi Seas.
</P>
<P>
   Kreider said Greenpeace expects Congress to hold hearings in
January on the Alaskan climate change and that some of the people
quoted in the report will testify.
</P>
<P>
   She urged U.S. approval of the so-called Kyoto Protocol, an
accord reached by negotiators around the world last December that
would require industrial nations to make significant cuts in carbon
dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions by 2012.
</P>
<P>
   The Greenpeace report noted that the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change, a group of 1,600 climate scientists from around the
world, said Arctic sea ice has decreased 2.8 percent each decade
since the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also said that upper Arctic ice, which had been 2
meters (6 1/2 feet) to 3 meters (just under 9 feet) thick, now
averages about 1.5 meters (under 5 feet) or less.

   ``The Legend of Sleeping Bear''
</P>
<P>
   Author: Kathy-jo Wargin
</P>
<P>
   Publisher: Sleeping Bear Press
</P>
<P>
   Cost: $16.96
</P>
<P>
   Ages: All
</P>
<P>
   If you are the kind of parent who weeps at Kodak moments, ``The
Legend of Sleeping Bear'' will bring more than a tear to your eye.
The people who normally tease you will probably be moved, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legend'' is a gentle retelling of the Indian legend of the
great mother bear who sleeps on the shores of Lake Michigan. Driven
by a forest fire to swim across the lake with her two small cubs,
the mother bear exhorts her children to keep swimming. They swim
all day, the mother constantly looking back to check on the cubs'
progress. Night falls, and still she looks for them. When the sun
rises, her cubs are gone.
</P>
<P>
   The mother bear reaches the shore, where she begins pacing up
and down at the water's edge. ``My children, can you hear me? I
will wait for you forever,'' she shouts into the wind.
</P>
<P>
   And she does. The seasons come and go, but the mother bear will
not be moved. After a time, the ``great spirit of the land'' sees
her devotion and rewards it in a most marvelous way.
</P>
<P>
   The way this book rewards you _ in a most marvelous way.

GRILLING IN THE GLOBAL VILLAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 JILL WENDHOLT SILVA  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) _ Shortly after moving from Boston to Miami, Steven
Raichlen was lounging in an Adirondack chair next to his grill when
he had ``one of those little moments of epiphany.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not, he thought, ``see the world through grilling?''
</P>
<P>
   An award-winning author of 16 cookbooks, Raichlen had long been
fascinated by the world's oldest, simplest and most primal method
of cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next three years he traveled the ``global barbecue
belt,'' logging 150,000 miles and visiting 25 countries on five
continents. He spent another year testing recipes for The Barbecue!
Bible (Workman, $18.95), a hefty collection of more than 500 global
grilling recipes that transports readers from the steak houses of
Buenos Aires to the satay stalls of Bali.
</P>
<P>
   Raichlen's brush with live-fire cooking included eating shrimp
cooked on ember-filled hubcaps in Vietnam and vegetables seared on
infrared gas grills in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   He still swoons at the memory of picanha, a prime cut of sirloin
served at churrascarias in Brazil, or Caribbean jerk pork seasoned
with hot Scotch bonnet peppers and allspice.
</P>
<P>
   To re-create the global grilling recipes he sampled, Raichlen
takes notes, makes sketches and tries to ``fix a taste, flavor and
preparation in my mind, then figure out how to get the same
results.''
</P>
<P>
   After tasting the haunting, smoky grilled escargot at L'Hostal
in Castellnou, France, Raichlen could have sworn he tasted curry.
But when he interviewed the chef he discovered the snails were fed
bunches of thyme before being cooked over grapevine trimmings.
</P>
<P>
   Although cooks can't buy live snails in the United States,
Raichlen was indeed able to duplicate the flavor using curry, a bit
of lard and a sprinkling of shallots, garlic and thyme chopped so
finely they would blow away if you breathed too hard.
</P>
<P>
   At each stop on his tour Raichlen relied on local cooking
experts, embassy officials and taxi drivers to steer him to the
best restaurants. From there he would branch out to the central
markets, stalls and street vendors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love street culture, street food and that kind of
in-your-face experience,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But in countries where social and political unrest made travel
impossible, such as Afghanistan, Iran and Iraq, Raichlen relied on
interviews and recipes with expatriates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risks I took were of the gastronomic sort,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   One of his riskier meals was at an Esarn (northeastern Thai)
restaurant. He began to worry when he realized the fly-infested
kitchen overlooked a stagnant canal. Still, he ate with the gusto
befitting the guest of honor and was pleasantly surprised when he
didn't get sick.
</P>
<P>
   Raichlen speaks French and Spanish with a smattering of Italian,
Portuguese and German thrown in. In countries where he didn't speak
the language he hired local interpreters. When no interpreter was
available he used his past cookbooks and a bit of pantomime to
communicate.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in Korea a cook wrote down a recipe and the
concierge at the hotel translated it into English. In Brazil, a
butcher pulled out a diagram of a steer to illustrate exactly where
the picanha came from.
</P>
<P>
   Raichlen's culinary travels also included pit stops throughout
the U.S., and his book includes a section on Kansas City-style
barbecue. There's a recipe for Lil' Jake's wings and mention of not
one but two Kansas City restaurants on his top 25 grilling
emporiums and barbecue joints list (Arthur Bryant's and Lil'
Jakes).
</P>
<P>
   But there were a few editing glitches that local barbecue buffs
will find hard to swallow. Raichlen places Kansas City on the
Mississippi rather than the Missouri River, and he ignores the
state line, referring to ``Kansans.''
</P>
<P>
   Locals may also bristle at Raichlen's use of the words
``barbecue'' and ``grilling'' as if interchangeable. (Grilling is a
quick-cooking method done over direct heat. Barbecue is a
slow-cooking method over indirect heat.)
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a lot of true barbecue in other countries, except
the Caribbean and Mexico,'' Raichlen says. ``It's only in the U.S.
that you'll find (barbecue) purists. What's interesting about the
U.S. is that we have the tradition of both grilling and barbecue.''
</P>
<P>
   The word ``barbecue'' in the title was the publisher's decision.
But Raichlen acknowledges the title has probably helped sales.
</P>
<P>
   And whether you call it grilling or barbecue, ``it's a religion
for a lot of people,'' he says. ``They really approach it with
religious fervor, and that's what I love about it.''

   &UR; SILENCE IS GOLDEN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Three monks were meditating in the Himalayas to be away from the
maddening crowds.
</P>
<P>
   One year passed in silence and the first monk said, `Pretty cold
here.'
</P>
<P>
   Another year passed in silence and the second one said, `You
know, you're quite right.'
</P>
<P>
   Another year passed and the third one said, `Look, I'm gonna
quit unless you two stop bitching!'
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WOMEN WITH GUNS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   While a Texan was busily preparing for the first day of deer
hunting season, his wife started nagging that he never asked her to
go along. After several hours of argument the wife won.
</P>
<P>
   That next morning they drove out to the country, and he placed
his wife in a tree about 100 yards from his blind. Just as the
hunter reached the blind, he heard a loud bang coming from the
wife's position.
</P>
<P>
   As he ran up to her, he saw that she was holding her gun on a
man nearby and shouting, `It's my deer! Get away from It!!'
</P>
<P>
   The sheepish-looking stranger just nodded slowly and said, `OK,
lady.. It's your deer. Just let me get my saddle off of it!'
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLAT TIRE EXAM &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Two college seniors had a week of exams coming up. They decided
to party instead. Their biggest exam was on Wednesday and they
showed up telling the professor that their car had broken down the
night before due to a very flat tire and they needed a bit more
time to study.
</P>
<P>
   The professor told them that they could have another day to
study. That evening, both of the boys crammed all night until they
were sure that they knew just about everything.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving to class the next morning, each boy was told to go to
two separate classrooms to take the exam. Each boy just shrugged
and went to two different parts of the building.
</P>
<P>
   As each sat down, they read the directions:
</P>
<P>
   `For 5 points, explain the contents of an atom. For 95 points,
tell me WHICH tire it was!'

   ``Have you seen the graph that shows you the trading on the
Stock Market? Man, it looked like President Clinton's lie detector

<P>
   Mr. Clinton is on the road for part of this week. No, it's
mostly a political trip, not Starr-approved work-release.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Congress want Ken Starr to file an impeachment
report so the matter can be settled quickly. Well, plus they want
to read about Monica's dress.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way out if we start running away from this kind of
conduct,'' Mr. Clinton said this week. No, he was talking about
fighting terrorism, not Starrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Aunt Ilse from Oelwein says if Starr submits an impeachment
report to Congress it will get much higher readership if it
includes pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton's grand jury testimony will be via closed-circuit
TV. That's probably how he should spend any future time with White
House interns.

<P>
   A simple onion sandwich has its virtues
</P>
<P>
   It was the sheer simplicity of the sandwich that caught our
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Gather members of the Association of Food Journalists for an
annual conference and the eating can become, well, lavish.
</P>
<P>
   In the name of research, we often end up sharing one rich meal
... after another ... after another.
</P>
<P>
   Treadmill, anyone?
</P>
<P>
   But a tribute to James Beard luncheon at the Red Star Tavern and
Roast House in downtown Portland, Ore., proved a welcome respite
from our sometimes overzealous consumption of salmon, hazelnuts and
fresh Marionberries (a cross between the Chehalem and Olallieberry
blackberries, not to be confused with a certain Washington, D.C.,
mayor).
</P>
<P>
   For lunch executive chef Rob Pando served fresh-squeezed
lemonade sipped from frosty, sugar-lipped glass tumblers; a salad
of heirloom tomatoes and baby greens; Dungeness crab salad with
avocado, dressed in a light, lemon vinaigrette.
</P>
<P>
   And a basket of Walla Walla Sweet onion sandwiches served with
housemade mayonnaise.
</P>
<P>
   An onion sandwich?
</P>
<P>
   On the menu it did sound suspiciously like Depression-era fare,
but it was a favorite of the late, great culinarian James Beard.
</P>
<P>
   The sandwiches so-adored by one of Portland's native sons won
the table over.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are wonderfully simple, simply wonderful little
sandwiches...'' Marion Cunningham writes in The Fannie Farmer
Cookbook. ``James Beard used to make them with a rich brioche
dough....''
</P>
<P>
   You hardly need a recipe to re-create Pando's sweet onion
sandwiches at home. Simply slice the onions thin and serve with a
healthy slathering of high-quality mayonnaise on sturdy,
country-style bread.
</P>
<P>
   Cookbook author Jan Roberts Dominguez of Corvalis, Ore., also is
captivated by the simple sweet onion sandwich. But the author of
The Onion Cookbook offers a slightly jazzier variation on the Beard
theme.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts Dominguez uses pumpernickel bread and a sour
cream//mustard mixture to offset the sweet, crisp onion slices and
adds Swiss cheese and arugula. Both are thoughtful additions, to be
sure. But you could just as easily go without. In this case,
simplicity is, indeed, a virtue. Sweet onion sandwich Makes 4
servings 1/2 cup sour cream
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   8 slices dark, dense-textured pumpernickel bread
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces thin-sliced Swiss cheese
</P>
<P>
   12 to 16 tender arugula leaves, rinsed and crisped
</P>
<P>
   1 medium (about 8 ounces) fresh Walla Walla Sweet onion (or
another sweet onion, such as Vidalia), sliced thin
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   In a cup, combine sour cream and mustard. Slather 4 slices of
the bread with half of the sour cream mixture. Equally distribute
the cheese, arugula and onion slices over the sauce, then season to
taste with salt and pepper. Spread the other 4 slices of bread with
the remainder of the sour cream mixture and complete the
sandwiches.

   &UR; SILENCE IS GOLDEN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Three monks were meditating in the Himalayas to be away from the
maddening crowds.
</P>
<P>
   One year passed in silence and the first monk said, `Pretty cold
here.'
</P>
<P>
   Another year passed in silence and the second one said, `You
know, you're quite right.'
</P>
<P>
   Another year passed and the third one said, `Look, I'm gonna
quit unless you two stop bitching!'
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WOMEN WITH GUNS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   While a Texan was busily preparing for the first day of deer
hunting season, his wife started nagging that he never asked her to
go along. After several hours of argument the wife won.
</P>
<P>
   That next morning they drove out to the country, and he placed
his wife in a tree about 100 yards from his blind. Just as the
hunter reached the blind, he heard a loud bang coming from the
wife's position.
</P>
<P>
   As he ran up to her, he saw that she was holding her gun on a
man nearby and shouting, `It's my deer! Get away from It!!'
</P>
<P>
   The sheepish-looking stranger just nodded slowly and said, `OK,
lady.. It's your deer. Just let me get my saddle off of it!'
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLAT TIRE EXAM &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Two college seniors had a week of exams coming up. They decided
to party instead. Their biggest exam was on Wednesday and they
showed up telling the professor that their car had broken down the
night before due to a very flat tire and they needed a bit more
time to study.
</P>
<P>
   The professor told them that they could have another day to
study. That evening, both of the boys crammed all night until they
were sure that they knew just about everything.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving to class the next morning, each boy was told to go to
two separate classrooms to take the exam. Each boy just shrugged
and went to two different parts of the building.
</P>
<P>
   As each sat down, they read the directions:
</P>
<P>
   `For 5 points, explain the contents of an atom. For 95 points,
tell me WHICH tire it was!'
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OPENING REMARKS FROM THE ``LATE SHOW with DAVID LETTERMAN'' &LR;

   ``Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is trying to clean up the city and has
closed down all of New York City's sex shops, all of New York
City's sex shows. Well, thank God, at least we still have the
Clinton administration.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you seen the graph that shows you the trading on the
Stock Market? Man, it looked like President Clinton's lie detector
test.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big weekend for President Clinton. He was out in Long
Island there in the Hamptons at a big fundraiser. This is how
President Clinton raises the funds for the Democratic Party. For
$1,000, you get to look at President Clinton...For $5,000, you're
allowed to shake his hand. Now, if you would like to have sex with
President Clinton, as always, that's completely free.''

</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton is on the road for part of this week. No, it's
mostly a political trip, not Starr-approved work-release.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Congress want Ken Starr to file an impeachment
report so the matter can be settled quickly. Well, plus they want
to read about Monica's dress.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way out if we start running away from this kind of
conduct,'' Mr. Clinton said this week. No, he was talking about
fighting terrorism, not Starrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Aunt Ilse from Oelwein says if Starr submits an impeachment
report to Congress it will get much higher readership if it
includes pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton's grand jury testimony will be via closed-circuit
TV. That's probably how he should spend any future time with White
House interns.
</P>
<P>
   A New York publisher says Monica Lewinsky treated her stained
dress like a trophy. Apparently journalists aren't the only ones
who value leaks.

more drought.'' Plus, of course, the usual run of bad movies about
all that.

JUST IMAGINE CECIL VAN TUYL IN ROYAL BLUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (KANSAS CITY, Mo.) _ How about this as a way to liven up the
dullest days of summer? How about Cecil Van Tuyl offers to kick in
whatever financial help Miles Prentice needs to buy the Kansas City
Royals in return for voter approval of Van Tuyl's Brush Creek Plaza
redevelopment proposal?
</P>
<P>
   If Van Tuyl's bid for a $78-million redo west of Country Club
Plaza gets the go-ahead at the polls Nov. 3, it will be worth
nearly $20 million in taxpayer subsidies. If Van Tuyl becomes a
Royals part-owner, it's a good possibility he'll get to share in at
least that much public largess over the next decade or so.
</P>
<P>
   Major league franchises are, after all, as good a way to
generate taxpayer subsidies as economic redevelopment. The bonus is
that the public relations potential has a lot more upside in sports
than it does in bricks and mortar. This is an aspect of the deal
that shouldn't be lost on Van Tuyl.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone has public relations problems, it's Van Tuyl. His
controversial redevelopment proposal has been kicking around for
nearly three years. As far as can be told, there's never been any
spirited public support for the project. Except for those in Van
Tuyl's employ and project beneficiaries, enthusiastic proponents
seem few and far between.
</P>
<P>
   On the opposition side, however, the fight to stop the
development has been intense. The opposition's numbers aren't all
that many, relatively speaking, but they are committed. One
objection is that it would create a traffic zoo in the area and
otherwise diminish the quality of life thereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   That's the practical objection. The esthetic objection is that
all those ancient apartment heaps Van Tuyl wants to supplant with a
brand new mixed-use commercial-residential neighborhood are too
precious to destroy. To paraphrase, hell hath no fury like
preservationists faced with proposed demolishment of something they
see as charming.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal has evolved into such a hot political potato that
the Kansas City, Mo., Council last week decided not to decide and
dropped the issue into the hands of voters. The people will
determine the project's fate, which would appear dubious. Those not
strongly opposed are apparently indifferent to it, which doesn't
bode well for Van Tuyl.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Van Tuyl creates image problems for himself by
choosing to maintain a nonexistent public profile. Van Tuyl's
visibility is nil in the community, which is a critical drawback
now that he's faced with the challenge of persuading Kansas Citians
to join him in radically changing the face of a beloved piece of
local real estate.
</P>
<P>
   Van Tuyl, however, can solve all his PR problems in one fell
swoop by mounting a white horse and becoming the biggest local
backer in the effort to save the beloved big-league baseball
franchise. Not only would he create a public persona, but also
would gain a rep as a guy who wants to give something back to the
community.
</P>
<P>
   Any effort to link his Royals financial support to voter
approval of his redevelopment project might be tricky from a public
relations standpoint, because some would equate it with a polite
form of blackmail.
</P>
<P>
   This hurdle is negotiable, though, because so many Kansas
Citians are desperate to retain the Royals. Thus, sufficient
numbers of voters likely would be able to overlook the /{quid pro
quo/} nature of his offer in return for the promise keeping the
Royals in Kansas City.

   &UR; SILENCE IS GOLDEN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Three monks were meditating in the Himalayas to be away from the
maddening crowds.
</P>
<P>
   One year passed in silence and the first monk said, `Pretty cold
here.'
</P>
<P>
   Another year passed in silence and the second one said, `You
know, you're quite right.'
</P>
<P>
   Another year passed and the third one said, `Look, I'm gonna
quit unless you two stop bitching!'
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WOMEN WITH GUNS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   While a Texan was busily preparing for the first day of deer
hunting season, his wife started nagging that he never asked her to
go along. After several hours of argument the wife won.
</P>
<P>
   That next morning they drove out to the country, and he placed
his wife in a tree about 100 yards from his blind. Just as the
hunter reached the blind, he heard a loud bang coming from the
wife's position.
</P>
<P>
   As he ran up to her, he saw that she was holding her gun on a
man nearby and shouting, `It's my deer! Get away from It!!'
</P>
<P>
   The sheepish-looking stranger just nodded slowly and said, `OK,
lady.. It's your deer. Just let me get my saddle off of it!'
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLAT TIRE EXAM &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Two college seniors had a week of exams coming up. They decided
to party instead. Their biggest exam was on Wednesday and they
showed up telling the professor that their car had broken down the
night before due to a very flat tire and they needed a bit more
time to study.
</P>
<P>
   The professor told them that they could have another day to
study. That evening, both of the boys crammed all night until they
were sure that they knew just about everything.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving to class the next morning, each boy was told to go to
two separate classrooms to take the exam. Each boy just shrugged
and went to two different parts of the building.
</P>
<P>
   As each sat down, they read the directions:
</P>
<P>
   `For 5 points, explain the contents of an atom. For 95 points,
tell me WHICH tire it was!'
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OPENING REMARKS FROM THE ``LATE SHOW with DAVID LETTERMAN'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is trying to clean up the city and has
closed down all of New York City's sex shops, all of New York
City's sex shows. Well, thank God, at least we still have the
Clinton administration.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you seen the graph that shows you the trading on the
Stock Market? Man, it looked like President Clinton's lie detector
test.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big weekend for President Clinton. He was out in Long
Island there in the Hamptons at a big fundraiser. This is how
President Clinton raises the funds for the Democratic Party. For
$1,000, you get to look at President Clinton...For $5,000, you're
allowed to shake his hand. Now, if you would like to have sex with
President Clinton, as always, that's completely free.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica's testimony has apparently been very, very hot. At one
point, the entire grand jury had to step outside for a cigarette.''
</P>

   ``Monica looked beautiful, though. She had a lovely blue dress
with that lovely crime scene tape wrapped around it.''

   &UR; BILL'S WORLD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton is on the road for part of this week. No, it's
mostly a political trip, not Starr-approved work-release.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Congress want Ken Starr to file an impeachment
report so the matter can be settled quickly. Well, plus they want
to read about Monica's dress.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way out if we start running away from this kind of
conduct,'' Mr. Clinton said this week. No, he was talking about
fighting terrorism, not Starrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Aunt Ilse from Oelwein says if Starr submits an impeachment
report to Congress it will get much higher readership if it
includes pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton's grand jury testimony will be via closed-circuit
TV. That's probably how he should spend any future time with White
House interns.
</P>
<P>
   A New York publisher says Monica Lewinsky treated her stained
dress like a trophy. Apparently journalists aren't the only ones
who value leaks.
</P>
<P>
   The president calls acts of terrorism ``inhuman.'' Don't we all
wish.
</P>
<P>
   Newly released government statistics show July was the hottest
month on record. Bet Mr. Clinton would cast his vote for this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Unless we act, says Al Gore, ``we can expect even more extreme
weather _ more heat waves, more flooding, more powerful storms and
more drought.'' Plus, of course, the usual run of bad movies about
all that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to be a scientist to know it's been hot this
summer,'' Gore says. In fact, you can be way below a scientist.
Like vice president.

LARGE MALL PROPOSED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC PALMER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The tidal wave of development sweeping south
Johnson County, Kan., has inspired plans to bring another regional
mall to the metropolitan area's shopping mix.
</P>
<P>
   Developers Copaken, White &AMP; Blitt on Tuesday confirmed they were
working on plans to build a mall at 135th Street and Metcalf
Avenue, in one of the region's most affluent, fastest-growing
areas.
</P>
<P>
   The developers, who are the main owners of Oak Park Mall, also
in the Kansas City area, are proposing a retail strip center and a
regional mall on about 90 acres. Members of the firm are working
with apartment developer A.G. Spanos, which plans to build an
apartment complex on 50 acres southeast of the mall, buffering it
from nearby residential areas.
</P>
<P>
   Emphasizing that plans are preliminary, Jon Copaken said the
company believes there is demand now for a retail strip center on
the site that would accommodate four or five large stores and
numerous smaller retailers and restaurants. He acknowledged that
plans for an enclosed mall were more speculative.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mall component will be dictated by the demand of
department stores,'' said Copaken. ``There are department stores
here that might want to be in the center and retailers outside of
Kansas City that might want to be in this market. If none of the
department stores are interested, then it wouldn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   News of the mall plan comes only a week after it was announced
that May Department Stores Co. is buying six Kansas City area Jones
stores and one in Topeka, Kan. The entrance of May, one of the most
successful department store retailers in the country, is leading
some retail observers to suggest that the Kansas City retail market
is in for some changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is due to break out of the second-tier status it's held,''
said David Levine, whose Dallas company Real Estate F//X has done
consulting for the Country Club Plaza and the proposed downtown
Power &AMP; Light retail project. ``Kansas City is not a major retail
market in the eyes of many retailers but it has the potential to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Levine said Kansas City has some predictable shopping and
restaurant venues and could use a mall if it were exciting enough
to attract some of the new retailers and themed restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kansas City has the horsepower for a Neiman Marcus or a
Bloomingdale's,'' Levine said of two of the more upscale national
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   He said May also owns chains such as Lord &AMP; Taylor that it might
want to bring to Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Work on the strip center could begin in the spring, if the city
grants appropriate zoning. The mall could take three to five years
to develop.
</P>
<P>
   Copaken, White &AMP; Blitt and A.G. Spanos would have to get zoning
for their specific plans, said John Petersen, attorney for the
project, but the site was zoned for a regional mall and apartment
project in 1990. A Michigan developer, Forbes-Cohen Properties,
proposed a mall of about 1.3 million square feet on the site, but
the project never materialized.
</P>
<P>
   The demographics in what is known as the Blue Valley area are
considered phenomenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has high, real high, disposable income,'' said Dennis
McKee, president of the County Economic Research Institute, which
develops statistics about the county. ``It is a hot retail location
and growing at almost double digit rates. It is competitive,
though.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of households in the three-mile trade area
surrounding the proposed mall site area has grown 8 percent a year
over the last five years. And according to a report the research
institute did in March, the average price of houses in the area is
more than $206,000 and annual household disposable income is almost
$94,000.
</P>
<P>
   Levine said the Kansas City area has about 10 percent more
retail space per capita than the national average. Even so, he
believes the area could support another mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you would see a real severe shakeout,'' Levine
said. ``You would see an adjustment but some of that would be due
to changing preferences.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of that adjustment would be in Johnson County, which last
year surpassed $5 billion in retail sales. &QL;

ONE-YEAR-OLD BOY SHOT AND KILLED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE VENDEL  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A 1-year-old boy was shot and killed Tuesday
in a midtown Kansas City apartment, and police said the boy's
6-year-old cousin told them he had fired the fatal shot with a gun
he had found in a bag.
</P>
<P>
   The bag also contained video game controls. Police were trying
to determine who took the gun into the Kansas City house.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Darian D. Hinds was shot about 2:35 p.m. at a
three-story house converted to apartments at 4001 Warwick Blvd. The
older boy's name was not released because of his age. It was his
birthday Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just traumatized,'' said Donald Richards, a family
member. ``I don't know if he knows what is going on. I'm sure he
just saw the gun in the bag and was curious about it. He didn't
know. It was just an accident.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-year-old boy's sister, 16, and their mother were also in
the first-floor apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The girl and woman were in a different room from the children
when the child was shot. The gun apparently had been in a bag that
was on the floor in front of a television set, said Detective Jeff
Cowdrey.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the boy told them he grabbed the handgun, pointed it
at a wall and pulled the trigger. A bullet struck the 1-year-old,
who was climbing onto a chair, in the torso.
</P>
<P>
   The mother called 911, and the boy was taken to the hospital,
where he was pronounced dead.
</P>
<P>
   No one who lived at the home claimed the handgun or knew how it
got into the house, said Detective Kevin Kilkenny.
</P>
<P>
   The mother told police the gun was not in the bag earlier in the
day, so police were investigating whether someone stopped by the
house Tuesday and put it there.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the shooting, family members gathered at the home. A
half-dozen pink roses in a vase had been placed on the front porch.
</P>
<P>
   About 6:30 p.m., an argument that could be heard on the street
broke out among family members. The teen-age girl stepped out of
the house and asked for police to intervene because the argument
was turning into threats. Police said later the argument was over
who was at fault.
</P>
<P>
   Police escorted several relatives to the curb and talked with
them. Family members then took the 6-year-old boy to get something
to eat.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors told police they had seen someone carrying a gun in
and out of the house in recent days. Another family member told
police that was a BB gun and was not related to the shooting.
Police were still investigating.
</P>
<P>
   The family had lived in the home about four months, said
Richards, a brother-in-law of the woman who lives there.
</P>
<P>
   A similar shooting occurred July 15, when Chris Hollowell, 4,
was shot in the head as his 10-year-old brother looked at a
handgun. The brothers had gone to their 10-year-old cousin's house
in Grandview and found the handgun on a closet shelf.

HEARST-ARGYLE TELEVISION REPORTS HIGHER EARNINGS FOR QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hearst-Argyle Television, Inc. on Wednesday reported
second-quarter revenues rose 401 percent and operating cash flow
for the quarter grew 484 percent over last year's second quarter,
reflecting the combined results of the Hearst and Argyle operations
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for the quarter totaled $109.7 million, up from $21.9
million a year earlier. Operating cash flow for the quarter totaled
$54.3 million, compared with $9.3 million in the year-earlier
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 results reflect operations only of the former Argyle
Television Inc. that merged, effective Aug. 29, 1997, with the
broadcasting group of The Hearst Corporation. Argyle owned six
stations and Hearst owned eight stations.
</P>
<P>
   For the first half, revenue rose 395 percent to $197 million
from $39.8 million, while operating cash flow jumped 497 percent to
$84.5 million from year-earlier $14.2 million. Earnings per share
came to 49 cents, compared with a year-earlier loss of 79 cents a
share.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst-Argyle also announced pro forma results as if
Hearst-Argyle's acquisition of the broadcasting group of Pulitzer
Publishing were complete. That acquisition, announced in May, is
expected to close by year-end, pending regulatory and shareholder
approval.
</P>
<P>
   On that basis, revenue for the quarter rose 6.7 percent, to
$178.4 million from $167.2 million, while operating cash flow was
up 11.4 percent to $89.5 million from $80.3 million. Pro forma
earnings per share rose 23 percent, to 27 cents from 22 cents a
share a year-earlier.
</P>
<P>
   For the first half, pro forma revenue was up 6.5 percent to
$320.9 million from $301.2 million. Operating cash flow rose 10.2
percent, to $142.4 million from $129.2 million a year earlier.
Earnings per share were up 38 percent, to 29 cents from 21 cents a
share.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Marbut, chairman and co-chief executive officer, said the
Pulitzer acquisition ``was a defining transaction for our
company.'' He said the deal puts Hearst-Argyle in more high-growth
southern markets and provides greater geographic and network
diversity.
</P>
<P>
   The pro forma company, with TV stations in 20 states, will reach
16.5 percent of U.S. households and will be one of the top three
independent TV station groups, Marbut said. The company will be the
largest ABC affiliate group and the second largest NBC affiliate
group, he said.
</P>
<P>
   John G. Conomikes, president and co-chief executive officer,
said the rate of growth of third-quarter ad sales has slowed ``to
about 3 percent'' as the result of the UAW strike against General
Motors Corp.
</P>
<P>
   However, Conomikes predicted that Hearst-Argyle will benefit in
the latter part of the quarter from the strike's settlement and
from political advertising. He said the earlier 8 p.m. starting
time for ``Monday Night Football'' would benefit Hearst-Argyle's
nine ABC-affiliated stations by allowing them to put their
late-night news program on earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monday Night Football'' is ``undeniably primetime TV's single
biggest draw for male viewers across all demographic
categories,''according to David J. Barrett, executive vice
president and chief operating officer of Hearst-Argyle.

 By PETER WAYNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has an evocative name, the motherboard, and rightly so: It is
the computer's main circuit board, so all the smaller assemblies
are plugged or wired into it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the motherboard (which is, of course, bigger and
smarter than a daughterboard) has had other names. For a time, IBM
referred to motherboards as planar cards, part of its practice of
having its own terms for everything. But it's not surprising that a
word like ``motherboard'' beat out ``planar card'' _ the hand that
rocks the cradle rules the world.
</P>
<P>
   A motherboard binds chips together. The board usually holds all
the processing power and moves signals back and forth among the
various chips responsible for doing computations, putting images on
the screen or sending data to modems or disk drives. The
motherboard is the Grand Central Terminal for all the data.
</P>
<P>
   Motherboards are generally made of a hard plastic and have
circuit traces made of copper etched onto them. In many cases, the
board has multiple layers because the traces are so complex that
they must cross one another many times. The chips, resistors,
capacitors and other components are generally attached to the top
and sometimes the bottom with solder.
</P>
<P>
   The art of designing a motherboard is complex and involves many
design decisions. One of the most basic is whether to solder a
component directly to a board or connect it with a socket.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, almost all parts were attached with sockets so new
parts could be swapped in when the old ones went bad. That practice
is largely history because the sockets never gave as good
connections as pure solder. Further, if repairs are needed, finding
which of the many components is bad and then replacing it is often
more expensive than buying a new motherboard.
</P>
<P>
   Today, only the processor chip and the memory boards are
routinely attached with a socket instead of solder. The processor
is the most important part of the computer and is generally the
most expensive. The speed of the chips varies, and sometimes people
upgrade their computers by putting in more powerful processors.
</P>
<P>
   The RAM is usually connected in small cards, memory modules that
are sometimes known as daughterboards or daughtercards; among the
more common are those known as SIMMs (single in-line memory
modules) or DIMMs (dual in-line memory modules). More memory is
generally better; huge amounts are generally needed by graphics
designers, scientists, programmers, medical diagnosticians and many
others, who can add more memory if they want to.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes manufacturers may leave parts off the motherboard to
give the user some flexibility. The circuitry for putting images on
the screen, for instance, is often put on a separate card that
plugs into the motherboard.
</P>
<P>
   That lets some people choose whether they want a high-end
graphics card capable of supporting a big monitor or whether they
would rather save some money by getting a lower-end card. Modems,
fast disk controllers, network access circuits and sound processing
are some of the typical functions put on separate cards to leave
the user some options.
</P>
<P>
   Some manufacturers are starting to bundle as many of these
options as they can together on the board. They are trying to
choose a collection of options that should fit the average user's
needs and locking them into the board.
</P>
<P>
   It is not uncommon to find circuits that used to be on a
separate sound card soldered onto the main motherboard. They are so
standard that this is the cheapest way to deliver the features. For
example, graphics processing on the motherboard is more common
these days.
</P>
<P>
   While motherboards have usually contained many chips, each for
different functions, chip manufacturers are now bundling more and
more features on the same chip. Manufacturers love to do that
because it reduces the chip count on the motherboard and makes
assembly cheaper. In time, it is possible that there will be only
one chip on the board.
</P>
<P>
   Some people who want better computers, and feel adept enough,
may put in faster processors, while others buy whole new computers.
For some people, a smart move is to upgrade by buying a new
motherboard but keeping the old box, power supply and disk drives.

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
Byu PERRY STEWART 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Point of Origin''
</P>
<P>
   By Patricia Cornwell
</P>
<P>
   356 pages, Putnam, $25.95
</P>
<P>
   THE AUTHOR: Before writing her first crime novel eight books
ago, Patricia Cornwell worked as a police reporter, an employee of
the Virginia chief medical examiner's office and a volunteer police
officer. She lives in Richmond, Va., and speaks with a subtle
Southern accent.
</P>
<P>
   BACKGROUND FOR FIRST-TIMERS: Quincy is a wimp. So is Mark Sloan
of ``Diagnosis Murder.'' Neither of those crime-solving physicians
is fit to pass a scalpel to Kay Scarpetta, the state of Virginia's
chief medical examiner.
</P>
<P>
   THE PLOT: Dr. Scarpetta reluctantly delays her beach vacation
with Benton, her FBI agent lover. A horse farm owned by a media
wheel has been torched, and it doesn't look as though a frayed
extension cord is the culprit. Worse: Carrie Grethen, Scarpetta's
nemesis from earlier novels, may somehow be manipulating these and
other misdeeds _ even though she is locked in a psychiatric
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Carrie's toxic ploys inflict new pain on Scarpetta's niece,
Lucy, who is Carrie's former lover. And subsequent events bring
even deeper emotional hurt to Scarpetta.
</P>
<P>
   STRANGE DELIGHTS: Cornwell's crime-scene portraits are
exhaustively detailed. You can feel the muck, smell the
flame-charred flooring. There are lengthy descriptions of a motel,
a motel clerk, a motel room, a motel bath. Then, by way of
intoxicating contrast, there is the lean economy of allocating
snide subtext to the merest of attributions (''... my niece inanely
said'').
</P>
<P>
   CAVEAT FOR THE SQUEAMISH: Cornwell also provides detailed
descriptions of charred, parboiled, bludgeoned and otherwise
foul-played-with bodies.

TROUBLED SAN ANTONIO SYMPHONY SEEKS NEW CONTRACT WITH MUSICIANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MIKE GREENBERG  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Just a month from opening night, the San Antonio
Symphony's 60th season is threatened by a game of brinkmanship
between its governing board and musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a ``profound financial crisis,'' the chairman of the San
Antonio Symphony board said Tuesday that the coming season is in
peril unless the musicians agree to renegotiate their contract.
</P>
<P>
   But the musicians' attorney, Leonard Leibowitz, has resisted
entering into formal contract talks while most of the musicians are
out of town for the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board feels very strongly that before we make a decision
to launch our 60th season, we have to deal in a straightforward
manner with the financial crisis we face,'' chairman Charles Lutz
said after a board meeting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The season is scheduled to begin Sept. 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``A key ingredient of our decision to go forward is a
renegotiated contract with the musicians,'' Lutz said. ``And I
would suggest that a renegotiated contract is essential to our
going to a group of stakeholders and asking them for sustaining
support.''
</P>
<P>
   Another board meeting has been tentatively set for Aug. 25.
Asked if a go-or-no-go decision would have to be made then, Lutz
replied: ``Not necessarily.''
</P>
<P>
   Flutist Jean Robinson attended the board meeting as head of the
orchestra committee, which also would be the contract negotiating
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are committed to keeping our orchestra alive, and we are
doing all we can to ensure its survival. We can't talk about any
specifics right now,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   The current contract has two years to run. In February, however,
the board declared a state of financial emergency, which allows the
symphony to force the musicians to reopen their contract.
</P>
<P>
   The symphony is asking to freeze the musicians' base weekly
salary at $732, reduce the number of paid weeks from 39 to 36 and
cut pension payments and other benefits, according to a letter from
symphony attorney George P. Parker Jr. to Leibowitz.
</P>
<P>
   The symphony also has filed a complaint against Local 23 of the
American Federation of Musicians. Parker charged that the musicians
union had ``refused to bargain over changes in the parties'
collective bargaining agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The symphony has an accumulated debt of about $1.5 million and
repeatedly was late in making payroll during the second half of the
previous season, which closed at the end of May.
</P>
<P>
   A task force, including board members, staff, musicians and
others not associated with the symphony, has spent the summer
studying a wide range of the orchestra's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Lutz said the task force recommendations were reported to the
board Tuesday, but he would not disclose what those recommendations
were.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we now must do is bring together all the constituencies
... and reach agreement with them that the right thing to do is
move forward with the 60th season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of these groups is essential _ the orchestra members, the
corporate community, season subscribers, City Council and the city
leadership, the board, and local and national foundations and
trusts,'' Lutz said.

BAY STATE HOME SALES SOAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER BABSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A brisk spring real estate market pushed sales of
detached single-family homes in Massachusetts to their highest
level in more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   During the second quarter of 1998, between April and June, more
than 14,304 single-family homes were sold in the state, a 11.5
percent increase from the second quarter of 1997, the Massachusetts
Association of Realtors reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mild weather and continued low interest rates pushed the number
of closings for the first six months of 1998 to an all-time
mid-year high of 22,528.
</P>
<P>
   Sales in Greater Boston dipped 4.9 percent in the second quarter
of 1998 as compared to the second quarter of 1997, a decline
attributed to a shortage of inventory and a new statewide listing
system that many agents had difficulty mastering.
</P>
<P>
   The average state-wide sales price for a home also climbed 10.2
percent to $217,281 during that period. In Greater Boston, where
sales tend to be driven by the higher end of the market, the
average price of a single-family home rose 15.4 percent to
$284,289.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the median home price increased by 6 percent to
$131,100 during the second quarter of 1998, the National
Association of Realtors said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Condominium sales in Massachusetts increased by 14.3 percent
during this time period, while the average price of a condo rose to
$135,640. In Greater Boston, the average price of a condo is now
$168,079 _ a 12.7 percent increase over last year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said sustained economic growth was the main ingredient.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the second quarter, consumer confidence was at
an all-time high, interest rates were low, and the stock market was
up,'' said Karl Case, an economics professor at Wellesley College.
</P>
<P>
   Case predicted that the market will slow in the third quarter,
in part because of volatility on Wall Street and the Asian
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is still strong, there is still no reason to
expect things are going to collapse, but it's going to be probably
a healthy cooling,'' Case said.
</P>
<P>
   While there are many first-time home buyers now shopping for
homes, many who already own are opting to trade in their existing
homes for more expensive ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can sell that first home and buy a larger home with
more amenities and that is reflected in the percentage changes.''
said MAR president Mary Crowley. ``The trade-up market is really
moving and that was a segment of the market that was very depressed
for a long time.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A moderate earthquake shook parts of northern
California Wednesday morning, rattling more nerves than buildings.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Centered about 85 miles southeast of San Francisco near the San
Andreas fault, the quake struck at 7:10 a.m. PT and registered 5.4
on the Richter scale of ground motion, according to the U.S.
Geological Survey office in Menlo Park, Calif. The effects were
felt over 116 miles, from Sausalito, just north of San Francisco,
down to Big Sur.
</P>
<P>
   In the San Francisco metropolitan area, the quake prompted
officials to shut down commuter train service while they checked
tracks for damage, and it caused some downtown skyscrapers to sway,
which frightened at least a few office workers.
</P>
<P>
   Seismologists at the University of California at Berkeley said
the earthquake was followed by dozens of small aftershocks in the
same area that registered 2.0 or greater, which is typical for a
quake of this size. One reached 3.0. But they also said the history
of earthquake activity in northern California over the last 20
years suggests a 5 to 10 percent probability that Thursday's large
quake could be a warning, known as a foreshock, of an earthquake
equal in size or larger within the next seven days.
</P>
<P>
   Near the epicenter of Thursday's quake, seven miles
south-southeast of San Juan Bautista, a bedroom community of 1,500,
state officials found small cracks in Highway 101, a major
north-south corridor. But they were not found to be serious enough
to close the road. `'Cars are still driving over them,'' Sheriff
Harvey Nyland of San Juan Bautista said.
</P>
<P>
   But the quake caused enough superficial damage at the town's
most famous landmark, the 186-year-old Mission San Juan Bautista,
that church officials summoned engineers to determine if there were
structural problems, as well. The Rev. Edward Fitz-Henry said
plaster fell from a wall that faces the mission cemetery, which
faces the fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time since 1906 that the mission has been
damaged by an earthquake,'' Fitz-Henry said, referring to the most
devastating earthquake ever recorded in northern California, with a
magnitude of 8.25. In addition to its historical importance, the
mission was the setting for the climax and several other critical
scenes in ``Vertigo,'' Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 thriller.
</P>
<P>
   In case any fans of the film were wondering, Fitz-Henry said,
the bell tower in the final scene of ``Vertigo'' was not damaged.
That is because the mission has no bell tower. Hitchcock,
Fitz-Henry said, shot the scene on a sound stage in Los Angeles.

BURMESE HOLD AMERICAN STUDENT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   A woman from Portsmouth, N.H., detained in Burma along with
several other American university students, is doing well and may
be released shortly, her mother says.
</P>
<P>
   Anjanette Hamilton, 20, was taken into police custody along with
17 companions Sunday for distributing antigovernment leaflets in
Burma, the southeast Asian nation also known as Myanmar. Though the
group is being held, they have not been arrested or charged with
any crime, a U.S. State Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   The six Americans being detained have communicated with their
families through the US embassy in the Burmese capital of Rangoon.
Five of the students attend American University in Washington,
D.C., and one attends Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to hang in there,'' said Anjanette's mother,
Alison Hamilton. ``We are hopeful that things will work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton received a fax from her daughter, known as Angie, on
Tuesday in which she said she is ``absolutely fine.'' The fax
continued: ``We are still making corny jokes, so I still have my
sense of humor. I LOVE YOU GUYS SO MUCH.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton was relieved to hear from a US embassy official
Wednesday that the embassy was able to visit the students on
Tuesday and give them food, towels, and clean underwear. The
embassy also told Hamilton that they gave her daughter some
batteries she had requested for her Sony Walkman.
</P>
<P>
   The students were distributing the leaflets Saturday, the 10th
anniversary of a nationwide uprising against Burma's military
government that left 3,000 dead.
</P>
<P>
   Angie, who will be a sophomore at American, left Washington for
Thailand on July 28, her mother said. Along with the other
students, she had planned to visit refugee camps in Thailand near
the Burma border. Hamilton had taken two suitcases with her _ one
with her clothes and the other with dental supplies for the
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's mother said her daughter was participating in the
trip through the Free Burma Coalition, a group active on college
campuses that works to promote democracy in Burma. The group is not
affiliated with American University.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's more humanitarian than political,'' Hamilton said.
``We're puzzled as to how she got into Burma and mixed up in all
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Angie has been fighting poverty and injustive overseas for
several years, her mother said. In 1994, she spent time in India,
where she visited an orphanage. She was so inspired to help that
she raised $6,000 for medical equipment for the orphanage. Two
years later, she spent a summer building latrines in a Brazilian
village.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department official said it was a good sign that US
embassy officials were able to visit the detained students, but
added that Burma has not detained Americans in the past, so it is
tough to predict what will happen.
</P>
<P>
   Alison Hamilton, who says she has lost sleep over her daughter's
ordeal, maintains hope that Angie will be released soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do feel they're being treated well, and we heard from the
embassy that the mood has changed for the better, so all of these
things make us hopeful, but we still don't know when they will be
released,'' she said.

FORT WORTH EXHIBIT SHOWS WHAT'S IMPORTANT _ AND WHY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JANET TYSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's one thing to say that certain artworks are important. Any
museum worth its salt makes that claim every time it hangs
something on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   It's another thing, though, to communicate WHY an artist or a
painting or print or an apparently simple lump of lead is
important, without smothering viewers in data and dogma.
</P>
<P>
   Take the two Andy Warhol paintings recently purchased by the
Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth. We all know who Andy Warhol is and
what his art looks like.
</P>
<P>
   But art and artist both have enjoyed far more than 15 minutes'
worth of fame _ and we can see why when we look at the pictures at
the Modern. Not only are the individual pictures horrific _ a
self-portrait as a death mask and a cannon-sized gun _ they are
installed with other artworks that amplify the themes of death and
the need for spiritual reassurance.
</P>
<P>
   Mixing artworks with related subject matter, similar
compositions and other affinities isn't a new practice. But, new or
not, it helps us get inside artworks that otherwise might seem
inaccessible. It even helps build a mood _ edgy seriousness in this
case _ that lingers well after visitors leave the museum to go
home, grab some coffee or, just maybe, look at more art.
</P>
<P>
   Assembled by Michael Auping, the Modern's chief curator,
``Recent Acquisitions and Selections From the Permanent
Collection'' features about 60 artworks by 33 artists. It includes
paintings, photographs, drawings and one video installation _ Bill
Viola's ``The Greeting'' (1995).
</P>
<P>
   Most of the work will be familiar to visitors who have been to
the Modern during the past year or two. Along with the two Warhols,
conspicuous new acquisitions include an important new painting by
Anselm Kiefer and a classic montage by those rude Brits, Gilbert &AMP;
George. Then there are golden oldies such as Picasso and Jackson
Pollock, hung side-by-side to suggest new ideas about both.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to paintings, the show includes several photographs.
Most are segregated into photo-only installations, although Cindy
Sherman's self-portrait as a pope is placed with the Warhols and
new Kiefer, with the Gilbert &AMP; George piece (which combines
photography and mixed media) nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Greeting'' is placed in a darkened gallery all its own. A
monumental projection, Viola's work is on the scale of a
16th-century altarpiece _ quite fittingly, considering that it is
based on Jacopo Pontormo's post-Renaissance painting of the Virgin
Mary's visit to her cousin Elizabeth. Viola's work is more general
and secular, but the monumental female figures, the fluttering
drape of their clothing and the dramatic lighting in his work all
hark back to Pontormo, as does the video's overall sense of
something uncanny.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Greeting'' is a major, majestic work by Viola and, for
now, the only video piece the Modern owns. Any number of artists,
including the quietly complex Ann Hamilton and trendy Tony Oursler,
work in that medium. But the Modern has yet to buy more video. This
tells us that Viola is special and that video is going to be around
long enough that there's no need to hurry up and buy.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other things this show wants to tell us:
</P>
<P>
   Warhol truly is great. He is not just the seer of surface
appearance, but a profound ponderer on eternal truths _ one of
which, the brevity of earthly existence, is mirrored by the
phenomenon of modern celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   Warhol's ``Self-Portrait'' (1986) and ``Pistol'' (1982) join the
Modern's extremely important ``Twenty-five Colored Marilyns''
(1962), along with several Warhol works on paper. ``Twenty-Five
Colored Marilyns'' is placed in a Pop room with paintings by Roy
Lichtenstein, Gerhard Richter and Jess. Placement of the new
Warhols _ in the ``death'' gallery _ casts a shadow on the entire
pop assemblage, though.
</P>
<P>
   Painted in black and putrid green, Warhol's ``Self-Portrait''
immediately brings to mind representations of severed heads _ of
Goliath, Medusa and others _ held suspended by their hair. As to
``Pistol,'' Auping has installed it so that the gun's barrel points
directly at Warhol's skull-like self-image. (As an aside, Auping
notes that the gun in ``Pistol'' is similar to the one Valerie
Solana used to shoot the artist in 1968, nearly killing him.)
</P>
<P>
   German artist Anselm Kiefer's importance exceeds the reputation
he enjoyed in the late 1980s as an apologist, of sorts, for the
Holocaust. The Modern's recent purchase of ``Pope Alexander VI: The
Golden Bull'' (1996), which measures almost 12-by-20 feet, makes
this clear.
</P>
<P>
   But not just size counts here. What really matters is that the
Modern has purchased not only Kiefer, but a new Kiefer. For, as
high as Kiefer was flying in the United States a decade ago, he
fell hard in the early '90s: About that time, several of his most
vocal American fans decided that Kiefer and his new art lacked
relevance _ that he, and it, were simply bombastic.
</P>
<P>
   Auping thinks otherwise. Not only did he steer the Modern to
purchase an early Kiefer last year _ the artist's ``Quaternity''
(1973) _ but he is planning a survey of Kiefer's new works,
featuring ``Pope Alexander VI,'' for the Modern's new building,
which opens in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Auping says, Kiefer's art addresses the
co-existence of life and death, good and evil, and other universal
dualities. In ``Pope Alexander VI,'' an immense pyramid symbolizes
humanity's yearning for a transcendent good, while evil and
futility are expressed in the trails and smudges of gold leaf and
blood-red paint on its steps.
</P>
<P>
   All-American, abstract expressionist Jackson Pollock _ who with
his cohorts stole the flame of progressive art from Paris and
brought it to New York _ was more European than we might think.
Pollock was greatly influenced by Picasso, this show says, flanking
Picasso's ``Reclining Woman Reading'' (1960) with two early, subtly
figural Pollocks.
</P>
<P>
   This grouping also casts a favorable light on Picasso's late
work, which can take self-satire to an almost buffoonish extreme:
Here, though, he soberly reprises one of his major themes _ the
female model as an object of the artist's gaze.
</P>
<P>
   What else can we learn by looking?
</P>
<P>
   That photography is becoming more important, not less so, as a
fine art medium with its own message. Auping makes this point by
putting several photographs on view and by addressing interactions
between painting and photography. The Cindy Sherman, for example,
refers to Old Master paintings of ecclesiastic figures. Too, Andres
Serrano's large, richly hued and lighted photographs emulate
painting _ just as they are rooted in traditional photojournalism.
</P>
<P>
   That realist paintings of familiar-seeming subjects by artists
like Julie Bozzi, Scott Gentling and Robert Bechtle are far from
reassuring.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Gentling paints naturalist Jane Goodall surrounded
by oddly threatening objects, including an ape's skull. Even Dennis
Blagg's relatively tranquil landscape painting _ recently
purchased, along with four graphite drawings _ underscores the
anxiousness of these other works.
</P>
<P>
   But, enough already. We're not trying to tell you what to think
_ any more than the Modern is. Go and see for yourself. Art is
about ideas, but it's also about the pure pleasure of looking.

OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE IS MOST SERIOUS OF ALLEGATIONS ABOUT
CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CLINTON-STARR) 
(bl) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The first article of impeachment against President
Richard Nixon that the House Judiciary Committee approved 24
summers ago charged Nixon with obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Among the dozens of actions the committee placed in that
category were Nixon's instructions to the CIA to block an FBI
investigation, his approval of hush-money payments to the Watergate
burglars, and his obtaining information from a federal prosecutor
in order to pass it along to aides who were under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry into President Clinton's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky is in a different realm. But the prevailing view in
political circles is that the most serious accusations against the
president involve obstruction of justice and that these are the
matters Congress is most likely to focus on if it begins
consideration of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was just a question of perjury in a civil trial so that
he could protect his wife and daughter from embarrassment, that's
one thing,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said last week. ``But if, in
fact, there is obstruction of justice or he did counsel others to
lie under oath or if he conspired to do these things, these are all
felonies and they're very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr has been investigating a
number of questions about Clinton's conduct that could fall into
the category of obstruction of justice. These are apparently the
main ones:
</P>
<P>
   _ Did the president urge Ms. Lewinsky to lie about their
relationship in her testimony in the Paula Jones lawsuit?
</P>
<P>
   _ Did he tell Ms. Lewinsky to give presents he had given her _ a
dress, a brooch and a hatpin _ to his secretary, Betty Currie, to
keep them out of the hands of Ms. Jones' lawyers?
</P>
<P>
   _ Was he instrumental in preparing the ``talking points'' meant
to coach former White House secretary Linda Tripp in preparation
for her testimony about the president in the Jones lawsuit?
</P>
<P>
   _ Did he try to shape Mrs. Currie's testimony about his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   _ Did he have his friend Vernon Jordan arrange for a job for Ms.
Lewinsky in return for her false testimony?
</P>
<P>
   In the Nixon case, much of the evidence of obstruction of
justice was on tape, in Nixon's own words. The evidence against
Clinton is much less clear.
</P>
<P>
   For example, lawyers familiar with Ms. Lewinsky's account have
said she testified that she and Clinton discussed possible cover
stories but that he never asked her to lie. Ms. Lewinsky also
testified that she alone was the author of the ``talking points,''
the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the gifts, the lawyers report that Ms. Lewinsky has said
that Clinton told her: ``If you don't have them, you can't turn
them over.'' It is unclear whether this was an idle observation, a
command or something in between.
</P>
<P>
   Other lawyers said that Mrs. Currie told investigators last
winter that the president walked her through an account of his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky by asking leading questions like,
``We were never alone, right?'' But there has been no indication
that Mrs. Currie said the president asked her to lie.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has said publicly that he helped Ms. Lewinsky find a job
at Mrs. Currie's request, not the president's.
</P>
<P>
   The federal law against obstruction of justice is unusually
broad. It applies, in one section, to someone who ``knowingly uses
intimidation . . . threatens or corruptly persuades another person
. . . with intent to influence, delay or prevent the testimony of
any person in an official proceeding.'' The maximum penalty is 10
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes obstruction cases are cut and dried, involving, say,
destroying documents, coercing jurors or paying witnesses to change
their testimony. This was the situation in Watergate, when former
White House aides H.R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman and former
Attorney General John Mitchell were convicted of trying to buy the
silence of the Watergate burglars.
</P>
<P>
   In another prominent case, Teamsters president Jimmy Hoffa went
to prison for obstruction of justice, in his case for jury
tampering.
</P>
<P>
   Other cases like Clinton's can be more subtle, and may depend,
for instance, on how one interprets a conversation a defendant had
with a potential witness.
</P>
<P>
   Obstruction is often difficult to prove, lawyers say, but it is
often easier to prove than some other crimes, including perjury,
where the prosecutor must show not only that defendants
specifically lied but that they meant to lie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obstruction of justice turns more on the global assessment of
the acts that were done _ whether the person was trying to
interfere with the process of finding facts,'' said Gerard Lynch, a
former prosecutor who now teaches criminal law at Columbia Law
School.
</P>
<P>
   The obstruction need not succeed. All the prosecutor has to
prove is that an attempt was made. People are rarely charged with
obstruction of justice alone, Lynch said. Usually, he said, the
charge is added to other criminal charges to improve the prospects
of a conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The law applies to civil as well as criminal cases, but
prosecutions are rarely brought for obstructing a civil lawsuit
like the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Washington trial lawyer Robert Luskin explained why. ``In civil
cases,'' he said, ``the trial process is almost always perfectly
well suited to protect the system. You don't need to have a
prosecutor involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never tried a civil case where someone wasn't lying about
something, but you don't say, `I'm going to call in a U.S. attorney
now.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But in criminal cases, obstruction of justice is a defense
lawyer's nightmare. At their first meeting with clients, defense
lawyers say, they invariably warn the clients not to talk to anyone
in any circumstance about the case. Prosecutors, the lawyers
caution, might use the conversation, even if it seems innocuous, to
bring an obstruction of justice charge.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Silbert, who was the first Watergate prosecutor and who is
now a criminal defense lawyer in Washington, described his approach
this way: ``I will tell my client, `Look, they're investigating you
for X. Based on what I know, I don't think they have a very good
case. You can do something stupid and illegal and you can destroy
documents and get someone to lie, and you will give the government
a very easy case. If you don't do that, there may not be a case
against you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Luskin said that Clinton's personal lawyers must have warned the
president not to talk about the case. But based on reports of their
accounts, Clinton seems to have ignored the advice when he met with
Ms. Lewinsky and Mrs. Currie.
</P>
<P>
   Luskin recalled several instances when his clients had been
charged with obstruction after they disregarded his warning to keep
their mouths shut. ``It's very hard advice for people to take,'' he
said.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Made-to-measure'' refers to a tailor-made shirt, suit or gown,
something that was once available only to the wealthy few. In time,
that custom fit may be readily available to the average mall
shopper as well, thanks to three-dimensional body scans.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year or so, experts say, some consumers are likely to
find such computer scans available at a handful of locations
ranging from the Mall of America to Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Technology being developed in the fashion industry in the United
States and abroad is likely to make so-called mass customization a
reality rather than an oxymoron.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the capability,'' said Stephen Gray, head of the
Computer Clothing Research Center at Nottingham Trent University in
England. ``If people have been through our body scanners, we can
have their data on a smart card that gives the retailer all the
information necessary to fit the individuals, who can, in turn, use
the Internet to look at fabrics and position the garment on a
personalized mannequin of their body type.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, body scanners can be found mainly at a few research
sites and special effects studios. While clothing manufacturers and
retailers are intensely interested in the new technology, they are
aware of the many roadblocks on the way to consumer acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   One problem is what Dick Yardley, a manufacturing technology
specialist at the American Apparel Manufacturers Association, calls
the modesty factor: ``Some people don't want everyone to see what
they look like in a skintight body stocking.'' There are, too, the
inevitable glitches that will occur when consumers trust the same
technology to design their clothes that has created a new meaning
for the word ``'bug'' and threatens worldwide disruptions in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology is amazing,'' said Andree Conrad, editor of
Apparel Industry Magazine, ``but inevitably problems will occur.
And, granted that the fit is far better than off-the-rack, will
consumers be willing to pay for it?
</P>
<P>
   ``The American public is so price-conscious that it has pushed
the cost of garments way down. Is it actually going to say, `I'm
willing to pay 20 percent more for a good fit?' Right now, what
they're willing to do is take 40 garments into the waiting room and
try them all on _ and then say how much they hate to shop when they
get home.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Blackwood, a vice president at J.C. Penney, the nationwide
chain of department stores, agrees that price is the defining issue
for the American market. ``Europeans are willing to spend more for
their clothing than Americans,'' he said. ``When you customize, the
cost is higher. We think the scanners have tremendous potential,
but it's not going to happen tomorrow for us. We have to refine the
process to get the scanning and manufacturing costs down to what
the customer is willing to pay and shrink the scanners, too. The
amount of square footage they take up is not economical.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, problems and all, manufacturers and retailers, many of
them in the high-end office-clothes market, are starting to come
forward to embrace the body scanner, bulky though it may be,
although few have yet bought.
</P>
<P>
   Homi Patel, president and chief operating officer of Hart,
Schaffner &AMP; Marx, a major manufacturer of men's clothing in the
United States, is working with a research and training operation in
Cary, N.C., that has developed its own scanner. That organization,
called (TC)2 (for the Textile/Clothing Technology Corp.; it is
pronounced tee cee squared) involves more than 100 clothing
manufacturers, including J.C. Penney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably we'll work with department stores to have scanning
equipment available and then connected directly into our management
information systems to develop custom garments at quick speeds,''
Patel said. ``True, the scanning machines won't have the charm of a
good salesman, but people will get acclimatized. Young people will
have no trouble; older people will need more time.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if body scanning is slow to spread to mass markets,
accurate information on body shape could have a profound effect on
the clothing industry. ``Even in the shops,'' Gray said, ``fit is
going to be better as we acquire more accurate data about our body
shapes.''
</P>
<P>
   Those interested in the new technology of digital fashion
include Edith Gazzuolo, who expects to operate her scanner at the
Mall of America, near Minneapolis; Kathryn Chase, a chemical
engineer and ardent seamstress who hopes to open her own scanning
parlor at an Atlanta shopping center, and Brooks Brothers, the home
of the button-down shirt.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Brooks Brothers has had striking success in the past year with
its fledgling computer-assisted shirt-customization program, which
began last August. Joe Dixon, a senior vice president for
manufacturing at Brooks Brothers, said, ``If you have the ability
to give people exactly what they want, it's a differentiator.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, customers for custom shirts are fitted the traditional
way, with a tape measure. Then software adapts the standard Brooks
Brothers pattern to specific measurements _ for example, making one
sleeve longer than the other _ before the material is cut and sewn.
Delivery is promised in about two to three weeks; prices start at
$75.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pleasantly surprised by the level of business we've
generated,'' Dixon said. ``We started with a catalog announcement,
and only recently rolled the program out to all the stores. We are
already seeing a nice uptake.'' He said he expected the
special-order business to grow. ``We're working with a couple of
companies on body scanners,'' Dixon said, ``and when we think it's
right for us, we'll go ahead. There's no doubt scanning works for
made-to-measure. We just need to make sure that when a customer
comes in and has to strip to underwear that the customer really
wants to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Levi Strauss, the jeans maker, has had a custom-fit program for
women's jeans for several years, using measurements taken by
employees. Ike Behar, a high-end shirt company that has boutiques
in Neiman Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman and many other stores, does
about 20 percent of its business in custom-fitted shirts but does
not use scanners yet. Alan Behar, president of the company, said:
``Body scanning is going to become a necessity.
</P>
<P>
   The shirt is the closest thing to the body. The shoulder, chest
and arm holes are particularly difficult to measure for comfort.''
Behar said that his customers were exercising more and that the
shirt's fit had to reflect this. He is not worried about customer
reaction to scanners, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is Ms. Chase, who is searching for capital to open her
Atlanta scanning center and a related Web site. Describing her test
of a scanner, she said: ``It's almost like a carnival ride. The
equipment is draped in black theatrical cloth to keep out the
light. You go in, get down to your underwear, put your feet on the
white marks and press the button. Lights flash, music plays _ it
only takes a few seconds _ and you have all the data the
pattern-making software needs for a custom fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chase got the idea for her business in part from observing
her two daughters. ``They both have the same measurements _ waist,
hips, bust _ but there are very few items that they can trade back
and forth,'' she said. ``They don't look good in the same clothes.
With 3-D, we'll have a better way of knowing how we actually look
in the clothes we want to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Body scanners are crucial to made-to-measure clothing for the
masses; the technology takes measurements so patterns can be
altered for individual customers.
</P>
<P>
   `Traditionally, tailors have taken these measurements for their
own pattern-altering methods,'' said David Bruner, manager of
research and development at (TC)2, ``but when you compare one
tailor's measurements to another, it turns out each is making an
educated guess; in fact, it's all guesswork _ the measurements are
notoriously inconsistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Both two- and three-dimensional scanners are being used for the
body measurements that are the basis for mass customization. In
England, the Computer Clothing Research unit at Nottingham Trent
University has measured more than 8,000 people. The center uses a
system of side profiles and front outlines that is less expensive
than point-to-point three-dimensional scanning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were concerned that larger ladies, say size 32, would be
unwilling to expose themselves in their underwear,'' Gray said.
``But when we ran a piece on local radio two years ago, we had
women queuing at the door. They said, `No one understands our
clothing problems.' They were glad to volunteer.''
</P>
<P>
   Full-color three-dimensional scanning of the entire body is
being used by the United States Air Force. After all, pilots wear
clothing, too, and helmets. ``Everyone is interested,'' said
Kathleen M. Robinette, an anthropologist and mathematician at
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio who is managing a program
called Caesar, for Civilian American and European Surface
Anthropometry Resource, the first large-scale whole-body
three-dimensional scanning project ever done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that 3-D is here,'' she said, ``We can measure bodies
quickly and accurately in a way that tape measures could never
accomplish. The technology will be applied in ways that haven't
even been imagined yet.'' Caesar will measure 10,800 men and women
of varying weights and ages, 4,000 of them in the United States and
6,800 in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to learn for the first time what we're shaped
like,'' said Ms. Robinette, manager of engineering anthropometry,
the study of human body measurements, for the Air Force. ``The data
will help us create realistic computer mannequins to build
made-to-measure garments on. It will yield many software tools for
the design and production of customized clothing. But it's also
going to help for better-fitting clothing in general. Right now,
there are many errors as we go from the person to a flat pattern.
We'll finally take away the guesswork. It may even lead to
consistent sizes across brands.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military has been interested in body measurement since
the 1930s because of its responsibility for uniforms and gear that
must fit properly, like helmets and gas masks. ``By 1980, we agreed
there had to be a better way than tape measures,'' Ms. Robinette
said. ``We were disposed to 3-D automated scanning methods.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base bought a head-scanning
system and developed software for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scanner was being used for a `Star Trek' movie,'' Ms.
Robinette said. ``The studio was concerned with artistry, but we
wanted accuracy. So we developed software not only to drive the
scanner and analyze the data but for applications related to
apparel.''
</P>
<P>
   The data became the basis for things like tight-fitting fighter
pilot helmets, oxygen masks and night vision goggles. ``Now we're
moving on, from head scans to full-body ones,'' Ms. Robinette said.
``Our last full-scale survey was done in 1939, and a lot has
changed since then: people's bodies, even our concept of fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray, of Nottingham Trent, agrees. ``Human size and shape have
changed in the McDonald's years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He credits a small part of the change to undergarments. ``Lycra
holds things in, but not with the supportive properties of
whalebone, so nipples are about 5 inches lower,'' he explained.
``But there's also the rest of us. Men are more round-shouldered,
and almost every person we surveyed has a stomach sticking out. In
general, we're not only taller than our parents _ we are fatter.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray says virtual reality software would be only one of many
benefits from body scanning. ``The advantages will come as well
from understanding the size of people and making patterns better,''
he said. ``As the body grows, different bits grow at different
rates. Gravity alone means a bigger bust is lower than a smaller
one. The stomach protrudes around the sides as well as the front.
People want clothing to disguise the bad and emphasize the good; we
need good data on body shape to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Caesar project is expected to yield data useful across
industries. Its partners include not only apparel companies, like
Lee, Levi Strauss and Vanity Fair, but also other companies with an
interest in body shapes and how they are changing, like Boeing and
Caterpillar.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Pollack of the Society of Automotive Engineers, which is
coordinating many administrative functions for the huge project,
said there had been no lack of volunteers to be scanned so far.
``Everyone has the experience of sitting in a car or airplane seat
that is too small,'' he said. ``People want their dimensions looked
at and used.''
</P>
<P>
   Digital fashion may one day provide not only physical benefits,
like clothes that fit better, but also psychological benefits:
shoppers may be able to to try on clothes without specifying their
size or weight, which many are reluctant to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hate to say our size,'' said Linda Freedman, vice president
for marketing at Modacad, a Los Angeles company that produces
software for electronic commerce. ``And everyone _ well, nearly
everyone _ lies about their weight. Don't you on your driver's
license?''
</P>
<P>
   Starting this August, Modacad will offer a CD-ROM intended to
let young women shop for clothes by using 3-D models of different
body types to try on their selections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ask them to choose a shape, but we don't use words like
`pear-shaped' or any other expressions like that. I'm a pear,
myself, but I don't want to be called one,'' Ms. Freedman said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, digital fashion has produced Kevlar-lined suit jackets
that don't rub a bodyguard's chest and snug-fitting helmets and gas
masks that would please even Darth Vader.
</P>
<P>
   As to whether scanning and virtual try-ons will transform
cabbage leaves into Cary Grants _ given a technology that routinely
messes up our monthly bills and crashes when loaded with too many
Web sites _ it's entirely possible we'll end up looking more like
Charlie Chaplin than the Prince of Wales.

<P>
   MUSICALS-REVIVALS (subslug) (New York) _ Audiences flocking to
the Martin Beck Theater for the current revival of ``The Sound of
Music'' could care less that many critics find the musical
irredeemably saccharine. With its famously tuneful score, this 1959
show, the last Rodgers and Hammerstein collaboration, is
comfortingly familiar. People watch dazed with happiness, bobbing
their heads, along with the Von Trapp children as they learn their
do, re, mi's, smiling with recognition as Maria lists her favorite
things. There is no glitz, no benumbing spectacle, no blaring
rock-ified orchestra, just good old-fashioned musical value and an
uplifting story. By Anthony Tommasini. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   GABRIELE-MUNTER-ART (Undated) _ ``Gabriele Munter: The
Expressionist Years, 1903-1920,'' an exhibition of 70 paintings,
drawings and prints at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond
through Sept. 20. For students and knowledgeable admirers of
20th-century art, Munter (1877-1962) is little more than an elusive
presence in the annals of German Expressionism. For decades she has
been mentioned in these histories, when mentioned at all, as pupil
and companion of the Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky. By Roberta
Smith. (Moved).

of the graduate acting program at Columbia University,
``Cymbeline'' opens Sunday night as part of the New York
Shakespeare Festival's 43rd season. By Andrea Stevens. (Moved).

</P>
<P>
   AYCKBOURN-THEATER (London) _ It is no secret that, after 53
plays, Alan Ayckbourn relishes a challenge. And in play No. 49,
``Communicating Doors,'' the task he has posed for himself is this:
how to mold a comic thriller _ or even a scary farce _ while at the
same time shuttling his characters back and forth in time with an
abandon many a filmmaker might envy. By Matt Wolf. (Moved).

   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;

<P>
   KRIS-KRISTOFFERSON-FILMS (Undated) _ If sentimentality is the
tendency to show more than one feels, Kris Kristofferson is the
opposite of sentimental: the man who feels so much that he cannot
help but show it. He is what he wrote about, a walking
contradiction _ a Rhodes scholar propelled though life less by
reason than by impulse; a Golden Gloves boxer blessed with a poet's
understanding of irredeemable loss and late-night yearnings. Rugged
yet capable of being wounded, solitary yet reachable, he veers
between two styles: supremely laid back and wound tighter than
most. By Elizaeth Kaye. (Moved). Photo.

   ZEMLINSKY-MUSIC (Undated) _ The centenary of Alexander von
Zemlinsky's birth, 1971, prompted the first flurry of his music
revivals. In the 1980s his operas were brought back to life, and
there were several important recordings. Now James Conlon is
pressing the case again, with five Zemlinsky albums recorded under
his baton for EMI Classics in Cologne, Germany, and more to come.
By Paul Griffiths. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BOTSTEIN-MUSIC (Undated) _ Who, in musical history, could have
guessed that a meddlesome figure like Leon Botstein would come
along? Not Mendelssohn, obviously. ``In everything I have written
down there is at least as much deleted as there is allowed to
stand,'' the composer told a friend around 1842. ``My `St. Paul'
originally had a third more numbers, which shall never see the
light of day.'' But Botstein, the American academic turned
conductor and festival director, has exposed those numbers to the
full glare of recordings. By James R. Oestreich. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   YIDDISH-MUSIC (Undated) _ For more than a century, Yiddish music
has survived in America. The melodic vernacular of displaced Jews
from Eastern Europe, it is a music of secular wit and religious
fervor, the music of a people in a conflicted dance with
assimilation. By Barry Singer. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   ADAM-COHEN-MUSIC (Undated) _ Adam Cohen, 26, the son of Leonard
Cohen, deserves points for jumping in over his head and infusing
some passion into a moribund folk-pop tradition. In the best songs
from his debut album ``Adam Cohen'' (Columbia) _ the nasty,
tormented ones _ this talented but still partly unformed songwriter
forces you to feel his anger, jealousy and frustration over various
erotic entanglements. By Stephen Holden. (Moved).

   BOEING-LAYOFFS (Seattle) After two years of building up
employment, The Boeing Co. is beginning its plan to cut up to
28,000 jobs by the end of next year with the first round of layoffs
scheduled to become effective in early December, according to
company documents. The first major round of federally mandated
60-day warn notices are scheduled to be issued to workers in
Boeing's commercial aircraft division Oct. 2, with the layoff
becoming effective Dec. 4. Also, wrap in that Boeing will announce
737 assembly line in California Thursday.

   WHALES-MAKAHS (Undated) Week after week, Will Anderson camped on
Baja beaches, lulled to sleep by the sound of gray whales spouting
and the rhythm of the tides. Each morning, he awoke to the
breathing of the great beasts. Now Anderson and activists like him
around the world have joined a passionate battle to stop the
Makah's whale hunt this fall off Washington's remote Olympic
Peninsula. It doesn't make a difference to Anderson, an organizer
with the Progressive Animal Welfare Society, that the Makah are an
indigenous people whose culture is defined by thousands of years of
hunting whales. To Anderson, hunting gray whales _ animals he calls
friendly and intelligent _ is just plain wrong.

   MICROSOFT-GORTON (Washington) Sen. Slade Gorton's advocacy for
Microsoft is being rewarded with campaign contributions from
company executives. During the first six months of this year, 23
Microsoft executives have contributed to Gorton, even though the
state's 70-year-old senior senator isn't currently a candidate for
anything and hasn't announced whether he plans to seek re-election
in 2000. The contributions are far more numerous than ever received
by Gorton from the Redmond-based software giant. In 1997, he
received contributions from eight Microsoft executives, in 1996
none, and in 1995 he received just one contribution, from the
company chairman and chief executive officer, Bill Gates.

   Young idealists, they simply wanted to make a quiet statement in
support of democracy. But the simple act of handing out leaflets
has landed 18 foreign activists, including Atlantan Nisha Anand, in
police custody in Myanmar, the Asian nation formerly known as
Burma.
</P>
<P>
   No charges have yet been filed, but the democracy advocates _
six of them Americans and four, like Anand, students at American
University in Washington _ could be sentenced to as long as 10
years in jail if convicted of violating the censorship laws
enforced by Myanmar's military dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew they were going, but I didn't know they were doing
this,'' said Doug Steele, spokesman for the Washington-based
nonprofit The Burma Fund. The group initially traveled to Southeast
Asia to visit a Burmese refugee camp just inside Thailand. The
students from American University had raised several thousand
dollars for the refugees with a dinner earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The leaflets they later handed out in Myanmar's capital, Yangon,
carried the message ``Don't forget _ Don't give up'' and the date
8-8-88, a reference to Aug. 8, 1988, when soldiers fired on a
pro-democracy demonstration, killing many civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Anand graduated from American University this spring, and is
scheduled to begin graduate study there this fall. She and others
in the group were described by friends and family as ``very
idealistic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very much into peace and love,'' said her mother, Ginny
Guzman of Duluth, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were handing out pamphlets. That's all they were doing,''
said Matt McMillan, a friend of Anand who works for her father,
Vijay, at Canterbury Engineering in Chamblee, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   But that can be dangerous in Myanmar, where police arrested the
activists Sunday and then held them for questioning without
allowing them access to their governments' embassies until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   State television showed pictures of the group Wednesday and
reported that all were being treated well. Anand, who suffers from
asthma, has been allowed to receive medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The government could opt to deport the detainees _ including
three Thais, three Malaysians, three Indonesians, two Filipinos and
one Australian _ but officials said they are still investigating
the incident. The Agence France-Presse news agency quoted state
television as reporting Tuesday that the activists had been trained
in sabotage and were intent on destablizing the country. The charge
was characterized as ludicrous by supporters of the group.
</P>
<P>
   Vijay Anand said his daughter believes in civil disobedience but
is firmly committed to nonviolent methods. ``Obviously, as parents,
we support her. But (this situation) is very tough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.), chairman of the House International
Relations Subcommittee on International Operations and Human
Rights, is attempting to gain entry into Myanmar to verify the
group's safety. Smith left Washington for Thailand Wednesday to
press Burmese officials to grant him a visa.
</P>
<P>
   ``A denial of my visa will only raise the specter that the
Burmese military government does not want a speedy resolution of
this crisis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Steele said the situation is very tense because Myanmar's
national economy is in collapse and pro-democracy groups have
called for a mass campaign of civil disobedience if the military
does not allow a parliament, elected in 1990, to be seated by Aug.
21.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clock is ticking on this. They could end up as hostages,''
he said.

HARLEM RENAISSANCE MEETS MARTHA STEWART 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ELAINE LOUIE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Five years ago in Harlem, Andre Harrell, then the
president of a record label called Uptown Entertainment, had a
design epiphany.
</P>
<P>
   He went to a cocktail party at Graham Court, at 116th Street and
Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard; walked into the apartment of
Warner Johnson, the managing director of Axicom Online.com, a
Web-based telephone company, and found the look that had been
eluding him. Harrell had made stars of Mary J. Blige, Jodeci and
Heavy D., but he was still a music producer in search of a design
sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   Then he saw Johnson's apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Harlem Renaissance _ classic, masculine,'' Harrell said
recently as he sat in the kitchen of his country house in Westport,
Conn., right across the street from Martha Stewart, whom he met a
year ago but whom he hasn't bumped into since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the rooms,'' said Harrell, who is 37. ``He had a
pool table. Moldings. Warm wood. Dark blue walls. I liked the
warmth. That's like my personality.'' He paused. ``Stylish,'' he
said, ``without trying too hard.'' Then he laughed.
</P>
<P>
   If personality was judged by clothing, then he was what he wore:
stylish and casual in a gray T-shirt, snug but not too snug, and
beautifully cut Armani cream-colored silk pants that draped
perfectly over his Gucci loafers.
</P>
<P>
   At the party, Harrell also met Sheila Bridges, an interior
designer who lived in the building. ``The apartment was a mix of
bold, deep colors _ dark reds and blues _ and lots of furniture
from Paris, like old velvet club chairs, lots of antiques _
American Empire, Directoire _ African mahogany paneling, sisal
rugs,'' Ms. Bridges, 34, said. ``It looked very rich. It looked
like someone who is well traveled, who has knowledge of history.''
Harrell wanted his own version of a Harlem Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said to me, `If you find me an apartment, I'll let you
decorate it,''' she said. She found one in two weeks. Still, it
took 30 phone calls to close the deal. Since then, she has designed
a second Manhattan apartment for Harrell and has just finished his
white clapboard 1940s house in Westport, which he bought last year.
</P>
<P>
   Harrell grew up in the Bronxdale housing project, in the
Soundview section of the Bronx. ``It was standard project decor,''
he said. ``Plastic slipcovers on the velvet couch.'' In 1983, when
he was 22, he rented his first apartment, a studio in Lefrak City
in Rego Park, Queens. His roommate was Russell Simmons _ from
Queens. Simmons, the rap impresario, remembers that apartment
complex. ``The pool never had water _ ever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By 1990, he had acquired another roommate: hip-hopper Sean
(Puffy) Combs, then an intern at Harrell's company. ``He told me he
and his mother were arguing, and could he move into my house,''
Harrell said. He was supposed to stay a week; he stayed six months.
</P>
<P>
   During those years, Harrell had moved from one rented apartment
to another, from the outer boroughs to Manhattan to a house in
Closter, N.J., where in 1992 he gave a Champagne brunch for 300
people for Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown the day after their
wedding.
</P>
<P>
   As he became more successful, Harrell's taste evolved. One
apartment was French Art Deco, ``very young jet set, shiny red and
yellow like the Mondrian Hotel.'' The New Jersey house was Italian
modern. ``I was trying to get something esthetically pleasing to my
eye,'' he said. After he saw Johnson's home in Harlem, he knew he
wanted his own version of what he calls ``high Negro.'' ``What I
like about working with Sheila,'' he said, ``is she takes the time
to educate you. She'd come with books, and we'd look at pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked Tricia Guild,'' he said, referring to the British
designer, who is known for bold colors.
</P>
<P>
   He also liked red and green, plaids and stripes, big sofas and
old painted furniture. Ms. Bridges showed him fabrics and colors.
There was always a debate. ``I want them bright, she wants them
quiet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, they compromised. She gave him lots of reds and
greens but in subtle shades, like milk-painted tables, striped
sofas, weathered sideboards and chairs _ set against a soothing
background of khaki, cream, taupe and white.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Harlem Renaissance, country style. An
easy-to-live-in quasi-rural perfection: classic moldings glow under
fresh white paint, rustic iron chandeliers hang over distressed
painted tables, chairs have faded stenciling, and art by
African-Americans _ paintings by Danny Simmons (Russell's brother),
photographs by Gordon Parks _ hang on the walls.
</P>
<P>
   The two-story, four-bedroom house is a home that a child can run
around in, where a visitor can entertain himself. There's a pool,
bikes to be ridden, and soon there will be a tennis court. The
scale is masculine _ big sofas and chairs, even big oval bars of
soap. But the details _ the topiaries in the kitchen, the painted
cupboard, the striped satiny cottons _ warm the house. It's the
kind of place Martha Stewart would love.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen has polished granite counters. Against the wall is a
gently beat-up blue wood cupboard. On the shelves sit thick
handblown Mexican glasses edged in cobalt. It's a generous kitchen
where there's plenty of room to peer into the stockpot and see
what's cooking.
</P>
<P>
   In the living room, the same palette prevails: peach and cream,
tranquil reds and greens. Windows face the pool and the newly
planted garden. Purple cosmos, pale pink roses and yellow
rudbeckia, which look like small sunflowers with furry brown
centers, stand upright, so new to the ground that they haven't
begun to nod.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a wind-down home, my private hideaway,'' Harrell said.
His son, Gianni, who is 3{, and Gianni's mother, Wendy Credle, who
is studying for the bar exam, retreat there. Simmons, too.
</P>
<P>
   Harrell's favorite spot is the family room. Here, too, the
furniture is red or green, but few would notice, so deft is Ms.
Bridges' hand: the green leather chair is the color of evergreens
on a cloudy day.
</P>
<P>
   Cream-colored cabinets hide his favorite toy: a 900-channel
television fed by a satellite dish. As he surfed the channels,
skipping through the 400 series, which are about sex, ``Hot Body''
flashed by. ``Some things you don't want to watch,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Settling into an easy chair, Harrell is serene, even though a
$25 million deal with Sony fell through this year, and last year he
resigned from Motown Records after a troubled 22 months. ``The
record biz is no walk in the garden,'' he said. ``I'm going back to
managing artists. I enjoy working with new artists, but I get
EXCITED about working with big stars.''
</P>
<P>
   That afternoon, he would be driving to Manhattan to have lunch
with Chris Rock. He said he was talking to Mariah Carey. Maybe he'd
buy a house in Florida and build a recording studio there.
</P>
<P>
   When a visitor mentioned that Spike Lee was leaving Brooklyn and
had bought a town house in Manhattan, Harrell asked WHERE in
Manhattan. When told it was on the Upper East Side, he laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that about keeping real _ they're faking!'' he said.
``They want to keep it FABULOUS!''
</P>
<P>
   Then he laughed again. It was a cloudless day, and in the
distance through a window, Long Island Sound was only slightly
obscured by a sun-lighted haze. ``I never claimed not to want to
live well,'' he said.

IN CAMBODIA, MUSEUM WORKERS UNDER SIEGE FROM BY BAT GUANO  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH MYDANS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ The mystical statues of ancient Angkor,
with their enigmatic smiles, sit in the damp and almost empty
National Museum here, enveloped in an ethereal twittering.
</P>
<P>
   It is the twittering of millions of tiny bats, roosting under
the leaking roofs and eaves of the museum _ the most dangerous
threat to the preservation of these ancient treasures, but also a
one of their chief benefactors.
</P>
<P>
   Since the days of the Khmer Rouge 20 years ago when the museum
was abandoned and the bat population exploded, its curators have
sought ways to drive them out. They are trying again today, but
they are meeting resistance from people who say the museum needs
the bats.
</P>
<P>
   There are sounds of heavy lifting in the museum's musty halls
these days as men with a mechanical winch heft the last of the
statues back onto their pedestals after a triumphal yearlong tour
of the grandest museums of France, the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   They returned unharmed from their journey, said the museum's
director, Khun Samen. But here at home they are in peril. Bat guano
is killing them.
</P>
<P>
   In flecks and black crumbs and noxious dust, it falls and
flutters constantly from the false ceiling that encloses the upper
reaches where the bats roost. It mixes with leaking monsoon
rainwater and seeps like coffee stains through the split and
sagging wooden ceiling and down the museum's walls.
</P>
<P>
   It accumulates _ filled with tiny worms _ on the elaborate
carved headdresses of the statues, on their shoulders, their folded
knees and the creases of their garments, where it turns to sticky
and corrosive slime and eats into the sandstone and bronze.
</P>
<P>
   It fills the air with an acrid, ammoniac stink that mixes here
and there with the sweetness of incense and jasmine that museum
workers place reverently before the holiest of the Buddhist and
Hindu statues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statues are all right as long as we sweep,'' said Khun
Samet. ``But if we stopped sweeping they would be buried.''
</P>
<P>
   At dawn and at noon, museum workers sweep and dust, gathering _
and saving _ more than 20 pounds of bat guano each day.
</P>
<P>
   Periodically the more agile of the workers cover their faces
with cotton cloths and climb above the ceiling, where they gather
another half a ton of bat guano a month, said the museum's deputy
director, Oun Phalline.
</P>
<P>
   Khun Samet is determined that the time has come to put an end to
all this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love bats too,'' he said, as if anticipating a backlash.
``But in the whole world there is not another museum with bats. In
the Louvre and the Metropolitan, there are no bats. I think in your
own home you would not want bats.''
</P>
<P>
   He is near an agreement with a French charitable organization to
build an uncompromising new plaster ceiling and seek ways to keep
out the bats, perhaps using wire mesh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let them go live somewhere else,'' said Bernarde Porte, who
heads the museum's restoration and conservation department. ``Let
them live at the Royal Palace.''
</P>
<P>
   But things are not that simple. The museum needs the bats. It
receives no government funding in this poverty-ridden nation, and
it is broke. Its employees have not been paid for two months.
</P>
<P>
   And bat guano sells as fertilizer at the central market for 18
cents a pound. For years the museum has been earning more than $300
a month from the guano trade, which it uses to subsidize its
operations and keep its employees from starving.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use it to buy office supplies and cleaning supplies,'' said
Mrs. Oun Phalline. ``And part of it we give to the staff to support
their living expenses.''
</P>
<P>
   A museum guide, Mao Vuthy, said the sale of bat guano had helped
support his family for nearly 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can eat the bats too,'' he said eagerly. ``They can be
fried like chicken. They are good with wine or beer. I will be
sorry to lose the bats.''

   NEW YORK _ The Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, a small
museum in Ridgefield, Conn., plans to present a variation of an
exhibition on the nude in 20th-century art that was canceled last
month by the Whitney Museum of American Art. The show, opening next
June, will include an installation by Karen Finley, a drawing class
in which she and others will participate as nude models.
</P>
<P>
   In canceling the exhibition, ``The Great American Nude,'' the
Whitney said it was trying to cut costs so it could devote more
resources to its forthcoming Project of America, a series of shows
about the history of American art in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was announced days after Ms. Finley and three other
performance artists lost a case before the U.S. Supreme Court, with
justices voting 8-1 to uphold a decency test for federal arts
grants.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitney said the cancellation had nothing to do with the
court case and that the show might eventually even be rescheduled.
But Ms. Finley and other artists criticized the Whitney's move as a
form of censorship and predicted that it would make it more
difficult for them to receive backing from the National Endowment
for the Arts and other agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Philbrick, the director of the Aldrich, said the museum's
exhibition was partly a response to the Whitney withdrawal. ``When
I heard about the cancellation, that jolted me in different ways,''
he said. ``I had wanted to do a show on the nude for some time, and
it dovetailed with our discussions about the issue of censorship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people think there is freedom of expression, but there is
a more insidious form of censorship, in terms of funding,'' he
said. Although nudity in art has ``been a staple for thousands of
years,'' Philbrick added, he expects the exhibition to be
controversial. The show is scheduled to run from June 13 to Sept.
12, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks after the cancellation, Willard Holmes, acting
director of the Whitney, acknowledged that there had been ``a
reaction from the art community and from people interested in
preserving First Amendment rights.'' His response was that there
was ``absolutely no chill at the Whitney'' and that the museum was
not acting as a censor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The importance of First Amendment rights and free speech has
been a continuing theme of this museum since it was founded by
Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney,'' Holmes said. ``If there is a
tradition in this museum, it is supporting the new voice, the
iconoclast, the person who goes against the grain.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently the Whitney named Maxwell Anderson as its new director,
replacing David Ross, who resigned last spring to become director
of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitney exhibition would have included art from the museum's
collection as well as Ms. Finley's drawing class. Because the
Aldrich does not have a permanent collection, the artworks in its
show will be drawn from other sources. Philbrick said it would
include sculpture, paintings, photography and probably video,
mostly by by American artists.

<P>
   The exhibition will occupy the entire museum, some 5,000 square
feet encompassing nine galleries, and an illustrated catalog is to
be published. Visitors will be invited to participate in the
drawing class.
</P>
<P>
   The show at the Whitney would have cost $300,000 to $400,000.
Mounting the smaller Aldrich exhibition will cost around $60,000,
Philbrick said.
</P>
<P>
   The drawing class installation, titled ``Go Figure,'' was first
presented last year at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los
Angeles. Ms. Finley has shown other work at the Aldrich. A copy of
her 1990 sculpture ``Black Sheep'' is in the museum's sculpture
garden.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking by telephone from Los Angeles, where she will soon be
directing her first film, ``Creating Kali,'' Ms. Finley said that
she was pleased that the Aldrich was mounting the exhibition but
that she was focusing her energies on other aspects of her career,
beginning with the film (written by Ms. Finley and Kamala Lopez and
starring Rosanna Arquette and Ms. Lopez).
</P>
<P>
   Still discouraged by the Whitney episode, she said, ``I have to
transform myself and leave the museum world for a while.''

   LENOX, Mass. _ The administrative battles at the Tanglewood
Music Center during the last 18 months seem to have had little
effect on the center's annual Festival of Contemporary Music, held
here this past week. That's not to say that the festival has
proceeded without change; and clearly there is more change to come.
But this festival has evolved steadily over decades, and few of
this year's changes seem to be echoes of the broader skirmish over
control of the center.
</P>
<P>
   One change that clearly is linked to the shake-up is Seiji
Ozawa's involvement. His conducting the student orchestra in
Takemitsu's ``November Steps'' in the final concert was regarded as
emblematic of the Boston Symphony Orchestra's assertion of dominion
over its summer music school, and the consensus here is that this
is a change for the better.
</P>
<P>
   A lesser change is that the festival, once a week long, has been
compressed to five days. But by offering concerts in the afternoons
and evenings _ and on Sunday at 10:30 a.m. _ it offered the same
number of performances as in recent years: six concerts and three
preconcert recitals, plus a partly related Boston Symphony
performance.
</P>
<P>
   There was, however, a troubling paucity of student works. In
past years, a few were heard on the main programs, including an
annually commissioned orchestral work. No commission was made last
year, and at this year's festival the only work by a recent
Tanglewood student was the String Quartet No. 3 by Shih-Hui Chen (a
1996 alumna), performed by the Arditti String Quartet in the
opening concert.
</P>
<P>
   The involvement of the Arditti and Reinbert de Leeuw, the Dutch
conductor who has directed the festival since 1994, argues that it
has not lost its credibility in new-music circles, as did an
appearance by Peter Serkin and the presiding presences of two
composers in residence, Henri Dutilleux and Mauricio Kagel, and
several other composers, among them Elliott Carter, Charles
Wuorinen and George Perle.
</P>
<P>
   This was de Leeuw's final festival; although he described the
recent administrative upheaval as saddening, he said that he had
always intended to hand over the reins after five years.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, he has used this year's festival to restate an
inclusive view of contemporary music in which abstraction and
programmatic writing, intellectual severity and inviting populism,
soulfulness and mechanical intricacy, and sobriety and pranks
intermingle freely and draw on one another's ideas.
</P>
<P>
   One of Kagel's works, ``General Bass,'' for solo accordion,
moved slowly; used easy, repeated intervals, and sounded like a
merciless parody of Minimalism. Yet Minimalism also had an honored
place at the table. de Leeuw led the orchestra in an account of
John Adams' ``Shaker Loops'' (1978, revised 1982) that brought out
the work's shifting chromatic nuances beautifully.
</P>
<P>
   Adams' newer piano duet, ``Hallelujah Junction'' (1998), though,
seemed oddly plodding; it could be that the student pianists were
unable to create the rhythmically pointed barrelhouse effect that
Adams was seeking, and ended up pounding instead.
</P>
<P>
   The younger generation of composers has grafted Minimalist
practices onto other styles: ``Song X,'' a piano work by Kenneth
Lampl, brought together Minimalist figuration and chordal melodies
that would be at home on a Dave Brubeck album. Jazz with an early
Miles Davis accent, as well as stylized references to flamenco,
made fleeting incursions by way of Thomas Ades' programmatic
dreamscape, ``Living Toys.''
</P>
<P>
   And rock found a back door into the festival through Matthew
Guerrieri's String Quartet (1998), a gorgeous, harmonically
ambiguous work in which the central movement is based on the chord
progression from the Beach Boys' ``God Only Knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Kagel's ``General Bass'' was unlike any of his other works at
the festival, yet a quirky sense of humor came through virtually
all of them. Often he amuses through harmonic surprises and
peculiar juxtapositions. In Quartet No. 4 (1993), which the Arditti
gave a tightly polished reading, the clever dissection of a
folklike melody was among the tricks in his arsenal. ``Westen,''
which Kagel conducted, hints at a cultural exchange gone haywire:
percussion instruments evoke African rhythms, and the rest of the
orchestra brings a European perspective. But while the interplay
suggests curiosity on both sides, the two styles never find common
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Another of Kagel's works, ``Fuerst Igor, Stravinsky'' (1982),
memorializes Stravinsky by way of a laconic, almost spoken
resetting of an aria from Borodin's ``Prince Igor.'' And his
``Etudes for Large Orchestra'' (1992-96) _ the final works played
at the festival, on Monday evening _ traded in big gestures and
strange combinations: a slow tuba melody, for example, overlaid
with a flurry of flutes. Kagel's ``Etudes,'' conducted by de Leeuw,
was also the most vivid display of how finely polished the
Tanglewood Music Center orchestra is.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the evidence was otherwise lacking. All through the
festival, the young musicians gave mostly stunning performances of
a demanding slate of chamber works, and when they came together for
the finale, they communicated freshness, excitement and a sense of
occasion. They supplied all the color and energy Peter Lieberson
demands in his ``Fire'' (1995), conducted by Stefan Asbury.
</P>
<P>
   And in Dutilleux's violin concerto, ``L'Arbre des Songes''
(1983-85), conducted by de Leeuw, they supplied the gossamer
textures necessary to support Irvine Arditti's eloquent reading of
the angular yet melodic solo line.
</P>
<P>
   In Takemitsu's ``November Steps,'' the players at first seemed
slightly at sea, but after a tentative start, Ozawa was able to
draw a confident performance from them. Like Kagel's ``Westen,''
this is a cross-cultural work in which assimilation proves
impossible. The Japanese instruments _ the lutelike biwa, played by
Kakujo Nakamura, and the shakuhachi flute, played by Katsuya
Yokoyama, both flown in from Japan for the performances _ hold the
spotlight so thoroughly that the orchestral music seems almost an
afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   Dutilleux's music was plentifully represented, and argued that
he should have a higher profile in the standard repertory. In works
like ``Ainsi la Nuit'' (1976), played by the Arditti, or ``Les
Citations'' (1985-90), a chamber piece with a supremely beautiful
oboe line, rendered with graceful virtuosity by Carolyn Banham, one
had to admire Dutilleux's magically shifting textures.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath his appealing surfaces though, Dutilleux speaks of
troubling issues: the second movement of ``Les Citations'' and
``The Shadows of Time,'' in which Ozawa led the Boston Symphony on
Sunday afternoon, come to terms with the dark side of the soul
through allusions to war and death.
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights are too numerous to discuss, but a few that
should be noted are Serkin's impassioned reading of Messiaen's
``Couleurs de la Cite Celeste'' (1963), with de Leeuw conducting;
Robert Zuidam's ``Nella Citta Dolente'' (1998), with its
magnificent eight-part vocal counterpoint; Wuorinen's ``River of
Light'' (1997), a shimmering, dramatically propulsive dance work,
and Carter's tough-edged and surprisingly lyrical Clarinet Concerto
(1996), played with vibrant virtuosity by Thomas Martin, with
Asbury conducting.

NO MORE `GARDEN SPOTS' AMONG US EMBASSIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS   AND ESTELLA DURAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When bombs ripped apart two US embassies last week,
the losses were not limited to people and property. A way of life
disappeared, too.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomats, secretaries and accountants who work at America's
288 embassies and consulates around the world have long divided
foreign postings into high-risk and low-risk assignments. But
Friday's bombings showed that even safer countries bring an
unexpected hazard: They have accessible, minimally protected
embassies that make inviting targets for terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, there really is the sense that no place is safe, not
even the so-called garden spots,'' said Myles Frechette, who has
served as an embassy official and ambassador in Latin America and
Africa during a 35-year career the Foreign Service.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department employee who has served in turbulent
countries in the former Soviet Union and elsewhere, put it this
way: ``It's hard to know where you can go and work without
endangering your family. ... This is a topic a lot of people are
talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most other employees interviewed, he is not authorized to
talk to the press and did not want to jeopardize his chances of
getting a desireable post the next time around.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the embassy bombings in Nairobi and Dar es
Salaam, young Foreign Service officers with children and officers
nearing retirement say they are reconsidering where they want to be
assigned, and even whether they should leave the professional
diplomatic corps.
</P>
<P>
   One diplomat stationed in Central America during the civil wars
there of the 1980s and Colombia during the drug cartel bombings of
the early 1990s was considering a posting in east Africa to
decompress at the end of her career.
</P>
<P>
   Not any more. ``I had been telling my daughter, `We'll go on
safaris,''' she said, ``but after Friday's attacks, she was reading
the newspaper and crying.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Miller, vice president of the American Foreign Service
Association, an organization of 23,000 active and retired members,
said those heading overseas consider everything from E-coli
outbreaks and blood supplies tainted by AIDS to air pollution and
threats from international terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're putting your health at risk, you're family's health at
risk, and sometimes your life at risk,'' he said. ``It scares a lot
of people. The risks seem to be growing.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, US government agencies find it increasingly
difficult to fill jobs overseas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like many veteran diplomats, Miller bristles at the image of
``striped-suit'' American envoys sipping wine at plush receptions.
In his 30 year-career, he has endured a police uprising in Cairo, a
threat of a coup in the Dominican Republic and tear gas wafting
through the air during a student rebellion in Panama.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Foreign Service and civil service employees who
work in US posts overseas have long realized that some countries
have unstable governments, poor hygiene and assorted hazards. The
State Department ranks assignments by threats from terrorism,
street crime and counterintelligence spying.
</P>
<P>
   The rankings include critical (such as Lebanon), high (Colombia,
Israel and Egypt), medium (Brazil) and low (France). The toughest
assignments come with salary bonuses of up to 40 percent for
hardship and danger duty.
</P>
<P>
   Five US ambassadors have been killed in the past three decades,
all in countries considered unstable or dangerous: Guatemala,
Sudan, Cyprus, Lebanon and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Nairobi, a large embassy that serves as a regional hub for the
State Department and other US agencies in east Africa, was
considered a desirable, low-risk assignment, aside from pervasive
street crime. As Frechette put it, ``The living is good, the food
is good and the disease level is good.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the US embassy hugged a downtown street clogged
with trucks and vendors. It did not have the high walls and small
windows that the US government has required of embassies built
since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's powerful bomb killed 12 Americans working at the
embassy _ more than any attack on a ``high-risk'' US embassy this
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Robert L. Pfaltzgraff, professor at Fletcher School of Law and
Diplomacy at Tufts University, said the bombings prove that
terrorism hits beyond those places traditionally considered
dangerous. ``If the goal is to strike at United States property,
United States citizens, it doesn't matter where you do it,'' he
said. ``You could do it in Tanzania, Kenya, or the very smallest
country with which we have diplomatic relations.''
</P>
<P>
   At the United States Information Agency, an employee who has
worked in Africa said the US government's rankings of threats tend
to be misleading. Argentina, for example, is rated as one of the
safest places and even the name of its capital, ``Buenos Aires,''
means ``good air.'' Yet in 1992, a bomb exploded at the Israeli
embassy in Buenos Aires, killing 30 people inside and next door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since last week, a lot of us have been wondering how to define
a safe post,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House announced Wednesday that it is putting together
a proposal to increase embassy security around the world and will
soon release an estimate of the cost. But spokesman P.J. Crowley
said Washington does not want to isolate its diplomats abroad.
``We're not going to create a 'fortress America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the State Department, Frechette said the irony for American
diplomats is that hostile Communist countries were often the safest
places to live. State security operations, which closely watched
foreign diplomats, ensured that the Americans were not robbed,
killed or kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   The new threats started to emerge with the end of the Cold War,
not the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, Frechette added. He knows.
When he began his careeer in the Foreign Service in 1963, terrorism
was a new threat. Since then, he has endured uprisings and a storm
of locusts in Chad as well as a Libyan plot to kill him in
Camaroon, where he was ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   While serving as ambassador to Colombia, he rode in a helicopter
that was shot at by drug traffickers. Because of constant death
threats from guerrillas, he drove in a bulletproof car escorted by
vehicles filled with bodyguards everywhere he went.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always avoided assignments in Europe because I thought they
were too boring,'' he said. ``I would have fallen asleep.''

CONGO REBELLION A WAR OF WORDS AS WELL AS BULLETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo _ In this capital struck with war fever, the day
began with a breathless government announcement that made the
improbable claim that it had retaken the eastern provincial capital
of Bukavu and was building up for a knockout punch against rebel
positions throughout eastern Congo.
</P>
<P>
   But the rebels are eager not to lose the edge in a war that
seems to have become as much a battle of the airwaves as one of
enemies captured and body counts. A mutinous commander who was
regaling foreign journalists in the eastern regions quickly issued
a statement that the rebels who were leading a week-old uprising
against President Laurent Kabila were using their own DC-10
jetliner to ferry troops and weapons several times a day to a
fallen military base not far from this city.
</P>
<P>
   Even the normally reserved foreign diplomats who concede that
they are largely at a loss to know what is occurring felt the urge
to guffaw at that. ``Really,'' one diplomat asked, ``I think that
is a bit much, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   While agreed-on facts are about as slim as they come, what is
well established is that a sporadically violent conflict is under
way. On one side is the man whom foreign diplomats and many
Congolese consider a novice and a politically maladroit president.
On the other side are many of the people who helped put him in
power just over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   For Kabila the conflict is an outright invasion from his former
sponsors to the east, Rwanda and Uganda. Once again, he says, those
countries have allied with the community of Congolese Tutsi,
long-ago immigrants from Rwanda, who provided the backbone for
Kabila's own rebellion two years ago. This time, he contends
however, their aim is to annex territory.
</P>
<P>
   One form that revenge has taken is the old-fashioned witch hunt.
Thousands of Tutsi and people suspected of being Tutsi by virtue of
their appearance have been rounded up, and some have been beaten.
They are held at a military base for what the government now calls
``protective custody.''
</P>
<P>
   The insurgents say theirs is an authentic uprising of soldiers
and people thoroughly fed up with a leader whom they had hoped
would transform the country, but has instead turned out to be a
poor-man's copy of Mobutu Sese Seko, the dictator whom Kabila
overthrew.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats say it is certain that Rwanda has supported the
rebels, providing logistical help in the east and lending at least
some officers who seem to have carefully planned and executed the
effort to oust Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   That drive has included a quick seizure of the border cities in
the east and a stunning move by hijacked plane to capture a
military base in the far west, from which the rebels might strangle
or capture the capital. Whatever the claims on both sides, there
has been little action since.
</P>
<P>
   In taking the western base at Kitona, the rebels are known to
have scattered thousands of soldiers, both recent recruits and
members of Mobutu's disgraced army who were being ``re-educated.''
Congolese familiar with the army say where they have gone and where
their loyalties lie is anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   Just as uncertain is the fate of the 15,000 or more young
Congolese who are said to have volunteered for the war in the week
that the government has been pressing for volunteers who can be
rushed into service. The hate for Rwandans is so strong here that
young men can be seen sleeping overnight near the stadium that is
the recruiting site be sure they will enroll first thing in the
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Little else is clear, either, except that those who can afford
to flee have been taking the threat of generalized violence
seriously enough to begin leaving in large numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Lebanon have chartered jets for
evacuations. On Tuesday, South Africa Airways used a Boeing 747
jumbo jet for its regular run here rather than a much smaller
Airbus because of the huge number of people who had bought one-way
tickets out. At last count the waiting list for the flight on
Thursday stood at 200.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are just plain weary of all the trouble,'' one
departing businessman said. ``But what has made it even worse is
that nobody seems to have any idea of what is going on or what is
about to happen.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rumors eagerly propagated by both sides stoke that uncertainty.
In a representative hour Wednesday one visitor heard these claims:
The Mozambican air force is flying sorties in support of Kabila,
Cuba and Libya have begun supplying the government troops and arms,
the rebels have cut the oil pipeline for the capital and the sole
seaport, Matadi, is in the process of falling to the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the disinformation is that in Kabila's
seven-month rebellion against Mobutu, wild propaganda by the
invaders proved to be an even better weapon than infantry assault.
By merely announcing the arrival of his troops days before they
appeared, Kabila's public relations representatives, many of whom
are now working for the rebels, often managed to send the enemy
fleeing westward.
</P>
<P>
   The problem this time, however, is that both sides are engaging
in the same tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the government felt that it needed to say it had
retaken Bukavu, 1,000 miles northeast of Kinshasa on the Rwandan
border, one government official here said sheepishly, ``Because the
enemy keeps saying how close it is to Kinshasa.''

2D CERTIFICATION TEST STUMPS HALF OF TEACHING CANDIDATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JORDANA HART  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Almost half of aspiring teachers failed the second
certification test in July, according to results released
Wednesday, just as the outrage was subsiding over the 59 percent of
would-be teachers who failed Massachusetts' first test in April.
</P>
<P>
   Although the results are slightly better than those from the
April test, they are still not acceptable, state education
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   About 47 percent of 2,500 teaching candidates failed the July
test. About 700 of the July candidates were retaking all or part of
the test they failed the first time. Of the 148 who failed the
entire test the first time, only 6 percent -- nine people -- passed
it this time. All candidates can take the test again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the handwriting is on the wall. Those people need to
consider another career,'' said Interim Education Commissioner
David Driscoll. ``I think the focus needs to be on attracting the
best and brightest, and then a 100 percent (pass rate) won't sound
so unattainable. That's a reasonable goal for basic literacy and
subject matter tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the improvement in the passing rate, no one in the
state's educational hierarchy was celebrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly doesn't do any good for the morale of teachers
that are already in the classroom,'' said Stephen Gorrie, president
of the Massachusetts Teachers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Acting Governor Paul Cellucci again blamed the low scores on the
colleges and universities that train future teachers. ``The problem
is not with the test,'' he said. ``The problem is with people
coming out of the teacher colleges who are not prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci reiterated his proposal to require all schools of
education to have 80 percent of their graduating prospective
teachers pass the test to retain state accreditation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, testing experts Wednesday said no inferences can be
made about why the second batch of test-takers did better than the
first, particularly on the writing portion, because the Department
of Education and the testing company have yet to release
information about how the test was put together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know enough about the test,'' said George Madaus, a
Boston College education professor whose speciality is testing and
assessment. ``They say they equated these two tests, which is a
technical term. But I would like to know how they did that. Until I
know that, it is impossible to know whether the two tests weren't
comparable.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials said the April and July tests were both reviewed
for fairness, and found to be equally challenging.
</P>
<P>
   The exam comprises three parts: Basic comprehension skills,
divided into reading and writing, as well as a teacher candidate's
speciality, such as math or art.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-eight percent of those who took the test in July for the
first time passed the writing portion, compared to only 59 percent
in April. And 80 percent passed the reading portion, compared to 70
percent in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe part of the answer is that the extraordinary public
attention to the April results led July candidates to take the
tests more seriously,'' Driscoll said. He said a report on how
students from different universities performed on the test will be
released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sophi Sagall, an Emerson College student seeking to become a
drama teacher, said she failed the reading portion of the July test
by four points and will have to retake that portion at the next
test Oct. 3. She is slated to begin teaching drama at Wellesley
High School in September, but does not know how the school will
react to her failing the test.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nervous going in because of the attention,'' Sagall said
Wednesday. ``I knew no matter what score I got, I would be under
scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she was probably more prepared than the April
test-takers because she was able to talk with friends about the
questions, finding out for example that some questions required
definitions of such terms as ``preposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, many state lawmakers were on vacation this week and
not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Harold Lane Jr. (D-Holden), a former school
principal and co-chairman of the Legislature's education committee,
said he was pleased the pass rate had inched up, ``but it is not
enough. We have to be more attentive to how we prepare students.
And the deans of education schools are committed to doing something
about it.''

NO MORE `GARDEN SPOTS' AMONG US EMBASSIES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When bombs ripped apart two US embassies last week,
the losses were not limited to people and property. A way of life
disappeared, too.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomats, secretaries and accountants who work at America's
288 embassies and consulates around the world have long divided
foreign postings into high-risk and low-risk assignments. But
Friday's bombings showed that even safer countries bring an
unexpected hazard: They have accessible, minimally protected
embassies that make inviting targets for terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, there really is the sense that no place is safe, not
even the so-called garden spots,'' said Myles Frechette, who has
served as an embassy official and ambassador in Latin America and
Africa during a 35-year career the Foreign Service.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department employee who has served in turbulent
countries in the former Soviet Union and elsewhere, put it this
way: ``It's hard to know where you can go and work without
endangering your family. ... This is a topic a lot of people are
talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most other employees interviewed, he is not authorized to
talk to the press and did not want to jeopardize his chances of
getting a desireable post the next time around.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the embassy bombings in Nairobi and Dar es
Salaam, young Foreign Service officers with children and officers
nearing retirement say they are reconsidering where they want to be
assigned, and even whether they should leave the professional
diplomatic corps.
</P>
<P>
   One diplomat stationed in Central America during the civil wars
there of the 1980s and Colombia during the drug cartel bombings of
the early 1990s was considering a posting in east Africa to
decompress at the end of her career.
</P>
<P>
   Not any more. ``I had been telling my daughter, `We'll go on
safaris,''' she said, ``but after Friday's attacks, she was reading
the newspaper and crying.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Miller, vice president of the American Foreign Service
Association, an organization of 23,000 active and retired members,
said those heading overseas consider everything from E-coli
outbreaks and blood supplies tainted by AIDS to air pollution and
threats from international terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're putting your health at risk, you're family's health at
risk, and sometimes your life at risk,'' he said. ``It scares a lot
of people. The risks seem to be growing.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, US government agencies find it increasingly
difficult to fill jobs overseas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like many veteran diplomats, Miller bristles at the image of
``striped-suit'' American envoys sipping wine at plush receptions.
In his 30 year-career, he has endured a police uprising in Cairo, a
threat of a coup in the Dominican Republic and tear gas wafting
through the air during a student rebellion in Panama.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Foreign Service and civil service employees who
work in US posts overseas have long realized that some countries
have unstable governments, poor hygiene and assorted hazards. The
State Department ranks assignments by threats from terrorism,
street crime and counterintelligence spying.
</P>
<P>
   The rankings include critical (such as Lebanon), high (Colombia,
Israel and Egypt), medium (Brazil) and low (France). The toughest
assignments come with salary bonuses of up to 40 percent for
hardship and danger duty.
</P>
<P>
   Five US ambassadors have been killed in the past three decades,
all in countries considered unstable or dangerous: Guatemala,
Sudan, Cyprus, Lebanon and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Nairobi, a large embassy that serves as a regional hub for the
State Department and other US agencies in east Africa, was
considered a desirable, low-risk assignment, aside from pervasive
street crime. As Frechette put it, ``The living is good, the food
is good and the disease level is good.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the US embassy hugged a downtown street clogged
with trucks and vendors. It did not have the high walls and small
windows that the US government has required of embassies built
since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's powerful bomb killed 12 Americans working at the
embassy _ more than any attack on a ``high-risk'' US embassy this
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Robert L. Pfaltzgraff, professor at Fletcher School of Law and
Diplomacy at Tufts University, said the bombings prove that
terrorism hits beyond those places traditionally considered
dangerous. ``If the goal is to strike at United States property,
United States citizens, it doesn't matter where you do it,'' he
said. ``You could do it in Tanzania, Kenya, or the very smallest
country with which we have diplomatic relations.''
</P>
<P>
   At the United States Information Agency, an employee who has
worked in Africa said the US government's rankings of threats tend
to be misleading. Argentina, for example, is rated as one of the
safest places and even the name of its capital, ``Buenos Aires,''
means ``good air.'' Yet in 1992, a bomb exploded at the Israeli
embassy in Buenos Aires, killing 30 people inside and next door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since last week, a lot of us have been wondering how to define
a safe post,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House announced Wednesday that it is putting together
a proposal to increase embassy security around the world and will
soon release an estimate of the cost. But spokesman P.J. Crowley
said Washington does not want to isolate its diplomats abroad.
``We're not going to create a 'fortress America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the State Department, Frechette said the irony for American
diplomats is that hostile Communist countries were often the safest
places to live. State security operations, which closely watched
foreign diplomats, ensured that the Americans were not robbed,
killed or kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   The new threats started to emerge with the end of the Cold War,
not the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, Frechette added. He knows.
When he began his careeer in the Foreign Service in 1963, terrorism
was a new threat. Since then, he has endured uprisings and a storm
of locusts in Chad as well as a Libyan plot to kill him in
Camaroon, where he was ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   While serving as ambassador to Colombia, he rode in a helicopter
that was shot at by drug traffickers. Because of constant death
threats from guerrillas, he drove in a bulletproof car escorted by
vehicles filled with bodyguards everywhere he went.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always avoided assignments in Europe because I thought they
were too boring,'' he said. ``I would have fallen asleep.''

WOMAN BEHIND ANTI-GAY ADS SEES CHRISTIANS AS VICTIMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LAURIE GOODSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Over the last two and a half years, leaders
representing about 25 conservative Christian groups have been
meeting for private strategy sessions to discuss how to counter
what they see as the increasingly powerful ``homosexual lobby'' and
its legislative victories.
</P>
<P>
   The conservatives believed that their position was getting
clobbered: Gay people were adopting children, coming out on
television shows and persuading politicians to vote for
anti-discrimination laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``The final straw,'' said Janet Folger, a member of the strategy
group, came in June when Michael McCurry, the White House press
secretary, denounced Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader,
as ``backward'' for comparing homosexuality to alcoholism and
``kleptomania.''
</P>
<P>
   So, in a conference call to the group of conservative
strategists in Washington on June 24, Ms. Folger proposed taking
out full-page newspaper advertisements that would show ``former
homosexuals'' who ``overcame'' their sexual orientation through
prayer and the help of Christian ``ex-gay ministries.''
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements, which ran recently in seven major newspapers
with a combined circulation of nearly 8 million, infuriated gay
rights advocates and ratcheted up the intensity of the debate over
homosexuality. The advertising campaign also drew attention to its
architect, Ms. Folger, who raised more than $400,000 to pay for it,
and is now placing more ads.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Folger, who has recently appeared on ``Nightline'' and the
``ABC Evening News,'' has no formal training in human sexuality,
psychology or science. She has a master's degree in communications
from Cleveland State University, and once worked for a Christian
radio station writing and producing commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Janet is an example of what I like to think of as an issue
entrepreneur,'' said Ralph Reed, former executive director of the
Christian Coalition. ``Some entrepreneurs try to figure out what
the new hot stocks are. Janet is an ideological entrepreneur,
someone who tries to pick the hot new issues.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview here, Ms. Folger said she is convinced
that conservative Christians are victimized by a popular culture
that ridicules and dominates them.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over homosexuality illustrates her point, she said.
Gay rights groups have persuaded Americans that Christians who
condemn homosexuality are intolerant, she said, while actually it
is gay people and their supporters who are intolerant of
Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not advocating tolerance,'' Ms. Folger said. ``If that
were the case, they'd live and let live. Instead, they do things
like demand that the Boy Scouts change their position by accepting
homosexuality. And they will sue anyone who doesn't agree with
them. It's basically forcing people to embrace their behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last four years, Ms. Folger has traveled to churches and
conferences presenting a seminar and slide show on ``the assault
against Christians.'' She lectures that the media, the courts,
popular culture and the politicians are ``chipping away'' at the
rights of Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prayer police are roaming the halls'' of schools, she told the
``Reclaiming America for Christ Conference'' in Florida earlier
this year, ``looking not for guns, not for drugs, but for children
praying.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Until recently, Ms. Folger was a lobbyist for the Ohio Right to
Life Society and the major force behind Ohio's becoming the first
state to ban partial-birth abortion. She rallied state legislators
by referring to the procedure as ``brain suction abortion'' and
displaying gory posters.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is a very effective advocate, very articulate,'' said Doug
Johnson, federal legislative director of the National Right to Life
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ms. Folger was so relentless that several legislators barred
her from their offices, newspaper reports say. State Rep. John
Garcia, R-Toledo, who said he usually votes against abortion and
was not among those who evicted her from his office, recalled that
``she got me so frustrated that I was ready to vote for abortion
and get it out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Janet is good at what she does, but she comes on a little too
harsh,'' Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   After nine years with Ohio Right to Life, Ms. Folger said she
wanted to broaden her repertoire. When Reed left his job leading
the Christian Coalition in 1997 to become a political consultant,
Ms. Folger says she sought to replace him. But the job was given to
Donald Hodel, who was secretary of Energy and later secretary of
the Interior in the Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, Ms. Folger moved to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to
become national director of the Center for Reclaiming America, a
fledgling advocacy group started by the Rev. D. James Kennedy,
founder of Coral Ridge Ministries, a multimedia evangelical
organization.
</P>
<P>
   As a startup in the already crowded field of conservative
Christian public advocacy organizations, the Center was in search
of a strategy and a focus. Ms. Folger had been at work developing a
series of ``animated cartoons for children promoting biblical
values,'' she said, when she realized that the advertising campaign
on homosexuality was more timely.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's looking for a way to influence the debate,'' Reed said,
``and she's smart enough to know that it's easier to dive into a
topic that people are already talking about than to try and start a
new conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement that ran in The New York Times featured a
photograph of Anne Paulk, with a caption that read, ``Wife, mother
and former lesbian,'' and showed a portrait of men and women
gathered at a convention for Exodus, an ex-gay ministry. Ms. Folger
said she wanted to strike at the assumption that homosexuality is
an immutable trait and that gay people therefore need protection
under anti-discrimination laws.
</P>
<P>
   Gay rights groups quickly composed an opposing newspaper
advertisement to refute the claims. They maintain that only a small
percentage of those who seek help from ex-gay groups permanently
alter their sexuality, and that many more are emotionally scarred
by trying to change something they cannot.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are definitely some people who sincerely believe that
homosexuality is a sin, and that you should have compassion, but I
think that the advertisements are not being put out by those
people,'' said Cathy Renna, director of community relations for the
Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. ``The ads are being
put out by political operatives and religious extremists who are
trying to influence public opinion and political candidates, who
know that a very strident approach is not going to work.''

<P>
   QUINCY, Mass. _ He was his musical father's middle child _ a
smart and quiet kid who told corny jokes, savored science fiction
films and so ached to visit America that when the chance came
unexpectedly last month, he jumped at it.
</P>
<P>
   Gaelic football was Shane Patrick McGettigan's passion in his
native Drumshanbo, Ireland, a village of 700 just 25 miles south of
Northern Ireland. And football was his ticket to Massachusetts,
where he died Tuesday amid a jumble of steel tangled by tons of
brick, working the day job that was his pastime for a sport he took
more seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a big, strong, gentle type of a lad _ very
happy-go-lucky and very, very popular,'' said Eamonn McGowan, the
manager and trainer of the Allen Gaels, his team in County Leitrim,
Ireland. ``The whole town is totally devastated by this. Nobody can
believe this has happened. He's only been gone from Ireland for
three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   A month shy of his 22nd birthday, McGettigan and another Irish
workman, 23-year-old Ronan Stewart from County Louth, were killed
when a construction-site scaffolding collapsed at a Quincy
high-rise condominium.
</P>
<P>
   As federal officials investigate the cause of the collapse, and
families of the dead men prepare for the return home of their
bodies for burial, friends and teammates said McGettigan's grisly
death was cruelly incongruous to his life of laughter, music and
small-town friendships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll miss that stupid smile on his face _ his stupid jokes,''
Kieran McWeeney, McGettigan's best friend said in a telephone
interview from Drumshambo. ``He wanted to see the world _ to get
away from here for a little bit. He was so good to be around.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many of his countrymen, McWeeney was recruited last year to
play Gaelic football for a team in Chicago _ a season he enjoyed
while McGettigan spent the summer of 1997 as a laborer on a
construction site outside of Dublin, building a wall alongside a
highway.
</P>
<P>
   When McGettigan's turn came last month in a telephone call from
a Gaelic football recruiter in Boston, he did not hesitiate.
``We're only a small village here,'' McWeeney explained. ``He
jumped at the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   McGettigan's father, Charlie, had achieved local celebrity in
Ireland 1995 when he won a pan-European song contest, followed by
millions, with his entry, ``Rock and Roll Kids.''
</P>
<P>
   But his only son made a name for himself on the football fields,
winning two medals with the Allen Gaels in 1996 and 1997. He was
selected to play for the all-county team, a distinction in a
country where their blend of football is taken as seriously as the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sport was a big thing in his life,'' said Enda McGlone, a
long-time family friend. ``He played a little music, but ended up
choosing football over music. He planned on coming back here in
September for what would have been his last year in college.''
</P>
<P>
   McGettigan was enrolled at Dublin City University, where he was
a communications student who was interested in pursuing a
film-making career, perhaps, said McGlone, to satisfy his appetite
for the whiz-bang special-effects films of movie titans like Steven
Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   In its editions Thursday, the Irish Mirror recounts an interview
with McGettigan about his father's local fame and his own
achievements.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for my dad being famous, well, he might be to others, but
he's just dad to me,'' he said. ``But hopefully after today (a
championship match) people will be asking him, `Are you Shane
McGettigan's father?' rather than asking me if I'm Charlie's son.
He's fanatical about football and he'll certainly be cheering us on
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie McGettigan was to board a US-bound jetliner late
Wednesday, accompanied by his daughters Ciara, 25, and Tara, 18, on
a journey to bring his son's body home.

   BEAR-MARKETPLACE (New York) _ Who exactly is moving the market
this summer? Institutional investors, the same powerful group that
sold aggressively in October, when the Dow tumbled 554 points, or
7.2 percent, in a single day. And the same big-time players who
have soured repeatedly on the bull market, only to jump back in
later, after smaller investors have quietly affirmed their faith.

WIN AGAINST ROYALS ALL PART OF GORDON'S SCHOOLING AS CLOSER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Lesson 42 in the ongoing education of Tom Gordon as a
closer came Tuesday night against the Royals. ``That was big what
happened,'' he said. ``I learned a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   When Gordon was called into a tie game by Red Sox manager Jimy
Williams after a rain delay with two outs in the eighth, he didn't
feel right. He has been a closer for all of one season now, and all
those years of starting have not been erased from his psyche. As
Gordon learned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that he didn't trust his fastball or was worried about
his specialty, the killer curveball. The problem was his mind-set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why,'' said Gordon, ``but I felt as if I were
starting the game instead of coming in to relieve. I found myself
pacing myself.''
</P>
<P>
   A starter paces himself. A starter can pick his spots to throw
this pitch or that. A starter thinks of the long term, five or six
or seven innings down the road. A reliever can do none of the
above. A reliever must produce immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a different feel when I got out on the mound,'' said
Gordon. ``I felt like a starter, so it took me a while to get
myself motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Gordon surrendered the go-ahead run in the top of
the ninth before the Red Sox took him off the hook with a run in
the bottom of the inning and made him a winner with Nomar
Garciaparra's three-run homer in the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that glitch, Gordon has made a remarkable transformation
from starter to one of baseball's best closers. He has 32 saves,
including 29 in a row, and has blown only one save opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   In adapting to his new role, Gordon has had to alter his
pitching rhythm. Intsead of being ready every fifth day, for
instance, he must be ready on call.
</P>
<P>
   ``That feeling I had (Tuesday) is not a kind of feeling that I
want to have,'' he said. ``But later in the game when they had
runners on base, that's when I started to pick it up (mentally).''
</P>
<P>
   It's an old problem for closers. Bring a closer in to close a
game and he's ready. Bring a closer in with a huge lead or deficit
(just to get work, for instance) or into a tie game, then a
closer's focus is not always as sharp.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come into a game and you know the game's on the
line,'' said Gordon, ``you can pretty much get yourself into that
frame of mind right away. But right now it's still very new to me,
and that's why I felt the way I felt (Tuesday). If it had been a
save situation and I knew I was coming into the game to save it or
maybe we had a couple of more runs, I probably wouldn't have felt
like I was starting the game. I might have been sharper earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said he felt confident he could be a closer when he was
given the word a year ago this month ``because I've always had an
aggressive attitude even when I was a starter. What I remember is
that I used to give everything I had early in a game and then if I
got into a tough situation, I was almost out of gas.''
</P>
<P>
   But as a closer, he doesn't have to worry about saving himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a starter, there was a lot of thinking,'' said
Gordon. ``But now ... it's just `bam!' Don't think, go out there
with your stuff, and get three outs. Get your outs, finish this
game, and go home. I don't have a lot of time to think out there
and I don't want to think.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, old habits die hard. Gordon pointed toward the locker of
Dennis Eckersley, another starter turned closer, and said, ``Those
guys who've been doing it for years know how to snap mentally into
it. But me? I'm still learning. There've been times when I've
gotten up (to warm up) and I didn't have good stuff, but I've been
able to focus and still get myself ready. But to say what exactly I
did to pinpoint my mind, I can't say. When I don't feel as pumped
up right away, I try to think of something to get me going.''
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, getting the save is enough to pump up any closer.
Gordon conceded he had problems earlier in the season coming into
non-save situations but has found a way to get into focus hours
before he takes the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell myself I'm pitching every day. That helps me out,''
said Gordon. ``I say to myself, `I'm pitching today,' and I keep
repeating that to myself. When I walk out to the bullpen in the
sixth, that's what I'm telling myself: `I'm coming in.' But what I
learned (Tuesday) is that I sometimes still have that attitude as a
starter.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Gordon still didn't feel right when he took the
mound, even though he got Mike Sweeney to pop up to end the eighth.
``I had my good curveball,'' he said, ``but I didn't have my good
spot fastball.'' And the Royals took advantage in the ninth before
Gordon settled down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was proud,'' he said. ``I didn't feel right and I didn't
have my (best) stuff, but I came back and I learned something new.
After all, I'm still pretty new at this.''

SONY FACES UP TO NAKED TRUTH, STOPS SHIPPING VIDEO CAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY AND HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   First there was Candid Camera. Now there is Naked Camera.
</P>
<P>
   Under ideal conditions and with a special filter, a new Sony
video camera can see through some bikinis and T-shirts, turning a
bathing beauty's day at the beach into a birthday-suit peep show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every 14-year-old boy is going to want one of these,'' said
Bob Moisan, general manager of a camera and video store near
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The video cameras are from a new line made by Sony Corp., and
several models include an infrared option called NightShot that
allows videophiles to take footage in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   But much to the embarrassment of the consumer-electronics king,
a Japanese magazine reported that the X-ray like properties of
NightShot gave it the potential to qualify as the one of the
biggest advances in softcore pornography since Hugh Hefner invented
the Playboy centerfold.
</P>
<P>
   When used by day, a NightShot-equipped camera can make the
Spandex of a swimsuit seem as diaphanous as cellophane, the
magazine reported.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday Sony said it was halting shipment of the original
models of the camera, which can retail from about $600 to $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Sony insists that NightShot was designed with purely innocent
intentions. With the ``NightShot'' feature, nature buffs can study
the nocturnal habits of the coyote and the owl, and parents can
record their children's hijinks after dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was intended for such night-time activities as a baby
sleeping, or children out on a Halloween night, or carollers at
Christmas time,'' said Sony spokeswoman Dulcie Neiman.
</P>
<P>
   But there was something else ``NightShot'' could do. When used
with one of the camera's filters in bright sunlight, NightShot &UR;  &LR; can
sometimes yield images that make flimsily clad people appear to be
naked. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't happen all the time,'' acknowledged Sony spokesman
Rick Clancy. ``But it does happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though 400,000 cameras with the NightShot feature &UR;  &LR; have
been shipped to North America, few people in the United States
seemed to have been aware of NightShot's voyeuristic powers until
wire stories began to move out of Tokyo Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my!'' said product specialist Shameem Siddiqui of Best
Buy, an electronics chain about to open stores near Boston, when he
was told of the camera's X-ray capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Circuit City was equally surprised.
</P>
<P>
   While the NightShot in its original form might appeal to some
consumers, Sony has moved quickly to modify the camera. Newer
versions will produce only a blank screen when the NightShot
feature is activated during daylight, Clancy said.
</P>
<P>
   Once radio reports began airing Wednesday about cameras that
could eye-pop a peeping Tom, inquiries started flooding Newtonville
Camera &AMP; Video.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had phone calls galore,'' said manager Moisan, adding,
``Everybody wanted to know about the naked camera.''
</P>
<P>
   But try as he might, Moisan couldn't get any of the NightShot
-equipped Sony cameras in his store to ``see through'' clothing.
The images that appeared in the cameras' viewers were more
reminiscent of the ``X-Files'' than an X-rated movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sort of surrealistic and eerie looking,'' Moisan said.
``Everything had a washed-out look, but you had the illusion of
seeing flesh.''

MICROSOFT TO APPEAL ORDER OPENING DEPOSITIONS TO PUBLIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp. will appeal a federal judge's order
that pretrial questioning of its chairman, Bill Gates, and 16
employees in the government's antitrust action be opened to the
public and the news media, the company said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of U.S. District Court refused
Wednesday to postpone the order he issued Tuesday that the
depositions of Gates and others take place soon so that the Sept. 8
trial date he has set is not delayed.
</P>
<P>
   With obvious reluctance, Jackson told a Microsoft lawyer, John
Warden, ``I am going to deny your motion for a stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's initial ruling to open the depositions came in
response to a motion from The New York Times, The Seattle Times and
the cable-television and online news units of Ziff-Davis, a
computer trade publisher. Their filing was joined by Reuters and
Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   The news organizations based their requests on a federal
antitrust law that says depositions taken in civil antitrust cases
``shall be open to the public as freely as are trials in open
court.''
</P>
<P>
   In hearings Wednesday and on Tuesday, Jackson made it clear that
he did not like the provision but felt bound to enforce it.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department joined the news organizations Wednesday
in opposing Microsoft's request to postpone the depositions,
apparently out of fear that a postponement would delay the start of
the trial.
</P>
<P>
   In its court filing, the government said it had asked Congress
last year to repeal the 1913 act requiring open deposition taking,
but stated that Congress had failed to act, leaving the provision
``the law of the land.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge agreed. But even as he ordered the parties to work out
details for taking the depositions in public, he warned that the
process was likely to be complex and asked the two sides to come up
with answers to these questions, among others:
</P>
<P>
   _ How will the public be notified of the time and place of the
depositions?
</P>
<P>
   _ Will the questioning be televised?
</P>
<P>
   _ Will reporters or others be allowed to bring cameras, cellular
phones or laptop computers into the room?
</P>
<P>
   _ How will seating be allocated among members of the news media
and the public?
</P>
<P>
   _ Will the proceeding be closed when Gates or any of the other
16 Microsoft employees giving depositions discuss trade secrets?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a partial list of things that could be potential
problems,'' Jackson said after he had read a list of 20 or more
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Microsoft prepared to appeal, lawyers representing the
company and the government remained in the courtroom after
Wednesday's hearing and began trying to devise answers to the
judge's questions.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Microsoft has made it clear that it wanted
much longer to prepare for the trial. Last spring, the company
asked for a seven-month delay, but Jackson said he wanted to try
the case in September, and he has worked assiduously to push the
parties toward that goal.
</P>
<P>
   If the judge had agreed Wednesday to Microsoft's request for a
postponement in the depositions, the trial date would almost
certainly have been pushed back.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TACHING, Germany _ When Martin Thaller's grandfather worked the
family's 75-acre farm here in the Bavarian hills near Austria, five
farmhands milked cows and tended the horses. On a recent day, as he
struggled to free a heifer stranded on a railing, Thaller's only
helper was a young government archivist from the Rhineland,
hundreds of miles west, who was vacationing on the farm.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers like Thaller who double as innkeepers to paying guests _
who merely want to relax or, like the archivist, also want to learn
a little farming _ are rural Europe's answer to a growing
challenge. As prices for farm products dwindle, and with them rural
incomes, European farmers are redesigning their farms to take in
tourists, a practice known as agritourism, and governments are
helping them do so. By rough estimate, the 15 European Union
countries have spent $2 billion since 1991 to subsidize such
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Europe treads a narrow path, however, facing objections from
trade partners like the United States that it risks violating
global agreements to stop farm aid, and complaints from the
European hotel industry that it unfairly subsidizes competition
when it pays farmers grants to create accommodations for guests.
</P>
<P>
   But government leaders argue that without adequate income,
farmers will quit the land for the cities, threatening farms and
villages that form an architectural heritage stretching back
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Bavarian lands will suffer without a farming class,'' says
a sticker that Thaller, 34, has fixed to equipment in a barn his
ancestors built in 1848.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Europe's leaders say they must keep the rural
population in touch with an urban society that is rapidly changing
through technology and globalization, or there will very likely be
greater dislocation in the countryside as young country people find
themselves even less prepared for jobs than they are today.
</P>
<P>
   When Umberto Lenzi's grandfather bought the family's 600-acre
farm in the Tuscany region of central Italy in 1939, dozens of
sharecroppers and their families toiled in the fields. Today, Lenzi
advertises the charms of his farm on a new World Wide Web site.
Europeans, drawn by modest room rates and seeking refuge from noisy
cities, are arriving in droves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just felt a need to get away from the noise of the
television set,'' said Nicola Decaro, 40, a city employee from
Apulia, in southern Italy, who spent a week recently with his wife
and two daughters at Lenzi's farm. Increasingly, advertising and
the Web site are also drawing guests from the United States and
Australia, Lenzi said.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping farmers on the land is the goal of European political
leaders searching for ways to halt unfettered urban development.
Besides, they say, Europe's commitment to eliminate farm price
supports requires that rural communities find new sources of
income, like tourism.
</P>
<P>
   A populated countryside, they also argue, protects picturesque
landscapes that attract tourists and produces distinctive products,
like wines and cheeses, that swell European food exports. The
golden wheat fields around Lenzi's farm are, after all, virtually
identical to those in 15th-century paintings that attract countless
tourists to the churches and town hall of nearby Siena.
</P>
<P>
   Agritourism began in the 1960s in northern Europe, where rural
traditions of taking in summer guests go back to the 19th century.
Today, it blankets the continent. And Europe's model is copied
elsewhere. In Israel, for example, kibbutzim embrace the concept,
and a 1996 conference to promote farm vacations drew delegates from
central Europe, Asia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Even though farm vacations account for only a fraction of
Europe's annual tourism revenues of $218 billion, their spread
raises hackles at the European Confederation of National
Associations of Hotels in Brussels. ``The problem is, they're
getting subsidies, and they're not subject to the same
regulations,'' said Marguerite Sequaris, spokeswoman for the group.
Hotels, she said, must comply with regulations for the handicapped
and for fire safety that farmers often ignore, ``creating a
situation that leads to unfair competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of the size of the agritourism market are difficult,
given the often informal and fragmented state of the business.
Peter Shackleford, an official at the World Tourism Organization in
Madrid, says it might account for 5 percent to 10 percent of
European tourism receipts. ``It's a relatively small share of the
market, but it's growing,'' he said. He dismisses hotel industry
complaints, saying, ``The five-star hotels in St. Moritz are not
worried about rural tourism.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet concern is clear among trade officials from the United
States, Europe's largest trade partner.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Murphy, the assistant U.S. trade representative for
agriculture, said that European officials, in trade talks, defend
their policies by arguing that farming is ``multifunctional:''
farms produce food, protect the environment and help preserve a
centuries-old rural cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are viewed as crude Americans who view agriculture as just
another form of business,'' he said. Washington, he added, accepts
the notion of farming's multiple functions, but only on the
condition that ``it does not result in trade distortions'' by
covertly subsidizing unprofitable farm products.

BELL ATLANTIC SETTLES WITH IBEW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE LEWIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A day after reaching an agreement with its largest union, Bell
Atlantic Corp. announced Wednesday a tentative two-year pact with
the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers that guarantees
union access to future jobs and prohibits layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, reached at 3:15 a.m., came hours after Bell
Atlantic and the Communications Workers of America announced a pact
with similar provisions. The agreement with CWA ended a two-day
strike by 73,000 telephone workers in 13 states and Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The IBEW, with 13,000 technicians, installers, repair workers
and operators in New England, is the largest telephone company
union in the region. The new contract will cover workers in
Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, and Rhode Island. The
two unions negotiated similar agreements that offer wage increases
of up to 3.8 percent the first year, and 4 percent the second year
of the pacts. Both agreements prohibit layoffs, limit the use of
outside contractors, and ensure union members will secure future
jobs involving Internet, multimedia communications and data
networking technologies _ jobs that are expected to be among the
fastest growing in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Myles Calvey, business manager for IBEW Local 2222 in Boston,
said the new contract would be submitted to workers for a vote
within 20 days. The local has 3,700 members in greater Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest issue was contracting,'' said Calvey, who chaired
negotiations for 10 regional locals. ``We had a clause in the
former contract that prevented Bell Atlantic from using outside
contractors to install poles and cables. That language remained in
place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This settlement ensures that we will continue to care for our
customers by providing them with outstanding service,'' Donald J.
Sacco, executive vice president of human resources, at Bell
Atlantic, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The company also agreed to increase by 15 percent payments to
workers who resign from the company rather than be transferred to
another city or state.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, IBEW officials will be allowed to initiate
organizing campaigns at newly created nonunion subsidiaries without
company interference.
</P>
<P>
   According to Sacco, pensions will increase by a minimum of 20
percent over the life of the agreement. Additionally, IBEW workers
will receive cash bonuses for maintaining service standards.
</P>
<P>
   James Green, a labor expert at the University of Massachusetts
in Boston, said the new contracts suggest that unions are
developing more expertise in forecasting and bargaining on future
changes in industry that could affect their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``We are now seeing a trend on the part of unions to bargain
over the future direction of an industry,'' said Green. ``In the
past, unions were behind the curve in terms of understanding new
technological changes and re-engineering. They were simply in a
reactive position. That appears to be changing.''

 TACHING, Germany: farm products.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   European Union officials acknowledge that since 1991, about $2.3
billion has been spent on programs to promote rural business
activities as alternatives to farming, about 40 percent of it for
farm vacations. Since most of those funds are distributed as grants
to match local government aid, the total figure Europe spent in the
period to promote farm vacations could be double that, or close to
$2 billion, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Yves Champetier, director of the European Association for
Information on Local Development, defended the spending, saying the
goal was to ``get away from direct subsidies to farmers and create
new viable activities.'' European funds, he said, go to restoring
dilapidated buildings, training farmers in hotel skills, promoting
traditional products and trades, and helping to market farm
holidays through travel agencies or Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Though they may not realize it, American tourists in Provence or
Tuscany are often the beneficiaries of European government aid to
farmers to restore old farm buildings and so prevent their gradual
disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   Thaller's family provides an example.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, after tractors replaced horses, the Thallers converted
an unused horse barn into guest rooms, then finished the attic of
their 137-year-old farmhouse, creating total accommodations for
about 20 guests. Now, on sunny August days, the Thallers' guests,
who pay about $13 a night for a room, poke around the barn or
descend a meadow to the Tachinger See, a pond for swimming, boating
and fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Leafing through dog-eared guest books, Thaller's mother, Rosi,
points to names of families, mostly German, that have returned
again and again, providing 5 percent to 10 percent of the farm's
total income. ``It's more a little side thing,'' she said, adding
that it ``allows you to get nicer furniture, allow yourself things
you might not otherwise be able to.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, the Thallers built a new cow barn with
subsidized loans from the Bavarian government, and Martin Thaller
wants to create a wine bar in the low stone vaults of the old one.
</P>
<P>
   Bavaria is among Europe's most generous regions for farmers. A
five-year program begun in 1994 will provide a total of $1.2
billion, including funds from the regional government matched by
the European Union, to promote rural businesses as alternatives to
farming.
</P>
<P>
   Eva Reitzlein, an official in the Bavarian agriculture ministry
in Munich, says that about 7,000 of Bavaria's 185,000 working farms
take in paying guests, accounting for one-third the total number of
farms offering agritourism in Germany. This year, she said, to
better market the farms abroad, Germany's regional governments will
begin ranking them with a star system like that used for hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Europe continues, under international pressure, to
dismantle price supports for farm products, which will cut into
farm profits for farmers like Thaller and Lenzi. Under a government
plan called Agenda 2000, Bavaria will order farmers to cut milk
production by 15 percent to 20 percent so that the milk price will
rise, Thaller said.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, he said, not even tourism receipts will suffice
to keep his farm alive, and he will be forced to take outside work
as an electrician, a trade he learned before turning to farming.
Yet his optimism is unbroken. ``I like to assume things will get
better,'' Thaller said.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuscany, Lenzi, 37, faces a similar struggle. He restored his
farm with grants from the regional government in Siena, matched by
European Union funds, and guests arrive in steady streams. But
wading through European farm policy complexities, a maze of price
supports and production quotas, is taxing, and the white Vernaccia
wine that is his specialty now commands a price of $98 per 100
liters, compared with $285 a decade ago. ``You won't get rich,'' he
said, then added with a wave of the hand at his cluster of small
stone buildings: ``But you're preserving what's here.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite government subsidies, Ms. Reitzlein of the Bavarian
agriculture ministry acknowledged that farm incomes in Bavaria ``do
not keep step'' with urban incomes and ``remain very depressed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Giovanni Pacini, who is responsible for rural tourism in the
province of Siena, where more than 3,000 farms, including Lenzi's,
take in guests, points to thousands of ancient villages, churches
and farm buildings that have been saved from sure destruction. ``An
enormous patrimony has been rescued,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosi Thaller says there is yet another benefit _ that farmhouse
guests have introduced her six children, including Martin Thaller,
to a world they otherwise would not have known. ``Our kids visited
with the guests' kids, and our kids benefited,'' she said. ``They
went along to museums, saw things they otherwise wouldn't have
seen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tremendous enrichment for us and for our children.''

 &HT;    Falcons Q&AMP;A with Bob Whitfield
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sometimes it's difficult to figure Atlanta's Bob
Whitfield, one of the top young offensive tackles in the NFL. He's
sometimes quiet, occasionally irritated, frequently funny and
almost always thinking. Sometimes he's dominant on the field;
sometimes he seems indifferent. He first played in the NFL in 1992,
at age 20, and became a full-time starter the next season. He has
started every game for the Falcons for five-straight years, the
last four years at left tackle. He also owns his own studio,
PatchWerk Recordings, in downtown Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: There has been quite a bit of fuss over the importance of
quarterback Chris Chandler staying healthy. Does it make any
difference to you whether you're blocking for a quarterback with a
track record for injury or if you're blocking for a guy who clearly
makes such a difference in how the team fares?
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield: He's a good quarterback and a leader. We all rallied
around him (last year), and we knew if we kept him healthy it said
a lot about us. If we keep the hits off him, we know we can win.
Our whole thing was to move the ball and keep Chandler healthy. It
will be again.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: What do your peers think of you? What do you think of
yourself?
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield: I think everyone around the league respects my
athletic ability, my awareness and my pass-blocking. I look at
myself and there are a lot of shortcomings. Maybe I haven't applied
myself or haven't done certain things (coaches) want to see,
especially with my run-blocking. Until I do that, I won't see
myself as the complete package. I'm trying to show some different
things, improve my run-blocking because I've been in the league
going on seven years, and I've only had a sniff of the Pro Bowl, as
an alternate. I'm trying to get there as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: Is the assessment that you're inconsistent, or even
sometimes lackadaisical, accurate?
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield: I watch myself slack off. I can watch film and tell
you if I'm slacking off or if I'm not into it. Maybe it's practice,
and I don't feel like doing it. This year, though, I'm trying to
stay in tune more, work harder, want to be here more, and I've
found out that concentrating and focusing, it goes by faster and
you don't have as many mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: The Falcons were 19th in the NFL in rushing last year, and
in the first preseason game, the running game struggled (with 67
yards on 23 carries). Three of five projected line starters were
here in '96, the last of seven straight years of run-and-shoot
offense. Is there a difference blocking now versus then?
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield: It's a transition. A lot of the run-blocking is way
different. In the run-and-shoot, you spread everybody out, and
there are a lot of cutback lanes, so you might not have to get a
great block, just good position on a guy where he can't get to the
ballcarrier. This is more straight-ahead blocking with eight or
nine (defenders) in the box (near the line of scrimmage). In the
run-and-shoot, you might have four or five guys in the box. Here,
you need to create space to running lanes. Everybody has to come
off with good leverage and power.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: Why are fans in Atlanta so indifferent to the Falcons? Do
they have a right to be?
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield: We've got the image of maybe not winning many games
but showing a little excitement, so we'll keep a small group of
(core) fans. But to sell out that big arena, you got to put some
points on the board and some wins. I never knock somebody for what
they feel about sports. If they don't want to watch, they don't
have to watch. But it helps us play better when there are a bunch
of fans in the Georgia Dome. We got to do some impressive stuff to
get them to come.

 &HT;    Redskins stand good chance to improve
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FROSTBURG, Md. _ Norv Turner will have no excuses this time if
his Washington Redskins team, the favorite in the suddenly diluted
NFC East, fails to advance to postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Turner is one of only seven NFL coaches since 1970 to have
survived four years without a playoff appearance. He has plenty of
reasons _ about 16 million of them _ to think the Redskins drought
will end in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Washington paid $16.4 million in signing bonuses and first-year
salaries to acquire veteran defensive tackles Dana Stubblefield and
Dan Wilkinson.
</P>
<P>
   In the space of less than a week this spring, general manager
Charley Casserly coaxed Stubblefield, an unrestricted free agent,
away from San Francisco. Then he dealt first- and third-round draft
choices to the Cincinnati Bengals for Wilkinson.
</P>
<P>
   Stubblefield got a six-year contract worth $35.88 million.
Wilkinson got $21.4 million over four years. And the Redskins got
the pair of enforcers they desperately needed.
</P>
<P>
   So, while the brainy Turner again will resemble a character from
``Revenge of the Nerds,'' no one should be able to kick sand in his
face without fear of retribution. The Redskin defense was 28th
against the run in '97, but defensive coordinator Mike Nolan has
cautioned that Stubblefield and Wilkinson ``shouldn't be viewed as
saviors.'' But Wilkinson, who squandered his immense talent for
much of his four seasons in Cincinnati after being the first
overall pick in the 1994 draft, would prefer to toss caution to the
wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the money they're paying us, it's only natural (that)
people will expect a big change,'' Wilkinson said. ``And that's
fair. But if they turn the two of us loose and let us just beat on
people, I don't see how teams can stop us. You simply can't
double-team two tackles like us. But believe me, teams are going to
think they're seeing double.''
</P>
<P>
   During the last five seasons, the defensive emphasis in the NFL
seems to have moved from the edge to the inside _ away from
upfield-rushing ends, whose quickness has been neutralized by
quarterbacks' three-step drops _ and toward the tackles. No team
reflects that change more than the revamped Washington defense,
which struggled last year with defenders Steve Emtman, Chris Mims,
Keith Rucker and Chris Zorich.
</P>
<P>
   Casserly recently said that if the Redskins had either of their
new tackles in 1996 or '97, they would have been in the playoffs
both years. Now they have both, so expections are higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys didn't just wake up one day and say, 'Hey, let's
sign Dana Stubblefield and Dan Wilkinson,''' said Stubblefield, the
49ers' first-rounder in 1993. ``They have been planning this for a
long time. They saw the way the game was going, and they reacted to
it. They stepped up for us; now it's time we step up for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Casserley blueprint actually called for acquiring one
dominant tackle, and Stubblefield topped the list, as he did for
most clubs. But by landing the tandem, Washington completely
altered the dynamic of their division.
</P>
<P>
   ``The division has always been about brute power and being
physical, and we sometimes couldn't hold up,'' middle linebacker
Marvcus Patton said. ``Well, let's see teams try to mess with us
now.''
</P>
<P>
   In the short time they have been together, Stubblefield and
Wilkinson, who met for the first time at an athletic banquet in
'93, have grown close. They have joked during camp and, defensive
line assistant Earl Leggett noted, are ``beginning to meld.''
Washington will have to smooth out some rough spots as each player
attempts to establish himself as ``The Man'' on the Redskins'
defensive front. But their similar backgrounds should help hasten
the process.
</P>
<P>
   Stubblefield, the league's defensive MVP in 1998 with 15 sacks,
grew up in Cincinnati and described his neighborhood there as ``one
of the places where, at a certain age, all your friends started
dying.'' His father abandoned the family when Stubblefield was 6
years old, and Dana claimed that his maturity came ``from having to
do all the things he wasn't around to do.'' Stubblefield eventually
moved in with his grandfather, who died midway through Dana's
junior year in high school. Seeking a more stable background in a
rural setting, he went to live with the family of one of his
teachers, Martha Heath, on her 220-acre farm.
</P>
<P>
   The second-youngest of 11 children, Wilkinson grew up in Dayton,
played at Ohio State and then went to Cincinnati after skipping his
senior season with the Buckeyes. He hated it there, calling the
city ``racist.'' His father died of a heart attack in '87, and
Alfred Powell, his freshman coach in high school, recalled that
Wilkinson then developed a lazy streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like Dan was saying, 'No matter how hard you work, life
is still going to turn out unfair,''' Powell said. ``His father
didn't make it to many games because he was at work most times,
just trying to make ends meet. (Wilkinson) was always a little bit
backward socially, and he drew in even more after that. Frankly, he
flat-out felt sorry for himself and didn't want to work through
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his strength and quickness, the 320-pound Wilkinson has
been an underachiever in the NFL. The Bengals coaches finally
decided he no longer was worth their investment.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Stubblefield has a reputation in some quarters as a
player who doesn't work hard every play. Critics claim that he got
his 15 sacks, after just one the year before, just to increase the
ante on the free-agent market.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive tackles and Turner all know that it's time to
silence the naysayers and restore the credibility of a proud
franchise. With a buttressed line, a trio of solid linebackers and
the NFL's best man-coverage players in Darrell Green and Cris
Dishman, Nolan certainly should have a top-10 unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming from San Francisco, I know how things are supposed to
work out,'' Stubblefield said. ``No matter how good the offense
was, the defense won championships. And (it) always does. I feel
like I was brought in here to establish that attitude.''

<P>
   ATLANTA _ To most Southerners, Indy-style race cars, and their
drivers, might be so unfamiliar that they could come from another
planet, but at least one team will have home ties at the Aug. 29
Atlanta Classic 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway. The Kelley Racing
Team, headquartered in Fort Wayne, Ind., just completed a
sponsorship agreement with Norcross, Ga.-based Johnson Industries,
a top wholesale auto-parts distributor. Look for the JI logo on car
No. 8, driven by Scott Sharp and No. 28, Mark Dismore.
</P>
<P>
   Indy-style racing might be No. 2 these days, even at the Indy
Brickyard, but that doesn't mean the hard-core fans have retired.
The IRL Crew, the official fan club of the Indy Racing League, will
be taking two chartered busses to the Atlanta race. The club has
100 seats reserved, with the option for more if demand is great
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Mosport
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's GT1 sweep at Mosport International Raceway left Panoz
drivers in the top four positions of the championship points
series: Eric Bernard of Paris leads with 87, followed by Andy
Wallace, Le Mans, and David Brabham, England, tied at 80 and Raul
Boesel of Key West, Fla. fourth with 63. Another Panoz driver, Doc
Bundy of Atlanta, is seventh with 43 points. Other
Atlanta-connected results at Mosport: sixth place, Toshiba/Lease
Plan Ferrari 333, driven by Wayne Taylor, Altamonte Springs, Fla.,
and Eric van de Poele, Monte Carlo; eighth place, Downing Kudzu
Mazda, driven by Jim Downing of Atlanta and A.J. Smith, Voorhees,
N.J. Taylor and van de Poele are 1-2 in WSC points with 110 and
109, respectively. Downing is seventh with 48. Taylor leads the WSC
series with 110 points, one more than van de Poele.

   In Italy, Ferrari is next to God. Literally _ the Pope blesses
the team, and church bells ring when the team wins races. When they
lose, they get no more respect than Bear Bryant _ ``we're with you
coach, win or tie.'' The fallout of Ferrari's disappointing weekend
in the German Grand Prix _ Michael Schumacher finished fifth and
Ulsterman teammate Eddie Irvine eighth as the McLaren Mercededs
continued to roll _ has reached the Monza race circuit, where
ticket sales for the Sept. 13 Italian Grand Prix are well down from
last year. Tickets are still available for everywhere except for
the 1,500-seat central stand.

   NAIROBI, Kenya _ This has been an agonizing time for the United
States ambassador to Kenya, Prudence Bushnell.
</P>
<P>
   Her embassy was destroyed in a terrorist bombing on Friday that
injured her and took the lives of three dozen American and Kenyan
colleagues, many of them close friends.
</P>
<P>
   She has had to re-establish her mission in temporary quarters
while overseeing a chaotic rescue operation and arranging to
evacuate dozens of wounded officials and employees.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters harder, she has also become the focus of anger
among many Kenyans who believe the United States did too little to
help save Kenyans trapped under the rubble of a building next door
to the mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like that building over there _ devastated,'' she said
Wednesday during a ceremony for rescue workers, pointing at the
demolished Ufundi Co-operative Building where more than 100 Kenyans
died.
</P>
<P>
   Embassy officials say the bombing was particularly painful for
Bushnell because she had been complaining privately to her
superiors in Washington for more than a year about the poor
security in Nairobi. She had argued that the embassy should be
moved, but a decision was made in Washington to renovate the
existing building instead.
</P>
<P>
   She has a reputation as an effective manager _ indeed, her
background was in administration within the State Department.
Within two hours of the explosion, a bandaged Bushnell walked into
a temporary command center set up at another building housing the
U.S. Agency for International Development and took charge.
</P>
<P>
   She immediately ordered a secretary to take down a list of
priorities: determine who was missing, establish a central control
room, set up communications because the local telephones were
jammed.
</P>
<P>
   Until last Friday, Kenya was considered a safe foreign posting,
a lovely country where diplomats enjoyed safaris and the biggest
threat to security was the occasional political riot by students
downtown or a spate of carjackings.
</P>
<P>
   That changed drastically last week when a pickup truck loaded
with explosives detonated at the entrance of the embassy's
underground parking garage at the rear of the building. The
explosion gutted the mission, demolished the seven-story Ufundi
building next door and killed at least 247 people.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion caught Bushnell on the 18th floor of the
Cooperative Bank Building next door to the Ufundi building, where
she was meeting with the Kenyan trade minister. She was badly cut
by flying glass and had to descend on foot through floor after
floor of destruction and chaos before being led into a scene of
carnage outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was bleeding,'' she recalled at an emotional news
conference on Saturday. ``The banister was wet with blood.''
</P>
<P>
   The ambassador has taken the tragedy personally, friends said.
She had prided herself that during a three-year tenure as a deputy
assistant secretary of state for Africa _ a time when there was a
genocide in Rwanda and several other dangerous crises on the
continent _ no Americans were killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that really upset her was that the whole time she
was the deputy assistant secretary in Washington she never lost an
American,'' one aide said. ``Today she's saying, `Now look what's
happened, and it's my fault.' That's what's hurting her most.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bushnell was born in Washington to the diplomat's life, the
daughter of a career Foreign Service officer. She was raised
abroad, in Germany, France, Pakistan and Iran. She speaks fluent
French.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Russell Sage College in Troy, N.Y., she
had a career in the private sector as a management consultant in
Texas before deciding to join the Foreign Service in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, she has served as the general services officer in
Bombay, India, and then as the deputy chief of mission in Dakar,
Senegal, under George Moose, who later became an assistant
secretary of state and took Bushnell with him to Washington in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Like her father, she was on the administrative track in the
State Department, a road that seldom leads to an ambassadorial
appointment. But in 1996, President Clinton nominated her to become
the ambassador to Kenya, with the strong support of Moose.
</P>
<P>
   She is married to a retired lawyer and playwright, Richard
Buckley, and has five stepchildren.
</P>
<P>
   In her two years in Kenya, she has been a persistent critic of
President Daniel arap Moi's government, pushing Kenya to live up to
its 1992 promise to establish a full-fledged Western-style
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   She has also hammered the Moi administration again and again for
being slow to clean up corruption, which is a tremendous drag on
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, she found herself on the defensive, facing
allegations from Kenyan journalists and people in the street that
U.S. Marines should have allowed local rescuers to enter the
embassy in the hours immediately after the bombing to carry out
wounded people. Instead, the Marines turned away crowds of good
samaritans.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday evening, Bushnell defended the Marines on state
television, saying they had been trying not only to protect the
crime scene but also to keep self-appointed rescuers from being
hurt. There was a gas tank behind the building that might have
exploded, she pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effort was to keep everybody out because we didn't know if
the gas was going to explode and we didn't know if the building was
sound,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bushnell also tried to defuse public anger in diplomatic terms.
``The fact that there is anger is very, very understandable,'' she
said. ``I feel tremendous anger and frankly it is that anger that
helps me keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   In private, several embassy officials said, Bushnell had been
functioning well on the job, running staff meetings with her usual
mix of humor and intensity. ``She's done remarkably well
considering that she was almost killed in the explosion,'' one
official said.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Bushnell says the experience of surviving the bomb
has irrevocably changed her and her view of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly my life was changed,'' she said in an interview with
The Associated Press Wednesday. ``Dramatically. And I am having to
adapt to a new life style. One that is full of security people. We
never had armed guards before. We never lived in a fortress before.
We do now.''

CONSUMER MAGAZINE CITES TOP BAY STATE HMOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consumer Reports, the nation's largest consumer magazine,
Wednesday released a report that rated Medicare health maintenance
organization plans sold by Harvard Pilgrim Health Care and Blue
Cross and Blue Shield among the best buys in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine examined 200 Medicare HMOs and 1,200 Medicare
supplemental insurance policies in its September issue, which is
scheduled to hit newsstands Aug. 25.
</P>
<P>
   The ratings compared plans on a ``value index'' that evaluated
benefits and premiums. The index did not take into account
differences in quality among the plans. The magazine will issue a
separate report comparing HMO quality in October, said Trudy
Lieberman, health policy editor for Consumer Reports.
</P>
<P>
   For the Boston market, the magazine evaluated 16 HMOs and one
so-called ``Medigap'' plan that pays for some health care costs not
covered by Medicare, the federal health insurance program for
seniors and disabled citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Among HMOs that do not offer prescription drug benefits,
Harvard's First Seniority ranked at the top, closely followed by
HealthSource of New Hampshire and Blue Cross's BlueCare 65 plan.
Though HealthSource does not sell Medicare HMOs in Massachusetts,
Consumer Reports included the plan because of its proximity to the
Boston market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We strive to provide excellent value to our members,'' said
Ellen Offner, vice president for Medicare programs at Harvard
Pilgrim. Offner said Harvard's dental benefits under First
Seniority set it apart from rivals. The plan, among other things,
lets seniors buy dentures for $355, compared to thousands of
dollars charged to uninsured patients.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard, Fallon Community Health Plan in Worcester, Mass., and
Blue Cross rated well among plans with drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being the largest and fastest-selling Medicare HMO in
Massachusetts, Tufts Health Plan's Secure Horizons trailed its
rivals in both categories. Only Aetna US Healthcare fared worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to think that people are voting for us with their
feet,'' said Michelle Davis, spokeswoman for Tufts. ``We're the
largest Medicare HMO in the state, and we regularly report
extremely high satisfaction among our members.''
</P>
<P>
   On Medigap policies, Consumer Reports reported a 35 percent
average jump in premiums since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The article also projected that seniors will face market turmoil
as HMOs increasingly scale back benefits, hike premiums or bail out
of unprofitable markets in response to lower government
reimbursement and soaring health care costs.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ This has got to be the most fun you can have in
Massachusetts politics without a Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   It is precisely because a Kennedy is leaving that the 1st
Congressional District, a Democratic stronghold encompassing parts
of Boston and several suburbs, is up for grabs and considered the
hottest campaign fight in the state these days.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, candidates without the best brand name in American
politics have a shot at hallowed ground: the kingmaker district
that gave President John F. Kennedy his start in national politics
and long served as home base to the late leonine speaker of the
House of Representatives, Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent Kennedy to hold the seat, Joseph P. Kennedy 2d,
is about to retire after six terms, and vying for his spot is a
sharp-elbowed, capacious-pocketed field of 10 strong Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Even better, the political junkies who abound here can follow a
phenomenon now exceedingly rare in the center-straddling Democratic
Party of the Clinton era: contenders in this grand old bastion of
blue-collar, lunch-pail liberalism are sparring in part over just
who is the most liberal liberal on the liberal block.
</P>
<P>
   At an evening candidates' forum last week in the working-class
Dorchester neighborhood, one candidate, George Bachrach, a former
state senator, introduced himself to a reporter as ``an unabashed,
unrepentant, unreconstructed liberal.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ray Flynn, the former mayor of Boston who is considered the
current front-runner in the race, who does not hesitate to identify
his brand of politics with the New Deal of Franklin D. Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, there seemed so much liberal consensus at the forum,
which local schoolchildren had helped organize as part of a lesson
in democracy, that one candidate complained it could hardly be
called a debate. Yes to tens of billions more federal dollars for
education, the candidates said; yes to universal free health care;
yes to more government money for child-care and elder-care and
antipoverty programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's refreshing about this race,'' said a veteran Democratic
political consultant, Daniel Payne, ``is that in an America where
politics have become very bland and Democrats and Republicans sound
very much alike and seem very cautious about positions, virtually
all the candidates in this race are well left of center.''
</P>
<P>
   But the more-liberal-than-thou uniformity hardly makes for a
dull campaign, observers hasten to point out.
</P>
<P>
   First, they note, the stakes are so high. The Eighth is not just
any seat _ in political history, it is practically a throne. It has
been held by James Michael Curley, Boston's ``Rascal King Mayor;''
it was Tip O'Neill's seemingly forever John Francis Fitzgerald, the
Kennedy forebear known as Honey Fitz, and in 1946, he watched his
patrician 29-year-old grandson, John F. Kennedy, win it.
</P>
<P>
   The Eighth ``is a kind of a cherished district in Boston because
so many famous Boston politicians have started their national
careers there,'' said Thomas O'Connor, a historian of the city.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a geographic and sociological oddity. Roughly
T-shaped and encompassing 40 percent of Boston plus several
suburbs, it includes areas as diverse as the Brahmin country of
Beacon Hill, the predominantly minority section of Roxbury, the
egghead commune of Cambridge and much in between.
</P>
<P>
   And the real suspense in the race is already mounting right now,
in the lead-up to the Sept. 15 primary, for the district is so
overwhelmingly Democratic that the primary is considered the
end-all of the campaign, even though a Republican, Philip Hyde, who
previously competed for the seat, is also running.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   So lively is the campaign that analysts say it may end up
surpassing the gubernatorial race in spending, particularly given
the early financial push by three millionaires: Tom Keane, a member
of the Boston City Council who invokes the spirit of former Sen.
Paul Tsongas; Chris Gabrieli, a high-tech venture capitalist with a
fancy campaign Web site and lavish television time, and John
O'Connor, husband to a supermarket heiress and is known as a
campaigner for environmental causes.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the field of 10, some observers say, is worth
watching as a bellwether for various strains in current Democratic
politics.
</P>
<P>
   For example, said Lou DiNatale, a senior fellow at the McCormack
Institute, a public policy center at the Boston campus of the
University of Massachusetts, there is the female factor. Two women
are running _ Marjorie Clapprood, a former radio talk-show host,
and Susan Tracy, a veteran of city political work and one of four
lesbians running for national office this year who are openly gay.
How the two female candidates fare, DiNatale said, could answer the
question, ``Are gender issues working in the liberal community?''
</P>
<P>
   Bachrach and O'Connor he would call ``great white liberals'' in
the style of perhaps a decade ago, while Gabrieli and Keane lean
more toward Clinton-style moderation.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are two minority candidates, each with solid
bases in their communities but little money: Charles Yancey, a
black City Council member and president-elect of the National Black
Caucus of Local Elected Officials, and Alex Rodriguez, who was
recently assistant deputy secretary of the treasury and is perhaps
the most aggressive oratorian of the bunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to bite this race in the butt,'' he told a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Minorities make up about 40 percent of the district, but it also
has a heavy Italian population that could help Michael Capuano, the
mayor of the city of Somerville, who boasts that the working-class
suburb has reduced the average public-school class size to 19.
</P>
<P>
   On issues, the biggest divergence from liberalism-as-usual
appears to be Flynn's opposition to abortion; the other candidates
took pains to point that out at a televised debate on Tuesday
night. Political analysts say they expect Flynn to retain his lead
into the final lap, but the hottest question then will be whether
the candidate in second place can pick up enough anti-Flynn votes
to win.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn remains sanguine. ``I think the people know exactly what
they want.'' he said in a recent telephone interview, ``someone who
will identify with them, work for them, protect Social Security,
the elderly, the poor and education.''
</P>
<P>
   For voters, the plethora of candidates has kept the race
confusing, and many remain undecided. There was no obvious trend
among an unscientific sampling of people asked on the streets in
the neighborhoods of Dorchester and Beacon Hill and in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a crowded field that it is really hard,'' said Steve
Capuccio, a 44-year-old systems analyst from Cambridge who plans to
vote for Flynn.
</P>
<P>
   If there was any agreement, it was on the sense of change that
comes when a Kennedy goes. Kennedy announced in March that he would
retire to devote more time to his family and business, the Citizen
Energy Corp., which was founded in 1979 as a nonprofit company to
deliver heating-oil to the poor but has since grown into a partly
profit-making conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of wish Joe Kennedy were still in,'' said Mike Kelly, a
Cambridge investor. ``Kennedys have an automatic vote in my
house.''
</P>
<P>
   But Donald Wilson, 38, a real estate businessman who lives on
Beacon Hill, had no such regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The race is less interesting, but I would not want a Kennedy
in the race,'' Wilson said. ``I've had my fill of Kennedys.''

<P>
   QUINCY, Mass. _ He was his musical father's middle child _ a
smart and quiet kid who told corny jokes, savored science fiction
films and so ached to visit America that when the chance came
unexpectedly last month, he jumped at it.
</P>
<P>
   Gaelic football was Shane Patrick McGettigan's passion in his
native Drumshanbo, Ireland, a village of 700 just 25 miles south of
Northern Ireland. And football was his ticket to Massachusetts,
where he died Tuesday amid a jumble of steel tangled by tons of
brick, working the day job that was his pastime for a sport he took
more seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a big, strong, gentle type of a lad _ very
happy-go-lucky and very, very popular,'' said Eamonn McGowan, the
manager and trainer of the Allen Gaels, his team in County Leitrim,
Ireland. ``The whole town is totally devastated by this. Nobody can
believe this has happened. He's only been gone from Ireland for
three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   A month shy of his 22nd birthday, McGettigan and another Irish
workman, 23-year-old Ronan Stewart from County Louth, were killed
when a construction-site scaffolding collapsed at a Quincy
high-rise condominium.
</P>
<P>
   As federal officials investigate the cause of the collapse, and
families of the dead men prepare for the return home of their
bodies for burial, friends and teammates said McGettigan's grisly
death was cruelly incongruous to his life of laughter, music and
small-town friendships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll miss that stupid smile on his face _ his stupid jokes,''
Kieran McWeeney, McGettigan's best friend said in a telephone
interview from Drumshambo. ``He wanted to see the world _ to get
away from here for a little bit. He was so good to be around.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many of his countrymen, McWeeney was recruited last year to
play Gaelic football for a team in Chicago _ a season he enjoyed
while McGettigan spent the summer of 1997 as a laborer on a
construction site outside of Dublin, building a wall alongside a
highway.
</P>
<P>
   When McGettigan's turn came last month in a telephone call from
a Gaelic football recruiter in Boston, he did not hesitiate.
``We're only a small village here,'' McWeeney explained. ``He
jumped at the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   McGettigan's father, Charlie, had achieved local celebrity in
Ireland 1995 when he won a pan-European song contest, followed by
millions, with his entry, ``Rock and Roll Kids.''
</P>
<P>
   But his only son made a name for himself on the football fields,
winning two medals with the Allen Gaels in 1996 and 1997. He was
selected to play for the all-county team, a distinction in a
country where their blend of football is taken as seriously as the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sport was a big thing in his life,'' said Enda McGlone, a
long-time family friend. ``He played a little music, but ended up
choosing football over music. He planned on coming back here in
September for what would have been his last year in college.''
</P>
<P>
   McGettigan was enrolled at Dublin City University, where he was
a communications student who was interested in pursuing a
film-making career, perhaps, said McGlone, to satisfy his appetite
for the whiz-bang special-effects films of movie titans like Steven
Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   In its editions Thursday, the Irish Mirror recounts an interview
with McGettigan about his father's local fame and his own
achievements.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for my dad being famous, well, he might be to others, but
he's just dad to me,'' he said. ``But hopefully after today (a
championship match) people will be asking him, `Are you Shane
McGettigan's father?' rather than asking me if I'm Charlie's son.
He's fanatical about football and he'll certainly be cheering us on
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie McGettigan was to board a US-bound jetliner late
Wednesday, accompanied by his daughters Ciara, 25, and Tara, 18, on
a journey to bring his son's body home.

GERMANS REJECT CHALLENGE TO DAIMLER STOCK OPTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ A German court rejected a challenge Wednesday to the
way Daimler-Benz AG rewards 1,600 of its executives with stock
options. The ruling, by a court in Stuttgart, allows Daimler
managers to continue to invest in the company by buying convertible
bonds whose price is lower than the company's stock price.
</P>
<P>
   The decision swept aside objections by a management professor,
Ekkehard Wenger, that the stock-option plan linked management
rewards solely to the stock price rather than considering the stock
price's performance relative to that of the overall market. It also
helped pave the way for Daimler to tackle the problem of pay
differences between its executives and those of Chrysler Corp.,
which it plans to acquire this fall in a stock deal.
</P>
<P>
   The pay differences between the United States and Germany drew
attention last week when a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission disclosed that Chrysler's chairman and chief executive,
Robert Eaton, had received $69 million in bonuses, stock and stock
options in previous years that will be paid in cash and stock when
the deal is completed. He also received a pension sweetener that
could be worth $360,000 annually for life if he stays with the
merged company for three years.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the 10-member management board of Daimler, the
executives who run the group's day-to-day business, together make
less than the salary, bonus and stock options exercised last year
by the No. 2 Chrysler executive, Robert A. Lutz, whose compensation
package totaled more than $13 million. He retired on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Though the salaries of senior German managers are rarely
disclosed, Daimler's chief executive, Jurgen Schrempp, is thought
to earn the equivalent of $1.1 million to $1.5 million a year, plus
the returns on Daimler stock options. But the cumulative payout for
all 10 management board members, if all options are exercised, is
estimated to total about $570,000.
</P>
<P>
   The top 10 Daimler executives combined were paid the equivalent
of $12.3 million, slightly below their 1996 pay, the company's
disclosure statements show.
</P>
<P>
   Wenger, who teaches at the University of Wurzburg, views Daimler
with suspicion because the plan will lead to the annual creation of
as many as 22 million shares, diluting others' holdings. He said he
would appeal the decision to Germany's highest court.

<P>
   In the acquisition agreement, which was released in Germany this
week, Daimler and Chrysler said they sought executive pay
arrangements that would be competitive on both sides of the
Atlantic ``both with regard to the type and variety of programs as
well as the amount of remuneration.''
</P>
<P>
   Stock-option plans are relatively new in Germany and have come
under the influence of American ideas about motivating executives
to create shareholder value. But other German corporations,
including Lufthansa, link such plans not only to the share price
but also to its performance relative to the overall growth of the
German stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Daimler introduced stock options in 1996, and German law
requires that executives hold the bonds for up to two years. They
may not convert them until the share price on which they are based
increases by at least 15 percent. Though the original plan was
intended for 170 senior executives, Daimler expanded it last year
to include the much broader group.
</P>
<P>
   Experts expect Daimler to gradually adjust its compensation
structure to those in the United States, especially because the
largest bloc of shareholders _ roughly 44 percent _ will be former
Chrysler shareholders. But this will have to be done within the
limits of German law because the merged company, to be known as
DaimlerChrysler, will be a German corporation.

 &HT;    Clinton aide: Conservatives hurt AIDS prevention efforts

<P>
   ATLANTA _ White House AIDS adviser Sandra Thurman pulled no
punches, as usual, during a Wednesday talk on AIDS prevention in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``This conservative swing that we have in Congress and school
boards and at the state level is a huge impediment,'' Thurman said
during her hourlong speech, presented at the National Leadership
Conference to Strengthen HIV/AIDS Education and Coordinated Health
School Programs. The conference is sponsored by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Thurman, the former executive director of AID Atlanta and a
Clinton appointee, said ``plain old advocacy'' is the best way to
change U.S. lawmakers' conservative approach toward AIDS education
and prevention programs. She urged AIDS educators and teachers to
speak with legislators at all levels of government and to educate
them about the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have got to talk about condoms. We have got to talk about
needle exchange,'' Thurman said. ``Our children's future depends on
it. It means we have to do more than we ever planned to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But getting condom ads on television will be tough, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very sensitive issue,'' said Thurman. ``I'm not sure
we're making much progress. But we'll continue to make that push.''

TEXAS TOWN RECALLS DAY OF 120-DEGREE HEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEYMOUR, Texas _ Long before talk of global warming, this North
Texas farm-and-ranch community experienced what its local history,
``From Salt Pork to Sirloin, Vol. II,'' wryly called ``Seymour's
proudest heat wave.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 12, 1936, the temperature climbed to 120 degrees. That
set a state record that remained unchallenged until 1994, when the
far West Texas town of Monahans matched it.
</P>
<P>
   Many a Seymour resident will note that 120 degrees was far less
agreeable in 1936 than in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   There were no air conditioners, central or window-mounted, and
some folks didn't own fans. Johnnie Jackson Miller, who lived on
farms outside of town, was among many people whose homes had no
electricity except for a propeller-driven wind charger that powered
one light and the family radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recall exactly what my mother did that day,'' said Miller,
69. ``She poured water in the chicken house to keep the chickens
from dying. Then she brought water into the house and poured it on
the floor to try to cool it down. All day, she'd draw water for the
chickens and pigs.''
</P>
<P>
   It still gets hot in and around the Baylor County seat, 59 miles
southwest of Wichita Falls, although the thermometer at Farmers
National Bank showed a relatively mild 85 degrees shortly after
noon Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, a welding spark ignited pastures, tinder dry from a
month of 100-plus temperatures. The 48-hour blaze blackened 2,000
acres and destroyed a firetruck, despite the best efforts of 60
volunteer firefighters and four airplanes, ``The Baylor County
Banner'' reported.
</P>
<P>
   But that broiling August day smack in the middle of the Great
Depression remains a communal time peg.
</P>
<P>
   It is somewhat easy for residents to recall because it was the
day of the Old Settlers Reunion and Rodeo picnic during Texas'
centennial year celebration, attracting 800 people by one count.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the ground was hot,'' said H.A. Dodd, 71. ``I
remember because I had no shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   At the rodeo, none of the cowboys and cowgirls suffered heat
exhaustion, and no one among the spectators collapsed, ``From Salt
Pork to Sirloin'' said.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Collier, 82, recalls hitchhiking in from Paradise in Wise
County, taking a cooling, clothing-free dip in a stock tank with 20
other boys before making it over to the reunion bash.
</P>
<P>
   ``No girls,'' he said of the summer immersion ritual. ``We were
near a road. But they couldn't see us. Didn't care if they did.''
</P>
<P>
   At the picnic, in the city park along Seymour Creek, more than a
ton of ice was trucked in to chill the lemonade.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Fancher, then 24, volunteered to help and was fearful
that he would be asked to work the barbecue pit. Luckily, J.W.
Ross, vice president of Farmers National Bank, appointed him to the
drinks stand.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't easy duty serving a thirsty crowd on one of the
hottest days in Texas history, Fancher recalled Tuesday after a
roast chicken lunch at the Seymour Senior Citizens' Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miss Hazel Williams and myself served lemonade to every mother
and child,'' he said. ``We don't know how much, but we did it
non-stop for hours.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From Salt Pork to Sirloin'' said it was so hot that day that
10 medical thermometers blew up in a Seymour doctor's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe it,'' said Pauline Allen Bradwell, 84. ``I
never heard that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was hot,'' Bradwell acknowledged. ``We fashioned a
home-made `air conditioner' with straw, wire, water and a fan.''
</P>
<P>
   Seymour families tried an assortment of ways to beat the heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the daytime, we'd just sit under an old mesquite tree and
fan ourselves,'' recalled Mary Mocek, 90. ``We drank from a
container wrapped in a wet gunny sack. At night, we'd take our
sheets off the beds, wet them down, wring them out good and then
put them back down to sleep on. That was our `air conditioning.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Oleta Hayley, ]82, said she remembers being ``nearly smothered
to death'' by the heat on Aug. 12, 1936. Her husband insisted that
they sleep outside. Hayley tried it, but moved back inside even
though they didn't own a fan. ``I can't sleep without something
between my head and the way beyond,'' she said, gesturing toward
the skies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard days, but happy days,'' Hayley said.
</P>
<P>
   Fancher said he slept on a quilt and a wagon sheet on the ground
outside even though ``mosquitoes went after you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just accepted it,'' he said. ``We didn't know any
difference.''

ANALYSIS: POLITICS PRODDING FCC TO FAVOR BELL COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: S.D., Ariz., S.C., N.J., Mo.)   (bl)  
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After more than two years in the regulatory wilderness, the
local Bell telephone companies are finally winning battles of
influence at the Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Their biggest victory yet came last week when the FCC
recommended that the Bells, along with GTE Corp., be allowed to
keep their local data networks to themselves instead of having to
resell them to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   FCC Chairman William Kennard described the proposal as a bid to
jump-start the deployment of high-speed data services to American
homes. By allowing the Bells to avoid reselling the use of their
systems, the FCC is trying to give them incentives to invest in
advanced data services.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposal also reflected a complex and powerful set of
political pressures that have come to bear on the FCC. The Bells'
political influence seems to have combined with Kennard's relative
vulnerability, the impatience on Capitol Hill with the pace of the
communications revolution, and Washington's native partisanship to
push the FCC in its current direction.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are immense, coming as technological change and
corporate consolidation continue to sweep through the
telecommunications industry. Those changes, in fact, have
contributed to labor disputes between several of the Bells and
their union employees represented by the Communications Workers of
America _ some 73,000 of whom walked off the job early Sunday after
failing to reach a new contract with Bell Atlantic. Those employees
returned to work Tuesday, but only after Bell Atlantic agreed to
let the union into two new, fast-growing ventures that it was
trying to develop using nonunion labor.
</P>
<P>
   But all the Bells are locked in a regulatory and financial war
with the big long-distance carriers to dominate the nation's $200
billion telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
   That war has two main fronts. One is the $80 billion
long-distance market, with the Bells trying to get in and the
existing long-distance giants trying to keep them out. That battle
is at a standstill, with a key court case yet to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The other front is the growing market to provide high-speed
Internet access to consumers, who are generally stuck with modems
that make linking to the Internet tedious.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's FCC proposal would give the Bells an important boost
by allowing them to deploy local data networks through subsidiaries
without sharing them, as they must for most of their systems.
</P>
<P>
   That is just fine with many members of Congress because they
want to be able to show voters that something tangible _ and good _
has resulted from the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The law was supposed to usher in an age of broadly lower rates
and broadly better and more advanced services. But that has not
happened.
</P>
<P>
   The specter that hangs over many members of Congress, especially
those on the Senate and House Commerce Committees, which oversee
the FCC, is that of former Sen. Larry Pressler, R-S.D.
</P>
<P>
   Pressler was the sole incumbent Republican senator to lose in
the 1996 elections. As chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee,
Pressler had been highly identified with the act. He lost his seat
to Rep. Tim Johnson, in part because Johnson convinced voters that
the act was not good for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who succeeded Pressler as the
committee's chairman, is bent on not allowing that to happen to
him. He has railed against the act since its passage and has been a
big proponent of relaxing restrictions on the five remaining Bells:
Ameritech, Bell Atlantic, BellSouth, SBC Communications and U S
West.
</P>
<P>
   He is not alone. The Bells remain the dominant communications
lobby in Washington. While some powerful members of Congress _
including Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., ranking Democrat on the Senate
Commerce Committee, and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott _ are
generally identified with the long-distance carriers, the Bells
still seem to have more muscle to flex.
</P>
<P>
   That is largely because the Bells have customers and employees _
read voters _ in hundreds of congressional districts nationwide,
while the big long-distance carriers tend to be concentrated
geographically _ AT&AMP;T in New Jersey, for example; MCI
Communications in the Washington, D.C., area and Sprint in the
Kansas City area.
</P>
<P>
   Because Congress controls the FCC's budget, its wishes naturally
carry some weight.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress' influence at the FCC has appeared to grow since
Kennard became chairman, partly because he was not the first choice
of anyone important in the first place. He got the job in a
compromise between Vice President Al Gore, who favored Kathleen
Wallman, a former chief of the FCC's common-carrier bureau, and
Hollings, who favored Ralph Everett, one of his former aides.
</P>
<P>
   So Kennard has not appeared to have the same level of support
from the White House that was enjoyed by his predecessor, Reed
Hundt, who is a close friend of Gore. And he also lacks a solid
power base in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Hundt seemed to fight the Bells at every turn with a sharp
tongue and an even sharper pen. Part of Hundt's combativeness
seemed to stem simply from his personality. But he also seemed to
draw confidence from his relationship with the vice president.
Kennard does not have that luxury.
</P>
<P>
   But that has not prevented Republicans in Congress from using
the FCC as a political surrogate for Gore, a potential Presidential
candidate in 2000. Gore, after all, is primarily identified with
two issues: the environment and communications.
</P>
<P>
   McCain; Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., a member of the Commerce
Committee; and House Speaker Newt Gingrich have each demonstrated
an interest in communications policy and are each considered
potential presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   When a dispute arose over the commission's plan to raise money
to subsidize Internet connections for schools and libraries, the
fees were immediately labeled the ``Gore tax'' on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that this is an election year and that the next
presidential election is little more than two years away has
appeared only to increase the congressional pressure on Kennard to
move away from Hundt's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Bells are helped by the very nature of
telecommunications regulation in the United States. The local
telephone industry, especially the Bells, is regulated much more
strictly than is the long-distance industry.
</P>
<P>
   So when anxious members of Congress press the FCC to ``do
something'' to shake up the communications landscape or to ``get
out of the way of the marketplace,'' that often ends up being
translated into relaxing restrictions on the Bells or on local
phone companies generally.
</P>
<P>
   If that dynamic does not change soon, the Bells may be in for
more victories.

U.S. RECORD IN BRINGING TERRORISTS TO JUSTICE A DISMAL ONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: AFRICA-RDP, AFRICA-ENVOY, AFRICA-BOMBING, AFRICA-DEAD) 
(JT) 
 By TIM WEINER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ In the war between the United States and
terrorists since the 1983 bombing of the American Embassy in
Beirut, Lebanon, the score is grim.
</P>
<P>
   Today it stands: Americans killed in bombings and hijackings in
the Middle East and Africa _ 307. Terrorists convicted for those
crimes by American courts, a bare handful.
</P>
<P>
   As the FBI and the CIBA set up shop in borrowed offices here and
in Tanzania, scrounging desks and telephones while spearheading a
global search for the people who bombed the American embassies five
days ago, they know all too well that acts of terror committed
overseas are the most difficult cases to crack.
</P>
<P>
   The complexity and sophistication of foreign terrorist
organizations is increasing, present and former intelligence
officials say. The audacious timing and logistical skill required
in the bombings last week _ one group fomenting two nearly
simultaneous attacks more than 300 miles apart, killing at least
257 people and leaving no clear trace _ was breathtaking to
veterans of the war on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two at once is not twice as hard,'' said Milton Bearden, a
retired senior CIA official who was the ranking officer for the
agency in Afghanistan, Pakistan and the Sudan. ``Two at once is 100
times as hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The war was hard enough before the bombings. Terrorist groups
seem to know more about American intelligence than the American
intelligence knows about them, Bearden said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, the domestic law-enforcement agency, is operating
abroad, searching for clues in unfamiliar terrain and seeking help
from local officials and other residents who are sometimes
unhelpful.
</P>
<P>
   On overseas investigations, the FBI and the CIA have to work
together. But they began only recently to cooperate, after decades
of mutual mistrust, intelligence and law-enforcement veterans say.
The intelligence agency, despite its best efforts, has few reliable
sources in international terrorist networks.
</P>
<P>
   The Kenyan government announced Wednesday night that it had
arrested suspects. So did the government in Tanzania this week. But
those arrests appear unpromising. And there are many reasons not to
expect swift justice under American law.
</P>
<P>
   No one may ever know whether the bombings last week were
supported by a state like Iraq, an intelligence service like Iran's
or an individual like the exiled Saudi financier Osama bin Laden.
Bin Laden has hailed such attacks in the past, financed terrorist
groups from Egypt to Algeria to Afghanistan and sought to unify
them under his banner, according to intelligence officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This in all likelihood was not state supported, and if it's
not, `Terror Inc.' is beginning to creep in,'' Bearden said.
``Whether or not bin Laden was in on it there may be an emerging
linkage between bin Laden, the Islamic Jihad guys and the Islamic
Group out of Egypt. If so, these people are close to becoming a
state unto themselves.''

 NAIROBI, Kenya: unto themselves.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   All are suspects, American officials said. But following a trail
from the rubble of the embassies to a command center in Baghdad, a
clandestine cell in Tehran or a terrorist training camp in
Afghanistan would be a long haul.
</P>
<P>
   The networks are by nature almost impossible to unravel. The
chain of command in a sophisticated group connects the intellectual
author of the terror to the attackers who carry out his will. But
that chain has many links, and no one person in the chain may know
the identity of the next.
</P>
<P>
   The man who builds the bomb may know nothing of the man who pays
him, or the man who drives the bomb to its target. So locating a
bomber or his car may lead nowhere. It can be extraordinarily
difficult for investigators to recreate the chain.
</P>
<P>
   The search sometimes never ends. The CIA is still looking for
the assassins who killed its Athens station chief, Richard Welch,
in 1975. And no one has ever been arrested by American authorities
in the bombings of the U.S. Embassy and the Marine barracks in
Beirut in 1983 that killed 255 people or in the bombings of two
military posts in Riyadh and Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, in 1995 and
1996 that killed 26 American military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   But the Beirut and Dhahran cases provide lessons for the
investigators in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam today. The investigation
of the Khobar Towers bombing, which killed 19 airmen, is at a dead
end. The FBI and the Saudi intelligence service would not share
information.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau, which had never conducted an investigation in the
kingdom, said the Saudis were uncooperative. The Saudis said the
bureau was highhanded.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can never catch the bad guys without the help of your
friendly local foreign security and intelligence services,''
Bearden said. ``You can't run roughshod over them.''
</P>
<P>
   The hunch that the Khobar Towers bombing was carried out by
Saudi dissidents with the help of outsiders _ possibly Iran or bin
Laden _ remains unproven. Suspicions that Iran has had a hidden
hand in such bombings date from the start of the modern era of
terrorism against American diplomatic and military posts, the
bombing of the Beirut Embassy in April 1983.
</P>
<P>
   That explosion damaged the CIA's ability to understand,
infiltrate and nullify Islamic terrorism. The bomb destroyed the
agency's Beirut station, killing seven officers, among them Robert
Ames, the top Mideast analyst. He had been the chief of the
clandestine service in the Arab world and a covert agent in Iran,
Lebanon, Kuwait and Yemen.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years before the bombing, he had won the trust of Ali Hassan
Salemeh, the security chief of Al Fatah, then one of the most
feared terrorist organizations. Salemeh provided the CIA with
warning of the assassination plots of radical Palestinian groups
and helped the agency obtain agents in Islamic political and
guerrilla organizations, former intelligence officials said. In
1979, Salemeh was killed by a car bomb, probably by the Mossad, the
Israeli foreign intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA has never had a source quite like Salemeh or an officer
quite like Ames, some intelligence officials said. The lesson, they
added, is that an intelligence service is only as good as its spies
and its sources. Until recently, another problem in terrorist
investigations outside the United States was a deep friction
between the CIA and the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CIA and the FBI did not cooperate as well as they ought
to,'' Jeffrey Smith, a former general counsel at the intelligence
agency, said. ``They did not share information. They frankly were
suspicious of each other.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Smith said, the bureau and the agency confronted the
fact that they were like the Army and the Navy during the invasion
of Grenada. He used the image that could not communicate because
their radios operated on different frequencies.
</P>
<P>
   They came from different cultures. A law-enforcement officer who
is confronting an evildoer wants to string him up. An intelligence
officer wants to string him along, to find out what he knows and
where that knowledge might lead.
</P>
<P>
   To overcome that clash, ``we got senior CIA people from Europe
and the Middle East together with senior people from the FBI'' for
a three-day meeting two years ago in Rome, Smith said. ``They asked
each other, `How do you handle the joint takedown of the terrorist
organization? Do you do this for purposes of prosecution or for
purposes of penetration?' It was the first time these conversations
had occurred, and when it was over the deputy director of the FBI
said, `We should have done this 40 years ago.'''

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Iraq is not only freezing all current U.N.
weapons inspections but is also threatening the long-term
monitoring that is crucial to preventing the country from producing
weapons of mass destruction in the future, U.N. officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq, which announced last week that it would no longer
cooperate with arms inspectors but would let video and other
technical surveillance continue, now says U.N. inspectors will not
be allowed to act on any violations that they discover.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the two chief inspectors said Wednesday in a letter
to the Security Council, they can no longer feel confident that
Iraq is not restarting prohibited weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Council will hold a preliminary meeting on Thursday to
confront this latest, unexpected problem in what has been a string
of confrontations. Not since the disarmament of Iraq began after
the Persian Gulf war in 1991 has President Saddam Hussein taken
such a clear step to block long-term surveillance that he would
have to accept in return for the lifting of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The disarmament was planned to fall into two phases, the first
involving teams on the ground physically seeking and destroying
prohibited weapons, ammunition and production plants. The second
phase, which was to have begun when all of the weapons were
accounted for, was based on the use of state-of-the-art
surveillance equipment, monitored from the inspectors' headquarters
in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that monitoring is done by cameras and sampling devices
for air, soil and water. The equipment has been installed on sites
that the inspectors say they need to watch indefinitely. The crux
of making this system work is the inspectors' right to return to
the field to inspect anything that looks suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   Independent arms-control experts have suspected that the
long-term monitoring would face problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't check something that you discover by monitoring,
then there's no point in monitoring,'' said Gary Milhollin,
director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control. ``If
Iraq is saying you can't do any more inspections, even if the
monitoring indicates something suspicious, then you might as well
not be there.''
</P>
<P>
   The two chief U.N. arms inspectors _ Richard Butler for
biological, chemical and missile systems and Mohammed el-Baradei
for the clandestine nuclear program _ said Wednesday that Iraq was
not only blocking follow-up searches in cases when monitoring
raised questions but had frozen technical talks regarding the
history of Iraq's weapons production.
</P>
<P>
   In letters to the Security Council, Butler, executive chairman
of the U.N. Special Commission, and Baradei, director general of
the International Atomic Energy Agency, said Iraq's refusal to
cooperate with active inspections was already weakening what they
called ``ongoing monitoring and verification.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This denies the right of the commission to inspect additional,
nondeclared sites, where the capabilities for conducting proscribed
or monitorable activities may exist,'' Butler wrote. ``Such
conditions significantly reduce the effectiveness of monitoring.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials and independent experts have also feared the
possibility that Iraq might destroy the monitoring equipment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and
International Security in Washington and a former expert for the
atomic energy agency who has worked in Iraq, said Wednesday that he
was ``a little surprised'' that this Iraqi action had happened so
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly they want to weaken the inspection effort,'' he said.
``It's quite serious if the Iraqis do not roll this one back.''
</P>
<P>
   It is very important for inspectors to go where they want at
short notice, Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they are just blind shots in the dark,'' he said.
``Sometimes they may have intelligence information. Some of these
searches have turned up important things. Without these searches
the monitoring is useless.''
</P>
<P>
   Arms-control experts say it is important that the Security
Council, and above all the United States, act firmly and quickly if
Iraq is to be deterred from further undoing disarmament
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   At the Wisconsin Project in Washington, Milhollin said Iraq had
``made a cynical judgment that the United States is not willing to
force Iraq to accept meaningful inspections.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From the response so far of the Clinton administration,'' he
said, ``Iraq appears to be correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire history of these inspections shows that unless the
United States actively backs the inspection teams with the threat
of force, that Iraq will not comply.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Security Council appeared Wednesday to be taking
a cautious approach to the new challenge from Saddam. Some
diplomats said the Iraqi leader was only making the situation worse
for himself by alienating his supporters in Council debates.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq must be certified free of nuclear, biological, chemical and
prohibited missile programs or the means to restart them in order
to have the ban on Iraqi oil sales lifted. The lifting of that
embargo has been the focus of Iraq's single-minded campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But as Iraqi violations of Council resolutions and of the
agreement signed with Secretary-General Kofi Annan in February
mount, chances of sanctions being lifted in October during the next
review fade significantly.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Iraq has always responded to threats, most of
all military threats, and there are none this time.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of warnings of retaliation, the Iraqis have been
steadily rolling back restrictions on themselves and opening new
diplomatic links within the Middle East and in the United Nations.
Some experts say it will be harder to turn back this progress away
from restrictions by the Iraqis as time goes by.

COMMENTARY: DON`T FLUNK THE FUTURE  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The press is drawn irresistibly to that which is loud and
destructive. This seems especially true when it comes to leadership
in the black community. Persistent, quiet, dedicated work generates
little in the way of headlines or air time. But if someone starts
making outrageous comments and playing the fool, the reporters will
come running.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Price, president of the National Urban League, is not a
noisy man. But he is saying some things that need to be heard.
``The data tell us loud and clear,'' said Price, ``that our
children are decaying academically. We say our children equal our
destiny. But what destiny awaits us if nearly 80 percent of our
youngsters in Denver fail the fourth-grade reading tests, as they
did last year?''
</P>
<P>
   Delivering the keynote address at the annual Urban League
conference, which was held in Philadelphia last week, Price warned:
``The achievement deficits facing our children will be our undoing
if we don't reverse them.''
</P>
<P>
   His words echoed those of retired Gen. Colin Powell, who said at
the NAACP conference in Atlanta last month that there would be no
point in preserving affirmative action programs if black youngsters
were not prepared academically or socially to take advantage of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Both men stressed that a vast field of opportunity is now open
to black youngsters in the United States. But only catastrophe will
result if the black community fails to do a better job at what
Price calls ``the urgent matter of preparation.''
</P>
<P>
   The basic preparation begins long before conception. ``We must
make certain that our youngsters don't start out behind the eight
ball,'' said Price. ``Yet that's exactly what we do by bringing
infants into this world before their parents are mature enough to
nurture and provide for them.''
</P>
<P>
   He told his audience that at a minimum, just to avoid the
scourge of poverty, ``There are three things black parents must
persuade their teen-agers to do. First, get their high school
diploma. Second, get married before having their first child.
Third, hold off on having their first child until after they turn
20 themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``Only about 8 percent of children raised in households
that follow these rules experience poverty. By contrast, 80 percent
of the youngsters in households that ignore these rules end up
poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Price was blunt at times in his speech and in a recent
interview, but he was not pessimistic. He cited a number of
encouraging trends, including the birth rate for unmarried black
women, which has reached a 40-year low, and the high school
graduation rate of black youngsters, which now equals that of
whites.
</P>
<P>
   Still, too many black youngsters are in serious trouble
academically, including a large percentage of those who are
graduating. And Price seemed astounded by what he described as the
``blase'' attitude toward this continuing academic failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say we want our youngsters to do well in school,'' he said,
``but how involved are we in making certain that actually happens?
Blase is the word. There's no other way to describe why we tolerate
the lackadaisical attitude of many of our children and the lousy
performance of the schools they attend.''
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``I know I'm butting into other people's personal
business. But this is no time for politeness, obliqueness or
complacency. There's too much at stake and time is running out _
for our children and, thus, for our people.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the myriad problems that continue to plague
African-Americans, Price believes that the current conditions in
the United States offer blacks the ``best shot we have ever had to
shove ourselves the rest of the way into the American mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``With unemployment so low, employers are gobbling up
almost every willing and able worker with a pulse. Shame on us if
we don't seize this historic opening in the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Racial discrimination? It must be fought wherever it still
exists, said Price. But he suggested that the most egregious forms
are, in fact, abating. He said, ``I think we are moving rapidly
toward the day when if you've got something to put on the table,
employers aren't going to care what color you are.''

STOCKS REBOUND, LIFTED BY VALUE-SEEKING BUYERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BEAR-MARKETPLACE, RAT) 
(bl) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bargain hunters again tiptoed back into the stock
market Wednesday, picking up some of the issues battered the
previous day.
</P>
<P>
   This buying of small-company, oil, semiconductor and other
beleaguered stocks repeated the pattern that led the stock market
to rebound at the end of last week, after the Dow Jones industrial
average plunged 299.43 points on Aug. 4, its third-worst point
decline in history.
</P>
<P>
   But there were also signs of renewed interest in the big-name
stocks that have performed well all year, in part because investors
viewed earnings reliability as a haven in an uncertain market. This
buying helped lift the Dow Jones industrial average by more than
100 points during the day. And it held most of the gains, ending up
90.11 points, or 1.1 percent, at 8,552.96.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts, however, do not seem ready to say the market is out of
danger yet. And they point out that much of the market _ especially
small-company stocks _ is already in a bear market, having fallen
more than 20 percent in value.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is too much to expect the market to reach the bottom on
this leg,'' said Byron Wien, U.S. investment strategist at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter. ``First you have a frightening downleg, a
recovery from that, a relaxation of investor fears, and then
another downleg.'' That, he concluded, means there could be more
trouble in October, the time of last year's record one-day point
decline in the Dow. His forecast for the Dow at year end is 8,000.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Applegate at Lehman Brothers is more optimistic,
forecasting the Dow at 9,900 at year's end, which would give the
Dow an unprecedented four years in a row of double-digit gains.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, the market faces trouble ahead, in part because
Japan has yet to prove that it can get its economy back on track.
``You can't say we are out of this rolling correction yet,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 15.24 points, or
1.4 percent, to 1,084.22. Although both the Dow and the S&AMP;P
regained most of their Tuesday losses, they are still down 8.4
percent and 8.6 percent, respectively, from their July highs.
</P>
<P>
   As has been the case in the few days of recovery recently, the
Russell index of 2,000 smaller-company stocks and the Nasdaq index,
with many high-technology stocks, outperformed the marquee indexes.
The Russell rose 7.95 points, or 2 percent, to 408.55, while the
Nasdaq climbed 32.83 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,825.53. They are
16.9 percent and 9.4 percent, respectively, below their highs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The buying Wednesday was prompted in part by a reversal in the
Japanese yen, which rallied against the dollar after hitting an
eight-year low on Monday. This lead to a mixed day for stocks in
Asia _ which was better than usual _ and a rally in Europe before
Wall Street opened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just any day tell me what the dollar-yen is doing, and I will
tell you what U.S. equities are doing,'' said Applegate of Lehman
Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   But Latin American stocks continued to plunge, despite the yen's
rally. The Bovespa index in Brazil fell 4.4 percent and the Mexican
Bolsa index dropped 1.9 percent. Both markets were rattled by
growing fears that Russia would be forced to devalue the ruble,
adding to the pressure on other emerging market currencies.
</P>
<P>
   World markets have been following the movements of the yen
recently because it is a signal of the continued weakness of the
Japanese economy. U.S. officials say Japan must turn its economy
around to lead Asia out of it year-old economic crisis. Only then
will Asia's drag on the U.S. economy and corporate earnings be
eased.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the weak yen has focused attention on the
possibility of a devaluation by China, a move that would deepen the
Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The yen, which finished in New York at 146.44, rallied after
Japanese officials indicated overnight that the government was
prepared to intervene in the currency market to support the yen if
its decline accelerated. On Tuesday, the yen fell to 147.35 to the
dollar, surpassing the 146.78 low it hit before the surprise
intervention to support the yen by the United States and Japan in
June.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of official jawboning can slow a decline temporarily.
But currency traders do not seem overly concerned. Japan's
intervention alone to support the yen this spring had almost no
lasting impact. And the surprise intervention with the United
States on June 17, while effective at the time, did not support the
yen for long because Japan did not take the policy actions
investors think are needed to deal with the nation's banking
problems and to stimulate the economy.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric and Wal-Mart Stores led the Dow higher. GE, off
11.6 percent after the Dow hit its record high of 9,337.97 on July
17, rose 2 1/16, to 89]. Wal-Mart, which announced a 30 percent
surge in earnings on Tuesday, jumped 2, to 66.
</P>
<P>
   And then some stocks have just continued to rise, bucking the
market's trend. Apple Computer, whose stock is up 205 percent this
year, rose 1 1/16 Wednesday, to 40 1/16; it had risen 8.6 percent
since the Dow began to plunge.
</P>
<P>
   The performance of American Express on Wednesday was another
indication of how hard it is to rebound in the current environment.
It has been one of the best-performing stocks in the Dow this year,
although only a middling performer when included among the stocks
in the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   It announced last week that the crisis in Asia would cut into
its revenue in the second half of the year, and the stock dropped
6.8 percent in one day. Since its high for the year of 117~ on July
14, American Express had plunged 16.4 percent through Tuesday.
Wednesday, it jumped as much as 2}, or 2.8 percent, to 101\. But by
the end of the day it had given up most of its gain, rising just [,
to 98|.

TERRORISTS WHO ATTACK U.S. TARGETS OVERSEAS OFTEN GO UNPUNISHED 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Within hours of hearing that their embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania had been bombed last week, Americans once again witnessed
an all-too-familiar ritual: The president, somber and stern,
delivering a warning to the attackers that they would be tracked
down and punished for their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how long it takes or where it takes us,'' President
Clinton told the nation after the bombings, which killed more than
250 people, ``we will pursue terrorists until the cases are solved
and justice is done.''
</P>
<P>
   But while such hostility may make the nation feel momentarily
better, the truth of the matter is that terrorists who attack U.S.
targets overseas are seldom apprehended and punished.
</P>
<P>
   During the past 15 years, beginning with the brazen car-bomb
attack on the U.S. Embassy in Beirut that killed 16 people in April
1983, only a handful of perpetrators have been brought to justice
 &UR; _ &LR;  even fewer to courts in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In some instances, investigators have a good idea of who the
criminals are and still, because of diplomatic and sovereignty
concerns, are not able to bring them to the United States for
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, there is a gap between the rhetoric and
the action,'' said Edward Djerejian, director of the James A. Baker
III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University in Houston and a
former U.S. ambassador to Lebanon, Syria and Israel. ``The goal is
to narrow that gap by crafting policies to enable us to more
effectively identify, apprehend and bring to justice these
terrorists. That's the real challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty is compounded, Djerejian said, because in
addition to having to conduct an investigation in a foreign
country, U.S. authorities are more often than not hunting
individuals who are being sheltered and aided by ``sponsor''
nations, which help culprits obtain passports, identity documents
and money, and provide safe haven.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the United States considers nations such as Iran,
Iraq, Libya, Pakistan and Syria as countries that sponsor
anti-American terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Djerejian said, major acts of terrorism that have
occurred on American soil _ the 1995 bombing of the Oklahoma City
Federal Building and the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center in
New York City _ have been fairly quickly solved and the
perpetrators tried, convicted and sentenced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good record of catching terrorists here because
we're on our own turf, because we don't have diplomatic
difficulties and because people like (Oklahoma City bomber Timothy)
McVeigh had no support,'' Djerejian said.
</P>
<P>
   But consider the scorecard on some of the more serious attacks
on foreign soil in the last 15 years:
</P>
<P>
   _ In April 1983, 16 people died when a car bomb driven to the
front of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut exploded. Although
fundamentalist Muslims, including members of the Lebanese Party of
God, a Syrian and Iranian backed terrorist group led by Imad
Mughniyah, are suspected, there have been no arrests or
convictions.
</P>
<P>
   _ A few months later, in October 1983, 241 people died in a car
bomb attack at the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut. The same groups
as in the previous attack are suspected, but to date there have
been no arrests or convictions.
</P>
<P>
   _ In June 1985, U.S. Marine Robert Stethem, a passenger on Trans
World Airlines Flight 847, is killed by Party of God terrorists who
have hijacked the plane. Four people, including Mughniyah, are
charged in a sealed indictment in the United States and one of
them, Mohammed Al Hamadi, is arrested and convicted in Germany for
Stethem's murder. There were no convictions in U.S. courts.
</P>
<P>
   _ In October 1985, an elderly, American named Leon Klinghoffer
was shot and dumped overboard during the hijacking of the cruise
ship Achille Lauro in the Mediterranean Sea. Four Palestinians were
later arrested after U.S. Navy jets intercepted an airliner and
forced it to land at a U.S. base in Sicily. After their arrest,
President Reagan declared, ``You can run, but you can't hide.'' The
four were convicted in an Italian court, but the alleged
mastermind, Abul Abbas, was released.
</P>
<P>
   _ After Pan Am Flight 103 was blown up in the sky over
Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988, killing 281 people,
President-elect Bush pledged to ``seek hard and punish firmly,
decisively, those who did this if you can ever find them.'' Yet 10
years later, two men who have been indicted in the United States
and who are on the FBI's most-wanted list remain in Libya with a $4
million bounty on their heads.
</P>
<P>
   _ Despite President Clinton's promise that ``the perpetrators of
this cowardly act'' will be apprehended, there have been no arrests
and convictions for the March 1995 shooting of two U.S. diplomats
in Karachi, Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   _ The same is true of two bombings in Saudi Arabia in November
1995 and June 1996, when a U.S.-run military training center in
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and a military barracks in Dhahran were
attacked, resulting in the deaths of 7 and 19 people, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   There are limited, and mostly ineffective, tools available to
the United States to track down and arrest suspected terrorists,
said Brian Jenkins, a terrorism expert with Kroll Associates, an
international security organization. But before getting started, he
said, one must clear a major obstacle, determining who is
responsible.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, like the shootings of four Houston oil company
workers last year in Karachi, he said, the United States just
doesn't know with certainty who did it. In other cases, U.S.
investigators know who the individuals are, but don't have enough
evidence to indict them. And then there are suspects against whom
there is sufficient and compelling evidence, but who simply cannot
be found.
</P>
<P>
   Once an individual is identified, Jenkins said, there are,
basically five possible tools available to try and bring that
person to justice: If the person is being sheltered by a
``sponsor'' nation, then sanctions can be applied to that nation;
assassination could be an option if it were legal; military
retaliation could be considered; culprits can be captured and
brought to trial; and ransoms can be offered to ferret out
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that all of these, individually and
collectively, are very poor instruments,'' Jenkins said. ``The
truth is that we really don't have the tools and the means to wage
war against terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Jenkins said, U.S. efforts to track down and apprehend
terrorists have improved somewhat in the past 10 years largely due
to laws allowing the FBI to become involved in the investigation
and government offers of millions of dollars in rewards, both for
catching terrorists, and preventing attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is offering $2 million in the embassy bombings
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slowly things are changing,'' Jenkins said. ``Big sums of
money on the table help.''

TWO INDONESIAN OFFICERS SENTENCED IN STUDENT SLAYINGS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Two military officers whose troops killed
four university students in May, setting off a cataclysm of
violence and the resignation of President Suharto, were sentenced
to less than a year in prison on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A military tribunal found 1st Lt. Agus Tri Heryanto, 29, and 2nd
Lt. Pariyo, 30, guilty of violating military orders and not
controlling their troops, who shot at students protesting Suharto
and his 32 years in power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two defendants have been found guilty of taking action
outside of their orders or exceeding the limits of their orders,''
said Col. Saji Suradi, who presided over the two-month trial.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers said that the two officers were taking the blame
for the military and that they would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Students gathered outside the courtroom complained of the
leniency of the sentences: 10 months in prison for Heryanto and
four months for Pariyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sentence doesn't fit a crime this serious,'' said Rhea
Sutedja, who on the day of the incident was wounded by a rubber
bullet. ``If they only violated orders, then a heavier sentence
should be handed down to those who gave the orders.''
</P>
<P>
   The student killings set off three days of rioting, looting and
arson that left more than 1,000 people dead and sections of the
capital in ruins. Suharto resigned nine days later.
</P>
<P>
   The former commander of an elite unit of special forces, Lieut.
Gen. Prabowo Subianto, is being questioned by a military council
over his role in the kidnappings of Suharto opponents before
presidential elections last March. Prabowo is Suharto's son-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the council, Gen. Subagyo Hadisiswoyo, told
reporters Wednesday that Prabowo had misinterpreted orders and
``admitted that he was wrong,'' but it is not established that he
gave the orders to his troops to kidnap the political opponents.
Under the country's new president, B.J. Habibie, the military has
said it will go after officers implicated in rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have arrested 10 members of the special forces,
alleging they were involved in more than two dozen kidnappings.
Fourteen people remain missing.
</P>
<P>
   Those that have been released said they were abducted, tortured
and questioned about their political activities.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday the government, under court directive, agreed to lift
a ban on a pro-democracy youth group. The Suharto government had
banned the group, the Democratic People's Party.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 parties have formed since Habibie became President
on May 21. Suharto had allowed only three government-sanctioned
parties to operate.

YANKEES ROUT TWINS, 11-2, AFTER CONE SCARE  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Defeating the Yankees these days requires more than a
simple combination of good hitting, pitching and defense. Defeating
the Yankees requires a secret weapon, and unwittingly, Minnesota
deployed the size 13{ right foot of LaTroy Hawkins Wednesday _ a
big foot that oddly provided the Twins with their best chance for
victory in the three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, David Cone recovered from the impact of Hawkins'
right foot and the Yankees covered the Twins with a flood of
late-inning runs to win, 11-2, before 47,841 at Yankee Stadium. The
Yankees once again have a .750 winning percentage, having won 87 of
116 games, including their last seven. At 87-29, they have won 58
games more than they have lost, the first Yankee team to do so
since 1939.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been waiting all year to get everyone clicking together
on all cylinders,'' Cone said. ``I think we're starting to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the other games on their current homestand were a lot
easier. The Yankees were in jeopardy Wednesday; Cone was in
trouble. There were moments in the first innings when the Twins
could have broken open the game with one hit, when they could have
knocked out Cone, when they could have finally had the Yankees
reeling, if only for one day.
</P>
<P>
   And Hawkins' big right foot played a major part in creating this
opportunity. In the first inning, Cone, already out of sorts, was
rushing his delivery, his body moving forward with his arm dragging
behind. His control was affected, his fastball sailing high, his
curveball and slider imprecise. Two hits and a hit batsman loaded
the bases for Minnesota, and the Twins scored their first run on a
groundout. Cone returned to the dugout feeling fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins shut out the Yankees in the bottom of the first, and
when Cone returned to the mound, he found that Hawkins had dug an
unusually large hole in front of the rubber, where pitchers plant
their back foot as they drive forward while releasing the pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Cone excavated and kicked at the gash, working to fix it to his
liking. But, he would say later, his balance was affected, he felt
awkward. He walked Ron Coomer on four consecutive pitches to lead
off the second; he was unable to throw any of four fastballs over
the plate, and he was missing badly.
</P>
<P>
   Cone tried slowing his delivery, aiming intently at the mitt of
catcher Joe Girardi _ and the more he tried aiming the ball, the
more dysfunctional his delivery became. Javier Valentin stood and
watched Cone throw four more fastballs out of the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   Girardi went to the mound. ``Be patient, I'll figure it out,''
Cone said, digging at the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre watched, and although he says he believes Cone
when the pitcher tells him he feels great, he was seeing the
classic signs of a pitcher with a tired or injured arm: Cone, whose
control has been spectacular, simply could not throw a strike.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jerzembeck began throwing in the Yankees' bullpen, as Cone
fell behind Denny Hocking, Minnesota's No. 9 hitter, three balls
and no strikes. ``I can't remember a time when I threw 11 straight
balls,'' Cone said after the game. He saw Jerzembeck warming up and
assumed that he was in danger of being replaced.
</P>
<P>
   He threw a strike to Hocking, Yankee Stadium erupting with mock
cheers. Cone fired another fastball, and Hocking popped up to short
center field, the runners forced to hold. Later, Hocking and Cone
would point to this as a pivotal moment. ``I was thinking we might
bunt in that situation,'' Hocking said, ``but you've got to make
the guy throw strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Otis Nixon lined a single to right, but the ball was hit so hard
and reached Paul O'Neill so quickly that Coomer stopped at third.
Bases loaded, one out, infield back, Jerzembeck nearly ready in the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Brent Gates hit a bouncer to first baseman Tino Martinez, who
was in position to make the play only because the bases were loaded
and he wasn't holding the runner. Martinez gloved the ball and
threw to second, where Derek Jeter caught the ball for a forceout
and returned a throw to first for an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   Cone returned to the dugout and with both hands grabbed his
teammate David Wells, joking: ``How are you throwing strikes? Let
it rub off on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone said later: ``At that point, I breathed a sigh of relief. I
knew I could settle down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Twins scored another run in the third inning, but Cone was
making adjustments on the fly, adjusting to the hole, adjusting his
release, gradually gaining control of his fastball and slider.
Minnesota, only 1 for 6 with runners in scoring position in the
first three innings, would not get any more runs.
</P>
<P>
   And eventually, the Yankees came back. Four runs in the fourth,
including two on Girardi's hit-and-run double; three runs in the
seventh, with home runs by Bernie Williams and Scott Brosius; three
more in the eighth, including two on a double by Brosius that gave
him five runs batted in for the game.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins' foot had opened a hole, but the Twins couldn't get
through quickly enough.

LEADING EXPEDITIONS OF MUSICAL ARCHAEOLOGY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who, in musical history, could have guessed that a meddlesome
figure like Leon Botstein would come along?
</P>
<P>
   Not Mendelssohn, obviously. ``In everything I have written down
there is at least as much deleted as there is allowed to stand,''
the composer told a friend around 1842. ``My `St. Paul' originally
had a third more numbers, which shall never see the light of day.''
</P>
<P>
   But Botstein, the American academic turned conductor and
festival director, has exposed those numbers to the full glare of
recordings.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Botstein is gleefully exploring ``Tchaikovsky and
His World'' in performances and discussions filling the first of
two weekends at the Bard Music Festival in Annandale-on-Hudson,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 he devoted similar attention to Mendelssohn at Bard
College, and two years later he conducted the American Symphony
Orchestra and the Pro Arte Chorale in a performance of
Mendelssohn's path-breaking oratorio ``St. Paul,'' or ``Paulus,''
of 1836.
</P>
<P>
   Now, ever the contrarian, he has recorded the work in a new
critical edition from the Carlus publishing house, leading the
Royal Scottish National Orchestra and Chorus, and appending the 11
numbers that Mendelssohn thought would be interred with his bones
(Arabesque Z6705; three CDs).
</P>
<P>
   Another of Botstein's historical straight men was Deryck Cooke,
an English musicologist and the author of an influential essay,
``The Bruckner Problem Simplified,'' of 1975. ``The spurious Schalk
score,'' Cooke wrote there of the first edition of Bruckner's Fifth
Symphony, ``has been abandoned by everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for simplicities. In 1995, Botstein led the American
Symphony in a performance of the Bruckner Fifth in the edition by
Franz Schalk; now he has replicated that performance on disc with
the London Philharmonic Orchestra (Telarc CD-80509).
</P>
<P>
   And in response to no particular historical provocation except
his usual bugaboo, unjust neglect by posterity, Botstein throws in
another recording, of Erno Dohnanyi's First Symphony, which the
conductor unearthed in a Lincoln Center offshoot of the Bard
Festival in 1995 (Telarc CD 80511), here also with the London
Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   In the matter of Dohnanyi, little deliberation is needed. At his
best, as in the youthful First Piano Quintet, Dohnanyi was a
splendid composer, and he is here working in near-peak form. The
main focus of the festival at which the work was performed was
Bartok, and that composer thought so highly of his compatriot's
symphony that he could play it from memory at the piano.
</P>
<P>
   This work, from 1900, breathes much the same late-Romantic air
as the Zemlinsky symphonies, discussed elsewhere in these pages, a
volatile atmosphere laced with disparate influences: Bruckner,
Brahms and Tchaikovsky; Liszt, Wagner and Busoni.
</P>
<P>
   In the second of the work's five movements, the Molto adagio,
with its languid, sinuous melodies and its lush blend of strings
and woodwinds, you might suspect that Dohnanyi had heard
Rachmaninoff's Second Symphony, if that work had not lain six or
seven years in the future. Dohnanyi's work is, to be sure, an
immediate successor of Glazunov's ``Seasons,'' and in the Scherzo,
sounds it.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Hungariana in the middle of the second
movement is vintage Dohnanyi, and the composer speaks throughout in
a distinctive and piquant style. This work certainly deserves an
occasional hearing, and it is good to have it in a fine performance
and in Telarc's excellent sound.
</P>
<P>
   Here, as in the other recordings, it is minor curiosity that
although Botstein is the music director of the American Symphony
and has performed the music with it, an American label should
resort to a British orchestra and recording locale.
</P>
<P>
   But Botstein has also maintained a relationship with the London
Philharmonic, including an earlier recording of works by Joseph
Joachim. In any case, the musical results in the Dohnanyi and
Bruckner works make the decision hard to fault.
</P>
<P>
   The fluency and coherence generally accorded these big,
sprawling pieces here speak well, too, for Botstein's continued
growth in sheer technical terms as a conductor.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruckner performance is especially impressive, since
Botstein has not only to create an interpretation but also to
counter the expectations, orchestra's as well as listeners', raised
by familiarity with the other versions.
</P>
<P>
   Those scores, edited by Leopold Nowak and Robert Haas, are
nearly identical to each other and radically different from the
1894 version (published in 1896) by Bruckner's friend Schalk. The
basic issues are whether, as in other instances, Bruckner approved
of Schalk's cuts and emendations (if in these, his waning, years he
even knew about them), and whether he would have objected in any
event, being, supposedly, an acquiescent sort.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As if there were not enough controversy here, Botstein has
involved himself in recent debates over how much Haas' editorial
work, stressing the ``purity'' of original versions, and how much
the monumental Bruckner performance style since World War II may
owe to the Nazi ideology in Germany and Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Haas was cozy with the regime, no question. Pamela M. Potter, in
her new book, ``Most German of the Arts: Musicology and Society
From the Weimar Republic to the End of Hitler's Reich,'' suggests
that he was considered ``victimized'' in Austria before the
Anschluss, deprived of important academic appointments because he
had joined the Nazi party in 1933.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had also waged a difficult battle with `Jewish business
interests' for his Bruckner edition,'' Ms. Potter reports, citing
archival documents from the University of Vienna, ``a situation
which `was decided in his favor ... by our Fuhrer Adolf Hitler.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A CD booklet is not even remotely big enough to accommodate such
issues, which were discussed at length in connection with the
concert performance. Botstein merely suggests them here, arguing
chiefly that in the Schalk edition, which is substantially shorter,
the work ``possesses a special power and proportion that reveals a
new _ or, perhaps, simply a forgotten _ dimension of Bruckner's
music.''
</P>
<P>
   And as in the concert, he makes a persuasive case for this
alternative, adding lively tempos into the mix. The work takes on a
mercurial cast, as at the end of the first movement, where the coda
fairly skips toward conclusion. Still, Bruckner would not be
Bruckner without some monumentality and drama, and it was Schalk
who instituted the notion of bringing on a platoon of fresh brass
players for the work's peroration.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how such matters are handled in recordings is never
clear in the listening alone; suffice it to say that the
conclusion, in the London Philharmonic's performance and Telarc's
sound, is truly resplendent.
</P>
<P>
   Again as in the concert, there is no sense of mere demonstration
or didacticism. This is a gritty, committed performance from first
to last.
</P>
<P>
   Less can be said for the Mendelssohn recording, despite much
fine work from Botstein and the Scottish forces. The main problem
is an indifferent cast of vocal soloists (Susan Roberts, Ruby
Philogene, Glenn Siebert and Mark Beesley), especially the men, in
roles that have been well, sometimes superbly, recorded. (Thomas
Hampson's Paul in the Erato recording conducted by Michel Corboz is
a notable example.)
</P>
<P>
   This splendid work, which was inspired in part by Mendelssohn's
historic revival of Bach's ``St. Matthew Passion'' and is
especially rich in its use of chorale tunes, is well worth getting
to know. But Botstein's recording should probably not be anyone's
first or only one.
</P>
<P>
   The supplementary disc, including a few alternative versions of
published numbers as well as items dropped from the final version,
will be of interest principally to specialists.
</P>
<P>
   True, it also holds attractions for the average listener, but
the dislocations in original placement as well as intent between
numbers discourage listening straight through, and the whole thing
ends in mid-modulation, on an agonizingly unresolved chord.
</P>
<P>
   With the classical-recording industry still struggling to emerge
from the chaos caused by a suffocating glut of the overfamiliar,
Botstein's adventurous programming in recent years seems to have
cast him in a modest role of savior, bearing invigorating doses of
the ``new'' and unusual. Indeed, many of his archaeological finds
are likely to wear better on disc than in the concert hall.
</P>
<P>
   This impressive trove is a reminder of what a remarkable body of
work Botstein has accumulated over a decade of exploration. It also
shows promise of further development in the technical aspects of
conducting on his part, even though he has chosen roads that will
get him there only the hard way.

UNTANGLING A CRASH OF PRIORITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Days after the
</P>
<P>
   demolished truck was hauled away and the road cleared, Arizona
state police still were taking angry calls. Gov. Jane Hull even
joined the complainers, releasing a statement saying, ``Disrupting
traffic for five or six hours at a time is unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   You probably saw the pictures on TV or in the paper. Interstate
17 was shut down for more than four hours Sunday afternoon. The
backup stretched 30 miles and involved thousands of cars and
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   People had fled north for the weekend, away from the terrible
Phoenix heat, and now were heading home.
</P>
<P>
   Going from mountains to desert makes travelers crabby to begin
with. Then, they stopped. There was an accident ahead. They knew
that. But they had to get back to the city, back to their busy
schedules. It wasn't long before they wanted to know _ demanded to
know _ what was holding things up.
</P>
<P>
   It was a little girl.
</P>
<P>
   Her name was Layne Paulson, and she was 13 years old. Her body
on the road was holding things up.
</P>
<P>
   Layne had gone north for the weekend, too, and was returning
home. She and her father, George, along with his fiancee and her
daughter had been camping. The four of them were in the cab of
George's pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   South of Cordes Junction, where the road drops steeply and winds
along rock walls, a car in front of them suddenly swerved. The
driver told Department of Public Safety investigators he hit a
slick spot in the road, perhaps gas or oil from a big rig. The car
fishtailed, striking a guardrail and careening across the lane.
</P>
<P>
   George veered to avoid hitting him. He went off the road and
onto a narrow patch of dirt only a few feet from the rocks. As he
tried to steer back onto the pavement, his truck flipped over. No
one was wearing a seat belt. Layne was thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   The upside-down truck spun wildly, like a second hand on a
clock. Then time and traffic stood still.
</P>
<P>
   There was a doctor in one of the following cars. He rushed to
Layne, but it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a beautiful girl,'' her grandmother, Shirley Paulson,
told me. ``She was like sunshine walking into a room.''
</P>
<P>
   Shirley lives out of state. So does Layne's mother. Her father
and his fiancee remain in the hospital. The other girl was injured
only slightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen stories about the traffic and what the governor had
to say.'' Shirley said. ``I guess some people don't think about
how, when they have to stop because of a siren, they're the lucky
ones.''
</P>
<P>
   DPS spokesman Andy Vidaure has listened to complaints since
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand people's frustration,'' he said, ``but the fact
is there was a death.''
</P>

   Any accident may be a crime scene, he said. What if _ as
sometimes happens _ drugs or alcohol are involved? Or road rage? If
police don't gather all the evidence, there's no hope of making a

   ``We only get one shot at the scene,`` Vidaure said. ``It takes

   The pickup had been loaded with camping gear, and with dreams.
As any parent can tell you, no 13-year-old girl travels without a

   Layne Paulson was in the school chorus. She worked on the school
newspaper. A friend says she loved the band Hanson and going to the
mall. She was supposed to start high school next week. Her
principal at Desert Shadows Middle School in Phoenix told me, ``She
was a lovely girl. She would have been a spectacular grown-up.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true, said her grandmother, adding, ``But, sometimes, the
best people are only on this Earth for a little while, and we have
to cherish what we've had, and how precious they were.''
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, a traffic accident in which one person is killed
rates a passing mention on the TV news and only an inch or two of
type in the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   This one made the front page and was the lead story on all the
evening newscasts. But not because a girl died. &QL;

JUDGE OFFERS TO STEP DOWN IN HARRELSON CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Updates with judge offering to step down from the case.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JACQUE CROUSE  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ A federal judge who had a one-on-one basketball
face-off with actor Woody Harrelson has offered to step down from
hearing the high-profile murder appeal of the actor's father.
</P>
<P>
   The offer from U.S. District Judge Fred Biery followed ethical
questions raised about the half-hour game at a time when both men
were in Denver, where Biery was presiding over the latest appeal of
two life sentences given to Charles Harrelson.
</P>
<P>
   The judge _ a high school basketball player who went on to the
basketball program at Texas Lutheran College _ said the pick-up
game with Woody Harrelson occurred after a chance meeting with the
actor in the hotel health club.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the San Antonio-based judge freely discussed the
game and the situation that led to it, saying he did not believe it
raised any ethical concern.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, Biery offered to step aside. The judge faxed a
letter to lawyers telling them they can request the appeal be
reassigned to another judge if they object to the basketball
encounter _ or to any of Biery's other social relationships with
people in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors and defense attorneys in the case could not be
reached Wednesday for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all at the same hotel, the FBI agents, the
prosecutors, the defense attorneys and Woody Harrelson,'' Biery
said Tuesday. ``I would have had to lock myself up not to run into
someone involved in the case every day at breakfast, dinner and in
between.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Harrelson is appealing his 1982 conviction and two life
sentences for killing U.S. District Judge John H. Wood on May 29,
1979. Harrelson is an inmate at the federal prison in Florence,
Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Harrelson, whose movie credits include a film about
basketball called ``White Men Can't Jump'' and who played a
bartender on the television comedy ``Cheers,'' acknowledged last
week that he is footing the bill for his father's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Biery said he was getting ready to leave the gym on Aug. 5 when
Woody Harrelson came in.
</P>
<P>
   Biery, who works out several times a week by shooting baskets,
said they began to talk and decided to play a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did say he felt kind of awkward, and I told him we could
play as long as we did not discuss the case,'' Biery said. ``I also
had breakfast twice that week with FBI Special Agent Claude Martin,
who was there to testify. We also did not discuss the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Joan Bohl, a judicial ethics expert and instructor at
Southwestern University School of Law in Los Angeles, said though
no impropriety may have occurred, that is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a clear appearance of impropriety, and judges are held
to the standard of avoiding the appearance,'' she said. ``I was
shocked by this. He wasn't trapped in an elevator. He could have
said hello and cordially walked off, but he didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   University of Texas School of Law Professor Charles Silver,
however, said that as long as Biery is telling the truth that they
did not discuss the case, he sees nothing wrong with the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an appearance of impropriety issue for judges, but I
am always reluctant to assume there has been impropriety,'' Silver
said. ``Judge Biery has been around a long time, and he knows the
rules. In principle, there is nothing wrong with him and Woody
Harrelson being on opposite sides in a pick-up game _ or on the
same side, for that matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The Code of Conduct for federal judges requires them to avoid
impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all activities,
but sometimes chance encounters are unavoidable, a federal appeals
court judge said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Circuit Judge Jerry Buchmeyer, who serves on the federal
Committee on Codes of Conduct, said the restrictions require only
that a judge and parties not discuss the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do run into parties in a lawsuit, and I think judges in
small towns have the problem more than others, usually,'' he said.
``You might even go have a drink with a lawyer, but (neither) you
nor the lawyer discusses the case before the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Biery said about 20 other people were in the gym while he and
Harrelson played basketball for a half hour.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors that his law clerk took pictures of the game are false,
Biery said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has a 13-year-old nephew in Denver, and he came by and had
his picture taken with Woody and his two brothers,'' Biery said.

50 GLOBE WORKERS PROTEST BARNICLE REPRIEVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also tonight's Boston Globe story, GLOBE-BARNICLE-BOS) 
(nk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A burst of anger rolled through the newsroom of The Boston Globe
on Wednesday as at least 50 people signed a petition, which was
presented to the editor and publisher, saying that the reprieve
given columnist Mike Barnicle ``not only cripples the paper's
integrity but undermines the efforts of staff members who work
daily to produce a newspaper that is beyond reproach.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle had teetered on the brink of termination for five days
for writing a column that paralleled the work of the comedian
George Carlin and making apparently contradictory statements about
his familiarity with Carlin's work. After refusing his editor's
request that he resign and mounting a public campaign in his
defense, Barnicle was suspended for two months on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the decision by Editor Matthew Storin and Publisher
Benjamin Taylor offered raw comments in an hourlong staff meeting.
Automotive writer John White, a 33-year employee at the paper who
spoke at the meeting, said afterward: ``There has been a perception
for a long time that Mr. Barnicle answered to a different standard
than the rest of us. On this one, a lot of us are angry.''
</P>
<P>
   According to White, the hostility at the meeting was replaced
briefly with applause when Storin announced that Walter Robinson,
an assistant managing editor and a former metropolitan editor,
would edit Barnicle's future columns. Robinson was the editor who
identified potential problems with the work of another columnist,
Patricia Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith was forced to resign earlier this summer after
admitting she fabricated characters in some columns. She is black,
while Barnicle is white. The Boston chapter of the NAACP issued a
statement Wednesday echoing the charges that the paper has employed
a double standard.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the news that Barnicle was being asked to resign,
the columnist's many supporters inside and outside the newsroom
urged the paper's management to reconsider. The chief executive of
Staples, Inc., a leading advertiser, wrote a letter to Taylor
saying that losing Barnicle's column, ``would render The Globe a
less attractive advertising vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   Storin said Wednesday that the meeting was ``emotional and
candid and healthy.'' He added that he is ``getting a lot of
sentiment'' from among the paper's 520 editorial employees ``that
it's time to put this behind us.''

FORMER PROSECUTOR DEFENDS ACTION IN MAFIA BUG ORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The former federal prosecutor who got the court order
used to bug a Mafia induction ceremony again defended her legal
strategy Wednesday, insisting she withheld information from the
judge who granted the order because the FBI wanted to protect the
mob source who told them the time and place of the secret ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   As she did last week on the witness stand in a different mob
case, Diane M. Kottmyer, former head of the New England Organized
Crime Strike Force, said she kept details about the ceremony out of
court documents  &UR;  &LR; because the FBI didn't want to expose Mafia
informant Angelo ``Sonny'' Mercurio, who told agents the ceremony
would take place in a Medford house on Oct. 29, 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Kottmyer said she was told by the FBI that the details were so
closely-held, so ``singular,'' that mentioning them in the court
affidavit could point to Mercurio as the source of the information.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether Kottmyer, who is now a Massachusetts
Superior Court judge, provided US District Judge David S. Nelson
with all the pertinent information he needed to make a decision on
authorizing the bugging.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Kottmyer is being asked to defend the
government's decision to seek a so-called ``roving bug,'' which
doesn't specify the location to be bugged _ even though the FBI
knew hours before Nelson signed the order exactly where and when
the induction ceremony would take place. But Kottmyer said she
wasn't told before she sought authorization from Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   The legality of the bugging, which is being challenged in two
separate court cases involving the prosecution of mobsters and
their associates, is at the core of months-long hearings before US
District Judge Mark L. Wolf in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for New England Mafia boss Francis P. Salemme, Winter
Hill Gang leader Stephen Flemmi, Mafia soldier Robert DeLuca and
Winter Hill gangster John Martorano, argue that Nelson was given
incomplete information _ particularly regarding what investigators
knew about the planned induction ceremony. They want the tape
recordings of the ceremony suppressed as evidence in the extortion
and racketeering case against the region's top Italian and Irish
gangsters.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, during several hours of questioning by Martorano's
attorney, Martin G. Weinberg, Kottmyer said she was unaware that
the Boston office of the FBI had promised headquarters in
Washington that it would add the time and place of the induction
ceremony to the court affidavit accompanying the bugging
application as soon as agents learned the details.
</P>
<P>
   That was never done, even though then-organized crime supervisor
James A. Ring _ who testified earlier in the hearings _ said
Mercurio told him the time and place of the ceremony on Friday,
Oct. 27, 1989, hours before Kottmyer met with Nelson. Kottmyer
testified that Ring didn't tell her about Mercurio's information
until the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Even if she'd known the location, Kottmyer said, she was
precluded from putting it in the affidavit because of the FBI's
concerns about exposing Mercurio. And she had no authority to
convert her request for a roving bug to a more restrictive fixed
one, pegged to the Medford location.
</P>
<P>
   The package of documents seeking a roving bug had been approved
by Justice Department and FBI superiors in Washington, days before
anyone had firm information on where the ceremony would be held,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with prosecutors and Kottmyer in private, Wolf
will decide whether Kottmyer will be required to reveal whether the
FBI had other informants at the induction ceremony, besides
Mercurio.

IRAQ BROADCASTS VIDEO OF TALKS WITH U.N. ARMS INSPECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (with IRAQ-U.N.) 
(bl) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Iraq experimented this week with a television
propaganda blitz intended to court world opinion. The effort is
getting mixed reviews, and could backfire where opinion matters
most: in the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few days, Iraqi television, and networks around the
world, have been showing video footage of a tense standoff between
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz and the United Nations'
chief arms inspector, Richard Butler, in talks that broke down 10
days ago in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   More than four hours of tapes of two days of meetings have been
shown in Iraq. Networks have aired mostly one short clip that
appears to show Butler getting up from his chair and abruptly
ending the meetings Aug. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``That never happened,'' Butler said Wednesday in an interview,
recalling his last, admittedly chilly meeting with Aziz. ``The
meeting ended in an orderly way. I walked around the table and
shook his hand.''
</P>
<P>
   For Butler, who had been given an ultimatum by his Iraqi
counterpart _ declare us disarmed first or there is nothing to talk
about _ there were more troubling aspects of the videotaping than
one scene that he suspects may have been edited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been shocked to learn that Iraq has chosen to put into
the public arena videotapes of our private official
consultations,'' Butler said, calling the Iraqi action an attempt
at political theater. ``This was done without any consultation with
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler, an Australian arms control expert and former diplomat,
said that the videotaping of his meetings began last December, when
one crisis over the expulsion of U.S. inspectors had abated and
another was about to begin. At the first meeting taped, Butler
recalled, Aziz ``announced the existence of presidential sites from
which we would be forbidden forever, and that authored Part II of
the November-to-February crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, here were these cameras and lights in the room,'' he
said. ``I said, `May I ask you a question before we begin? What it
is that we see here?' And he said that they are video cameras. And
I said, What is the purpose of this?'''
</P>
<P>
   Aziz assured him that the films were being made only for the
historical record for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `It's not for the media?''' Butler recalled. ``And he
said, `No!' _ robust assurance _ `No! It's just for the record.'''
</P>
<P>
   Talks in January, March, June and August were also videotaped.
And in June, an extra microphone appeared in front of Butler's
place at the table in Iraq's Foreign Ministry. Its presence made
private consultations with his team virtually impossible. An aide
said his voice in a whispered conversation 20 feet away was picked
up clearly.
</P>
<P>
   But only the August session, when Iraq appeared to have decided
to stop all further cooperation with the arms inspection commission
known as Unscom, was made public on Iraqi television.
</P>
<P>
   But before the public airing, just after the end of the talks,
copies of the video were sent to certain embassies in Baghdad close
to the Iraqi leadership and to selected members of the Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, Unscom, have not yet been provided our copies,'' Butler
said. The commission's monitoring center in Baghdad was given a
tape, however, and that is slowly making its way to New York, days
behind the copies circulated to influential Security Council
members _ though not the United States _ by the Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   ``One person from a permanent member state spent five hours
yesterday reviewing the whole lot,'' Butler said. ``But not us, the
co-participant in the talks.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats and others who have seen the tapes doubt they will
have the effect the Iraqis want. Much of the footage is devoted to
Aziz blustering, badgering and cutting off Butler with repeated
sharp demands for an immediate end to sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   This from the Iraqis, who have persuaded some of U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan's aides that Butler's ``Anglo-Saxon'' bluntness
and the ``cowboy'' behavior of his inspectors offends Iraqi
sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Iraq talks about Unscom's behavior, as they sometimes
do, this kind of behavior by them in a diplomatic context is
unheard of,'' Butler said of Iraq's public distribution of the
tapes. ``Diplomacy does have its rules. It would be appropriate for
us to be advised of these things. We are a co-participant with Iraq
in these conversations. It's not a one-way event, a one-way
street.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What this does to the utility of confidential conversations is
a bit worrying,'' he added. ``That's why diplomacy has these
conventions.''

   MICROSOFT-GORTON (Washington) Sen. Slade Gorton's advocacy for
Microsoft is being rewarded with campaign contributions from
company executives. During the first six months of this year, 23
Microsoft executives have contributed to Gorton, even though the
state's 70-year-old senior senator isn't currently a candidate for
anything and hasn't announced whether he plans to seek re-election
in 2000. The contributions are far more numerous than ever received
by Gorton from the Redmond-based software giant. In 1997, he
received contributions from eight Microsoft executives, in 1996
none, and in 1995 he received just one contribution, from the
company chairman and chief executive officer, Bill Gates.

PUC DECIDES RESIDENTIAL ELECTRICITY CANNOT BE CUT OFF DURING HEAT
WAVE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Electricity cannot be cut off to residential
users for any reason during a record heat wave expected to last
into September, says an emergency rule adopted Wednesday by the
Texas Public Utility Commission.
</P>
<P>
   PUC Chairman Pat Wood and Commissioner Judy Walsh voted for the
immediate ban on cutoffs through Sept. 30 after hearing reports
that Houston Lighting &AMP; Power and other utilities were still
hanging disconnect notices on customers' doors despite public
promises not to cut people off.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were doorhangers passed around in the middle of this
horrible heat,'' Wood said. ``That's what got my Irish up.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood said he objected to seeing panicking Houstonians ``passing
out from the heat on national television'' while seeking help with
bills because they feared their electricity would be turned off.
The commissioners said Texans should not be afraid to run their air
conditioners.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is a general emergency is escalating into a needless
crisis because people aren't getting the message that we've got
time to work on your payment plan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   HL&AMP;P had already announced an indefinite suspension of
terminations starting this month, said company spokesman Graham
Painter. But he confirmed the company had continued sending pink
warning notices and distributing the doorhangers.
</P>
<P>
   Those practices stopped Wednesday, Painter added. Newly worded
late notices will explain the ban on disconnections but urge
customers to make arrangements to pay their bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still going to be a lot of people who have difficulty
paying their bills. We agree this is a special year and they need
time to do it,'' he said. ``It seems reasonable to err on the side
of conservatism when human lives are at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Texas death toll from the heat wave hit at
least 128 when the U.S. Border Patrol confirmed the death of a man
who was trying to cross into the United States near Laredo.
</P>
<P>
   With July the hottest ever recorded worldwide, Texas utility
bills soared to an average $175 in Dallas, while residential bills
statewide have been running up to 40 percent higher than last year,
said Saralee Tiede, chief of the PUC's customer protection office.
</P>
<P>
   Under the PUC ruling, customers unable to pay soaring electric
bills will have until the end of September to work out deferred
payment plans with their electric companies. Residential customers
must be allowed up to six months to pay the bills but can opt to
pay them sooner. If electric companies approve, customers might
also qualify for 12-month plans in which all of their payments are
averaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``This emergency ruling is not what I would call a free lunch,''
said Carol Biedrzycki, executive director of the Texas Ratepayer's
Organization to Save Energy, a consumer advocacy group that sought
the new rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were not aware of the fact that they weren't going to
be disconnected even though they were receiving disconnect
notices,'' she added. ``This was a problem. We've got that settled
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Texas congressmen are seeking another $37.5 million
in emergency heat relief money, just two weeks after a grant of the
same amount was issued.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's Sheltering Arms agency has already run out of its
share of the federal money, and other administrators say they have
exhausted at least 60 percent already.
</P>
<P>
   A combination of disconnection notices and the quickly dwindling
aid money likely led hundreds of people to line up at Sheltering
Arms on a day so hot that fire trucks and air conditioned buses
were called in to offer relief, Tiede said. Money shortages in Fort
Worth had hundreds there lined up before dawn awaiting help at the
Will Rogers Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   More money could be on the way, though. Recent fund-raisers at
Sheltering Arms have led to collection of $200,000 from private
foundations, energy companies and even individuals putting up $5 to
$500, said Nieves Lopez, an energy assistance planner at the Texas
Department of Housing and Community Affairs. HL&AMP;P announced an
extra $5 million for low-income ratepayers earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez said her agency is also supervising an effort to shift
remaining federal dollars from locations around the state where
they are not being used to those with high need, such as Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tremendous need for energy assistance during this
extended heat wave,'' she said. ``However, it makes it particularly
difficult to assist clients as long as the utilities either
terminate clients or send termination notices to their customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez recommends that people be told their power won't be
terminated, they should use air conditioners wisely and they will
have an opportunity to work out a reasonable payment plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is,'' said Commissioner Walsh, ``that people need
to take care of their health first.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ This has got to be the most fun you can have in
Massachusetts politics without a Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   It is precisely because a Kennedy is leaving that the 1st
Congressional District, a Democratic stronghold encompassing parts
of Boston and several suburbs, is up for grabs and considered the
hottest campaign fight in the state these days.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, candidates without the best brand name in American
politics have a shot at hallowed ground: the kingmaker district
that gave President John F. Kennedy his start in national politics
and long served as home base to the late leonine speaker of the
House of Representatives, Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent Kennedy to hold the seat, Joseph P. Kennedy 2d,
is about to retire after six terms, and vying for his spot is a
sharp-elbowed, capacious-pocketed field of 10 strong Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Even better, the political junkies who abound here can follow a
phenomenon now exceedingly rare in the center-straddling Democratic
Party of the Clinton era: contenders in this grand old bastion of
blue-collar, lunch-pail liberalism are sparring in part over just
who is the most liberal liberal on the liberal block.
</P>
<P>
   At an evening candidates' forum last week in the working-class
Dorchester neighborhood, one candidate, George Bachrach, a former
state senator, introduced himself to a reporter as ``an unabashed,
unrepentant, unreconstructed liberal.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ray Flynn, the former mayor of Boston who is considered the
current front-runner in the race, who does not hesitate to identify
his brand of politics with the New Deal of Franklin D. Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, there seemed so much liberal consensus at the forum,
which local schoolchildren had helped organize as part of a lesson
in democracy, that one candidate complained it could hardly be
called a debate. Yes to tens of billions more federal dollars for
education, the candidates said; yes to universal free health care;
yes to more government money for child-care and elder-care and
antipoverty programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's refreshing about this race,'' said a veteran Democratic
political consultant, Daniel Payne, ``is that in an America where
politics have become very bland and Democrats and Republicans sound
very much alike and seem very cautious about positions, virtually
all the candidates in this race are well left of center.''
</P>
<P>
   But the more-liberal-than-thou uniformity hardly makes for a
dull campaign, observers hasten to point out.
</P>
<P>
   First, they note, the stakes are so high. The Eighth is not just
any seat _ in political history, it is practically a throne. It has
been held by James Michael Curley, Boston's ``Rascal King Mayor;''
it was Tip O'Neill's seemingly forever John Francis Fitzgerald, the
Kennedy forebear known as Honey Fitz, and in 1946, he watched his
patrician 29-year-old grandson, John F. Kennedy, win it.
</P>
<P>
   The Eighth ``is a kind of a cherished district in Boston because
so many famous Boston politicians have started their national
careers there,'' said Thomas O'Connor, a historian of the city.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a geographic and sociological oddity. Roughly
T-shaped and encompassing 40 percent of Boston plus several
suburbs, it includes areas as diverse as the Brahmin country of
Beacon Hill, the predominantly minority section of Roxbury, the
egghead commune of Cambridge and much in between.
</P>
<P>
   And the real suspense in the race is already mounting right now,
in the lead-up to the Sept. 15 primary, for the district is so
overwhelmingly Democratic that the primary is considered the
end-all of the campaign, even though a Republican, Philip Hyde, who
previously competed for the seat, is also running.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   So lively is the campaign that analysts say it may end up
surpassing the gubernatorial race in spending, particularly given
the early financial push by three millionaires: Tom Keane, a member
of the Boston City Council who invokes the spirit of former Sen.
Paul Tsongas; Chris Gabrieli, a high-tech venture capitalist with a
fancy campaign Web site and lavish television time, and John
O'Connor, husband to a supermarket heiress and is known as a
campaigner for environmental causes.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the field of 10, some observers say, is worth
watching as a bellwether for various strains in current Democratic
politics.
</P>
<P>
   For example, said Lou DiNatale, a senior fellow at the McCormack
Institute, a public policy center at the Boston campus of the
University of Massachusetts, there is the female factor. Two women
are running _ Marjorie Clapprood, a former radio talk-show host,
and Susan Tracy, a veteran of city political work and one of four
lesbians running for national office this year who are openly gay.
How the two female candidates fare, DiNatale said, could answer the
question, ``Are gender issues working in the liberal community?''
</P>
<P>
   Bachrach and O'Connor he would call ``great white liberals'' in
the style of perhaps a decade ago, while Gabrieli and Keane lean
more toward Clinton-style moderation.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are two minority candidates, each with solid
bases in their communities but little money: Charles Yancey, a
black City Council member and president-elect of the National Black
Caucus of Local Elected Officials, and Alex Rodriguez, who was
recently assistant deputy secretary of the treasury and is perhaps
the most aggressive oratorian of the bunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to bite this race in the butt,'' he told a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Minorities make up about 40 percent of the district, but it also
has a heavy Italian population that could help Michael Capuano, the
mayor of the city of Somerville, who boasts that the working-class
suburb has reduced the average public-school class size to 19.
</P>
<P>
   On issues, the biggest divergence from liberalism-as-usual
appears to be Flynn's opposition to abortion; the other candidates
took pains to point that out at a televised debate on Tuesday
night. Political analysts say they expect Flynn to retain his lead
into the final lap, but the hottest question then will be whether
the candidate in second place can pick up enough anti-Flynn votes
to win.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn remains sanguine. ``I think the people know exactly what
they want.'' he said in a recent telephone interview, ``someone who
will identify with them, work for them, protect Social Security,
the elderly, the poor and education.''
</P>
<P>
   For voters, the plethora of candidates has kept the race
confusing, and many remain undecided. There was no obvious trend
among an unscientific sampling of people asked on the streets in
the neighborhoods of Dorchester and Beacon Hill and in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a crowded field that it is really hard,'' said Steve
Capuccio, a 44-year-old systems analyst from Cambridge who plans to
vote for Flynn.
</P>
<P>
   If there was any agreement, it was on the sense of change that
comes when a Kennedy goes. Kennedy announced in March that he would
retire to devote more time to his family and business, the Citizen
Energy Corp., which was founded in 1979 as a nonprofit company to
deliver heating-oil to the poor but has since grown into a partly
profit-making conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of wish Joe Kennedy were still in,'' said Mike Kelly, a
Cambridge investor. ``Kennedys have an automatic vote in my
house.''
</P>
<P>
   But Donald Wilson, 38, a real estate businessman who lives on
Beacon Hill, had no such regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The race is less interesting, but I would not want a Kennedy
in the race,'' Wilson said. ``I've had my fill of Kennedys.''

WOMAN BEHIND ANTI-GAY ADS SEES CHRISTIANS AS VICTIMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Duplication warning: Also moved in `a' category) 
(mk) 
 By LAURIE GOODSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Over the last two and a half years, leaders
representing about 25 conservative Christian groups have been
meeting for private strategy sessions to discuss how to counter
what they see as the increasingly powerful ``homosexual lobby'' and
its legislative victories.
</P>
<P>
   The conservatives believed that their position was getting
clobbered: Gay people were adopting children, coming out on
television shows and persuading politicians to vote for
anti-discrimination laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``The final straw,'' said Janet Folger, a member of the strategy
group, came in June when Michael McCurry, the White House press
secretary, denounced Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader,
as ``backward'' for comparing homosexuality to alcoholism and
``kleptomania.''
</P>
<P>
   So, in a conference call to the group of conservative
strategists in Washington on June 24, Ms. Folger proposed taking
out full-page newspaper advertisements that would show ``former
homosexuals'' who ``overcame'' their sexual orientation through
prayer and the help of Christian ``ex-gay ministries.''
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements, which ran recently in seven major newspapers
with a combined circulation of nearly 8 million, infuriated gay
rights advocates and ratcheted up the intensity of the debate over
homosexuality. The advertising campaign also drew attention to its
architect, Ms. Folger, who raised more than $400,000 to pay for it,
and is now placing more ads.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Folger, who has recently appeared on ``Nightline'' and the
``ABC Evening News,'' has no formal training in human sexuality,
psychology or science. She has a master's degree in communications
from Cleveland State University, and once worked for a Christian
radio station writing and producing commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Janet is an example of what I like to think of as an issue
entrepreneur,'' said Ralph Reed, former executive director of the
Christian Coalition. ``Some entrepreneurs try to figure out what
the new hot stocks are. Janet is an ideological entrepreneur,
someone who tries to pick the hot new issues.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview here, Ms. Folger said she is convinced
that conservative Christians are victimized by a popular culture
that ridicules and dominates them.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over homosexuality illustrates her point, she said.
Gay rights groups have persuaded Americans that Christians who
condemn homosexuality are intolerant, she said, while actually it
is gay people and their supporters who are intolerant of
Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not advocating tolerance,'' Ms. Folger said. ``If that
were the case, they'd live and let live. Instead, they do things
like demand that the Boy Scouts change their position by accepting
homosexuality. And they will sue anyone who doesn't agree with
them. It's basically forcing people to embrace their behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last four years, Ms. Folger has traveled to churches and
conferences presenting a seminar and slide show on ``the assault
against Christians.'' She lectures that the media, the courts,
popular culture and the politicians are ``chipping away'' at the
rights of Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prayer police are roaming the halls'' of schools, she told the
``Reclaiming America for Christ Conference'' in Florida earlier
this year, ``looking not for guns, not for drugs, but for children
praying.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Until recently, Ms. Folger was a lobbyist for the Ohio Right to
Life Society and the major force behind Ohio's becoming the first
state to ban partial-birth abortion. She rallied state legislators
by referring to the procedure as ``brain suction abortion'' and
displaying gory posters.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is a very effective advocate, very articulate,'' said Doug
Johnson, federal legislative director of the National Right to Life
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ms. Folger was so relentless that several legislators barred
her from their offices, newspaper reports say. State Rep. John
Garcia, R-Toledo, who said he usually votes against abortion and
was not among those who evicted her from his office, recalled that
``she got me so frustrated that I was ready to vote for abortion
and get it out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Janet is good at what she does, but she comes on a little too
harsh,'' Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   After nine years with Ohio Right to Life, Ms. Folger said she
wanted to broaden her repertoire. When Reed left his job leading
the Christian Coalition in 1997 to become a political consultant,
Ms. Folger says she sought to replace him. But the job was given to
Donald Hodel, who was secretary of Energy and later secretary of
the Interior in the Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, Ms. Folger moved to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to
become national director of the Center for Reclaiming America, a
fledgling advocacy group started by the Rev. D. James Kennedy,
founder of Coral Ridge Ministries, a multimedia evangelical
organization.
</P>
<P>
   As a startup in the already crowded field of conservative
Christian public advocacy organizations, the Center was in search
of a strategy and a focus. Ms. Folger had been at work developing a
series of ``animated cartoons for children promoting biblical
values,'' she said, when she realized that the advertising campaign
on homosexuality was more timely.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's looking for a way to influence the debate,'' Reed said,
``and she's smart enough to know that it's easier to dive into a
topic that people are already talking about than to try and start a
new conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement that ran in The New York Times featured a
photograph of Anne Paulk, with a caption that read, ``Wife, mother
and former lesbian,'' and showed a portrait of men and women
gathered at a convention for Exodus, an ex-gay ministry. Ms. Folger
said she wanted to strike at the assumption that homosexuality is
an immutable trait and that gay people therefore need protection
under anti-discrimination laws.
</P>
<P>
   Gay rights groups quickly composed an opposing newspaper
advertisement to refute the claims. They maintain that only a small
percentage of those who seek help from ex-gay groups permanently
alter their sexuality, and that many more are emotionally scarred
by trying to change something they cannot.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are definitely some people who sincerely believe that
homosexuality is a sin, and that you should have compassion, but I
think that the advertisements are not being put out by those
people,'' said Cathy Renna, director of community relations for the
Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. ``The ads are being
put out by political operatives and religious extremists who are
trying to influence public opinion and political candidates, who
know that a very strident approach is not going to work.''

   NAIROBI, Kenya _ The American ambassador to Kenya went on
television Wednesday night to address charges that Americans were
more concerned about protecting their own people and guarding their
embassy than helping Kenyans killed or hurt in an attack presumably
aimed at the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper editorials and some Kenyans have charged that
Americans concentrated on saving embassy employees after a bomb
attack last Friday but stood by while others worked to rescue
Kenyans. They have also said Americans and embassy employees were
flown out of the country while Kenyans had to make do with
overcrowded hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The ambassador, Prudence Bushnell, explained American conduct in
an interview aired Wednesday night on Kenyan television. ``We were
shedding blood. Blood was blood,'' Bushnell said. ``We were
rescuing people. People are people. There was no determination as
to race, religion, ethnic group. We were trying to get as many
people out as we possibly could.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``The fact that there is anger is very, very
understandable.''
</P>
<P>
   The death toll from the blast in Nairobi stands at 247, the
Kenyan government said Wednesday, including 12 Americans and 24
Kenyan employees who were inside the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   The American government has rushed support teams, including
doctors, paramedics and specialists in rescue operations, as well
as blood supplies and rescue dogs, to help both Kenyans and
Americans hurt in the explosion. However, many Kenyans still feel
the Kenyan casualty list would have been shorter if the Americans
had been as concerned about them as they were about protecting
American lives and protecting the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not see them first of all saving lives,'' said Charity
Ngilu, a leader of the opposition Social Democratic Party and a
presidential candidate in last December's election. ``They were
more concerned with their building and property.''
</P>
<P>
   An editorial cartoon in the Nation, the country's most widely
read newspaper, showed two beefy men in Marine Corps battle gear
pointing their rifles at a badly wounded Kenyan, wearing a Chicago
Bulls T-shirt and missing his left leg and right arm. ``We can't
take you for some security reasons,'' barks one Marine. Behind him,
a white man is being carried on a stretcher to a plane with the
American flag and label ``American Rescue Force 1'' on the
fuselage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ugly side of Americans,'' read the headline on an
editorial in the Standard, the country's second-largest daily. The
editorial called the U.S. Marines guarding the embassy
``heavy-handed,'' ``insensitive'' and ``looking more suited to a
Rambo movie than the bread and butter role of a guard in a city
center.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Kenyan anger appeared to reflect a lack of
understanding of the mission of American soldiers in protecting the
embassy, as well as pent-up resentment over Washington's charges of
corruption in the Kenyan government and criticisms of the absence
of a liberal democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Many Kenyans resented the refusal of the Marines to allow anyone
into the embassy after the blast. Kenyans who gathered outside
wanted to rush in and begin digging through the rubble for victims.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said that the Marines' role was to protect
the embassy's documents and that no one would be allowed into the
building until a professional search team arrived and it was
determined that the building was safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing we wanted was for good Samaritans to lose their
lives in our building,'' Bushnell said in her interview with Kenyan
television.
</P>
<P>
   Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Steve Johnson, the commander of the
joint task force sent in response to the bombing, defended the
Marines.
</P>
<P>
   ``These Marines did exactly what they're required to do,''
General Johnson said at a memorial ceremony Wednesday afternoon.
``Their mission was to protect the United States mission.''
</P>
<P>
   It is almost impossible to judge how deep the resentment runs
beyond the country's leaders and the elite. On the streets
conflicting sentiments were voiced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are angry with the Americans,'' said Bismarck Odida, 35, an
electronics repairman who was among several hundred Kenyans who
gathered Wednesday in front of the American embassy, watching the
cleanup. ``They're trouble-makers.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble began in 1992, he said, ``when you Americans started
pushing for this multiparty democracy.'' Odida, who is a member of
the ruling Kenya African National Union, added: ``Before that,
Kenya was an island of peace.'' The American ambassador at the
time, Smith Hempstone, was a voluble critic of the lack of
democracy, and is credited by some, and damned by others, for
loudly pushing for multiparty elections.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon Kasina, a 45-year-old trader, interrupted Odida. ``This
has nothing to do with democracy,'' he said. ``This is terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We are not angry with the Americans. We are angry
with the Arabs.''
</P>
<P>
   The division of opinion among the populace was also evident in a
mildly heated discussion between two women working in a camera
shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people are angry,'' said one woman, who did not want to be
identified. ``They say the Americans are doing nothing. They didn't
help bring out the bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   Her sister-in-law countered: ``No, that's not fair. Of course
they wouldn't let anyone in. They have documents, secrets, they
must protect.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the documents were CIA files that would presumably include
profiles of Kenyan leaders and perhaps the identities of Kenyans on
the agency's payroll. Some Kenyans who did manage to get in engaged
in looting, Bushnell said Wednesday.

 &HT;    Falcons Notebook: Addition of Dutton may give fans hope
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Falcons made a roster move Wednesday
evening, and while it wasn't the one they're hoping to make a
splash with today or Friday, the addition of quarterback John
Dutton to the team is interesting.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-4, 222-pounder was a sixth-round draft choice of the
Dolphins in April, but Miami was _ unlike few teams in the league _
quarterback rich and waived him Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In order to remain at the NFL's 80-man roster limit, the Falcons
waived rookie free agent quarterback Brian Brennan of Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   In some pre-draft hype, Dutton was considered as high as a
possible fourth-round pick after putting up impressive numbers in
two years at Nevada-Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Dutton, 22, didn't throw a pass for three years from 1993-95 as
the native of Newport Beach, Calif., spent two years at Texas, and
redshirted in '95 after transferring.
</P>
<P>
   But he took off at Nevada-Reno, where he was a teammate of
Falcons rookie free agent tackle Michael Edwards. In '96, he
completed 222-of-334 passes (66.5 percent) for 2,750 yards, 22
touchdowns, and just six interceptions. Last year, he completed
222-of-367 (60.5) for 3,526 yards, 20 TDs, and six interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins, however, have Dan Marino, Craig Erickson, Damon
Huard, and Stan White at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Dutton is expected in Suwanee today.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are still negotiating with former Minnesota Vikings
defensive end Fernando Smith, who had 13.5 sacks the last two years
despite several injuries last season.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Durand, the agent for the 6-6, 283-pound Smith, said,
``We'd like to make a decision no later than (today). We're
considering the Falcons, New Orleans, Washington and Jacksonville.
The Falcons have shown great interest in having Fernando join the
team, and we're strongly considering Atlanta although there are no
clear front runners.''
</P>
<P>
   What's next?
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons will have a brief practice today, probably at 2
p.m., as they make final preparations for Friday night's game in
Detroit. There likely will be a light workout Saturday, an off day
Sunday, and perhaps two practices Monday and/or Tuesday. There will
be no more chance of two-a-day practices after next Wednesday, when
camp breaks. On that date, veterans are allowed to go their homes
in the area. Rookies and veterans who do not have homes in the area
will continue staying at the Falcon Inn motel adjacent to team
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Aches and pains
</P>
<P>
   This is close to a repeat of Tuesday, as the same eight players
missed practice Wednesday. They were DT Mark Campbell (knee
sprain), RT Corey Louchiey (groin), WR Keith Crawford (hamstring),
WR Tim Dwight (back), DT William Gaines (back), WR Jammi German
(groin), DE Barry Mitchell (elbow), and CB Randy Fuller (ankle).
</P>
<P>
   None will play Friday nightat Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   New injuries: CB Lenny McGill (ankle), CB Ronnie Bradford
(thumb), and S Devin Bush (ankle).
</P>
<P>
   QB watch
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at what's going on with the quarterbacks:
</P>
<P>
   Chris Chandler _ Threw in drills, and worked with the No. 1, No.
2 and No. 3 lines and all offensive skill players.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Graziani _ Threw in drills, and worked with the No. 1 and
No. 2 lines and all offensive skill players. Also had holding
duties while working with placekickers.
</P>
<P>
   Steve DeBerg _ Threw in drills, and worked with the No. 1 and
No. 2 offensive lines, and all offensive skill players. Also had
holding duties while working with placekickers. Got almost all the
work in hurry-up offense drills at the end of practice. Early, in
11-on-11 drills, he threw a perfect 12-yard out to the left
sideline, caught by Tony Martin with Michael Booker covering.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Brennan _ Threw in drills. Was waived after practice.
</P>
<P>
   The good, bad, and ugly
</P>
<P>
   Good: Defensive left end Lester Archambeau, who has been
splitting time with the No. 1 unit this week with third-year man
John Burrough, sniffed out a few bootlegs in different drills
Wednesday, batted down a couple passes at the line of scrimmage and
was involved in a couple stops in a goalline session.
</P>
<P>
   Bad: With DeBerg running the offense against the No. 1 defense
in a hurry-up drill, there were two incompletions, then left guard
Calvin Collins jumped offsides, then several players muffed the
snap count. On third-and-20 from the offensive 20, DeBerg rolled to
his left and threw toward the sideline, and receiver Tony Martin.
Backup strong safety Chris Bayne intercepted. Against the No. 2
defense, DeBerg and the offense moved 35 yards in five plays, into
position for Morten Andersen to kick a 52-yard field goal with two
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Ugly: Ever seen what happens when dinner is not mandatory at an
NFL training camp, like Wednesday in Suwanee? Stay clear of the
door, brothers and sisters. It's a stampede.
</P>
<P>
   What he said
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, I've been in the league 10 years, eight as a starter,
last year I was second on the team with (a career-high) 119
tackles, and you guys didn't even do a card on me.'' _ Strong
safety William White, to an Upper Deck photographer who was at
practice photographing players for trading cards.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know?
</P>
<P>
   In one practice, the Falcons typically use about four cases of
tape, with 32 rolls in each case. That's about 128 rolls of tape,
which at 15 feet per, works out to about 1,920 feet, or 640 yards,
or six football fields plus another 40 yards worth. They also use
about 64 rolls of ``spating tape'' per practice, generally on the
outsides of shoes, and 48 rolls of spongy pre-wrap, the stuff that
goes on before the tape so when the tape is torn loose, less hair
comes with it.
</P>
<P>
   Hard noses
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons got in more goalline work than in any practice yet.
When the first units were both in there, on the second play, from
the 2, Chandler rolled to his right and hit wide open TE Brian
Kozlowski for a TD as there was some confusion whether outside
linebacker Keith Brooking or a safety should have covered Koz'. On
the third play, from the 1, he hit TD Ed Smith for a TD (SLB Henri
Crockett defending).
</P>
<P>
   When the second units were out there, with DeBerg at
quarterback, the defense stopped the offense the first two times,
but on third down from the 2, Gary Downs followed backup right
guard Scott Adams and backup right tackle Ephraim Salaam into the
end zone.
</P>
<P>
   With Graziani running the No. 2 offense, there were three
straight scores. First, he reversed out his right and hit TE Brian
Saxton for a TD (MLB Ruffin Hamilton covering). Next, Ken Oxendine
went up the middle for a TD, and on the third play, Graziani hit TD
O.J. Santiago, who tipped the ball up in the air and caught it for
a TD, over the middle.
</P>
<P>
   In three more plays, with DeBerg at QB, there was a 4-yard TD
pass to FB Bob Christian, a 1-yard run by Harold Green, who was
stopped short of the goalline by S Eugene Robinson, and an
incomplete pass, as Archambeau swatted the ball at the line.

MAKAH WHALE HUNT BITTERLY OPPOSED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL SHUKOVSKY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Week after week, Will Anderson camped on Baja beaches, lulled to
sleep by the sound of gray whales spouting and the rhythm of the
tides. Each morning, he awoke to the breathing of the great beasts.
</P>
<P>
   Now Anderson and activists like him around the world have joined
a passionate battle to stop the Makah's whale hunt this fall off
Washington's remote Olympic Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't make a difference to Anderson, an organizer with the
Progressive Animal Welfare Society, that the Makah are an
indigenous people whose culture is defined by thousands of years of
hunting whales. To Anderson, hunting gray whales _ animals he calls
friendly and intelligent _ is just plain wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's judgment of the Makah and their attempt to breathe
new life into their culture by resurrecting the hunt is shared by
hundreds of groups around the globe, including the Humane Society
of the United States, Australians for Animals, Sea Shepherd
Conservation Society, Canadian Federation of Humane Societies,
Korea Animal Protection Society and Swiss League Against
Vivisection.
</P>
<P>
   Some organizations are seeking to stop the hunt by filing a
federal lawsuit. Others have vowed to disrupt the hunt by putting
themselves between whale and whalers.
</P>
<P>
   The debate pits ancient, indigenous rights against modern,
international mores. The conflict has generated worldwide media
coverage, a lawsuit by a Washington congressman and the creation of
an inter-agency police task force designed to provide security
during the hunt, expected to attract demonstrators from around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's spiritually and morally wrong to be killing whales,''
said Anderson, who speaks of his time kayaking among the whales in
Baja California, Mexico, as ``a profound, door-opening
experience.'' Anderson makes no bones about his demand that the
Makah conform to what he believes is the prevailing global attitude
against whaling.
</P>
<P>
   As to the Makah's assertion that they have the right to hunt
whales, Anderson said, ``We are all advocates of our own belief
system.''
</P>
<P>
   The polarization could result in more than whale blood being
spilled at sea. Anderson and dozens of other animal rights
activists plan to take to the ocean in ships, inflatable boats and
a two-man submarine painted to look like a killer whale.
Ultra-light aircraft and amphibious planes will circle above. The
goal is to swarm the armed, Makah whalers, making it impossible for
them to carry out their hunt, or at the very least documenting it
on video.
</P>
<P>
   Combining the high seas that sweep the area every fall with the
high emotions of all involved, ``there is a lot of concern on our
part ... that we may end up losing somebody,'' warned Capt. James
Olson, chief of operations for the 13th Coast Guard District,
during a meeting with some of the animal rights activists in May.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to prevent chaos at sea, the Coast Guard recently
proposed establishing a 500-yard exclusion zone around the whaling
vessels. But activists like Paul Watson of the Sea Shepherd
Conservation Society have said they won't let the Coast Guard keep
them away.
</P>
<P>
   Watson is mindful that the hunters will carry a .50-caliber,
armor-piercing rifle to kill the whale after it is struck by a
harpoon.
</P>
<P>
   But despite such dangers, Watson said, ``we will do everything
that is lawful to obstruct and intervene in the hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Watson's exploits are the sinking of two Spanish and two
Icelandic whaling vessels. But he rebuts those who charge he is an
eco-terrorist by saying ``we have never caused an injury to anyone
in our entire history.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson's passion for protecting marine mammals has attracted
followers and funding from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   A co-founder of Greenpeace, Watson split with the group in 1977
and founded Sea Shepherd, which he calls ``more activist'' than
Greenpeace. ``I don't believe there is anybody more radical then
us.''
</P>
<P>
   He justifies his organization's tactics by pointing out that
many whale species are teetering on extinction and that the gray
whale has only recently been removed from the federal endangered
species list.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we are not spending all our energy and money and time and
resources on the Makah killing five gray whales,'' said Watson. The
real problem, as Watson sees it, is that the Makah are leading the
way for other nations that want to return to their whaling
heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing the Makah to hunt based on cultural history instead of
need for food could result in countries making the same claim as a
guise for the resumption of commercial whaling, Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   And that, he worried, would undermine the International Whaling
Commission's global moratorium on commercial whaling.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1997 commission meeting, Japan's delegate asked what the
difference is between cultural necessity for the Makah and cultural
necessity for the Japanese, according to Watson.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. IWC Commissioner James Baker said the Makah's case is
far different from the Japanese desire to return to whaling. ``The
Japanese proposal for small, coastal whaling has a heavy commercial
element. They sell the whale. The U.S. has always opposed
commercial whaling. We have a written agreement with the Makah not
to sell whale,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   He notes that the Inuit whale hunt in Alaska was presented to
the IWC as primarily cultural and its approval did not open the
floodgates of indigenous whaling. The Alaskan Inuits have been
hunting for years without sparking a wholesale return to indigenous
hunting.
</P>
<P>
   But Watson is not mollified. ``What we see is that thousands of
whales will be killed as soon as that first Makah harpoon goes into
a whale,'' he said. ``The moratorium will be destroyed with the
first harpoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not fighting the Makah. We are fighting Japan; we are
fighting Norway. If this moratorium is destroyed, it is a
catastrophe for many species of whale.''
</P>
<P>
   The Makah claim to have a subsistence need to hunt whales, which
Watson asserts is also bogus. In fact, no one is starving at Neah
Bay. And besides, gray whale meat tastes terrible, Watson said.
``Gray whales are bottom feeders.''
</P>
<P>
   For Watson, the Makah hunt is a frightening threat to a beloved
creature. He recalled how in 1975, he piloted a Zodiac inflatable
boat between a 150-foot Soviet harpoon vessel and a sperm whale
``reasoning that they wouldn't risk killing a human being.'' He was
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   A harpoon flew over the protesters' heads and slammed into the
back of one of the whales. ``The ocean erupted behind us, and
another bull came straight out of the water at the harpooner.'' The
two wounded whales ``were screaming and thrashing, and the ocean
around us was red.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the whales dove, then moments later emerged right next to
Watson's Zodiac, towering over them, raining blood and water onto
their little boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked up into this huge eye and that instant changed my
life forever. That whale understood exactly what we were trying to
do. I saw pity in that eye, not for himself, but for us. The
easiest thing for that whale to have done was to come forward and
crush us. Instead, with great effort, the whale slid back into the
sea and I watched him disappear beneath the waves and die.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson points out that even some members of the Makah tribe want
to stop the whale hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Alberta Thompson, 74, is one of about seven Makah elders who
publicly allied themselves with Sea Shepherd. She traveled to the
International Whaling Commission meeting in Scotland in 1996 to
oppose the Makah request for a quota of gray whales. She believes
the time has passed for the tribal whale hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know anything about it,'' she said. ``We don't know
how to cut it, we don't know how to cook it and we don't want to
eat it. The Makahs ate humpback (whales). The gray whale is hot dog
and the humpback is steak.''
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the Makahs preferred eating other whales than
grays, which were commonly used for their oil.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson says it is simply not true that the tribe needs whale
meat for dietary reasons. ``Even during the Great Depression, we
didn't know we were poor. We went out to get food from the sea and
the rocks. No one was hungry. We still have the same fish, the same
clams, the same seafood.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson also rejects as wishful thinking the hope that whaling
will provide a spiritual and cultural focus for the people and
become an alternative for troubled youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything they say that will bring the kids out of violence,
will bring the kids out of liquor, will bring the kids out of
drugs, is done in the home,'' she said. ``The problem is not with
tribal culture, but with what is happening in the homes. It is
happening all over. I don't think my teenagers are any different
than yours.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a return to the old whale culture, Thompson says the
tribe should conduct whale watching trips and capitalize on
tourism.
</P>
<P>
   It's an idea that appeals to animal rights activists like Will
Anderson of PAWS, who has followed the gray whales on their annual
migration between Baja and the Bering Sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's Makah do not know whales,'' said Anderson. ``A lot of
us feel that we do. When a whale comes up to you for a friendly
encounter it changes your perspective. We have been trying to get
the Makah interested in cultural eco-tourism.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Toni Frohoff, a Seattle-area biologist specializing in the
behavioral interactions between whales and people, is concerned
that if whales are accustomed to friendly relations with people,
they will be sitting ducks for Makah hunters. Frohoff, who works as
a consultant to the Humane Society of the United States, said she
fears that the hunt will be a bloodbath.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of these people have hunted whales before and it is rare,
extremely rare, for an experienced hunter to kill a whale with a
single shot,'' Frohoff said. ``We can expect that the whales that
are struck and lost will suffer extensively before they die.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Calvert, a port commissioner in Friday Harbor and vice
chairman of the county Republican party, fears the Makah whale hunt
will repel tourists who visit the San Juan islands for
whale-watching cruises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eco-tourism has become the mainstay of the economy of the San
Juans,'' said Calvert. ``This will have a devastating effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Calvert has been working closely with U.S. Rep. Jack Metcalf,
R.-Wash., who has opposed the Makah hunt through resolutions made
in Congress and by filing a federal lawsuit in the District of
Columbia to stop the hunt. Makah elder Thompson is also a plaintiff
in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   By allowing the hunt, the federal government failed to comply
with numerous environmental laws, including the National
Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act, according
to the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Metcalf, who lives on Whidbey Island, operates his home as a bed
and breakfast, catering to many guests who come to whale watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think America is ready to step up and authorize
whaling,'' Metcalf said. ``I just don't think it is necessary or
right. There is no way to do it humanely. From the pictures I've
seen, it is just awful.''
</P>
<P>
   So awful, said animal rights activist Anderson, that when it
comes time for the hunt this fall, ``a lot of people will be out
there risking their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People like myself are not going to care what the government
says about restrictions and exclusions around the hunt. We want to
document the hunt and bear witness and to put our lives on the
line.''

 &HT;    Braves on deck: San Diego Padres
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ When: 5:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   _ Where: Qualcomm Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   _ TV: Fox Sports South.
</P>
<P>
   _ Probable starting pitchers: LHP Tom Glavine (15-4, 2.47;
15-10, 3.75 lifetime vs. Padres) vs. LHP Mark Langston (4-4, 5.66;
1-0, 0.00 lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   _ Notes: Glavine has lost just once in his last nine starts and
is pitching at his most effective pace of the season. Coming off
his first shutout of the year, a 5-0, three-hit performance against
San Francisco on Friday, Glavine has allowed just 23 hits and five
runs in his last 38 innings for a 1.18 ERA. He lost to the Padres
3-2 on May 8, giving up three runs on six hits; opposing pitcher
Andy Ashby allowed nine hits and won. Glavine has won 10 times at
Qualcomm in 16 career starts. He will be careful facing
left-handers Steve Finley (.320 career average) and Tony Gwynn
(.322 with two home runs). No one on the current Braves roster was
around the last time Langston faced Atlanta, which is probably a
good thing. In his only career start against the Braves, he threw a
shutout in 1989 when he pitched for Montreal. His return to the
National League has not been a smooth one. He spent more than four
weeks on the disabled list (April 15-May 23) with a strained
shoulder and has had little luck since the All-Star break. He is
1-3 in five second-half starts, having given up 23 runs and 37 hits
in his last 20 2/3 innings. He has not pitched past the sixth
inning in six-straight games and only twice in 14 starts this year.

   BANGKOK, Thailand _ Loading a van with food, water and other
supplies, Aung San Suu Kyi embarked again Wednesday on one of the
few means of protest she has: She drove into the countryside as far
as she could until the military authorities who rule Myanmar
stopped her.
</P>
<P>
   The last time she did this, at the end of last month, she spent
six days inside her car, blocked by soldiers from proceeding and
refusing their order to return to the capital, Yangon. This time,
foreign diplomats said, she was better supplied for an even longer
stay.
</P>
<P>
   The spectacle of the country's pro-democracy leader _ and winner
of the Nobel Peace Prize _ stalled for days inside her car and
surrounded by soldiers seemed an apt symbol for the political dead
end the country has reached.
</P>
<P>
   In the 10 years since Suu Kyi stepped forward as a leader during
a pro-democracy uprising, her main accomplishment has been to
dramatize the human rights abuses and political repression of the
military rulers of the former Burma. She has not succeeded in
easing the lives of her countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years after her party, the National League for Democracy,
won a landslide victory in parliamentary elections, its delegates
remain blocked from taking office, powerless, harassed and often
jailed.
</P>
<P>
   In another of the symbolic acts that are her only weapons, Suu
Kyi has demanded that the elected National Assembly convene by Aug.
21, though she has not said what would happen if, as expected, the
military government ignores her demand.
</P>
<P>
   In advance of this date, she has begun traveling to the
countryside to try to meet with her supporters. The first two
times, brief meetings were permitted. The second two times she was
stopped, on the same road and in almost the same place: 15 miles
west of Yangon, heading toward the town of Bessein.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government of Myanmar regrets that security conditions in
Ayarwaddy division make it unsafe for Ms. Suu Kyi to travel there
at this time, but the government encourages Ms. Suu Kyi to return
home and continue her political activities in a more secure
environment in Yangon,'' the government said in a statement
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The military government, for its part, can point to few
accomplishments during its decade of rule since the country's
long-time strongman, U Ne Win, stepped into the background. It
appears to have quieted the ethnic insurgencies that have
challenged the central government for years. But it has failed to
revive the economy of one of the world's poorest nations, or to win
the support either of its people or of most foreign powers.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there is no sign at the moment of the unrest among
students and monks that exploded into street protests _ and then
into military violence _ in August 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The political standoff is being played out in small, tense
gestures. Among these was the arrest on Sunday of 18 foreign
demonstrators who donned T-shirts with pro-democracy slogans and
began handing out tiny leaflets in downtown Yangon.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators remained in detention Wednesday as their home
governments demanded their release and as local authorities said
they were trying to decide whether to put them on trial or expel
them.
</P>
<P>
   The detainees include six Americans, three Thais, three
Malaysians, three Indonesians, two Filipinos and one Australian.

 &HT;    Love III defends his PGA Championship title
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ It's probably golf's most familiar scene of
1997 and surely among the most emotional. A rainbow running across
the sky at Winged Foot Golf Club at the conclusion of the PGA
Championship. A rain-soaked, teary Davis Love III flinging his
visor through the air in victory. Davis in weepy embrace with
mother Penta and wife Robin. A son realizing that his father, a
respected PGA pro lost in a plane crash in 1988, watched it all
proudly from above.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I win one major or a hundred majors,'' said Love, ``that's
probably going to be the highlight of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Today the first round of the 90th PGA Championship begins at
Sahalee Country Club and Love becomes an equal to the other 149
players in the field, just another guy trying to negotiate this
narrow area of the Pacific Northwest without too frequently finding
timber. He will try to become the first player in 61 years to
repeat as champion. He will not be the biggest story of the week.
That designation goes to Masters and British Open champion Mark
O'Meara, 41, who attempts to become the first player since Ben
Hogan in 1953 to capture three majors in a year.
</P>
<P>
   Love this week finds himself reflecting on new, once
unattainable experiences that have been part of securing, after 12
years as a PGA Tour player, his first major championship. He
celebrates the end of a label _ the Best Player Not To Win A Major
tag that vanished by winning a Sunday showdown with his good
friend, Justin Leonard, but recalls it as ``a compliment and
annoying at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot more focus on me as a person and as a
player,'' Love said. ``It's probably been 10 times more than I
thought it would be. But then it's also been great to be on that
trophy with those other champions. I enjoy being part of that
group. It is a fun little club to be in and they make you feel a
part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But here's the interesting aspect to the story: While Love's
hunger has not been dashed _ he wants to win all of the majors and
says, ``I'm just getting started'' _ the dream victory was not
followed by an entirely dream season. Although Love won twice after
Winged Foot, coasting to victories at Callaway Gardens last fall
and in April at Harbourtown, a pained back caused curtailment of
his schedule and concern about his future.
</P>
<P>
   Although an exercise and stretching program, as orchestrated by
Columbus, Ga., physical therapist Tom Boers, has greatly healed
Love's back at this stage, he has played only five PGA Tour events
since the MCI Classic at Hilton Head and been, for the most part,
disappointed by his performance in the majors. He tied for 33rd at
the Masters, then missed the cut at the U.S. Open, where his back
was so inflamed he could hardly play. After a three-week rest Love
rallied slightly to finish eighth at the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it stalled me a little bit in the other majors,''
Love said Wednesday. ``I wasn't very comfortable at the U.S. Open.
I probably shouldn't have even gone out there. I started feeling
better before I went and then the trip out there kind of got me. I
hit one shot on Monday and all of a sudden I was back out of it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   While pleased to have moved to No. 2 in the rankings behind
Tiger Woods, Love honestly does not know how it happened. But, then
again, he's not the first player confused by the Official (formerly
Sony) World Rankings, which list Japan's Jumbo Ozaki 11th, ahead of
Phil Mickelson and Justin Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Love said. ``Maybe I got some of Jumbo's
points. I still don't how that whole thing works. ... But it's like
a friend of mine said, 'I'm one win away from No. 1 player in the
world,' so I'm hanging in there. If I'd have not done anything the
whole year, I'd have been disappointed, but to have overcome the
distractions and still be able to have a couple good weeks, I feel
pretty good about it.''
</P>
<P>
   His lower back is the main reason. When it went into spasm in
April while in Japan for the Chunichi Crowns, Love still won the
tournament, but wondered if marked the beginning a lifetime war. He
took a month off, returning to the tour at the Memorial for a
surprising fifth-place finish. After the debacle at Olympic, Love
did not feel sufficiently healed and able to swing at 100 percent
strength until the week before the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   Two stretching routines a day, about 20 minutes each, are
usually enough to keep his back loose. He avoids lengthy plane
trips on his plane, a small jet, and even flew commercial to
Seattle this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Private planes are nice if you've got a big enough area to lay
down or walk around,''' Love said. ``I'm not in that category
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Boers is here this week, supervising his stable of
lumbar-ravaged stars _ Love, Couples and Ernie Els. The latter two
have disks that demand more care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fortunate it was just a hurt and not a bad back,'' Love
said. ``Once I got the swelling and the tightness out, it's gotten
a lot better. So I feel very fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   NOTES: Billy Andrade made the field as the eighth alternate
Wednesday when Steve Jones withdrew following the death of a close
friend. ... The ``Isleworth Slam'' is on the line this week as the
members of the posh Orlando club try to sweep the majors. O'Meara
and neighbor Lee Janzen have combined for three so far. Other
Isleworth players in the field are Woods, Scott Hoch, Stuart
Appleby and Grant Waite. ``If we could do that,'' said Woods, ``we
could say we're not going to Hawaii (for the PGA Grand Slam); we're
going to hold it at Isleworth. The PGA would love us.'' ... Woods
has been calling the towering fir and cedar trees at Sahalee
``80-foot rough.'' ... Odd pairing: Al Geiberger, 60, the 1966
champion, who made a pact to enter if son Brent made the field, and
John Daly. ...

GLOBE'S BARNICLE DECISION BRINGS PROTESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Strong protests from inside and outside The Boston
Globe newsroom Wednesday greeted Tuesday's decision to suspend
rather than terminate veteran Metro columnist Mike Barnicle.
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight day, editor Matthew V. Storin and
publisher Benjamin B. Taylor faced a tough grilling about the
Barnicle decision at a staff meeting. Later in the afternoon, the
publisher and editor were presented with a petition signed by 53
employees stating that ``Barnicle's reprieve gives the appearance
of a double standard that allows one individual to ignore
journalistic principles other reporters must follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, the Boston chapter of the NAACP and the Urban
League of Eastern Massachusetts criticized the Globe's decision to
retain Barnicle. The NAACP charged that the move reflects ``a
double standard that has both racial and gender implications.''
</P>
<P>
   The episode began when an Aug. 2 Barnicle column was found to
contain eight jokes similar to those in comedian George Carlin's
1997 ``BrainDroppings'' book. On Aug. 5, Storin _ accepting
Barnicle's explanation that he had not read the book and got the
jokes from friends _ initially suspended him for a month without
pay. But later that day, WCVB-Ch.5 in Boston ran a clip of Barnicle
endorsing the book on a June 22 edition of ``Chronicle.'' It was
then that Storin asked for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle, who responded that he would not resign, has said that
he did not recall recommending the book on the air.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Storin rescinded his request for the columnist's
resignation and imposed a two-month suspension without pay. In the
meeting at which that decision was announced, Barnicle apologized
to his colleagues, saying, ``We're here today because of my
sloppiness. We're here today because I have caused embarrassment
... to the paper.''
</P>
<P>
   All this comes less than two months after black columnist
Patricia Smith resigned after admitting to fabricating aspects of
four 1998 columns.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the suspension agreement, the Globe announced that
Barnicle will reduce the amount of outside work he does, will work
to repair his frayed relationships with his editors, and will face
closer supervision of his columns. Wednesday, it was announced that
assistant managing editor Walter Robinson would become Barnicle's
supervising editor. It was Robinson's scrutiny of Smith's columns
that triggered the events that culminated in her resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's staff meeting was attended by scores of Globe
employees and included tough questions about Barnicle's
transgressions and why he did not face the same fate as Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was no holds barred,'' said automotive writer John White.
``And there are a lot of people who are upset with this thing.
White Anglo-Saxons are just as angry about this as our
African-American brethren.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sorry to see how beleaguered Matt (Storin) and Ben
(Taylor) were about the situation in which they'd been trying to do
the right thing,'' said theater critic Ed Siegel. ``But the anger
at Barnicle was real and justified, and I hope it will lead to a
paper with sharper standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Storin characterized the meeting as ``emotional, forthright,
candid, and healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he ``understands the feelings behind'' the employee
petition, which stated that ``the reversal by Globe management not
only cripples the paper's integrity, but undermines the efforts of
staff members who work daily to produce a newspaper that is beyond
reproach. ... Globe management did the right thing by demanding
Patricia Smith's resignation and publicly airing management's
decision-making process in the newspaper. ... It erred by not
firing Barnicle and by keeping information about his case `a
private matter.'''
</P>
<P>
   The petition was an outgrowth of a Tuesday night meeting of
about a dozen mostly minority employees. But assistant Metro editor
Joseph Williams said that it was signed by white and minority
staffers and doesn't follow racial lines. The 53 signees would
represent about 10 percent of the Globe editorial employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to make this an `us versus them' issue. There
are a lot of people out there who are angry and confused,'' he
said. ``It's a protest letter. We made no demands. ... We just want
to make sure they know how strongly we feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to that letter, Storin acknowledged that Globe
leadership has ``a difference of opinion'' with the petitioners
over the appropriateness of the two-month suspension.
</P>
<P>
   But that decision also came under fire Wednesday from the Boston
branch of the NAACP, which expressed its ``discontent'' with the
Barnicle suspension, citing a ``double standard'' in the Smith and
Barnicle cases.
</P>
<P>
   Citing an Aug. 7 letter written by Staples CEO Thomas G.
Stemberg to Taylor hinting that he might withdraw his advertising
from the Globe were Barnicle dismissed, NAACP president Leonard
Alkins said in an interview that his suspension ``is not a decision
based upon ethics. It is a decision based upon economics.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Storin and Taylor have stated that the Barnicle suspension
was not influenced by advertiser or outside pressure. Storin noted
that in the past the Globe has published articles angering such
major advertisers as Fleet, Fidelity, Bell Atlantic, and Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Wallace-Benjamin, president and CEO of the Urban League of
Eastern Massachusetts, also released a statement on the Barnicle
suspension Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many times does an employee at the Globe get to bend and
sway the rules before they are dismissed?'' she asked. ``From where
we sit, it depends on who you are and how many people you can get
to cry to the paper about how you are being mistreated. And perhaps
the tolerance for it is influenced by race, gender, and how long
you have been able to break the rules and still remain employed.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the perception of a double standard, Storin said that
in the past, reporters caught plagiarizing _ a more serious offense
than that for which Barnicle was punished _ received shorter
suspensions than the columnist. He also said that Smith was given a
second chance after evidence surfaced in 1995 that she had been
fabricating information in her columns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could argue,'' he added, ``that the Patricia Smith (case)
brought about not only greater scrutiny of Barnicle, but in fact a
greater penalty than what he would have had otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   In an additional development Wednesday, the Rev. Eugene F.
Rivers III, pastor of the Azusa Christian Community, who has
characterized the Barnicle suspension as a ``slap on the wrist,''
said he was trying to set up a meeting with Globe personnel to
discuss ``the journalistic sacred trust and the Barnicle affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to listen and understand what happened ... so that our
worst fears are allayed,'' said Rivers. ``We're not interested in
mau-mauing or playing political games.''
</P>
<P>
   Indicating that the Barnicle episode provided a ``legitimate
occasion ... to look at diversity and affirmative action at the
Globe,'' Rivers said he would be asking for more black
representation on the newspaper.

 By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ A quarter of a century after the overthrow of
the monarchy started Afghanistan on a downward spiral into
fratricide and destruction, the Islamic hard-liners of the Taliban
movement appear to be on the brink of re-unifying the country and
imposing their vision of a purist Islamic society.
</P>
<P>
   In a month-long offensive, Taliban forces have overwhelmed the
so-called northern alliance, which defied the Islamic militants for
two years by holding on to much of the territory north of the
Himalayan peaks of the Hindi kush.
</P>
<P>
   With a rush of victories in the past week, the Taliban now hold
at least three quarters of the country, and seem poised to surround
the last remnants of the alliance forces in two remaining redoubts,
in the Bamiyan region of the central mountains and in the Panjshir
valley of the northeast.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban thus appear to be close to achieving the goal that
eluded both the Soviet invasion force of more than 100,000 troops
through much of the 1980s, as well as American-backed guerrillas
who fought a murderous civil war after driving the Russians out in
1989: Forging a new, united Afghanistan, one that will bring peace
to a weary, demoralized and underfed population of between 15
million and 20 million people.
</P>
<P>
   While Taliban forces continue to push forward against the
scattered and retreating alliance forces, which surrendered 14
northern cities and towns in recent days with only token
resistance, the historic significance of the moment was proclaimed
by the Taliban's representative at the United Nations in New York,
Noorullah Zadran.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 25 years of struggle, it seems to us that we have
finally come to the end of the struggle,'' Zadran said in a
television interview Wednesday with the BBC.
</P>
<P>
   If so, the outcome is full of tragic irony for a nation that
seemed set on a diametrically opposite course in 1973, when King
Zahir Shah, the last representative of the Durrani Dynasty that had
ruled the country for 250 years, was ousted in a palace coup
mounted by his cousin, Mohammed Daoud.
</P>
<P>
   As president, Daoud proclaimed himself a modernizer but lasted
barely five years before he was killed in April 1978 in a coup
staged by the Soviet-backed Communist Party, which proclaimed a
still more radical modernization program.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists' program aimed at uprooting the pervasive
influence of Muslim clerics, whose support of the Durranis had
consigned Afghanistan to a social and economic backwardness that
marked the country out in a nation already beginning by the late
1979s to catch up with the Western world. Within hours of seizing
the Arg Palace in Kabul, the Afghan capital, the Communists vowed
to emancipate Afghan women, achieve universal literacy and move the
country beyond its bullock-cart economy.
</P>
<P>
   But now, with a Taliban victory, history may record that the
Communists achieved exactly the opposite. The bid to force
compliance with the Communist program, especially in the
arch-conservative world of the Afghan village, triggered a civil
war that drew in Soviet forces in December 1979. In turn, this
prompted the White House, under President Carter and later
President Reagan, to commit the United States to backing the Afghan
mujahideen, the self-styled Muslim holy warriors who drove out the
Russians in February 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The American effort, backed by other Western countries and by
Saudi Arabia, turned Afghanistan into the climactic confrontation
of the Cold War. By the time the Kremlin withdrew its forces, the
Soviet Union was barely three and a half years away from collapse.
But Afghanistan was virtually obliterated as a functioning state,
with thousands of its villages in rubble, at least a million of its
people dead and another 5 million living abroad as refugees, mostly
in Iran and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   When the Taliban first appeared, in 1995, many in the West were
dismayed. But to many Afghans, the rise of the movement rooted in
the ancient ways of the Afghan village, with its insistence on
strict forms of purdah for women and summary executions, or
amputations, for adulterers, blasphemers and thieves, seemed like
an inevitable consequence of the conflict in which modern weapons,
poured in with scant consideration for the civilian population, had
reduced an ancient society to rubble.
</P>
<P>
   With many schools, hospitals and highways destroyed, the way was
cleared for a band of village clerics to offer their own brand of
salvation. While educated Afghans recoiled, many others in a
country that is overwhelmingly rural accommodated quickly to the
Taliban's social strictures. To villagers, and to many
city-dwellers, too, what mattered most was that the Taliban held
out the prospect of ending a civil war in which most of the
factions have long since become little more than warlords,
sustaining their rule by banditry, pillage and rape.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Taliban seem likely to be faced with a continuing
resistance from the two remaining opposition forces, the
Hezbe-i-Wahdat of Abdul Khalili in the mountainous redoubt of
Bamiyan, and the Jamaat-Islami of Ahmed Shah Massoud in the
Panjshir Valley. Massoud, the most effective guerrilla commander
during the war with Soviet forces, seems likely to pose the biggest
obstacle. But now that the Taliban virtually surround Massoud's
forces, even his wily battle tactics may not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Taliban spokesmen have renewed demands for
international recognition. So far, only Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and
the United Arab Emirates, out of more than 180 nations worldwide,
have recognized the Taliban, so great has been the opprobrium for
Taliban policies that have banned most women from working, denied
education to girls and imposed a frightening array of other social
taboos, including bans on dancing, television, kite-flying,
bird-keeping and even the trimming of men's beards.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Taliban _ the name is taken from an Arabic term
meaning seekers after truth _ have played cat-and-mouse with
Western governments and international aid agencies, hinting that
harsh policies against women might be relaxed in return for
diplomatic recognition.
</P>
<P>
   In the BBC interview Wednesday, Zadran, the Taliban spokesman at
the United Nations, suggested changes were possible, but just as
quickly entered what seemed to be a disqualifying condition. ``We
will never compromise on our religion, Islam,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, tightening Taliban strictures, including rules
that virtually eliminated any direct international assistance for
Afghan women, have prompted most state organizations to suspend
operations in Kabul, Kandahar and Herat, three Taliban-held cities,
as well as evacuating staff from Mazar-i-Sharif, the pivotal
northern cities the Taliban seized at the weekend. With a harsh
Afghan winter approaching, there have been fears for the survival
of the poorest city-dwellers, including at least 400,000 people in
Kabul, the capital, who have relied on Western aid for food.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has led a chorus of dismay at the threat of a
Taliban-ruled Afghanistan spreading the contagion of Islamic
fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia considers the stepped-up military activities by the
Taliban in northern Afghanistan as a real threat to the
commonwealth's southern borders,''a Russian Foreign Ministry
statement said on Tuesday, referring to the Commonwealth of
Independent States, the grouping of former Soviet republics that
includes the Muslim states of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and
Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has joined the outcry, leaving Pakistan, alone among
Afghanistan's neighbors, as a supporter of the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   But the Taliban's main challenge seems likely to lie at home,
among millions of Afghans who yearn for peace, but not for the
harsh life vouchsafed by the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   For these people, the prospect now is for years of living in a
society not much different in its political, religious and social
rigors from the Afghanistan of the distant past. So far, the signs
have been that Western pressure for greater tolerance may not only
be ineffective, but a stir that pushes the Muslim clerics who
control the Taliban to adopt still harsher constraints.

ALBRIGHT PREPARES TO ESCORT HOME THE BODIES OF `VERY BRAVE

   LANDSHUT, Germany _ ``I am bringing home 10 very brave
Americans,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said here
Wednesday night as she prepared to fly home with the bodies of 10
of the 12 Americans killed in the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in
Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   Albright spoke after visiting eight Kenyan employees of the
State Department and an American staff member who are in the
American military hospital here for injuries suffered in the
bombing, which killed 250 people and wounded 5,500.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force has flown 12 wounded Kenyans and 10 Americans to
Germany since the bombing, but nine of the Americans were later
flown on to hospitals in the United States. One Kenyan staff
member, identified by German officials as Joash Okindo, is in a
German university clinic in Homburg with serious head injuries.
Officials said not all of those hospitalized here were well enough
to receive visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have just been visiting nine patients who are here, and they
are getting better,'' Albright said at the entrance to the Landshut
Regional Medical Center as night fell.
</P>
<P>
   She had spent just short of an hour talking privately with the
injured and with relatives of the one American from Nairobi who is
still here, Carolyn Riley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expressed President Clinton's best wishes and support to
them and said we would do everything we could, not only for them
but for all Kenyans, Tanzanians and Americans who were hurt,'' she
said. Ten people were killed in an almost simultaneous explosion
near the American Embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not be intimidated or pushed off the world stage by
people who do not like what we stand for, and that is freedom,
democracy, and the fight against disease and poverty and
terrorism,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   At the hospital, Albright did not allow photographers or
reporters to follow her through the wards, apparently so as not to
subject the injured to additional trauma.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary of state will depart nearby Ramstein Air Base
early Thursday morning in a C-17 military transport with the
flag-draped coffins of the 10 dead, whose bodies have been lying in
the medical center mortuary since they arrived here early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton plans to greet the plane after its arrival at
Andrews Air Force Base, Md., according to American officials here.
</P>
<P>
   The body of Air Force Senior Master Sgt. Sherry Lynn Olds, of
Panama City, Fla., was flown to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on
Wednesday at the request of her family, military officials said.
The 12th American casualty of the bombing, Jean Dalizu, was to be
buried in Kenya.

<P>
   At the hospital, Albright did not allow photographers or
reporters to follow her through the wards, apparently so as not to

</P>
<P>
   Six of the seven Americans medically evacuated to the United
States Wednesday before Albright's arrival went to Walter Reed Army
Medical Center in Washington. They were identified by Army
officials here as Sgt. Daniel Briehl of the Marines, Clyde Hirn,
Gary Lonnquist, Frank Pressley, Lydia Sparks and Gary Spears. The
seventh, Carol Hawley, was transferred to Brooke Army Medical
Center in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Another, David Robertson, left for a hospital in Phoenix on a
commercial flight on Tuesday, officials of the medical center here
said. One more, Ellen Bomer, was flown to Walter Reed late Sunday
night.

CLINTON ORDERS WORLDWIDE SECURITY REVIEW OF U.S. EMBASSIES 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Wednesday called for a review
of security at U.S. embassies worldwide and said he will ask
Congress for emergency funding to pay for safety enhancements in
the wake of two embassy bombings in East Africa last week, National
Security Council spokesman P.J. Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ordered the review after meeting with his national
security staff for two hours Wednesday about the investigation into
the attacks. Twelve Americans were killed in the bombing in
Nairobi, Kenya. No Americans were killed in the blast at the
embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The two blasts killed more than
250 people and injured more than 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut in 1983 led to
security reviews and more precautions at U.S. embassies under the
1986 Diplomatic Security Act.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants this review to include a list of priorities for
improving embassy security, particularly at high-risk facilities,
such as those in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The president asked that the security review be completed within
the next few days, Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, chairman of the Appropriations
Committee, indicated he was prepared to increase spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president asks for emergency funds, I will support it
... to assure protection of our personnel and embassies,'' Stevens
told The Associated Press. ``This terrorist threat must be
countered.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will be on hand Thursday to offer a eulogy when an Air
Force plane carrying the remains of 10 Americans arrives at Andrews
Air Force Base in Maryland, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart
said.
</P>
<P>
   The two dead Americans not on the plane include one who was
married to a Kenyan and will be buried in that country. The family
of the other wanted a private memorial ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he feels it's important in his role as the president
to convey a sense of the nation to the families: our sympathies,
our respect and our gratitude for the contribution these people and
their families have made for this country,'' Lockhart said. ``It's
obviously an event that I think weighs heavily on him, but he
believes it's important ... to speak for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven people injured in the blasts arrived Wednesday for
treatment at Walter Reed Army Hospital in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   At the national security staff meeting, Attorney General Janet
Reno updated Clinton on the status of the FBI's criminal
investigation of the bombings. Undersecretary of State for
Political Affairs Thomas Pickering, standing in for Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, discussed worldwide embassy security,
Crowley said. Defense Secretary William Cohen also attended the
high-level meeting. However, Crowley did not say whether the
subject of military retaliation arose.
</P>
<P>
   Albright was not at the meeting because she went to Germany on
Wednesday to visit injured Americans at Landstuhl Hospital near
Wiesbaden. She plans to be on the plane bringing the bodies of the
victims to the United States, the State Department reported.
</P>
<P>
   Crowley said the president was pleased with the ``outstanding
cooperation'' U.S. investigators have received from Kenyan and
Tanzanian law enforcement. Both countries have permitted FBI agents
access to all suspects who have been detained and questioned, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Crowley refused to provide details of the investigation, saying
such disclosures would assist terrorists trying to elude capture.
He reiterated Clinton's statement that the United States would not
yield to terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to create a fortress America,'' Crowley said.
``We are not going to retreat from the world.''

GALAXY'S LOZZANO HAPPY TO BE HOME
</HEADLINE>

 Long Beach Press-Telegram

<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Lawrence Lozzano had all but given up hope of
returning home to play soccer when the news he'd been awaiting for
three years finally arrived last week: He'd been traded to the Los
Angeles Galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   It could hardly have been more welcome: Lozzano, a versatile
veteran from Cerritos, was moving to one of the premier teams in
American soccer, where he was rejoining nearly a half-dozen former
teammates and one of his first professional coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, he was going home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good,'' says Lozzano, 28, who won't make his debut
for the Galaxy (18-6, 52 points) when it takes on the Kansas City
Wizards (10-12, 26) tonight at the Rose Bowl because of a nagging
hamstring injury. ``The situation is perfect for me here, being
from here, having a house here in Cerritos, being local, playing
for the hometown team in front of friends and family. ...
Especially with (the Galaxy) being a first-place team, a winning
team, possibly a championship team. That makes everything nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Lozzano is happiest for his wife, Dinorah, and three sons, who
finally can live at home rather than going back and forth between
San Jose, where he starred for the Clash, and Cerritos.
</P>
<P>
   If there are any negatives, it would be that the former Gahr
High standout probably won't see much time at his favored position,
forward, instead providing depth to the Galaxy's defense and
midfield. And that's not much of a negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to attack more than defend, but wherever this team
needs me, I will contribute as much as I can,'' he says. ``Winning
the championship is the goal here, and I'll do what I can to
help.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be a few weeks before he gets the chance. His hamstring
injury has sidelined him since July 11, and he's been working with
Galaxy trainers Ivan Pierra and Jim Liston this week to get back
into shape.
</P>
<P>
   Lozzano can play anywhere on the field, and he has done so in a
career that started as soon as he was out of high school and
includes stints with the U.S. national team, with whom he's made
seven appearances, and in Mexico, where he led Tampico Madero in
scoring three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he's been trying to join the Galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning (of Major League Soccer), I was supposed to
come here,'' he explains. ``I was supposed to be picked up in the
(1996) draft by the Galaxy on the third round, fourth pick, but
Dallas took me with the third pick. They were going to try to trade
me (to the Galaxy), and when I went to San Jose (after the '96
season), they tried to trade me, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been ongoing for awhile, and so finally I just
concentrated on playing and figured if it happens, it happens. I
kind of thought it would never happen.''
</P>
<P>
   With Dallas, Lozzano played primarily as a defender, making 22
of 31 starts on the back line during MLS's inaugural season. With
the Clash, he was a forward, contributing 10 goals and 10 assists
last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy acquired Lozzano for forward Harut Karapetyan, who
had requested a trade after his playing time was severely cut this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an issue of the versatility and polyfunctionality of
Lawrence Lozzano,'' said Octavio Zambrano, who coached Lozzano with
the California Emperors and Los Angeles Salsa. ``When he's played
in defense, he's done well, and in Mexico and San Jose when he was
a forward, he's done quite well. He can play anywhere, and he's a
tough guy, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he's a very, very happy guy to be back in his hometown.''
</P>
<P>
   That could pay off, Lozzano suggests. ``Your lifestyle affects
your training habits, and it has a lot to do with with you reaching
your full potential,'' he said. ``In terms of being 100 percent all
the time, (being happy) makes that so much easier.''
</P>
<P>
   So does playing for a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could tell the difference when I walked into the locker room
on Monday,'' he says. ``They're a great group of guys, and they
welcomed me to the team, made me feel comfortable. It's night and
day (compared with San Jose). Over there, it's a losing team,
inconsistent, and at times the guys on the field aren't getting
along. It seems everyone gets along here, respects each other.
That's one of the ingredients to a winning team.''
</P>
<P>
   GALAXY NOTES:
</P>
<P>
   A win tonight, in regulation or shootout, will secure a playoff
berth for the Galaxy. If L.A. falls, it would qualify if Dallas
fails to win in regulation Saturday at Colorado. ... The only way
L.A. misses the playoffs is by losing its last eight games, Dallas
winning its last nine in regulation, and the Burn winning the Sept.
2 meeting in the Rose Bowl by 40 goals. ... The Galaxy has scored
68 goals, two shy of the single-season record set last year by D.C.
United. ... The Wizards are clinging to fourth place in the Western
Conference, one point ahead of Dallas and three in front of San
Jose in the race for the final playoff berth. They have lost in
regulation only once in their last seven games, a 2-0 defeat to the
Galaxy on July 4 at the Rose Bowl, but fell twice in shootouts
before beating Colorado, 3-1, on Saturday. ... Mo Johnston, with
nine goals and two assists in 17 games, is the only K.C. attacker
who has been on form this season, one reason why the Wizards are
struggling so. Preki (4 goals, 7 assists), the '97 MLS MVP, Mark
Chung (0, 5) and Digital Takawira (5, 2) have been disappointing.
... Chung had two of his assists against Colorado. ... Johnston has
a goal or assist in each of the past five games. ... Goalkeeper
Mike Ammann, an Orange native, has been the brightest spot for
Kansas City with five shutouts and a 1.33 goals-against average,
third in the league. ... Kansas City has surrendered the fewest
goals of any MLS team (30) but has only scored 30, second-worst in
the league. ... The Wizards are an MLS-worst 2-9 on the road; last
season, when they won the West regular-season title, they were 9-7
away.

   WASHINGTON _ An Air Force rocket carrying a spy satellite blew
up shortly after launch Wednesday, creating a $1 billion Roman
candle that showered debris and sparks across a wide swath of ocean
and dealing a setback to the country's space-reconnaissance
program.
</P>
<P>
   The Titan 4A rocket blew up about 40 seconds after its 7:30 a.m.
liftoff from Cape Canaveral, Fla., into a hazy sky. The Air Force
said the rocket's nose dipped slightly just before the craft turned
into a fireball some 20,000 feet up. Seconds later, flight
controllers radioed signals to trigger another explosion and break
the falling debris into smaller, less dangerous chunks.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force officials said they had no idea what caused the
accident. An investigative board will be convened at once, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   No one was injured, and there appeared to be no property damage,
officials said. Even so, the mood around the cape was one of
dismay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no,'' the launch announcer muttered as the Titan exploded.
``It appears that we've had a malfunction of the vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   The blast could be heard miles away and set off car alarms in
the region. It also reverberated on Wall Street, and its echoes may
be felt in Pentagon planning rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite was intended to monitor air-defense radar networks
and track missile tests, according to an official intimately
familiar with the project, and while its loss is not a catastrophe
it dashes several years' of planning and could delay further
satellite launches.
</P>
<P>
   ``My initial thought is, `We're hurt,' '' Brig. Gen. Randall
Starbuck, commander of the 45th Space Wing at Cape Canaveral, said
at a somber press conference. ``This is a sad day for the United
States Air Force.''

SEN. CAMPBELL CALLS PRIMARY WIN A TRIUMPH FOR GOP MODERATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, who easily defeated a
conservative challenger Tuesday night in his first election since
switching parties, called his victory a triumph for Republican
moderates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sends an important message to me, because I am sick to
death of my opponents saying Republicans don't trust me _ they do
trust me in landslide proportions,'' said Campbell, who beat Bill
Eggert, 71 percent to 29 percent. ``It shows the moderate voices
within the Republican Party are dominating.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell switched from the Democratic party three years ago.
Eager to encourage Democratic defectors, the Republican Senatorial
Campaign Committee in Washington made a rare foray into primary
politics, mailing out pro-Campbell postcards to thousands of
Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
   His Democratic opponent will be Dottie Lamm, a women's activist
and wife of former Gov. Richard Lamm. She defeated a more liberal
opponent, state Rep. Gil Romero of Pueblo, 58 to 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats also chose a woman in the primary for governor,
Lt. Gov. Gail Schoettler, a former banker. She will face state
Treasurer Bill Owens, who won the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In the governor's race, Democrats argue that the governorship is
the only barrier keeping Colorado from slipping into ``one party''
status. In neighboring Kansas, Wyoming and Utah, Republicans
control the legislatures and the governors' mansions. In Colorado,
Democrats have held the governor's office since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a Democratic governor to say no to a Republican
legislature when it needs to be said,'' said Gov. Roy Romer, who is
barred from running for a fourth term by Colorado's term limits
law.
</P>
<P>
   In primaries, where moderates generally prevailed, several new
faces emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Udall, son of Morris Udall, the former congressman,
unexpectedly won the Democratic congressional nomination for the
Second District. This area, which includes Boulder, has been in
Democratic hands since 1974, the year President Nixon resigned.
</P>
<P>
   But, the Republicans now have their best chance in years to
regain the seat. On Tuesday, voters nominated Bob Greenlee, a
millionaire radio entrepreneur, who is a moderate and Boulder's
first Republican mayor in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   In the adjoining Sixth District, the western suburbs of Denver,
the Republicans nominated Tom Tancredo, an anti-tax activist and
former director of the Independence Institute, a
libertarian-leaning think tank. Although the district has been in
Republican hands since it was created 14 years ago, Tancredo's
arch-conservatism may open the door to the Democratic candidate,
Henry Strauss, a real estate developer.

ECONOMIC SCENE: CLOSING THE INCOME GAP 
</HEADLINE>
  (af)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Most economists are most comfortable thinking and writing about
what is, or will be. Would cutting the capital gains tax to 15
percent transform couch potatoes into software entrepreneurs? Would
4 percent unemployment lead to inflation? Just ask you friendly,
neighborhood PhD. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And, truth be known, most economists have a weakness for clever
fixes that exploit free markets. Want to prevent the overfishing of
coastal waters? Privatize the rights to fish. Want to curb global
warming for a fraction of the cost of conserving energy at home?
Let Western consumers pay the Chinese and Russians to cut their
emissions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But efficiency isn't an end in itself: making more stuff for
less gets you only part of the way to the economist's nirvana. And
maybe, just maybe, economists _ and other Americans _ are worrying
too little about dividing up the spoils. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   America's economic system does work better than the obvious
alternatives. After all, the socialist utopias collapsed under the
cumulative weight of their internal contradictions. Asia's crony
capitalism has proved that it isn't ready for prime time. Europe's
mixed economies perch on a powder keg of 20 percent youth
unemployment _ and can't think of any way out, save for the risky
strategy of following the advice of Alexander Hamilton and adopting
a common currency. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the celebration may be getting out of hand. For while the
American system is doing many things right, most economists would
agree that it is doing one big thing wrong: for the last quarter
century, virtually all the bounty of growth has gone to the
educated, enterprising and already-affluent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago, growth was seen as the solution to all
problems. Competitive markets, the not-so-dismal scientists
reminded us, had insured that two-thirds of all income had gone to
wages as far back as the division between capital and labor could
be measured. Hence, a growing, fully employed economy would mean
rising living standards for all. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But since the 1970s, economists have learned that a very nasty
devil lurks in the details. While labor still captures about
two-thirds of national income, only skilled workers have benefited.
And even within this elite, the phenomenon of ``winner take all''
has increased the gaps between the successful and the also-rans in
occupations as diverse as law, plumbing and basketball. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of business-as-usual argue that the consequences are
less than meet the eye. Inequality of consumption, they note, is
less extreme than inequality of wages or incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Social mobility allows some of the poor to make the leap to the
comfortable middle. The earned-income tax credit _ a negative
income tax for the working poor _ has offset some of the wage
decline of the unskilled. And the elderly, the people traditionally
at greatest risk, are generally shielded from poverty by Social
Security and Medicare. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But such rationalizations get you only so far in an economy that
has grown steadily less egalitarian over the last quarter century.
The most comprehensive estimate of income distribution, by Lynn
Karoly of the Rand Corp., shows that the real income of the bottom
10th of American families fell by 13 percent between 1973 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   And Brooks Pierce, an economist at the Bureau of Labor
Statistics, has found this growing inequality has been magnified by
the decline of company-wide medical and pension benefits. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What could be done to right the imbalance without damaging the
engine of economic growth? Probably plenty. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The earned-income tax credit could be expanded. State and
federal tax systems could be tilted, effectively eliminating taxes
on the bottom third of the income distribution and making up the
lost revenue with modest increases on the top third. Government
could take some of the sting out of private income inequality by
increasing outlays for communal services _ day care, early
childhood education, mass transit, recreation.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What is being done? Precious little. Virtually all recent tax
changes have had the effect of allowing the rich to keep more of
their earnings. President Clinton's acclaimed effort to make
college affordable has funneled the greatest share of the tax
breaks to the middle class. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Surprising the skeptics, welfare reform has been successful in
cutting dependence. But it is safe to say that tough love gets you
only so far. Even its most optimistic supporters concede that the
social infrastructure of day care and medical benefits is sorely
lacking _ and that roughly one-third of the welfare caseload is
hopelessly unprepared for gainful employment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A decade hence, will hindsight show that American capitalism,
too, was drifting toward the ashcan of history? Probably not. But
history rarely looks kindly on societies that trumpet their virtues
and ignore their failings.

CRISIS IN ASIA LEADS TO LOW INTEREST RATES IN U.S.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One side effect of the financial crisis in Asia is incredibly
low interest rates for American consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the region's malaise, demand for computers and their
components and a variety of other products is dwindling, putting
downward pressure on the earnings of many U.S. companies. But that
very damper on growth has made inflation a distant worry and kept
interest rates attractive to borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term interest rates have reached historic lows in recent
days, and consumers can largely expect more of the same, according
to economists and market analysts.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond touched 5.55
percent, its lowest level since the Treasury Department began
issuing bonds on a regular basis in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Yields fall when investors clamor for bonds and push up their
prices. That is what happened on Tuesday as fears increased that
Japan's economic recession would worsen and investors fled
worldwide equity markets for the relative safety of bonds backed by
the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday the yield on the 30-year bond was down 2/32, to a
price of 107 15/32, while the yield was unchanged at 5.60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general feeling is that interest rates will remain good
and there's not a lot of economic news out there to steer us
otherwise,'' said Greg Lumsden, a managing director of loan
originations at Countrywide Credit Industries, one of the nation's
largest mortgage loan providers.
</P>
<P>
   Already, home mortgage refinancings have hit their highest
levels in years and they are expected to continue at a strong pace.
</P>
<P>
   The average interest rate on a 30-year mortgage, which started
the year at 7.05 percent, is now 6.9 percent, and has been below 7
percent for eight weeks, the longest stretch since 1993, according
to Fannie Mae, the nation's largest mortgage provider. Rates are
expected to remain in that range through the end of the year, said
Robert Barr, a senior economist at Fannie Mae.
</P>
<P>
   If Asia's economic crisis continues to worsen, ``our forecast
may be a little too conservative,'' Barr said, suggesting that
rates could fall even further.
</P>
<P>
   Fannie Mae forecasts that $1.33 trillion in mortgages, for home
purchases and refinancings, will be made in 1998, up from $834
billion last year. The record was $1.2 trillion in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, increasingly used as a
gauge for mortgage rates, rose six basis points, to 5.43 percent
Wednesday, but remains near its June low of 5.35 percent, also its
lowest level since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Declines in rates for other types of consumer borrowing are even
more striking.
</P>
<P>
   Four-year new-car loans are now available from banks at an
average rate of 9.05 percent, down from 9.21 percent at the
beginning of the year and 9.36 percent a year ago, according to
Bank Rate Monitor.
</P>
<P>
   And bank-issued credit cards offer fixed rates almost two
percentage points lower than where they were at the beginning of
the year. At this time last year, the average rate was 16.85
percent and it remained at 16.82 at the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
   At the current rate of about 15.06 percent, a consumer carrying
a card with a $1,000 balance who switches to the lower rate from
the rate of a year ago could save $200 a year in interest payments.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The rates for people with good credit continue to go down,''
Bill Anderson, president of Bank Rate Monitor, said.
</P>
<P>
   A stellar credit history may qualify consumers for a credit card
with a 9.90 percent fixed rate that Capital One Financial began in
April or a similar card at 9.99 percent from First USA Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Declining interest rates and fierce competition have also pushed
some introductory ``teaser'' rates for new cardholders to as low as
zero, from the recent average of about 5.9 percent to 6.9 percent,
said Robert McKinley, president of Cardweb Inc., a Gettysburg, Pa.,
research firm which tracks the card industry.
</P>
<P>
   While rates are unlikely to fall much more, credit-card rates
for consumers with a less than rosy credit history are actually
going higher as lenders become more concerned about their own risks
in a weakening economic environment, McKinley said.
</P>
<P>
   Credit-card issuers are also imposing more stringent
restrictions on customers. One late payment, for example, can cause
a customer to forfeit a low introductory rate, and late-payment
fees are rising, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In what is known as the subprime card market, which caters to
consumers with low incomes, poor credit or no credit history, rates
now run 18 percent to 21 percent, said Spencer Nilson, publisher of
the Nilson Report, an industry newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Low rates on everything from mortgages to auto loans raise a
note of caution from some economists.
</P>
<P>
   If the economy slows drastically, consumers may find themselves
overextended after taking advantage of today's favorable rates to
borrow, Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities Company
International, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have called this the Goldilocks economy, but maybe
we're getting to the part where Goldilocks meets the three bears,''
Brusca said.

ARCHER EXECUTIVE TESTIFIES TO FIXING CITRIC ACID PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By KURT EICHENWALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ An executive withArcher Daniels Midland Co. testified
Wednesday that he and another senior executive at the grain giant
had participated in a global conspiracy with competitors to fix the
price of citric acid, a widely used food additive.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony of Barrie Cox, an executive with the food
additives division of Archer Daniels, came in the criminal trial of
three former officers of the company who were charged with fixing
the price of lysine, an additive in animal feed.
</P>
<P>
   While no one in the case has been charged with fixing prices of
citric acid, the government sought Cox's testimony to bolster its
charges in the lysine case, and to respond to defense arguments
that Archer Daniels executives adhered to antitrust laws, and were
more interested in cutting prices than fixing them.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have argued that Archer Daniels executives used the
method of fixing prices of citric acid as a model in the subsequent
lysine conspiracy. They argued that both systems involved
allocating sales quantities to competitors, with almost identical
methods of reporting and auditing to insure the schemes were
working.
</P>
<P>
   The three executives on trial are Michael D. Andreas, the former
vice chairman of Archer Daniels; Terrance Wilson, the former head
of the company's corn processing division; and Mark E. Whitacre,
the former head of its bioproducts division.
</P>
<P>
   The role of Archer Daniels in fixing prices of the food additive
was no surprise _ the company pleaded guilty in 1996 to conspiring
to rig both the prices of citric acid and lysine. And Cox offered
testimony about citric acid to the government that year as part of
a deal to reduce Archer Daniels' fine, which was eventually set at
$100 million.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Cox said that Wilson took a direct role in
fixing prices of citric acid. He said that he and Wilson traveled
to meetings with four other European competitors, where both
price-fixing and volume allocation were discussed.
</P>
<P>
   The system described by Cox was unusually detailed. The
conspirators referred to themselves as the G-5, which stood for the
``group of five.'' He said executives in the conspiracy were
characterized as being in two categories: ``sherpas,'' who attended
to the daily details of the scheme, and ``masters,'' who handled
broader strategy and planning.
</P>
<P>
   Cox testified that the scheme began in the spring of 1991 and
lasted through 1995. Often, he said, illegal meetings between the
citric acid producers were held in conjunction with official
meetings of a trade association, in order to provide the executives
with cover.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the conspiracy, Cox said that he had a
discussion with Wilson about what would happen if the government
learned of the illegal scheme. He said that Wilson replied, ``If
ever any of this goes wrong, you're on your own.''
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination, Cox testified that he had learned
during his time at Archer Daniels that executives with his former
employer, Pfizer Inc., had held pricing discussions with
competitors in the past. But he said that he was not aware of those
discussions while he worked at the pharmaceutical giant.
</P>
<P>
   Archer Daniels bought Pfizer's citric acid business in 1990.
Pfizer officials did not return telephone calls seeking comment on
Cox's testimony.

NEW YORK TIMES EDITOR'S NOTE FOR THURSDAY, AUGUST 13

   A New York Times News Service article sent on August 19, 1997,
described the operations of the European Union Bank, an offshore
institution based in Antigua. The article said two of the bank's
original directors, Aleksandr P. Konanikhin and Mikhail B.
Khodorovsky, were officers of the Menatep Bank of Moscow. It quoted
unidentified British and American officials who said Menatep had
links to Russian organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, The Times should have sought a response from
Menatep, Mr. Khodorovsky and Mr. Ko-nanikhin.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Khodorovsky has since said the allegations about Menatep
were ``baseless'' and ``entirely false.'' He said last fall that
Menatep had earned a B+ rating from Thomson Bank Watch, an
international rating service, and had recently gained approval from
the Securities and Exchange Commission to sell stock in the United
States. He added that the bank had ties to the World Bank and was a
``respected, reputable financial institution.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Khodorovsky said he withdrew as a director of the European
Union Bank in 1994, a week after its registration, and played no
role in its operations before then.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Konanikhin said the allegations against him, including an
arrest in the United States, visa violations and Russian charges of
having embezzled $8 million, resulted from ``disinformation'' by
Russian intelligence, which influenced or duped officials at the
United States Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   This editors' note was delayed pending the outcome of a lawsuit
in London against The International Herald Tribune over the
article. The Times was not sued, and the suit has now been settled.

 &HT;    Steele and Krumrie: Twin sons of different mothers
 &HT;    By Marty Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GEORGETOWN, Ky. _ The mentor and the student don't look alike on
the outside, but their hearts and mean streaks are identical.
</P>
<P>
   When rookie defensive lineman Glen Steele first joined the
Cincinnati Bengals, line coach Tim Krumrie pointed toward him and
said, ``Steele reminds me of an old saying Paul Brown said about me
when I was being timed in the 40 (yard dash). PB said, `I wish
training camp was here so we could put him in pads and let him hit
somebody.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Training camp is here and the fourth-round draft choice from
Michigan hasn't stopped hitting and reminding people of Krumrie,
the classic overachiever who arrived in Cincinnati as a 10th-round
pick and played 12 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really critiqued myself when I played,'' Krumrie said.
``I just tried to play hard every down. That's the same thing about
Steele. He's not going to ring your bells and whistles in his
shorts, but when he puts his pads on he's going to hit you in the
mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   At 6-foot-4 and 295 pounds, Steele is taller and heavier than
Krumrie, but their playing styles and approach to the game are
similar.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's practice at Centerville High School, for example,
Steele was suffering from an intestinal virus, but he kept working
until he was taken to the locker room for two pints of intervenes
fluids. He then participated fully in both of Wednesday's workouts
at the Bengals' Georgetown College training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a lot of moves and I'm not the quickest guy in
the world,'' he said, ``but I'm willing to work and I want to
learn. Whether you're a rookie or a 10-year veteran, you should
learn something every time you go on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele's learning curve has been complicated because he's
playing both end, his position as a four-year starter at Michigan,
and nose tackle. With regular nose tackle Kimo von Oelhoffen out
with a pulled groin, Steele has spent most of this week at that
position and is expected to get considerable playing time there in
Monday night's preseason home opener against Indianapolis. ``The
hardest thing to get used to is the pace,'' Steele said.
``Everything is boom, boom, boom. If you don't know what you're
doing, you can get behind real quick.''
</P>
<P>
   If Steele's name and his new No. 70 aren't familiar, you might
recall what he did against Ohio State last November while wearing
No. 81. In the 20-12 victory that knocked the Buckeyes out of the
Rose Bowl, he had two sacks, three other tackles for lost yardage
and a fumble recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The roster won't be set until Aug. 30, but Krumrie gave every
indication that Steele's name will be on the final list. ``This guy
isn't a project. He's going to play. He's having a good, solid camp
and he keeps getting better.''

 &HT;    Top seed tanks in ATP final
 &HT;    By Gary Nuhn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MASON, Ohio _ I don't pretend to know more than a computer but
if Marcelo Rios is the No. 1 player in tennis, the sport should be
fumigated.
</P>
<P>
   Rios, the computer's top man, put up a less-than-valiant effort
Tuesday night, losing in 62 minutes to someone named Daniel Vacek,
whose previous claim to fame was that his mother is named Radmila.
No. 1 players don't lose in 62 minutes to anybody, let alone Daniel
Vacek, who in 10 years on the tour has never won.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the computer's No. 2 player, Pete Sampras,
played his first match Wednesday, and it is my duty to report that
No. 2 looked suspiciously like No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's the best player in the world,'' Martin Damm said
after Sampras rolled over him like a truck, 6-4, 6-2, in the Great
American Insurance ATP Championship.
</P>
<P>
   It was quick and workmanlike _ one hour, 13 minutes _ a fitting
27th birthday present from Sampras to himself. But more
importantly, it was the way top players should comport themselves.
</P>
<P>
   If you're No. 12 in the world or No. 18 and you need a week off,
it's one thing to show up as a shadow. If you're No. 1, call in
sick and give the spot in the draw to someone who cares.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Rios' pathetic tank on Tuesday night, Sampras was
diplomatic. ``I know nothing about it,'' he said. ``It's hard for
me to comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly a ringing endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   The former and future No. 1 player won by breaking Damm at 4-5
in the first when Damm's serve suddenly went haywire, like a
computer crashing. Damm hit only one first-service in in that game,
and only 36 percent in the second set.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras feasted on Damm's second serve like Dom DeLuise at an
all-you-can-eat buffet.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't play with your second serve against a guy like
Pete,'' the 26-year-old Czech said. ``It was an easy match for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   How would Sampras celebrate his birthday?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll go back to my room, have dinner and get ready for
tomorrow,'' he said. ``Have a little dessert. Treat myself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is your family here?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So you're all by yourself?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't say that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras has taken criticism for tennis' fall from grace from the
heady days of McEnroe-Connors and McEnroe-Lendl. No charisma, say
his critics. Too bland. Too robotic, like R2D2 but without the
sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   He rejects the charge. ``I'm an athlete,'' he said. ``I'm not a
celebrity. I'm not a big star.''
</P>
<P>
   And then the hammer: ``I'm an anti-celebrity.''
</P>
<P>
   He sees himself as a tennis player, which would have sufficed 20
years ago. But this is the '90s and just being good is almost
sinful.
</P>
<P>
   I am reminded of Stan Smith, who was No. 1 in the early '70s
when I started covering the sport. Sampras and Smith are very much
alike _ serve and volley specialists with muted personalities _
except Smith was accepted for exactly what he was: a great tennis
player. He wasn't asked to show false emotion on the court or make
headlines off it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a showy guy,'' Sampras said. ``I'm not flamboyant.
People know what I'm about. I'm about winning tournaments.''
</P>
<P>
   And, unlike Rios, he is about giving his all.
</P>
<P>
   He said it used to bother him when he read that he was boring
and was ruining the game. Now, he said, he has adopted a line Jack
Nicklaus used when the same nonsense was foisted on him: ``The more
I won, the less I cared,'' Sampras said.
</P>
<P>
   He has won plenty, 55 tournaments, including 11 Grand Slam
events.
</P>
<P>
   He is No. 2 with a bullet, and his birthday party Wednesday
night was subdued. As is he.

 &HT;    Philanthropist Kantor makes donations to the hungry
 &HT;    By Kavita Kumar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Trucks loaded with 89,700 jars of baby food and
18,432 bottles of salad dressing were on their way Wednesday to
four major Ohio food banks, thanks to a gift from philanthropist
Milton Kantor.
</P>
<P>
   Kantor, chief executive officer of Victory Wholesale Grocers,
contributed the goods valued at more than $50,000 to help feed some
of the 1.6 million Ohioans living below the federal poverty level,
a fourth of whom are children.
</P>
<P>
   The food will be distributed through the Miami Valley Emergency
Food Bank, Cincinnati Free Store, Southeastern Ohio Regional Food
Bank and Shared Harvest Food Bank.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Tony Hall (D-Dayton), an anti-hunger advocate and
friend of Kantor, helped arrange the distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Kantor had set out to send baby food to aid the starving victims
of civil war in Sudan, but found that helping the needy overseas is
often not easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had seen pictures of the children in Sudan and so we had a
meeting because I knew we had to do something,'' Kantor said.
Problems with logistics, distribution and red tape prevented the
goods from being sent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said cultural differences can also complicate overseas
donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, (Sudanese) won't eat the baby food; it's not
indigenous to them. So then we tried to barter it, but that also
proved difficult,'' he said. ``So I suggested the food stay
local.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall was especially concerned about Appalachian areas, where
requests for emergency food increased by 43 percent last year. In
March, he had toured the poorest areas of Appalachian Ohio and was
disturbed by the widespread hunger he encountered.
</P>
<P>
   Kantor dedicated the gift to the memory of Hall's 15-year-old
son, Matt, who died two years ago of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In Logan, the director of the Southeastern Ohio Regional Food
Bank said Kantor's gift is the largest donation of baby food in the
distribution center's 14-year history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a rurally depressed part of the state with depreciated
resources,'' said its director, Dick Stevens. ``We have many in our
area who are working just above the minimum wage, which is often
not enough to support their families.

SPOKESMAN SAYS CLINTON WILL ANSWER EVERY GRAND JURY QUESTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CLINTON-OBSTRUCT)

 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will answer every question put to
him when he testifies on Monday in the grand jury investigation
into his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a White House spokesman
indicated Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some television commentators and essayists have speculated that
Clinton may choose to invoke Constitutional protections against
self-incrimination or invasion of privacy to prevent prosecutors
from asking specific questions about his relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky has testified before the grand jury here that she
and Clinton had a sexual affair, according to a lawyer familiar
with her testimony. Clinton denied such an affair in a sworn
deposition during the Paula Jones sexual misconduct case.
</P>
<P>
   In his only public comments on his prospective testimony,
Clinton said that he would testify ``completely and truthfully.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if that meant that the president would answer every
question put to him, Lockhart said, ``That's what it suggests to
me, yes.'' Asked again if Clinton might duck some questions, he
said, ``The statement I think is pretty straightforward, that he
will testify completely and truthfully.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked specifically if the president would invoke the Fifth
or Fourth Amendments of the Constitution to block questions,
Lockhart referred again to the statement. ``I think that answers
that question,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart, speaking at the daily press briefing at the White
House, said that he was basing his comments on the president's
remarks, which he made almost two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's legal strategy is among the best-kept secrets in
Washington, known only to a handful of lawyers. News organizations
and free-lance commentators have compensated for the White House
silence on the details by offering numerous theories about what he
might wind up doing.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement negotiated with the prosecutors, Clinton is
to testify on Monday at the White House. His testimony will be
videotaped and also transmitted live via closed-circuit television
to the grand jurors.

MICROSOFT APPEALS TO KEEP DEPOSITIONS CLOSED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Wednesday asked a federal appeals court
to block the public and the news media from witnessing the
depositions of Bill Gates and other company executives.
</P>
<P>
   But the company also began negotiations with lawyers for the
government and the news media to set ground rules for an
unprecedented public questioning of the executives.
</P>
<P>
   The tussle over whether the depositions should be open or closed
_ which began late last week when several news organizations said
they would demand access _ threatens to postpone the start of
Microsoft's anti-trust trial, which had been scheduled to begin
Sept. 8.
</P>
<P>
   The company has been sued by the Department of Justice and the
attorneys general of 20 states and the District of Columbia, all of
whom accuse the company of illegally anti-competitive practices in
violation of the nation's anti-trust laws.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled Tuesday
that a little-known 1913 law allows the public access to
depositions in anti-trust cases. Wednesday, he refused a request by
Microsoft to allow the depositions to proceed in private while his
ruling is appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft suggested to Jackson, and is now suggesting to the
appeals court, that the depositions should be allowed to proceed
behind closed doors, but recorded by a video camera. The company
argues that if it ultimately loses its attempt to block public
access to the depositions, the videotapes could be watched by the
public and news media.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft warned that allowing the public to witness the
depositions will make it difficult to keep the trial on schedule.
The company argued that the depositions, which were supposed to
begin Wednesday with the questioning of Gates, will be delayed by
logistical questions and lengthened by the need to consult with the
judge about excluding the public when trade secrets or other
confidential information are being discussed.
</P>
<P>
   A succesful appeal ``may relieve the parties of the onerous
burdens of having to accommodate attendance by members of the press
and general public at the more than 25 remaining depositions in
this case to be held in the next three weeks, and having to resort
constantly to the district court on issues of exclusion when
confidential information is sought by deposition questions _
burdens that are certain to delay the ultimate termination of this
litigation,'' Microsoft argued Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Moranville, an associate professor of law at the
University of Washington, said opening the depositions to the
public could dramatically alter the tenor of the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of potential for the whole thing being played
to the press, rather than in fact being an information-gathering
process,'' she said. ``What you do in making it public is, you run
the risk of the whole O.J. (Simpson) scene, where there isn't even
a judge to take control. It strikes me as particularly problematic
in a case like this, where everybody and their brother's going to
want to watch Bill get grilled.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is supposed to respond to Microsoft's
appeal Friday, and Microsoft is entitled to reply to the
government's response on Monday. The appeals court could decide as
soon as Monday whether to let the depositions proceed. In the
meantime, none is scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   In its brief filed Wednesday, Microsoft said the depositions
should be secret in part because ``it is probable that much of the
information elicited at those depositions will involve the
development and marketing of existing and future software products
_ information that the companies involved regard as extremely
valuable proprietary information.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying that at least 16 people have already been deposed in the
case, Microsoft complained that The New York Times Company, ZDTV,
ZDNET and The Seattle Times had waited until just days before the
Gates deposition to seek access.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purported `emergency' to which intervenors refer in their
papers is entirely of their own making,'' Microsoft said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said it will argue that the news media and the judge
have misapplied the 1913 law. The company said that the word
``deposition'' had a different meaning when that law was written,
referring to action in a trial-like setting, and not to the
pre-trial discovery that is closed in virtually every type of legal
case.
</P>
<P>
   But the news media, in a brief filed with the district court,
said both ``the unambiguous language of the statute and the
unbroken 85-year history of judicial understanding'' makes it clear
that the public should be allowed into the depositions. The news
media blamed Microsoft for delaying the trial, saying that if the
company simply stopped objecting to opening the depositions, they
could proceed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft insists that intervenors are entitled to no more
than stale records of the deposition proceedings, to be made
available, if at all, at some uncertain future time,'' the attorney
for the news media argued. ``Each day that the public is denied
access to a judicial proceeding required to be open constitutes a
`separate and cognizable' violation of the First Amendment, and, in
this case, of a federal statute.''

<P>
   Although Microsoft warned of the delays that could be caused by
opening the depositions to the public, the Justice Department
appeared less concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already had conversations with Microsoft, we've had
conversations with the intervenors, and I think everything's going
to work out smoothly,'' said David Boies, the government's special
trial counsel.
</P>
<P>
   If the depositions are to be public, various ground rules must
be set, including where they will be held, how many people will be
allowed to attend, and what types of technological devices, such as
laptop computers, will be allowed in the room. Recording devices,
such as television cameras and tape recorders, are expected to be
barred as they are in federal courtrooms.

 &HT;    Florida doctor, non-profit group to offer free drug testing kits
 &HT;    By Ron Hayes
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Parents who want to be sure their
children aren't using illegal drugs could swing by the Sheriff's
Office and pick up a free home drug-testing kit, if a local
doctor's anti-drug crusade succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Douglas R. Smith, an emergency medicine physician at Good
Samaritan Medical Center, is the chairman of Drug Free America, a
Delray Beach, Fla.-based nonprofit group that hopes to put 10,000
testing kits in Palm Beach County law enforcement offices this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``A parent will not pay one single penny,'' Smith promised
Wednesday. ``Not for the kit, the postage or the results.''
</P>
<P>
   The kits, which test a urine sample for marijuana, cocaine,
amphetamines, opium and heroin, will include a list of warning
signs and local counseling resources, along with a plastic cup and
bottle for mailing the sample to a laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   After three days, parents would call a toll-free number for the
results, with a physician available to discuss and interpret a
positive result.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who wants one can take one,'' said Smith. ``We don't
take names, addresses or phone numbers. We don't want to know who
you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Drug Free America _ not to be confused with the Partnership For
A Drug Free America _ has enlisted an impressive roster to support
the project.
</P>
<P>
   Former Secretary of State Alexander Haig is listed as an adviser
on the group's letterhead but could not be reached for confirmation
Wednesday. U.S. Rep. Mark Foley (R-Lake Worth), and Palm Beach
County State Attorney Barry Krischer have lent their names to the
project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very supportive,'' said Foley. ``Sometimes if a child
knows they're going to be tested, they're less likely to engage in
illegal use of drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chief Circuit Judge Walter Colbath, Jr., asked that his name
be removed after learning Wednesday that he was listed as an
advisory board member. Judicial ethics forbid him from lending his
name to any effort that raises money, Colbath said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Bob Neumann has agreed to let his office serve as a
distribution point, said Dawn Guzzetta, his public and governmental
affairs adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I really want to make clear that we are not promoting
this,'' Guzzetta said. ``We didn't raise money for it, we're just a
clearinghouse if parents decide they want to use one.''
</P>
<P>
   Each kit will cost Drug Free America about $30, including the
testing charge by SmithKline Laboratories, Smith said. He has
raised about $190,000 of the $300,000 needed to put together 10,000
kits.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 38 and the father of two children, 7 and 12, will begin
testing his older boy next year, he said. But not all teenagers
think he has a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not right unless you give your parents a reason,'' said
Tonia Lewis, 17, a junior in high school, when told of the test.
``It's a violation of your space, your body.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, said Howard Simon, executive director of the American
Civil Liberties Union of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents have a right to test their children for drugs,'' Simon
said, noting that the ACLU is dedicated to monitoring government
instrusion into private lives, not the relationship between parent
and child. ``If you're 15 and your father says you can't read
Penthouse, that doesn't mean your First Amendment rights have been
abridged.''

ENVOY'S REQUESTS FOR SAFER BUILDINGS HAD BEEN DENIED FOR BUDGET
REASONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: AFRICA-INQUIRY, AFRICA-BOMBING, AFRICA-ENVOY,
AFRICA-DEAD) 
(JT) 
 By PHILIP SHENON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. ambassador to Kenya and the Defense
Department were so alarmed about threats to the embassy in Kenya
that they requested a safer building, but were rejected for
budgetary reasons, the State Department said Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In Nairobi, the Kenyan government said it had detained several
suspects in last week's bombing of the embassy, which killed at
least 247 people, including 12 Americans. Federal law enforcement
officials said that FBI agents in Nairobi would question the
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Prompted by requests from news organizations, the State
Department revealed details of the security warnings issued to the
department over the last nine months by the ambassador to Kenya,
Prudence Bushnell, and the U.S. Central Command, the element of the
Pentagon that oversees American military interests in East Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Senior State Department officials said they did not believe that
Bushnell had cited any particular terrorist threat in her two
requests for a new embassy building _ the first made in a cable
last December, the second in April in a message sent directly to
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   ``She indicated that resource constraints were endangering
embassy personnel,'' said Patrick Kennedy, assistant secretary for
administration, who choked with emotion as he described the
warnings that the ambassador had made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, we simply lack the money to respond immediately
to all the needs of embassy construction _ it's just like a family
with limited resources,'' he said at a news conference. ``Look I've
been a foreign service officer for 25 years. And if anybody thinks
that everyone in the department isn't sick about this, they're just
wrong. We did the very best we could, given what we had.''
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the department had to turn down the requests
for a new embassy because other projects had a higher priority,
including the construction of embassies in the Balkans and the
nations of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported Wednesday that Israeli
intelligence officers had advised their American counterparts
shortly before Friday's bombings to disregard a warning that the
Embassy in Kenya might be the target of an attack.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper reported that the man who relayed the warning had
been known to Israeli intelligence, and that American intelligence
officials had asked the Israelis to assess his credibility. The
newspaper said that ``based on their past experience with him, the
Israelis said the man's warning should be taken with a grain of
salt.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper did not provide any further details about the man
or the timing of the warning.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli official in Washington said that David Bar-Illan,
Netanyahu's spokesman, denied the report. Bar-Illan had said that
Israel had gone through the last six months of intelligence
exchanges with the United States and found no exchange like the one
Haaretz reported.
</P>
<P>
   The official said that Israel and Washington have ``ongoing and
intense exchanges'' of information about intelligence matters and
the East African bombings since they have happened. ``There is a
constant exchange of counter- terrorism information and
fragments,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior official of a foreign intelligence service confirmed
earlier this week that his government had learned of a warning that
preceded the attack. But the official did not say at that time
whether the United States had asked other governments to assess the
warning.
</P>
<P>
   Department officials noted Wednesday that even if a new embassy
building in Nairobi had been approved, it would not have been
completed for years. ``We still would have been in that embassy''
when it was bombed, Kennedy reminded reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Bushnell, a career foreign service officer who is highly
regarded at the State Department, made her first request for a new
embassy building last December in a cable to the department in
Washington
</P>
<P>
   ``She expressed her concerns on the vulnerability of the embassy
and requested a security assessment,'' Kennedy said. ``Her desire
was to have a new building. The department expressed its agreement
and shared its understanding.'' He described the tone of the memo
as ``concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   While the department declined to make public the ambassador's
message, officials said she had listed several security concerns,
noting that the embassy was close to the street at a busy
intersection, which made it vulnerable to a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were multiple threats at the embassy,'' Kennedy said.
``She talked about crime, she talked about administrative matters,
and she talked about safety.''
</P>
<P>
   But in January, the State Department's Foreign Buildings Office,
which reviews requests for construction and decides how that budget
will be spent, did not include a new embassy for Nairobi on its
priority of new projects. ``This discussion confirmed that other
embassy projects had a higher priority than Embassy Nairobi for our
limited funds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the U.S. Central Command issued a similar warning
to the State Department, recommending that the embassy be housed in
a new building.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the department, Kennedy said, the Central Command
``expressed to the department its concern over the vulnerability of
the Nairobi chancellery, noting that a planned renovation for later
in the year would not change the fact that the embassy was close to
the street.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the guidelines requested by the Inman committee,
the external wall of an embassy should be at least 100 feet from
streets or sidewalks. At the Nairobi embassy, which had been
considered a low-risk post for terrorists, the so-called setback
was only about 30 feet.

NEW MANAGERS OF LIVENT SAYS FOUNDERS KEPT TWO SETS OF BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Canada)   (af)  
 By BRUCE WEBER and MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The new management of the company that brought the
hit musical ``Ragtime'' to Broadway discovered that the flamboyant
impresario who started the company kept two sets of books to
conceal extravagant spending, according to two executives close to
the board who have been briefed on the management's findings.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery was what caused the board earlier this week to
suspend the company's founder, Garth Drabinsky, from his current
role as chief creative director, and Myron Gottlieb, as a vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Gottlieb and Drabinsky co-founded Livent, based in Toronto. In a
statement issued through a spokesman, David Weiner, Drabinsky and
Gottlieb denied any wrongdoing and said they ``are unaware of
anything other than one set of books.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they said the company's new management had not
provided them with any written details on the allegations and that
because they had been locked out of their offices, their ability to
respond had been limited.
</P>
<P>
   Drabinsky has also said that the company's new management,
headed by the Hollywood power broker Michael Ovitz and the New York
investment banker Roy Furman, was long ago given ample opportunity
to raise any accounting concerns and that it completed a due
dilgience review before buying into the company.
</P>
<P>
   The two executives close to the board said, however, that the
second set of books was so well covered up that management had only
recently come upon the discrepancies.
</P>
<P>
   The people who have been informed of the findings, business
executives with access to company records, said the second set of
books concerned itself exclusively with expenses for things such as
advertising, and that there were hundreds of ``improper shiftings''
of expenditures from one project to another or from one reporting
period to the next.
</P>
<P>
   Between $12 million and $13 million was involved in 1997 alone,
the people said, the effects of which were to misrepresent the
company's true state of affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, one of the executives said, on the set of books
that were shown to the board of directors and shareholders,
advertising costs on a money-losing show were shifted to a
construction project, where they appeared as an asset and did not
reduce the bottom line. On the set of books that accurately
reflected the company's finances, the executive said, the
advertising costs stayed where they belonged.
</P>
<P>
   Company revenues were not misrepresented, both executives said.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing Drabinsky's suspension, the board said it had
found ``accounting irregularities,'' that would almost surely cause
earnings back to the beginning of 1996 to be restated. Because
Livent is publicly held, that means financial statements given to
shareholders were incorrect.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether Drabinsky's accounting practices, as
described by two executives, would constitute fraud. However, one
of the executives said that interviews with company finance
department employees indicated that Drabinsky not only encouraged
the accounting shifts but also knew they had to be hidden.
</P>
<P>
   Drabinsky, 48, a man renowned for his grand theatrical ambition,
has always been known for the lavishness of his productions and
promotion budgets, a high-spending strategy that has produced
Tony-winning musicals like ``Kiss of the Spider Woman'' and ``Show
Boat,'' as well as ``Ragtime,'' but with mixed financial success.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, under Drabinsky's leadership, Livent built theaters
in Toronto, New York, Vancouver and is completing one in Chicago,
which led the company to take on an exceedingly high level of debt.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of Drabinsky, who raise questions about how carefully
new management scrutinized the company before taking over, say he
is being made a scapegoat. An editorial in the Toronto Star
Wednesday suggested Furman and Ovitz were simply uncomfortable with
an entertainment company based outside of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   More than sensibilities are at stake. Drabinsky is entitled to
$5 million to $6 million, and Gottlieb $2 million, should it be
determined they were dismissed ``without cause'' according to the
company's filings with Toronto securities regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz and Furman, for their part, have invested millions of
their own money in the company and must convince Wall Street and
stockholders that they are leading it on a more prudent fiscal
path.
</P>
<P>
   The company reported revenues of $224 million in 1997. Its stock
price has slid recently, from a 52-week high of $11.75 to $6.75
when trading was halted Monday on news of the accounting problems.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz and Furman took control of the company in June, amid
announcements that the company had lost some $50 million in the
previous 15 months. They removed Drabinsky from financial control,
leaving him as chief creative director, the overseer of the
company's productions.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The selling was furious early Tuesday. By 1:30 p.m.,
the Dow Jones industrial average was down 257 points. And while
stocks recovered late in the day, the session, the fifth busiest on
record, came after a week that had the second- and third-heaviest
trading days on record. This surge in activity raises a question:
Who exactly is moving the market this summer?
</P>
<P>
   The answer: institutional investors, the same powerful group
that sold aggressively last October, when the Dow tumbled 554
points, or 7.2 percent, in a single day. And the same big-time
players who have soured repeatedly on the bull market, only to jump
back in later, after smaller investors have quietly affirmed their
faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``The institutions are busy _ they're real busy, there's no
question about it,'' said Bill Allyn, director of listed trading at
Jefferies &AMP; Co. in New York, which handles large institutional
trades. ``There's a lot of blood being spilled.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, small individual investors have continued to
open new brokerage accounts and to buy beaten-down shares,
according to executives at mutual-fund companies, discount
brokerage firms and market analysts.
</P>
<P>
   So this summer, when most investors would be expected to be
lounging on a beach somewhere, professional traders and portfolio
managers are selling aggressively, presumably on fears about
slowing profit growth at home and economic turmoil in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   They are also shaking up their portfolios, trying to find ways
to beat the leading stock indexes, and engaging in huge program
trades, which are growing as a percentage of all trades, according
to the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in recent weeks computer-driven program trades have
accounted for nearly 18 percent of all Big Board volume, up from
10.7 percent just eight years ago. (A program trade consists of a
trade of 15 stocks worth at least $1 million).
</P>
<P>
   The statistics may help explain why volume is so heavy this
summer, but also why the market may not tumble in October-like
fashion: because a huge majority of smaller investors have
apparently not yet jumped onto the frenzied selling bandwagon by
aggressively redeeming shares at mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, reliable statistics about trading activity are
inexact and difficult to come by because the identity of most
trading is largely secret. But there is a trickle of information
that exists about who is trading, and it suggests that institutions
(hedge funds, mutual-fund companies and brokerage houses) have done
the bulk of the selling for the last few weeks, creating a big
down-draft in the markets.
</P>
<P>
   Small, individual investors, while also jittery about corporate
earnings and the Asian economic crisis, have been holding steady,
just as they did last October.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great majority of small investors have done nothing,''
said Tracey Gordon, a spokeswoman for Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., one of
the United States' largest discount brokerage firms. ``They stick
to the market like Velcro.''
</P>
<P>
   Concern among smaller investors has certainly been heightened
this summer because of market volatility. But brokerage firms say
that investors are showing few signs of panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a lot more rational behavior than we've seen in the
past,'' said Kathy Levinson, chief operating officer of E-trade, a
fast-growing online brokerage firm. ``So while the market has been
going down, people have not been panicking.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that institutional investors have been less bullish in
these last few weeks is borne out in a study conducted this week by
Birinyi Associates, a market research firm in Greenwich, Conn. In
the period between July 24 and Aug. 11, large institutions have
been more aggressive sellers of stocks than smaller investors,
according to a study of stock money flows into the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts at Birinyi Associates studied this by tracking large
block trades _ those of 10,000 shares or more _ against smaller
trades of fewer than 10,000 shares, which include, for example, an
investor's purchase of 100 shares of IBM. Through Tuesday, the
study showed, retail trades created about $731 million in net
buying on the Big Board, while block trades accounted for $3.47
billion in selling. The bottom line: Institutions sold and smaller
investors bought.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to this market is the retail investor,'' said Jeffrey
Rubin, an analyst at Birinyi Associates. ``The retail investors are
the ones who have been really correct about this market. And the
institutions haven't been right.''
</P>
<P>
   A survey of several brokerage firms this week concluded that
smaller investors were nervous after the Dow tumbled 299 points on
Aug. 4 and then fell 257 points in the first hours of Tuesday's
session. But investors did not aggressively trade so much as
inquire.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen an increase in call volume, but most of the calls
are more service-related,'' said Beth Basilio at Dreyfus Corp.,
noting that people often inquired about the market's recent
performance.
</P>
<P>
   And at a Schwab branch office in Manhattan, the week has been
anything but tumultuous. Even during Tuesday's steep decline,
visitors to the office consisted of just a few investors checking
quotes at a computer bank and cheering the market as it reversed
course. ``It's going up, it's going up,'' said one investor, who
refused to give his name. ``We've gone up 100 points in 10
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Mo Kraushar, a 42-year-old computer expert, said he wasn't
planning on selling stock. ``I'm not moved one way or another,'' he
said tapping away at a computer to check quotes. ``I'm a
fundamental kind of guy. I just kind of chuckle at it all. It's
like a sporting event.''
</P>
<P>
   Another measure of individual investor sentiment lies in the
online trading arena, where about 20 percent to 25 percent of all
retail trading occurs, according to Bill Burnham, an electronic
commerce analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Online trading has more than doubled in the last year, to about
15 million shares a day, but online trading executives say that
trading activity has not been unusually high this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The online firms are contributing, but their contribution is
being overshadowed by the huge volume coming out of hedge funds and
other professional market speculators,'' Burnham said.
``Ultimately, the retail investor can have an impact on the
margins, but at a macro level nothing has the power to move the
market like arbitragers and hedge funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Last October's huge selloff was much more serious, many analysts
say, and it created much more activity, even though average trading
volume is actually heavier this month _ about 744 million shares a
day, up from about 610 million in October.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Ricketts, chief executive of Ameritrade Holdings, an online
brokerage firm based in Omaha, Neb., said that investors continued
to open accounts at a steady pace this summer, and that on the day
after the Aug. 4 selloff, they were eagerly buying shares using
Ameritrade's online system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were really busy,'' Ricketts said. ``The individual
investors stepped in to buy that day.''
</P>
<P>
   If smaller buyers are active in the market, though, much of that
activity may be coming from day traders, individuals who trade
professionally and actively each day, and usually close out their
positions at the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other professional traders, day traders thrive on
market volatility, hoping to make large profits in price swings.
And with market volatility on the rise _ as a result of concerns
about the strength of the bull market _ day traders have been more
aggressive than usual, driving up electronic trading volume by
about 30 percent, according to James Lee, president of the
Electronic Traders Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's nothing going on, we won't initiate it, but if
there's activity, we'll jump in,'' said Harvey Houtkin, founder of
the All-Tech Investment Group in Montvale, N.J., a professional
day-trading firm. ``If it's an active day, we'll make it even more
active.''

the friends _ one a separatist and the other the highest decorated
Green Beret commander from the Vietnam war _ will undertake their
mission to hopefully escort Birmingham bomb suspect Eric Robert
Rudolph out of the mountains and down a safe corridor through the
federal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver, of the infamous Ruby Ridge siege in Idaho, knows all too
well what Rudolph is up against.
</P>
<P>
   A missed court date in 1991 over a minor weapons charge led to
an 18-month high-tech reconnaissance mission by federal agents that
on Aug. 21, 1992, was whipped into chaos after an agent shot one of
Weaver's barking dogs that was blowing their camouflaged cover. The
standoff ended 11 days later, with Weaver wounded and his wife and
son dead.
</P>
<P>
   Never again do federal agents want another Ruby Ridge. They have
said that once they find Rudolph's hiding place, it could take
weeks, even months to negotiate him out.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Southeast Bomb Task Force say they know Rudolph
is armed with long guns. Investigators said tests conducted at the
U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) lab in Atlanta
has detected dynamite residue in both trucks _ one was his and one
he allegedly stole_ that Rudolph has driven since the Jan. 29
bombing of the New Woman All Women health care clinic in
Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph is wanted for questioning in connection with the deadly
July 1996 bombing at Centennial Olympic Park, January 1997
double-blast at an Atlanta-area abortion clinic and a February 1997
blast at a gay Atlanta nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   A $1 million dollar reward on his head has made information
leading to Rudolph's arrest a hot commodity for bounty hunters. His
mother, Pat Rudolph, has released statements of concern for her
son's life and the safety of the lawmen tracking him.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver will appeal to Mrs. Rudolph, who lives in Florida but is
currently in North Carolina, that her son should give himself up,
said Vicci Gritz, the former soldier's daughter-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (federal agents) feel like she might have some kind of
contact with him somehow,'' Vicci Gritz said. ``Randy will reason
with her so she can reason with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials had no comment about the claim that Pat
Rudolph talks to her son, probably by telephone. ``When they
searched Eric Rudolph's home, he had some of our training videos,''
Vicci Gritz said. ``We have not had any contact with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gritz, 59, who has a daily radio show that can be picked up on
shortwave, plans to muster at least 100 volunteers to go into the
mountains this weekend. Any participants must sign a waiver of the
reward, because Gritz has promised it to Rudolph's mother to use
for his defense.
</P>
<P>
   That tactic had not been embraced by the FBI Wednesday, Vicci
Gritz said. But that's all Gritz may have to offer Rudolph, who
could face the death penalty. ``I don't think these guys are going
to be effective,'' said retired FBI Agent Robert Ressler, one of
the original and most experienced profilers of criminals. ``(Gritz)
cannot trust the government unless he gets something in writing.
Today they may say something and tomorrow say another, depending on
which way the political winds are blowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Jones, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama,
said Wednesday no announcement has been made concerning Rudolph and
the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under Justice Department guidelines, we can't make that
decision until he's in custody and indicted,'' Jones said. ``It's
my understanding that that decision will be made in Washington.
There will be a recommendation from our office, but the ultimate
decision will be left in the hands of the (U.S.) attorney
general.''
</P>
<P>
   Ressler said death by lethal injection will never deter some of
today's new brand of terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using the death penalty to prevent acts of terrorism is a
joke,'' he said. ``If you are mission oriented and willing to die
for the cause....the death penalty is nothing more than a political
football.'' Jack Killorin, head of the Atlanta ATF office has said
investigators believe Rudolph is on an unfinished mission.
Investigators said that might include hurting a group of agents or
even media workers.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have said all along that Rudolph was hiding in the
Nantahala where he spent his adolescence honing his skills in the
woods . It's where he is the most comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, Rudolph proved their theory correct when he emerged
in search of food and provisions from an elderly health store food
owner.
</P>
<P>
   Killorin has said it was not Rudolph's intention to run away or
leave the country. His intentions, investigators said they believe,
are to finish the job he started.
</P>
<P>
   ``If his ultimate plan is to finish his mission, he's a very
dangerous man,''Ressler said. ``Rather than negotiate, I think it's
imperative to nail him and get him under control.''

FAMILY OF SUSPECT IN CAPITOL SHOOTING SUBPOENAED 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Relatives of Russell Eugene Weston Jr., the man
accused of killing two police officers in the U.S. Capitol last
month, were served subpoenas during their first visit to Weston
since the shootings, their lawyers said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Weston's parents, Russell Eugene Weston Sr. and
Arbah Jo Weston, as well as his sister and brother-in-law, April
and Ron Callahan, said that the family members were ordered to
appear before a grand jury on Thursday morning. The family members
sought a postponement.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Asbill, the lawyer for the elder Weston, said the
relatives had no problems with providing testimony to the grand
jury. But he said they wanted a postponement to allow them to
consult with their lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a timing issue,'' Asbill told reporters gathered in front
of the hospital. ``No parent wants to testify in connection with a
matter against his or her son. But that is not their main
objection. Their objection is the timing.''
</P>
<P>
   The relatives were apparently surprised when the subpoenas were
served on Tuesday afternoon outside the locked ward in D.C. General
Hospital where the younger Weston is being held. He was wounded in
the shootings on July 24 that killed two members of the Capitol
Police, J.J. Chestnut and John Gibson; hospital officials said
Weston's condition remained stable.
</P>
<P>
   After the subpoenas were served, the elder Weston, who has been
exceedingly voluble since the shootings, made a short appearance
before reporters in which he read a brief statement thanking the
people who have sent the family roughly 500 letters of support
since the shooting. The younger Weston is a paranoid schizophrenia,
according to his parents, and was institutionalized for 53 days in
Montana in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the people who wrote to us have had family members who
suffered from mental illness and we really appreciate the support
from that community,'' Weston read in a quavering voice as his wife
placed her hand on his shoulder.

CLINTON DEFENSE FUND NETS MORE THAN $2 MILLION IN 6 MONTHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EXCLUSIVE; 10:45 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 12:01 a.m. ET
EMBARGO for electronic media.)  
(bl) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's new legal defense fund has
raised in excess of $2 million in just six months, enriched by a
new campaign that largely blamed Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr
for the first couple's financial plight, according to several
supporters briefed in recent days on the fund's progress.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Legal Expense Trust has exceeded its managers' most
optimistic expectations, mainly through the direct-mail effort
highlighting Starr's inquiry of the president and by the increased
annual limit of $10,000 per individual.
</P>
<P>
   The $2 million far outstrips the $1.3 million raised over a
three and a half year period by the original fund, formed to help
Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton erase millions in
personal legal bills. Estimates of their legal expenses range from
a current level of at least $6 million to a total that could
ultimately exceed $10 million. The earlier fund was disbanded last
December after campaign finance controversies and strict giving
limitations had slowed contributions to a trickle.
</P>
<P>
   The new trust, created independently of the Clintons, is free of
restrictions on the original fund that had prohibited solicitations
and limited annual contributions to $1,000 per individual.
</P>
<P>
   More than 8,000 people have sent contributions to the new trust,
ranging from a single dollar to the $10,000 maximum, the supporters
said. Donations came ``from Main Street, Wall Street and
Hollywood,'' said one supporter who insisted on anonymity. ``The
direct mail was very successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Several officials said that the trust's total was spurred by
supporters' anger and frustration with Starr's four-year-old
inquiry of the president. The solicitations began in late February,
five weeks after Starr's prosecutors began investigating the Monica
Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have given more, but they didn't want any more,'' said
David Geffen, the entertainment mogul who said Wednesday that he
had contributed $10,000 to the trust. The president spent several
hours with Geffen on Tuesday at his three-story, Palladian-style
mansion on his nine-acre Beverly Hills estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think this is an incredibly unfortunate situation for
the president and for this country,'' Geffen said. ``There is a
well financed group of zealots who want to bring down the
president. And this guy has no money. He's broke. This is a
terrible situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Fund raisers attracted generous support from others in the
entertainment industry. The trust has received $10,000 checks from
singer Barbra Streisand, actor Tom Hanks, filmmaker Steven
Spielberg, film executive Jeffrey Katzenberg, film executive Harvey
Weinstein, television producer Bud Yorkin and Gail Zappa, the widow
of performer Frank Zappa.
</P>
<P>
   A list of donors has not been released. Organizers of the new
trust, which is headed by former Senator David Pryor of Arkansas,
plan to announce the results at a press conference later this
month. The trust's executive director, Anthony Essaye, declined to
comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are disturbed by the way politics is conducted today,
then what better response than to make your own gesture of decency
and generosity,'' Pryor wrote in a solicitation letter mailed to
thousands of supporters. ``I know that it will be enormous comfort
to the first family to know that so many Americans appreciate their
work and have to come to their aid.''
</P>
<P>
   One adviser estimated that the Clintons owe their private
lawyers approximately $6 million. In the letter, Pryor said that
the bill exceeds ``the president's total compensation or the first
family's net worth.'' There are expectations that those bills could
increase by at least $1 million per year before the president
leaves office in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is the first sitting president to accept donations to
help cover his legal bills. Former President Richard M. Nixon
accepted donations to help defray his legal bills after he
resigned, but he paid the bulk of his legal fees himself.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Ms. Lewinsky, the 25-year-old former White House
intern at the center of the current scandal, has received less than
$10,000 in contributions to her legal defense fund, created by her
former lawyer, William Ginsburg. And Linda Tripp, the woman whose
surreptitiously recorded tapes of conversations with Ms. Lewinsky
started the scandal, has raised less than $50,000 to defray her
legal bills.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons owe lawyers at Williams &AMP; Connolly and Skadden,
Arps, Slate &AMP; Meagher. The president's lead attorneys are David
Kendall, who is handling the Lewinsky matter, and Robert Bennett,
who led his defense in the Paula Jones lawsuit, which is pending
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years, the lawyers have also worked on the
couple's Whitewater real estate transactions and on Democratic
fund-raising controversies. Clinton has hired extra lawyers, some
of whom charge an annual hourly rate of $500, to prepare motions
and witnesses, and monitor grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons' friends and advisers established the new trust to
allow fund-raisers to aggressively raise money through direct-mail
solicitations and higher annual limits per individual than the
original fund, which had been restricted by ethics rulings.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In voice solicitations and direct mail, fund-raisers invoked the
name ``Starr'' and found that long-time supporters of the
Democratic Party and the president were so incensed at the
independent counsel's inquiry that many people gladly contributed
the maximum amount.
</P>
<P>
   In a thank-you letter recently sent to one contributor,
fund-raiser Beth Dozoretz wrote that a donation to the Clinton
Legal Expense Trust is ``different'' from writing a big check to
the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heartfelt support for what the president and first lady
have had to endure is certainly different from your other
contributions,'' Ms. Dozoretz wrote to a supporter. ``Your support
and commitment have been tremendous and appreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has a great number of friends and admirers who
sympathize what he is going through and who think that Ken Starr is
totally out of control,'' said Mark Weiner, a friend of the
Clintons and the treasurer of the Democratic Governors Association.
</P>
<P>
   Common Cause legislative director Meredith McGehee said that the
trust's $10,000 annual contribution limit ``raise questions of
propriety'' if the contributions come from people who conduct
business with the federal government. ``The money should come in
amounts that don't tend to override the campaign contributions
limits and laws,'' Ms. McGehee said.
</P>
<P>
   The president's first legal defense fund was shut down Dec. 31
because its effectiveness was crippled by revelations that it had
been offered, but declined to accept, more than $639,000 in
questionable donations solicited by Yah Lin Trie, a former Arkansas
restaurateur and longtime friend of Clinton. Trie was indicted
earlier this year on charges that he made unlawful contributions,
some from foreign sources. He has pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The original funds' trustees were forced to testify before a
grand jury and Congressional committees about Trie's donations and
had to fend off a lawsuit filed by Judicial Watch. And as a result,
the fund had to use tens of thousands of dollars intended to defray
the Clintons' legal bills on its own legal fees. In 1997, the fund
took in $79,702 in donations, and had to pay out $92,372 in
administrative and legal expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Restrictions on the original defense fund were imposed by a
ruling of the Office of Government Ethics, which prohibited any
official connected with it from soliciting funds. The ruling by the
office, a semi-independent agency within the Executive Branch,
deemed the fund and its officers to be extensions of the Clintons
themselves and thus were bound by the same restrictions barring
federal officials from soliciting donations.
</P>
<P>
   The new fund was established independently of the Clinton,
enabling it to solicit and accept larger donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``When our trust was established, the president and his advisers
felt that he could not accept contributions for political
reasons,'' Michael Cardozo, the executive director of the old fund,
said Wednesday. ``The reality is that the only way to reduce these
legal expenses is to receive contributions in excess of $1,000 per
year per individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the $2 million was raised by Terence McAuliffe, a friend
of the president who chaired the Clinton-Gore campaign in 1996 and
chaired the 1997 inaugural committee. McAuliffe was traveling
Wednesday and unavailable for comment. McAuliffe was assisted in
his fund-raising duties by Ms. Dozoretz.

 &HT;    Braves notebook: Division Series tickets to go on sale
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The Braves announced tickets for the Division Series
will go on public sale Monday (Aug. 17) and Turner Field and via
various TickerMaster outlets. There will be no limit to the size of
ticket orders for the Division Series, though the majority of seats
available are reserved seating in the upper reaches of the park _
Upper level, Upper Pavilion and Skyline.
</P>
<P>
   Pricing for the Division Series remains the same as last year _

$15 for Field Pavilion and Terrace Pavilion and $10 for others.
These sales are for first-round games only. Dates for NLCS and
World Series sales will be announced at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   If the Braves win the NL East, they will have home-field
advantage. The Division Series will start either Sept. 29 or 30
and, in a scheduling change, the club with the home field advantage
will host Games 1, 2 and, if necessary, 5.
</P>
<P>
   Orders through TicketMaster may be made via its Charge-By-Phone
service, at various TicketMaster outlets and through TicketMaster
Online. Phone orders may be made at 404-249-6400 or outside the
metro area at 800-326-4000. TicketMaster Online can be accessed at
www.ticketmaster.com.
</P>
<P>
   Seats purchased at the Turner Field ticket office may only be
paid for with cash, cashiers check or money order. No checks or
credit cards will be honored.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker rockin'
</P>
<P>
   However the Braves bullpen shapes up for the postseason, rookie
John Rocker thinks he has earned his spot in it. And if he
continues to work like he did Tuesday night, he is right.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think as well as I've pitched since I've been up (May 5), I
think I'll probably be on the postseason roster, unless something
drastic happens in the next three weeks,'' He said. ''I think I've
pitched well enough for long enough that I've earned that''
</P>
<P>
   The staff's lone left-handed reliever for nearly seven weeks,
Rocker suddenly finds himself surrounded by two others, with the
call-ups of Norm Charlton and Adam Butler. Though the Braves
habitually reduced their pitching staff by one to 10 men for the
postseason, manager Bobby Cox would like nothing better than having
two lefties in his bullpen for October.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Rocker's penchant for walks (he has yielded 18 in 24-1/3
innings), he has allowed only 16 hits and a .186 average with 27
strikeouts. And he was outstanding working the eighth inning
Tuesday night, striking out Tony Gwynn swinging and then buckling
Ken Caminiti on a check-swing strikeout. Rocker's fastball was
consistently timed in the mid 90s, topping out at 98 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ''I changed my strategy back to how I was throwing a couple
weeks ago _ challenging with my fastball then using my slider when
I got ahead,'' he said. ''I think what got me away from that were
those two innings in Cincinnati (July 29), where I think I threw
like one slider the whole time. I started to rely on (the fastball)
too much because I was striking out a lot of guys with it. But the
slider felt good last night. You get ahead in the count and then
out pressure on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Father knows best
</P>
<P>
   Hunter Wendelstedt, the first-year umpire who ejected both John
Smoltz and Bobby Cox in a wild altercation in Cincinnati two weeks
ago, was behind the plate Wednesday, working in the same crew with
his father Harry, the league's senior umpire. League president Len
Coleman had given special approval for the father and son to work
one stretch this season. Hunter was filling in with Ed Montague's
crew when his incident with the Braves occured.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Smoltz or Cox have received notification from the league
about any fine or suspension. Making contact with an umpire is an
automatic suspension and that the matter has gone so long without
league action is leading the Braves to believe the incident is
being dismissed. Wendelstedt ejected Smoltz after turning into him
and stepping on Smoltz's foot and then ejected Cox for putting his
hand on his chest when trying to separate the two.

 U.S. RECORD IN BRINGING TERRORISTS TO JUSTICE A DISMAL ONE

<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ In the war between the United States and
terrorists since the 1983 bombing of the American Embassy in
Beirut, Lebanon, the score is grim.
</P>
<P>
   Today it stands: Americans killed in bombings and hijackings in
the Middle East and Africa _ 307. Terrorists convicted for those
crimes by American courts, a bare handful.
</P>
<P>
   As the FBI and the CIA set up shop in borrowed offices here and
in Tanzania, scrounging desks and telephones while spearheading a
global search for the people who bombed the American embassies five
days ago, they know all too well that acts of terror committed
overseas are the most difficult cases to crack.
</P>
<P>
   The complexity and sophistication of foreign terrorist
organizations is increasing, present and former intelligence
officials say. The audacious timing and logistical skill required
in the bombings last week _ one group fomenting two nearly
simultaneous attacks more than 300 miles apart, killing at least
257 people and leaving no clear trace _ was breathtaking to
veterans of the war on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two at once is not twice as hard,'' said Milton Bearden, a
retired senior CIA official who was the ranking officer for the
agency in Afghanistan, Pakistan and the Sudan. ``Two at once is 100
times as hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The war was hard enough before the bombings. Terrorist groups
seem to know more about American intelligence than the American
intelligence knows about them, Bearden said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, the domestic law-enforcement agency, is operating
abroad, searching for clues in unfamiliar terrain and seeking help
from local officials and other residents who are sometimes
unhelpful.
</P>
<P>
   On overseas investigations, the FBI and the CIA have to work
together. But they began only recently to cooperate, after decades
of mutual mistrust, intelligence and law-enforcement veterans say.
The intelligence agency, despite its best efforts, has few reliable
sources in international terrorist networks.
</P>
<P>
   The Kenyan government announced Wednesday night that it had
arrested suspects. So did the government in Tanzania this week. But
those arrests appear unpromising. And there are many reasons not to
expect swift justice under American law.
</P>
<P>
   No one may ever know whether the bombings last week were
supported by a state like Iraq, an intelligence service like Iran's
or an individual like the exiled Saudi financier Osama bin Laden.
Bin Laden has hailed such attacks in the past, financed terrorist
groups from Egypt to Algeria to Afghanistan and sought to unify
them under his banner, according to intelligence officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This in all likelihood was not state supported, and if it's
not, `Terror Inc.' is beginning to creep in,'' Bearden said.
``Whether or not bin Laden was in on it there may be an emerging
linkage between bin Laden, the Islamic Jihad guys and the Islamic
Group out of Egypt. If so, these people are close to becoming a
state unto themselves.''

 NAIROBI, Kenya: unto themselves.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   All are suspects, American officials said. But following a trail
from the rubble of the embassies to a command center in Baghdad, a
clandestine cell in Tehran or a terrorist training camp in
Afghanistan would be a long haul.
</P>
<P>
   The networks are by nature almost impossible to unravel. The
chain of command in a sophisticated group connects the intellectual
author of the terror to the attackers who carry out his will. But
that chain has many links, and no one person in the chain may know
the identity of the next.
</P>
<P>
   The man who builds the bomb may know nothing of the man who pays
him, or the man who drives the bomb to its target. So locating a
bomber or his car may lead nowhere. It can be extraordinarily
difficult for investigators to recreate the chain.
</P>
<P>
   The search sometimes never ends. The CIA is still looking for
the assassins who killed its Athens station chief, Richard Welch,
in 1975. And no one has ever been arrested by American authorities
in the bombings of the U.S. Embassy and the Marine barracks in
Beirut in 1983 that killed 255 people or in the bombings of two
military posts in Riyadh and Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, in 1995 and
1996 that killed 26 American military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   But the Beirut and Dhahran cases provide lessons for the
investigators in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam today. The investigation
of the Khobar Towers bombing, which killed 19 airmen, is at a dead
end. The FBI and the Saudi intelligence service would not share
information.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau, which had never conducted an investigation in the
kingdom, said the Saudis were uncooperative. The Saudis said the
bureau was highhanded.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can never catch the bad guys without the help of your
friendly local foreign security and intelligence services,''
Bearden said. ``You can't run roughshod over them.''
</P>
<P>
   The hunch that the Khobar Towers bombing was carried out by
Saudi dissidents with the help of outsiders _ possibly Iran or bin
Laden _ remains unproven. Suspicions that Iran has had a hidden
hand in such bombings date from the start of the modern era of
terrorism against American diplomatic and military posts, the
bombing of the Beirut Embassy in April 1983.
</P>
<P>
   That explosion damaged the CIA's ability to understand,
infiltrate and nullify Islamic terrorism. The bomb destroyed the
agency's Beirut station, killing seven officers, among them Robert
Ames, the top Mideast analyst. He had been the chief of the
clandestine service in the Arab world and a covert agent in Iran,
Lebanon, Kuwait and Yemen.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years before the bombing, he had won the trust of Ali Hassan
Salemeh, the security chief of Al Fatah, then one of the most
feared terrorist organizations. Salemeh provided the CIA with
warning of the assassination plots of radical Palestinian groups
and helped the agency obtain agents in Islamic political and
guerrilla organizations, former intelligence officials said. In
1979, Salemeh was killed by a car bomb, probably by the Mossad, the
Israeli foreign intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA has never had a source quite like Salemeh or an officer
quite like Ames, some intelligence officials said. The lesson, they
added, is that an intelligence service is only as good as its spies
and its sources. Until recently, another problem in terrorist
investigations outside the United States was a deep friction
between the CIA and the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CIA and the FBI did not cooperate as well as they ought
to,'' Jeffrey Smith, a former general counsel at the intelligence
agency, said. ``They did not share information. They frankly were
suspicious of each other.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Smith said, the bureau and the agency confronted the
fact that they were like the Army and the Navy during the invasion
of Grenada. He used the image that could not communicate because
their radios operated on different frequencies.
</P>
<P>
   They came from different cultures. A law-enforcement officer who
is confronting an evildoer wants to string him up. An intelligence
officer wants to string him along, to find out what he knows and
where that knowledge might lead.
</P>
<P>
   To overcome that clash, ``we got senior CIA people from Europe
and the Middle East together with senior people from the FBI'' for
a three-day meeting two years ago in Rome, Smith said. ``They asked
each other, `How do you handle the joint takedown of the terrorist
organization? Do you do this for purposes of prosecution or for
purposes of penetration?' It was the first time these conversations
had occurred, and when it was over the deputy director of the FBI
said, `We should have done this 40 years ago.'''

THQ DROPS PLAN TO ISSUE NOTES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Citing unfavorable market conditions, video-game
maker THQ Inc. said that it has withdrawn plans for a $60 million
private placement to fund expansion.
</P>
<P>
   THQ, based in Calabasas, Calif., had announced late in July that
it planned to issue the subordinated notes that could be converted
to stock after seven years. The notes would have financed the
purchase of new game titles, expansion of foreign distribution and
possible investments in other companies.
</P>
<P>
   But the announcement Wednesday sent THQ shares down as investors
possibly feared a dilution of their stock. Between July 27, when
the announcement was made, and Tuesday, the company's share price
fell from $31 to $26.875.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Gysi, THQ's chief financial officer, said recent drops in
the stock market would have made it difficult to place the $60
million in notes. ``In a declining market, it's a challenge to do
new issues,'' Gysi said. ``When stocks are dropping, most fund
managers, who would be buying the notes, are more worried about
surviving than taking on anything new.''
</P>
<P>
   Gysi also acknowledged that the effect the announced placement
had on THQ's price helped scuttle the plan for now.
</P>
<P>
   Investors greeted Wednesday's news enthusiastically, sending THQ
shares up $2.875 to close at $29.75. &QL;

TAKE ME OUT TO .... BATTING PRACTICE!  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Ryan Ahlemeyer begged his father, Lon, to leave
early for the 20-minute drive to Busch Stadium on Tuesday, early
enough to be one of the first fans into the park when the gates
opened at 5:10 p.m., to scamper to the outfield seats in Section
385 and to get in position to catch a batting practice homer from
Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   Lon Ahlemeyer, 42, a self-employed electronics technician,
rescheduled some job appointments, hopped into his gold Saturn and
drove Ryan, 13, from Cahokia, Ill., to the stadium by 4 p.m. to
wait in line. The father later sat in the steamy stands as his son
stood as rigid as a Marine behind the yellow neon sign that says
Big Mac Land in the upper terrace deck high above the left-field
fence. It would take about a 440-foot homer to reach Ryan's small,
tan glove perched over the front-row railing, a prodigious blast
even for McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   But Ryan was eerily confident, and so was his father. ``He said
he was going to do it, so I believed him,'' Lon Ahlemeyer said of
his son. ``It's kind of amazing, but I thought he'd do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people like the Ahlemeyers packed the entrances to
the stadium four hours before the first pitch, some like Ryan who
wanted to catch a ball and many others who simply wanted to watch
McGwire practice swinging a bat in his quest to break Roger Maris'
37-year-old record of 61 homers in a season. There were fathers and
sons and mothers and daughters. It was as easy to find a 5-year-old
with a Cardinals cap as it was to find a 55-year-old with a paunch
and a Cardinals T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, a team with a losing record, are nevertheless on
a pace to set a team attendance record with 3.1 million fans. The
enthusiasm that permeates Busch during batting practice, which is
generally regarded as a mundane warm-up in other stadiums, is the
clearest indication of just how eager fans are to feel close to the
summer's memorable home run race, with McGwire, at 47 entering
Wednesday night's game, leading the Cubs' Sammy Sosa, who has 46.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to make sure I got here and got a chance to get
something from his season,'' said Chad Mulligan, who cruised
through St. Louis on vacation from his home in Pocahontas, Ark.
``He's obviously going to break it. Even if we don't get a ball, we
can say we were here.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jane Mehlelman sounded a similar note. ``I haven't seen
this before and it's wonderful,'' she said. ``I've always enjoyed
coming to the games because I'm a big Cardinals fan. Now this makes
it even more exciting. You feel like you're part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   John Moranville, a former resident of St. Louis who now lives in
Memphis, returned home to see McGwire and felt as if he had been
placed inside a time capsule and was 10 years old again.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, McGwire has brought back a lot of interest in
baseball,'' he said. ``I was a fan of the Cardinals with Stan
Musial and Red Schoendienst. Back then, baseball was everything to
kids. Now, I don't think it's everything. McGwire is bringing that
back. Kids need heroes. He's a hero.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ryan Ahlemeyer, skinny with choppy brown hair, a hesitant smile
and high hopes, was evidence of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd come every night to watch him if my parents would let
me,'' Ahlemeyer said. ``This is so much fun.''
</P>
<P>
   When the park officially opened, the tranquil sounds of batting
practice in an empty stadium were replaced by the rowdy sounds of
fans rushing to get in position to snare a souvenir blast from
McGwire. They burst up the runways in anticipation. There was a
family of five with the father giving instructions for catching the
elusive ball, teen-agers who used hand and eye signals to station
themselves and husbands and wives who separated by 150 feet to
maximize their chance for a ball.
</P>
<P>
   They had gloves, cameras, binoculars and camcorders. Mostly,
they had gloves, causing one stadium employee to lament: ``It used
to be I could get all the balls I wanted if I came down here for a
few minutes. Now, everyone's here.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a calm in the seats as the crowd swelled. Jeff Marsh
wanted his 13-year-old son, Patrick, to feel the type of
exhilaration he did when he once caught a foul ball off a Nolan
Ryan fastball. Chad and Kevin Mulligan, whose combined weight is
about 450 pounds, sat in the front row of one section and spread
out in five seats to store their belongings. Sure. They were boxing
out other fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something gets close to us, my brother's big enough to get
it,'' said Chad, who pointed to his brother, a huge man with logs
for arms.
</P>
<P>
   When McGwire took practice swings beside the cage, the fans
cheered as if he had smoked a double. It was time. Ryan peeked down
over the railing and saw so many fans standing below him. Should he
be in the loge section?
</P>
<P>
   When McGwire routinely bunted the first batting practice pitch,
the fans groaned. When he grounded the ball to shortstop and fouled
another off, they moaned some more. But on the fourth toss, McGwire
satisfied the fans in 282 by stroking a ball at them.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Fletcher saw it all the way. He was sweating through a
purple shirt as the ball flew toward him. Fletcher reached up with
both hands and tried to catch the ball barehanded. It sounded like
a firecracker when it popped off his left hand and bounced softly
into another fan's grasp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost it in the sun,'' a pained Fletcher said. ``If I had a
glove, I would have caught it.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Fletcher Jr., a concerned 13-year-old, was still asking
about the apple-red mark on his father's hand when another ball
rocketed toward them. Five pairs of hands lunged for it, and the
fan whose glove reached the farthest was Tim Blan, who seconds
earlier had switched spots from the walkway in front of the section
to the sixth row. He shouted, ``Yeah,'' and closed his eyes after
the grab, but calmed down for the post-catch interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pure luck,'' Blan said. ``Any of these guys could have
caught it. I was just telling myself not to drop it. I'm glad I had
the glove.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after McGwire completed his first practice session with a
homer to center, Ryan did not lose hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he'll hit one up here,'' Ryan told his father. ``He
always does.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire did not go deep on his first three tries in the second
round. But then he lined a bullet into a section in left center,
almost the same spot where he drilled one later Tuesday night off
the Mets' Bobby Jones for his 47th homer.
</P>
<P>
   On the next swing, McGwire's 12th of batting practice, he
unloaded on a fastball and Ryan's brown eyes bulged because the
ball was hurtling toward him. Would the ball be high enough? Would
it make it to the terrace level? Ryan was standing behind a
three-foot railing, which led to a 50-foot drop, so he could not
lean over too far. He waited.
</P>
<P>
   The ball continued soaring. Ryan was standing over the ``d'' in
``Big Mac Land,'' and he squeezed his glove between two railings
awkwardly, yet adeptly. Miraculously, the ball hit the webbing of
Ryan's glove like a cannon ball and popped out like a snow cone
before he coolly gathered it in with his right hand, his arms
wrapped around the railing. Fans did double-takes after the
outstanding grab and then gave Ryan a McGwire-like ovation. The
teen-ager had been right all along. A ball from McGwire's special
and possibly historic season was his.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hit very hard and I didn't know if I was going to catch
it,'' Ryan said. ``I just tried to put my body in front of it. When
I saw it in my glove, it felt like Christmas.''

MENTOR MAKES HOSTILE BID FOR QUICKTURN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore.)  (mk) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER and LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If you can't beat them, acquire them. That
appears to be Mentor Graphics Corp.'s latest strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which primarily makes work station software, said
Wednesday that it had made an unsolicited tender offer for
Quickturn Design Systems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Hostile acquisitions are rare in Silicon Valley because
technology rapidly becomes obsolete and the real assets of the
acquired company, the engineers, can walk out the door. Rarer still
is this offer because Mentor and Quickturn, rivals in systems that
automate chip design, are locked in patent litigation that has
blocked a key Mentor product from the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   Mentor's offer of $12.125 a share in cash represents a 50
percent premium to Quickturn's closing price of $8 on Tuesday.
Mentor, based in Wilsonville, Ore., has already acquired 3 percent
of Quickturn, which is based in San Jose, Calif., on the open
market. Mentor would pay $209.5 million for the 97 percent of
Quickturn it does not already own.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Ostby, Quickturn's chief financial officer, said that
the company could not comment on the offer until it had reviewed
all the terms. He said Quickturn's board would meet to review the
proposal and formulate a response.
</P>
<P>
   Walden Rhines, Mentor's president and chief executive, said in a
telephone interview that while eliminating the patent battle
between the companies would result in savings of $12 million in
legal fees, the deal made sense independent of the litigation.
Although Mentor and Quickturn have discussed merging in the past,
they could never reach an agreement, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is something that is just plain good for the
shareholders and the companies,'' Rhines said. ``I think the
joining of the two companies would have tremendous benefits in
eliminating customer uncertainty,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Quickturn shares gained 38 percent on the news, closing up
$3.03125, to $11.03125, in Nasdaq trading. Mentor shares closed up
12.5 cents, to $9.375, also on Nasdaq. Both companies' shares have
been weak in recent months, Quickturn because it is in the midst of
a product transition cycle, Mentor because its growth rate has
lagged behind the market leaders Cadence Design Systems Inc. and
Synopsys Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mentor and Quickturn both sell products used to design
chips, they are in different parts of the business. Mentor
primarily sells software that typically runs on work stations from
Sun Microsystems Inc. or Hewlett-Packard Co., whose engineers use
it to design new chips. Quickturn sells specialized computers that
can emulate a new chip before it exists in silicon, allowing
engineers to test new designs and write software before a part
enters production.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating any deal, of course, is the patent litigation.
Mentor acquired a small French company with a product similar to
Quickturn's last year but cannot market the product in the United
States. The International Trade Commission ruled that Mentor was
infringing a series of Quickturn patents, and the Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit rejected Mentor's appeal. Gary Smith, an
analyst with Dataquest, said the proposed acquisition made sense
because Mentor would gain a strong entry in the fast-growing market
for simultaneous hardware and software design.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mentor really needs to do this,'' Smith said, noting that the
company has been growing at 5 percent a year in a market growing at
a 15 percent annual rate. ``Buying Quickturn just makes all sorts
of sense, and peripherally, it gets rid of the lawsuit,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the deal would present a management challenge because the
business models for software and hardware are so different.
Analysts note that Synopsis, the No. 2 electronic design automation
company, acquired an emulation product similar to that of
Quickturn's over a year ago but subsequently divested itself of it.
Cadence has remained a pure software company.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another curious attempt by Mentor to try to revive
some sort of strategy,'' said Mike Sottak, a Cadence spokesman.
``It doesn't make a lot of sense to us, particularly since Mentor
already owns technology in that space. Mentor has been kind of
wallowing along here, desperately grasping at straws to make
something happen from a strategy or an excitement standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, Mentor grabbed the lead position in electronic
automated design by offering its software on the then-popular
Apollo work station at a time when competitors sold only
specialized single-purpose computers. But the company was slow to
shift to selling software separately from hardware and slow to move
to Sun's work stations, which gave Cadence and others a chance to
move ahead.
</P>
<P>
   But a hostile bid is a risky way to regain momentum. Of the 11
unsolicited technology deals attempted in the last year and a half
_ including the $9.8 billion attempt by Computer Associates to take
over Computer Sciences Corp. _ seven of them were withdrawn within
two months of being announced, according to Securities Data Co. In
fact, IBM's takeover of Lotus Development Corp. in 1995 was one of
the few successful takeovers.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, more companies are attempting to shield themselves
from such unsolicited overtures. Stock prices of some companies are
off their highs, making them more attractive targets. Steven
Spurlock, a lawyer at Gunderson Dettmer in Menlo Park, Calif.,
which represents emerging growth companies, said that 60 percent of
the companies his firm talked to these days were taking defensive
measures. ``Certainly the level of concern has increased,'' he
said. ``As the industry matures this is a likely outcome.''

SPORTS COLUMN: WHY THREE IS BETTER THAN ONE  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The best team in baseball chases greatness, and
enjoys watching others try, too. The record-chasing Yankees sit in
the dugout, and look for hints on the scoreboard, omens from
Chicago, St. Louis and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's talking about it all the time,'' Luis Sojo said
Wednesday in the Yankee clubhouse. ``We see a run go up in St.
Louis, and we say, `McGwire's got another one.' I can't wait until
we get to the middle of September.''
</P>
<P>
   Do opposing players root? Yes, they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing to see, a month and a half to go and guys closing
in on 50,'' Bernie Williams said after the Yankees mugged Minnesota
again, this time by 11-2, once more affirming George Steinbrenner's
claim that their neighborhood is not very safe. ``I'm definitely
rooting for them. Both of them. Three of them.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of those weekly baseball publications, Vin Scully, the
Dodgers' announcer, said this week that he does not wish to see
Roger Maris' 61 home runs surpassed by more than one player, in
that it would cheapen the record and the achievement of breaking
it. With all due respect to a venerable baseball traditionalist, I
look at it as Williams does. If Maris is going down, let it be by
committee, by stampede.
</P>
<P>
   Maris beat Babe Ruth's 34-year record of 60 home runs in 1961,
but the Ruth legend only deepened its mythic footing because his
spikes were firmly planted in the American dream, rags to home runs
to riches. Now at the far end of the 20th century, in a country
with still-painful racial wounds, we have a white man, a black man
and a Hispanic man in this contest of Men Chasing Maris. If Mark
McGwire and Sammy Sosa remain on pace, if Ken Griffey Jr. can get
hot again in the next couple of weeks, then Sojo is right.
September will be a month to remember, the fitting conclusion to a
season when baseball has moved to reclaim its place as the American
game of the people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't count Junior out,'' said Sojo, the reserve middle
infielder. ``I played with him three years in Seattle. He can go
into one of his streaks, and then, it's like every other at-bat
it's a home run.''
</P>
<P>
   Luis Sojo, from Venezuela, and Bernie Williams, from Puerto
Rico, go to the morning paper with a special interest in Sosa, out
of the Dominican Republic, who stands to emerge from this assault
on the most famous of sports records in the most Ruthian place of
all.
</P>
<P>
   Hank Aaron already broke Ruth's career home run record. Ruth
remains the standard for transcendent power presence. The Hispanic
major league community, increasing in numbers and dominance year
after year, still awaits its rightful home run king.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they all did it, the impact would be more for the Latinos,
as far as the pride of having one of our own doing that feat,''
Williams said. ``It's an understatement to say that that would be
the greatest thing that's happened in Latin baseball since
Clemente.''
</P>
<P>
   Up in the press box, Roberto Clemente Jr. took a moment from his
preparation for the Spanish broadcast of the latest Yankee rout to
smile, in agreement, with gratitude. Then he talked about how Sosa
approached him at the All-Star Game in Denver last month, with a
sense of history that took him by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched films of your father when I was young,'' Sosa told
him. ``I always tried to emulate him on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, Clemente Jr. said, the perfect illustration of why
``Sammy Sosa's life is going to change like he never imagined,''
even if he hits 62 and McGwire 68. The man, whose Puerto Rican
father died when his plane crashed on a relief mission to
earthquake-struck Nicaragua, said: ``We are all brothers from
different countries. When my father was alive, he tried to improve
conditions for all Latino players. He fought for equality. It's not
there yet, but it's getting closer and closer. If Sosa passes
Maris, it will change the image of the Latin ballplayer forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth changed the way the country looked at all ballplayers, only
none of them were black. Sam Lacey, the 94-year-old Baltimore
Afro-American sportswriter inducted last month into the Hall of
Fame, told me recently that he never wrote a single word about Babe
Ruth. ``My readers had no interest in anything white on white,'' he
said. ``That was a society we weren't part of.''
</P>
<P>
   Maris' run came with much of the country struggling with the
prospect of imminent change in the early 1960s. Most people rooted
against him. That's not the sense now, with McGwire, Sosa and
Griffey. All the more reason that three for the price of one,
swinging deep into September, would be bigger and better, in ways
that can't be measured by number.

TOWN THAT DISNEY BUILT IS HIT BY FIRST VIOLENT CRIME
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DOUGLAS FRANTZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CELEBRATION, Fla. _ This widely publicized planned community
developed by Walt Disney Co. a few miles from Disney World was
abuzz Wednesday with news of the town's first reported violent
crime.
</P>
<P>
   A robber who said he had a gun threatened a family before taking
an undisclosed amount of cash and two credit cards from their home
in Celebration about 6 p.m. on Monday, said a spokeswoman for the
Osceola County Sheriff's office, which provides police protection
for the unincorporated town of about 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   The robber approached Terrence Turner in the garage of his home
while Turner's wife, Stephanie, and two small children stood nearby
in the yard. He then threatened to shoot the Turners unless he was
given money, said the spokeswoman, Carole Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept his hand in his pocket,'' Ms. Garcia said. ``The
victim never did see a gun. He was polite and apologetic and he
drove off in a blue Honda after being given the money and credit
cards.''
</P>
<P>
   Celebration is Disney's effort to generate small-town values in
a carefully designed small-town atmosphere. It has attracted
attention as a potential antidote to urban crime and the sprawl and
isolation of traditional suburbs since the first residents moved in
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The houses, which start at $160,000 and go as high as $1
million, are close together. The architecture of the homes is
old-fashioned and many have porches to promote social interaction.
The streets are narrow, tree lined and quiet. Residents often leave
doors unlocked and children rarely use locks on their bicycles at
school or downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the town is expected to have 20,000 residents on
4,900 acres southwest of Orlando, and it has been the
fastest-selling development in Central Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many other planned communities, Celebration is not gated,
and its downtown is a magnet for tourists and other visitors. It is
just off heavily traveled Route 192.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Garcia said there had been no previous reports of violent
crime in the town and only a handful of reported thefts of bicycles
or tools and material from construction sites.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Conneely, who moved here nearly two years ago from
Connecticut, heard about the robbery over coffee downtown Wednesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first reaction was shock and surprise,'' Ms. Conneely said.
``Then I thought that it proves this sort of thing can happen
anywhere. We shouldn't be naive.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Carl Perkins, who lives near the Turners and moved here with his
wife from a Chicago suburb, did not seem particularly alarmed by
the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the feeling that a lot of people moved here looking for
small-town America,'' he said. ``Everyone is looking for that old
sense of community and the security that goes with it. But you're
kidding yourself if you think that this couldn't happen here.''
</P>
<P>
   Brent Herrington, the community services manager for the
Celebration Co., the Disney subsidiary developing the town, said
residents were not as much concerned Wednesday about security as
about the well-being of the Turners.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very tight-knit community, and you are going to have
a high level of concern when something like this happens,''
Herrington said. ``We have all the same issues that every other
community in America has, but we feel this is a very safe place.''

AS DEBATE PERSISTS, NEW STUDY SEES LESS ATMOSPHERIC WARMING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y., Ala.)   (af)  
 By WILLIAM K. STEVENS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As nearly as climatologists can tell by studying temperature
measurements dating back to the 1850s, the earth's average surface
temperature has risen by about one degree over the last century.
But some measurements made by orbiting satellites have suggested
that the lower atmosphere is cooling, leading some skeptics to
argue that the world is not warming.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has persisted despite the fact that the two-decade
record of satellite data also shows a slight warming once transient
climatic effects like El Nino and volcanic eruptions are filtered
out.
</P>
<P>
   Now two scientists in California have reanalyzed the record and
concluded that it has been distorted by the inevitable decay, or
lowering, of the satellites' orbits as they encounter atmospheric
resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Once this error is corrected for, the scientists report Thursday
in the journal Nature, the satellite record shows a warming of
about 0.13 of a degree per decade, even without adjusting for the
cooling effects of volcanic eruptions and the heating effects of El
Nino.
</P>
<P>
   The new reading, they reported, ``is in closer agreement with
surface temperatures,'' although it shows about half as much
warming. The authors of the report are Frank J. Wentz and Dr.
Matthias Schabel, atmospheric physicists with Remote Sensing
Systems, a private research firm in Santa Rosa, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The finding could signal ``a sea change in the global warming
debate,'' Dr. James E. Hansen and four colleagues write in a
commentary that is to appear Friday in the journal Science. Hansen,
the director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New
York, has long been an advocate of the view that emissions of
heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide are warming the earth.
</P>
<P>
   If the Wentz-Schabel finding stands up, Hansen said in an
interview, it will make it ``very difficult to deny the reality of
global warming,'' though he and his colleagues note in the Science
article that the finding is likely to be challenged and possibly
revised.
</P>
<P>
   One originator and keeper of the satellite record immediately
offered a revision. ``It's real; this paper is legitimate,'' said
Dr. John R. Christy of the University of Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   But Christy said other corrections involving, for example,
east-west drift of the satellites and instrument temperatures have
also recently been made.
</P>
<P>
   The net result of all the corrections, he said, is that the data
show a warming in the lower atmosphere _ but a very small one,
close to zero and smaller than both the revised warming reported in
Nature and the reading derived from surface measurements.
</P>
<P>
   This does not necessarily contradict the surface record, Christy
said.
</P>
<P>
   He and others have long maintained that the temperature profile
of the surface and that of the lower atmosphere would not be
expected to be identical, since they differ physically. Comparing
the two records, many scientists say, is like comparing apples and
oranges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surface is doing something slightly different from the
atmosphere above,'' Christy said, ``and that's just the climate.
They do not have to be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he has long noted, the surface and satellite data agree
well in many regions, including the Northern Hemisphere continents.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 10 years, Christy and a colleague, Dr. Roy W.
Spencer of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's
Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville have been using data
from weather satellites to put together a continuous global
temperature record.
</P>
<P>
   The surface records have many gaps and inconsistencies resulting
from changing methods of measurement. And although analysts have
tried to correct for these, Christy and Spencer saw their satellite
data as having an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   A disadvantage, however, has been that the satellite data record
goes back only to 1979, and many experts say this is too short a
period to detect a meaningful trend. And it has been challenged on
its own methodological grounds, most recently in Wednesday's Nature
article.
</P>
<P>
   Before the new corrections of the satellite record, Christy had
calculated that once the effects of El Nino and volcanoes were
removed, the satellite measurements showed an atmospheric warming
trend of about 0.1 degree per decade. Now, with corrections in
place, he calculates it at 0.05 degree to 0.18 degree per decade.
This compares with about 0.25 of a degree for the surface record.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that over the long century and a half of the surface
data record the effects of El Nino and volcanic eruptions tend to
cancel each other out and that no adjustment for them is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Even with El Nino and the volcanoes included, Christy said, the
short satellite record now showed a warming trend of 0.07 degree
per decade.
</P>
<P>
   This, he said, is because the 1997-98 edition of El Nino warmed
the atmosphere so much that it counterbalanced the cooling effects
of volcano eruptions in the 1980s and early 1990s, which emitted a
haze that reflected sunlight.

<TEXT>
<P>
   USA Networks Inc. is expected to merge its Ticketmaster Online
service with Citysearch, an Internet company that produces local
guides of events, according to a person close to USA Networks.
</P>
<P>
   USA Networks already owns a 13 percent stake in Citysearch, for
which it paid $20 million a year ago, a person with knowledge of
the original negotiation said.
</P>
<P>
   After the merger, USA will own 62.5 percent of the merged
company and Citysearch will own the rest. Citysearch, which had
planned a public offering this week, lost $37 million last year on
revenue of $6 million, according to a USA Networks executive.
</P>
<P>
   Ticketmaster Online was started in 1994, receives four million
visits a month and sold about 10 million tickets in July, said Alan
Citron, who has been running the multimedia operation of USA
Networks. USA Networks chairman Barry Diller has been a proponent
of local programming and information services.

SWISS BANKS AGREE TO PAY HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS $1.25 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Representatives of Swiss banks and Holocaust survivors announced
a settlement Wednesday in which the banks agreed to pay $1.25
billion in reparations to victims of the Nazi era.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, intended to settle the claims of tens of
thousands of survivors whose families lost assets in World War II,
was hailed by Jewish groups and elected officials as providing
long-delayed justice for the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am tremendously pleased and gratified to announce that we've
reached a historic agreement,'' said Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.,
who led the move to pressure the Swiss banks into providing money
for a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was announced in front of U.S. District Court in
Brooklyn, where three suits filed over the last two years had been
consolidated into one class-action suit. The suits had accused the
banks of retaining the assets of Holocaust victims, assets that the
plaintiffs' lawyers said had been deposited in the banks by the
victims or that had been looted by the Nazis and stored in Swiss
banks.
</P>
<P>
   The litigation had been part of a growing effort to force the
banks to scour their records to identify dormant accounts and the
proceeds of Nazi plunder and to pressure them to return the assets
to the elderly and frail victims and their heirs.
</P>
<P>
   A number of states and cities, including New York City and New
York state, had threatened to impose sanctions on the Swiss banks
if they did not agree to an acceptable settlement. The threat had
outraged the Swiss government, and the sanctions were also opposed
by the U.S. government, which feared that the threats could
complicate efforts at a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat said in a statement
Wednesday night that the accord ``represents a major step'' in
achieving justice for Holocaust survivors and strengthening
American-Swiss relations.
</P>
<P>
   One condition of the settlement, Eizenstat said in an interview,
was that the plaintiffs publicly call for all elected officials to
drop their threat of sanctions against the Swiss.
</P>
<P>
   The call for sanctions intensified after a settlement agreement
fell apart in June. In subsequent weeks, officials in New York
City, New York state and California said they would impose
sanctions on Sept. 1 against Swiss financial interests.
</P>
<P>
   Many details of how to pay the money and who would qualify
remain to be worked out. The payments are to be made in four
installments over three years, with the first installment of $250
million not likely for nine months to a year because of the work
needed to implement the deal, according to lawyers for both side.
The work includes devising a plan to distribute the money to
victims with claims against the Swiss banks who live in the United
States and abroad, they said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Organ music, please. Cut to a shot of a woman in a
comfortable-looking kitchen. She pours coffee and says, ``Good
morning, dear.'' Never mind that it is really midafternoon: we are
watching a soap opera here, and she is the first character the
world hears on ``As the World Turns.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward 42 years, 4 months and 11 days, to Wednesday: same
station, same program, same actress. Helen Wagner is still playing
Nancy Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I outlasted Cronkite, I outlasted the one who wrote those
wonderful travel programs _ what was his name? Charles Kuralt,''
Miss Wagner says off camera. She also outlived two on-camera
husbands and became, in her words, ``the longest continually
running item on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Carson put in 29 years on the ``Tonight'' show, Walter
Cronkite a mere 19 as anchor of ``CBS Evening News.'' On ``As the
World Turns,'' Miss Wagner was, and is, the gravitational force, a
three-P character: proper, prim and even prissy. In the days of
black-and-white television, she was idolized, not only by
housewives who gave ``World'' world-beating ratings, but also by
school-age children who were banished from the living room when
``World'' came on but who sneaked a few looks anyway.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, Nancy and On-Camera Husband No. 1 inhabited a
surprisingly imperfect world, the world of live television. Doors
stuck when they were supposed to open, chairs crumbled when actors
sat down or a train rumbled by. For years ``World'' originated from
what Miss Wagner calls ``the square-wheeled-train studio,'' a sound
stage in Grand Central Terminal. The 1:55 to Pelham or Poughkeepsie
rattled the china in Nancy Hughes' cabinet almost every day until
CBS moved to West 57th Street in the mid-1960s. And following the
rules of the time, Nancy and her husband slept in separate beds.
</P>
<P>
   Off camera, Miss Wagner's voice is more Texas than Illinois _
her father was a doctor in Lubbock (``I guess I get some of my
drama from him,'' she said after telling a story of soap- if not
grand-opera proportions about his removing a bullet from an Indian
chief, saving his life, which is why the doctor lived to tell her
about it). But she did spend time in Illinois, at Monmouth College,
which cannot be too far from Nancy Hughes McClosky's beloved
Oakdale. Miss Wagner studied music and drama and, diploma in hand,
moved to New York, where among other things, she was a paid soloist
in church choirs.
</P>
<P>
   Even after all this time, Nancy and Helen have not merged into
one personality. ``I don't think Nancy would have disapproved of
Helen,'' Miss Wagner said, ``but she wouldn't have been
interested.'' On Tuesday's episode, Nancy was treated to a surprise
80th-birthday party aboard a cruise ship retracing the route of the
Titanic. It did not take a writers' conference to figure out that
she would be wearing a life jacket on Wednesday's show.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Wagner herself will not turn 80 until next month. Her
husband, Robert Willey, who was an actor and theatrical producer,
is sitting next to her in a restaurant where the noise from the
next table almost drowns her out. When she says, ``I made a pilot
film,'' one thinks she has just uttered an uncharacteristically
colloquial but oh-so Hollywood sentence, ``I made a pile of
films.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she was in a bunch of Broadway shows, including
``Oklahoma!'' and ``Sunny River'' and the touring company of ``A
Streetcar Named Desire,'' with Lee Marvin.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is: the organist told her. The often-asked question
is: when did she find out that President John F. Kennedy had been
shot? The black-and-white clip from Nov. 22, 1963, has been played
over and over. But about 1:40 that day, Miss Wagner did not know
that Cronkite was breaking in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grandpa and Nancy were in the library, talking about the
kids,'' Miss Wagner said. ``We finished the show.'' As she was
sauntering out of the studio at 2, the organist dashed out of his
soundproof booth. ``He said, `Did you hear? Kennedy's been shot.'
I'm in the Smithsonian Institution from that clip. A dubious
distinction.''
</P>
<P>
   She pauses. ``We didn't play those kinds of things in the show _

something is written until the time it's on the show. It may have
been a little less when we were live. Besides, by the time you get

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Organ music, please. Cut to a shot of a woman in a
comfortable-looking kitchen. She pours coffee and says, ``Good
morning, dear.'' Never mind that it is really midafternoon: we are
watching a soap opera here, and she is the first character the
world hears on ``As the World Turns.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward 42 years, 4 months and 11 days, to Wednesday: same
station, same program, same actress. Helen Wagner is still playing
Nancy Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I outlasted Cronkite, I outlasted the one who wrote those
wonderful travel programs _ what was his name? Charles Kuralt,''
Miss Wagner says off camera. She also outlived two on-camera
husbands and became, in her words, ``the longest continually
running item on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Carson put in 29 years on the ``Tonight'' show, Walter
Cronkite a mere 19 as anchor of ``CBS Evening News.'' On ``As the
World Turns,'' Miss Wagner was, and is, the gravitational force, a
three-P character: proper, prim and even prissy. In the days of
black-and-white television, she was idolized, not only by
housewives who gave ``World'' world-beating ratings, but also by
school-age children who were banished from the living room when
``World'' came on but who sneaked a few looks anyway.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, Nancy and On-Camera Husband No. 1 inhabited a
surprisingly imperfect world, the world of live television. Doors
stuck when they were supposed to open, chairs crumbled when actors
sat down or a train rumbled by. For years ``World'' originated from
what Miss Wagner calls ``the square-wheeled-train studio,'' a sound
stage in Grand Central Terminal. The 1:55 to Pelham or Poughkeepsie
rattled the china in Nancy Hughes' cabinet almost every day until
CBS moved to West 57th Street in the mid-1960s. And following the
rules of the time, Nancy and her husband slept in separate beds.
</P>
<P>
   Off camera, Miss Wagner's voice is more Texas than Illinois _
her father was a doctor in Lubbock (``I guess I get some of my
drama from him,'' she said after telling a story of soap- if not
grand-opera proportions about his removing a bullet from an Indian
chief, saving his life, which is why the doctor lived to tell her
about it). But she did spend time in Illinois, at Monmouth College,
which cannot be too far from Nancy Hughes McClosky's beloved
Oakdale. Miss Wagner studied music and drama and, diploma in hand,
moved to New York, where among other things, she was a paid soloist
in church choirs.
</P>
<P>
   Even after all this time, Nancy and Helen have not merged into
one personality. ``I don't think Nancy would have disapproved of
Helen,'' Miss Wagner said, ``but she wouldn't have been
interested.'' On Tuesday's episode, Nancy was treated to a surprise
80th-birthday party aboard a cruise ship retracing the route of the
Titanic. It did not take a writers' conference to figure out that
she would be wearing a life jacket on Wednesday's show.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Wagner herself will not turn 80 until next month. Her
husband, Robert Willey, who was an actor and theatrical producer,
is sitting next to her in a restaurant where the noise from the
next table almost drowns her out. When she says, ``I made a pilot
film,'' one thinks she has just uttered an uncharacteristically
colloquial but oh-so Hollywood sentence, ``I made a pile of
films.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she was in a bunch of Broadway shows, including
``Oklahoma!'' and ``Sunny River'' and the touring company of ``A
Streetcar Named Desire,'' with Lee Marvin.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is: the organist told her. The often-asked question
is: when did she find out that President John F. Kennedy had been
shot? The black-and-white clip from Nov. 22, 1963, has been played
over and over. But about 1:40 that day, Miss Wagner did not know
that Cronkite was breaking in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grandpa and Nancy were in the library, talking about the
kids,'' Miss Wagner said. ``We finished the show.'' As she was
sauntering out of the studio at 2, the organist dashed out of his
soundproof booth. ``He said, `Did you hear? Kennedy's been shot.'
I'm in the Smithsonian Institution from that clip. A dubious
distinction.''
</P>
<P>
   She pauses. ``We didn't play those kinds of things in the show _
current events,'' she says. ``It takes eight weeks from the time
something is written until the time it's on the show. It may have
been a little less when we were live. Besides, by the time you get
something on the air, it's old hat. If you say something about, and
I hate the word, the Monica Lewinsky thing, you'd think it would
have been over in eight weeks.''

8-12 -- A room in Umberto Lenzi's Tuscan farm-cum-inn, the Fattoria
San Donato. As prices for farm products dwindle, and with them
rural incomes, European farmers are redesigning their farms to take
in tourists, a practice known as agritourism, and governments are
helping them do so. By rough estimate, the 15 European Union
countries have spent $2 billion since 1991 to subsidize such
programs. (James Hill/New York Times Photo)

Europeans, drawn by modest room rates and seeking refuge from noisy
cities, are arriving in droves. ``We just felt a need to get away
from the noise of the television set,'' says Nicola Decaro, 40, a
city employee from Apulia, Italy, who spent a week recently with
his wife and two daughters at the farm. (James Hill/New York Times

PATH TO VICTORY IN A MAJOR MEANDERS THROUGH TALL TREES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash.)   (bl)  
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ With 100-foot tall trees and perfectly
manicured grass, Sahalee Country Club hardly resembles midtown
Manhattan. Lee Janzen sees similarities, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the best way to prepare for this course would have
been to go to a big city, like New York, and maybe play down Fifth
Avenue,'' said Janzen, the two-time U.S. Open champion. ``With the
trees being so large, and so close to the fairway, you immediately
see the only shot you can possibly hit. And that's straight down
the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   With that game plan in mind, the world's greatest golfers have
prepared to tee off Thursday for the 80th PGA Championship, the
final major championship of the year. Sahalee, which is playing
host to its first major, is a unique course that will test
precision and patience. Those who stay on the fairway consistently
will have a chance to win. Those who venture into the trees may
wish they had a chain saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody heard there were a lot of trees,'' said Justin
Leonard, last year's British Open champion. ``I don't think anybody
imagined this many.''
</P>
<P>
   But through those trees leads the path to a major. And for Mark
O'Meara, it could be a path that leads to history. Having already
won the Masters and the British Open, O'Meara will try to become
the first man since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win three majors in the
same year. If O'Meara is in contention this weekend, the tournament
is certain to be memorable. And if O'Meara can reach the back nine
Sunday with a chance to win, he likes his chances as well as
anyone's.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have a chance Sunday, I'm going to go for it,'' O'Meara
said. ``There's no reason not to. People remember the people who
win. You don't remember sometimes who finishes second, third,
fourth, or fifth.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara has deep respect for Hogan, one of the game's greats,
who died last year. In 1980, after winning the 1979 United States
Amateur Championship, O'Meara actually turned professional in
Hogan's office, signing with the Hogan company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I got to know him as well as most other players of our
era, and it was a lot of fun,'' O'Meara said. ``We had a lot of
neat times together. Just to be tossed around in the same light as
a Hogan is a tremendous honor.''
</P>
<P>
   But while O'Meara has already had a memorable season, this
tournament will be the last chance for others to win a major this
year. Those who have never won a major, such as Colin Montgomerie
and Phil Mickelson, would love to silence their critics. And Tiger
Woods, who has only one victory on the PGA Tour this year, but nine
top-10 finishes, could put an entirely different slant on his year
by winning a major.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this is my last chance at a major this year, but I'm
not going to put any more pressure than I normally do,'' said
Woods, the 1997 Masters champion. ``Last year, I was guilty of
being too rambunctious, and not really being as patient as I need
to be. I need to give myself a chance and not shoot myself in the
foot.''
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to hurt yourself at Sahalee is to toy with the
trees. The 11th hole is certain to be the most controversial of the
tournament, a 546-yard par 5 that features two trees in front of
the green that frame the pin like goal posts. Players who try to
reach the green in two shots will have to work the ball between the
trees like a place-kicker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be plenty challenging,'' Janzen said. ``You'll
see some eagles, plenty of birdies, and you'll see some shots hit
the trees and end up in not so good spots. If you could be a fly on
the golf bag, you might hear some words you've never heard.''
</P>
<P>
   All the talk about O'Meara's quest has overshadowed Davis Love
III, the defending champion, who won his first major in emotional
fashion last year at Winged Foot Golf Club in Mamaroneck, N.Y. Many
will never forget the scene when Love approached the final green
there and a rainbow appeared in the sky, reminding him of his
father, Davis Love Jr., the renowned golf teacher who died in a
1988 plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   Love was excited about his chances to repeat, but nobody has won
back-to-back PGA Championships since Denny Shute in 1936 and 1937.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the players here, Love will rarely use his driver,
and instead hit woods and irons off the tee to keep the ball
positioned in the tight fairways.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to hit two very good iron shots in a row to get on
the green,'' Love said. ``For me, it's probably one or two drivers
the whole golf course. You don't ever really get to a hole where
you can just bomb a driver down there and have an easy shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning a major is not supposed to be easy, however, and Sahalee
should present an interesting test. Nine of the last 10 PGA
champions were first-time major winners, so historically, it has
been a hard tournament to predict. But for the winner, dealing with
the trees, the 4-inch rough and the pressure will be well worth the
reward.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter where we play this, or what you think of the course,
they're going to give that Wanamaker Trophy to somebody on
Sunday,'' David Duval said. ``And that's what we all want.''
</P>
<P>
   CHIP SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   _ The weather is expected to be excellent throughout the
tournament, with afternoon temperatures in the 70s and 80s.
</P>
<P>
   _ STEVE JONES, the 1996 U.S. Open champion, withdrew Wednesday
because of the death of his close friend, Gus Lebsock, a part-owner
of the Phoenix Suns who died Tuesday from a heart attack. Lebsock,
67, had been fishing with Jones in Montana last weekend. Jones was
replaced by BILLY ANDRADE.
</P>
<P>
   _ JOHN DALY, the tour's leader in driving distance, practiced
Tuesday with a new Callaway Big Bertha Steelhead driver, and he
will use this week.

countries have spent $2 billion since 1991 to subsidize such
programs. (James Hill/New York Times Photo)

TEXT OF SOLICITATION LETTER FOR LEGAL EXPENSE TRUST 
</HEADLINE>
   (sidebar with CLINTON-DEFENSE-FUND)  
 (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following is the solicitation letter sent to
supporters of the President and Mrs. Clinton under the signature of
former Sen. David Pryor, D- Ark., as provided by the Clinton Legal
Expense Trust. Those receiving the letter also get a certificate
for donors to sign and return with their checks.
</P>
<P>
   LETTER
</P>
<P>
   In today's political climate, public service can exact a
disturbing price. There is perhaps no better example than the
financial crisis now facing President and Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   News reports reflect that to conduct his four-year investigation
of the Clintons, the independent counsel already has spent more
than $40 million of taxpayer money. And supporters of Paula Jones
continue to fund her case on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Since entering the White House, President and Mrs. Clinton have
accumulated almost $5 million in legal expenses _ an amount far
beyond the President's total compensation or the first family's net
worth. They are personally liable for these bills.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Legal Expense Trust has been established to enable
supporters of the first family throughout America to help defray
these enormous costs. Because you are a supporter of the President,
we are writing to ask for your help.
</P>
<P>
   Contributions to the trust can be made by any United States
citizen who is not a lobbyist or an employee of the executive
branch of the Federal Government. Contributions from PAC's,
corporations or labor organizations are not permitted, and no
individual can contribute more than $10,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   All of us should be concerned when the financial burden of
public service becomes so great as to discourage good men and women
from seeking office. Our President deserves the chance to do his
job and serve our nation unburdened by the prospect of a huge
personal debt.
</P>
<P>
   Few Americans would deny that President and Mrs. Clinton have
worked tirelessly for the benefit of our nation. Their work has
helped produce economic prosperity, lower crime and most
importantly a new optimism about America and our future.
</P>
<P>
   Their dedication and their achievement deserve our thanks and
our generosity.
</P>
<P>
   I have known the President for more than 30 years, and I'm sure
that your help will be deeply appreciated by the first family.
Please join other friends of the Clintons in contributing to the
trust. Your contribution will make a big difference.
</P>
<P>
   P.S.: If you are disturbed by the way politics is conducted
today, then what better response than to make your own gesture of
decency and generosity. I know that it will be enormous comfort to
the first family to know that so many Americans appreciate their
work and have come to their aid. Thank you so much for any
contribution you send.
</P>
<P>
   CERTIFICATE
</P>
<P>
   Enclosed with the mailer is
</P>
<P>
   To the trustees: In connection to my contribution to the Clinton
Legal Expense Trust, I hereby certify that:
</P>
<P>
   _ I'm a citizen of the United States;
</P>
<P>
   _ I've made my contribution voluntarily and with my own personal
funds;
</P>
<P>
   _ I'm not a lobbyist registered with the Federal Government;
</P>
<P>
   _ I'm not employed by the executive branch of the United States
Government;
</P>
<P>
   _ Including this contribution, I've not contributed more than
$10,000 this calendar year to the Clinton Legal Expense Trust;
</P>
<P>
   _ I understand that my name, city, state and the amount of my
contribution will be publicly disclosed;
</P>
<P>
   _ I understand that my contribution is not tax-deductible.

MANDELLA DUO FAVORED IN CLASSIC

<P>
   DEL MAR _ One horse hasn't run his best in precisely a year. The
other hasn't won a stakes in this country, let alone a race of this
quality.
</P>
<P>
   Individually, Gentlemen and Puerto Madero are shaky propositions
in the $1 million Pacific Classic on Saturday. But together,
coupled in the wagering because of common ownership, they are 6-5
favorites for the 1\-mile race, the highlight of the Del Mar
season.
</P>
<P>
   Touch Gold is so close, at 8-5 all by himself, that the
Kentucky-based 4-year-old really should be considered the favorite.
Free House is 3-1 on the morning line set after post positions were
determined Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is as tough as it gets. You have three, maybe four top
horses,'' said Richard Mandella, trainer of Gentlemen and Puerto
Madero, apparently counting the latter as the ``maybe.'' ``Touch
Gold is world-class. Free House is world-class.''
</P>
<P>
   Gentlemen won the Pacific Classic in 1997, when he was the best
older horse on the West Coast. Free House won the '97 Santa Anita
Derby and ran second or third in all of the Triple Crown races.
Touch Gold won the '97 Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Free House's and Touch Gold's rival, the popular Silver Charm,
will miss the Pacific Classic after a last-place finish in the San
Diego Handicap. The handlers of top-ranked Skip Away decided to
keep him in the East. But even without them, this is one of the
strongest runnings of the Pacific Classic, and its nine-horse field
equals the 1994 race won by come-from-behind 7-1 shot Tinner's Way.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get three horses like this,'' Mandella said, ``people don't
appreciate it (enough). It doesn't happen that often these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Six-year-old Gentlemen has lost back-to-back races for the first
time in a 20-race career. He bled and finished last at 1-20 odds in
the Santa Anita Handicap. He came back 3{ months later to run third
to Skip Away and Puerto Madero in the Hollywood Gold Cup.
</P>
<P>
   A half-mile workout in :46 3/5, the fastest Tuesday morning at
Del Mar, raised Mandella's confidence in Gentlemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had a sterling year,'' Mandella said. ``We're still
looking to get to the maximum point.''
</P>
<P>
   Chilean-bred 4-year-old Puerto Madero is the equal of Gentlemen
off their recent form. This will be his fourth U.S. race.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Madero could be one of the early trailers, hoping his
stablemate and Free House kill each other off.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Madero will be ridden as usual by Kent Desormeaux.
Gentlemen switches to Corey Nakatani, who rode him to two victories
in 1996. Gary Stevens had been riding Gentlemen but committed to
Silver Charm in the spring, and Mandella didn't want to be Stevens'
second choice.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens will be on Lazy Load in the Pacific Classic, taking over
from Desormeaux. Eddie Delahoussaye has Pacificbounty, replacing
injured Laffit Pincay.

 &HT;    SWT to offer online master's degree
 &HT;    By Rebeca Rodriguez
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Very soon, geography students from Lubbock to
Laredo and beyond will be able to turn on a computer, pop in aCD
and begin working toward a master's degree in applied geography
from Southwest Texas State University in San Marcos.
</P>
<P>
   SWT, with help from a U.S. Department of Education grant, is now
offering the only online master's degree in applied geography in
the world. For students who normally would not be able to attend
SWT because of, well geography, such as high school teachers in the
Rio Grande Valley, the program offers an alternative way to receive
a degree without having to spend several semesters on campus. With
the program, the university is helping to foster a trend among
colleges and universities of widening their reach through distance
learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very innovative way to look at geography,'' said
Lawrence Estaville, chair of the Geography and Planning Department
at SWT. ``This is not a new academic program, but it is a new way
of delivering the current academic program, and we are the very
first ones to have brought it online.''
</P>
<P>
   The university has offered a traditional applied geography
degree since 1983, and was the first institution in the nation to
do so. Since then, the department has grown to become the nation's
largest, with 28 professors, 575 undergraduates, 165 master's
students and about 19 doctoral students. The geography department
also offers the only doctoral program at SWT.
</P>
<P>
   The federal grant _ $208,000 spread over three years _ will help
get the online program started by Jan. 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In a world where student populations are constantly evolving,
distance learning is more than a luxury, it is a necessity, said
state Rep. Ted Kamel, R-Tyler. ``The average student age is going
to continue to grow as people return to school to re-learn things,
for continuing education, to finish degrees or start new ones,''
Kamel said.
</P>
<P>
   This new layer of students often cannot afford to attend a
course that meets three times a week from 3 to 5 p.m., he said.
``The deal with distance learning on the Internet is, you can plug
in your laptop at the airport or wherever you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Kamel sponsored a bill that allows Texas colleges to
offer online courses without having to get state approval, provided
those courses are already being offered traditionally.
</P>
<P>
   For those skeptical about distance learning, Kamel said the
trend will augment but not replace traditional universities and
face-to-face interaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``All it means is that we will have a better-trained work force.
Hopefully, it puts Texas on the same cutting edge of technology and
education that other states are,'' Kamel said. Going electronic
also means spreading the gospel on geography, SWT officials said.
The more people who have access to geography the better, Estaville
said, because contrary to what many think, geography is much more
than looking at maps and memorizing the location of foreign lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``In applied geography, we try to give students experience with
real-world problems, like the siting of landfills, modeling the
movement of surface and subsurface water, NAFTA transportation,
air-quality degradation, developing tourism,'' he said. ``All of
these are major issues for Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   So is teaching geography, said Brock Brown, an SWT geography
professor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Geography is now pretty much mandated in the high school
curriculum, but it's a double-edged sword,'' Brown said. ``We've
got geography out there, but we don't have a lot of teachers who
can effectively teach it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Rio Grande Valley, which already suffers from a chronic
shortage of teachers, there are few master's degree programs, and
anyone wanting additional education in geography usually has to
travel to SWT for classes.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of an online degree is enticing to Daniel Furmaga,
a geography teacher at Edinburg High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very attractive degree, especially now that people are
recognizing the importance of geography,'' Furmaga said. ``I would
be able to access resources and instruction that, for the most
part, have been out of my reach,'' he said. ``Southwest Texas is
THE geography school. Their geographers are full-blooded. They eat,
drink and sleep geography.''
</P>
<P>
   Furmaga said a master's in geography would help him be a better
teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many kids ask 'Why do we need to know this?' `` Furmaga
said. ``What we are trying to show is that in life, you are going
to use this, whether it's math or geography.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that emphasis on using geography in daily life that will
eventually create a cadre of global citizens, one expert said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing facts and where things are no more makes you a
geographer than memorizing multiplication tables makes you a
mathematician or knowing how to spell makes you a great writer,''
said Ronald Abler, executive director of the Association of
American Geographers in Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the connectedness of places and events in the world that
is the core of geography,'' he said. ``It is hearing of some event
in one particular place and immediately thinking how it is affected
by and, in turn, affects distant places.''
</P>
<P>
   Abler said enrollment in geography programs at all levels _ from
undergraduate through doctorate _ has been increasing a steady 3
percent each year, and there are about 20,000 geography students
across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   That means more teachers are being trained to present good
quality geography in primary and secondary schools, Abler said.

   All are suspects, American officials said. But following a trail

chain of command in a sophisticated group connects the intellectual
author of the terror to the attackers who carry out his will. But
that chain has many links, and no one person in the chain may know
the identity of the next.
</P>
<P>
   The man who builds the bomb may know nothing of the man who pays
him, or the man who drives the bomb to its target. So locating a
bomber or his car may lead nowhere. It can be extraordinarily
difficult for investigators to recreate the chain.
</P>
<P>
   The search sometimes never ends. The CIA is still looking for
the assassins who killed its Athens station chief, Richard Welch,
in 1975. And no one has ever been arrested by American authorities
in the bombings of the U.S. Embassy and the Marine barracks in
Beirut in 1983 that killed 255 people or in the bombings of two
military posts in Riyadh and Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, in 1995 and
1996 that killed 26 American military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   But the Beirut and Dhahran cases provide lessons for the
investigators in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam today. The investigation
of the Khobar Towers bombing, which killed 19 airmen, is at a dead
end. The FBI and the Saudi intelligence service would not share
information.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau, which had never conducted an investigation in the
kingdom, said the Saudis were uncooperative. The Saudis said the
bureau was highhanded.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can never catch the bad guys without the help of your
friendly local foreign security and intelligence services,''
Bearden said. ``You can't run roughshod over them.''
</P>
<P>
   The hunch that the Khobar Towers bombing was carried out by
Saudi dissidents with the help of outsiders _ possibly Iran or bin
Laden _ remains unproven. Suspicions that Iran has had a hidden
hand in such bombings date from the start of the modern era of
terrorism against American diplomatic and military posts, the
bombing of the Beirut Embassy in April 1983.
</P>
<P>
   That explosion damaged the CIA's ability to understand,
infiltrate and nullify Islamic terrorism. The bomb destroyed the
agency's Beirut station, killing seven officers, among them Robert
Ames, the top Mideast analyst. He had been the chief of the
clandestine service in the Arab world and a covert agent in Iran,
Lebanon, Kuwait and Yemen.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years before the bombing, he had won the trust of Ali Hassan
Salemeh, the security chief of Al Fatah, then one of the most
feared terrorist organizations. Salemeh provided the CIA with
warning of the assassination plots of radical Palestinian groups
and helped the agency obtain agents in Islamic political and
guerrilla organizations, former intelligence officials said. In
1979, Salemeh was killed by a car bomb, probably by the Mossad, the
Israeli foreign intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA has never had a source quite like Salemeh or an officer
quite like Ames, some intelligence officials said. The lesson, they
added, is that an intelligence service is only as good as its spies
and its sources. Until recently, another problem in terrorist
investigations outside the United States was a deep friction
between the CIA and the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CIA and the FBI did not cooperate as well as they ought
to,'' Jeffrey Smith, a former general counsel at the intelligence
agency, said. ``They did not share information. They frankly were
suspicious of each other.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Smith said, the bureau and the agency confronted the
fact that they were like the Army and the Navy during the invasion
of Grenada. He used the image that could not communicate because
their radios operated on different frequencies.
</P>
<P>
   They came from different cultures. A law-enforcement officer who
is confronting an evildoer wants to string him up. An intelligence
officer wants to string him along, to find out what he knows and
where that knowledge might lead.
</P>
<P>
   To overcome that clash, ``we got senior CIA people from Europe
and the Middle East together with senior people from the FBI'' for
a three-day meeting two years ago in Rome, Smith said. ``They asked
each other, `How do you handle the joint takedown of the terrorist
organization? Do you do this for purposes of prosecution or for
purposes of penetration?' It was the first time these conversations
had occurred, and when it was over the deputy director of the FBI
said, `We should have done this 40 years ago.'''

IT'S CLEAR-CUT: CHAN'S PLAN IS PERFECTION

<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Can't really say how bad that haircut was
that Michael Irvin threw a fit about a couple of weeks ago, but
after watching the Cowboys struggle through two preseason games and
a couple of scrimmages with teams that might not be able to compete
in the WAC, I'm right there with him.
</P>
<P>
   So far, this training camp has been like a four-week shave with
a dull razor. If the season doesn't start soon, somebody's liable
to bleed to death just to relieve the boredom.
</P>
<P>
   Which means, you understand, that things are right on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Folks are supposed to start getting antsy about now, which is
why the Cowboys will wrap up the Wichita Falls portion of training
camp and pick it up again at Valley Ranch after this weekend's trip
to Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   If you're less than enthused about what you've seen of your
heroes so far this summer, join the crowd. They are 0-2 in
preseason games, 1-1 in game-type scrimmages and light years away
from where first-year coach Chan Gailey hopes they'll be when they
open the season against Arizona on Sept. 6 at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   You can't miss Gailey. He's the guy with the barber's clippers
and the straight razor, trying to put a spit shine on a team that
had gotten a little ragged over the past couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to put too many pre-set standards on 'em,''
Gailey said of his expectations before yesterday afternoon's single
practice at Midwestern University. ``We had an idea of a general
area where we wanted them to be and we are in that general area.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if I put it too much up here,'' he added, holding a hand
up high, ``and we don't get there, then I go around staying mad
about it and it might not be their fault. You don't know what all
is going to happen in training camp that will slow you down or set
you back.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey was wearing the look of a man who had just dodged an
Internal Revenue Service audit after learning that defensive tackle
Leon Lett, by far his best defensive player in the front seven,
will miss only three to four weeks with a sprained knee and should
return in time for the season opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough game for tough people,'' Gailey said, but just
uttering the cliche seemed to leave his own knees a little wobbly.
</P>
<P>
   His team, Gailey understands better than anyone, must make some
giant strides over the next couple of weeks to be ready to play for
real. To get there, the Cowboys must address the head coach's three
main concerns.
</P>
<P>
   (1.) Somehow, some way, they must apply some defensive pressure
to opposing quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   (2.) The offense, still struggling with Gailey's new system,
must find some consistency.
</P>
<P>
   (3.) Someone must emerge as the No. 2 receiver to take some
pressure off Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the areas I'd say are the chief areas of concern for
me right now,'' Gailey said. ``I have a hard time categorizing what
the biggest problem is and what the least problem is, because if
it's a problem it's a problem. Whatever weak links you have, you
can be attacked there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys knew coming into camp that it would take time for
their two new starters at defensive end _ Kavika Pittman and rookie
Greg Ellis _ to develop, but they'd like to see some progress soon.
Pittman missed Tuesday night's scrimmage against the Saints in
Shreveport with an ankle sprain, and Ellis has yet to find himself
in the same area code as an opposing quarterback, much less record
a sack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly we'd like a better pass rush, but there are ways to
create pressure,'' Gailey said. ``We'll be able to get to that, I
believe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to create more consistency in the offense. I think
we've got to quit dropping the football, both catching passes and
putting it on the ground with fumbles.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey's like any coach. All he wants is perfection.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we score every time we get the ball we won't be as
consistent as I want us to be,'' Gailey said. ``But at the same
time, we've made progress. We've had good days, we've had bad days.
I would hope we could move rapidly from here on out, but we'll take
it at the pace that we need to go.''
</P>
<P>
   They're on a 24-day clock now, though, and suddenly time, like
the barber's scissors, is snip, snip, snipping away.

PERELMAN LIKELY TO GET LARGER STAKE IN SUNBEAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sunbeam Corp. said Wednesday that it had agreed to give one of
its largest shareholders, a company controlled by Ronald Perelman,
the right to increase its stake for attractive terms in exchange
for guarantees that it will not sue the troubled appliance maker.
Such a suit would have been likely to force Sunbeam into
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the agreement, Sunbeam granted the Perelman
holding company, MacAndrews &AMP; Forbes Holdings Inc., five-year
warrants to purchase 23 million Sunbeam shares at an exercise price
of $7 per share. MacAndrews &AMP; Forbes already owns 14 percent of
Sunbeam's stock, making it the second-largest shareholder behind
Franklin Mutual Advisers Inc. The new arrangement would give
MacAndrews &AMP; Forbes a 28 percent stake if it exercised the right to
buy the additional shares.
</P>
<P>
   Sunbeam says the arrangement, which would dilute the value of
current investors' shares, is good for the company because it comes
with certain key guarantees from MacAndrews &AMP; Forbes. But it is
also a way for Perelman to recoup his investment after having sold
Coleman Co. to Sunbeam in March for a large chunk of Sunbeam stock
instead of mostly cash. Had he taken cash, his investment _ then
worth about $560 million _ would not have taken a nose dive when
Sunbeam ran into serious trouble under its former chairman and
chief executive, Albert Dunlap, who has since been ousted.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the Coleman deal, shares of Sunbeam were trading
at about $40. But after several disappointing quarters, the stock
has tumbled, losing more than 80 percent of its value.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's announcement was made after the stock market had
closed for the day.
</P>
<P>
   For Perelman, ``the road to breaking even is a lot shorter
now,'' said Constance Maneaty, an analyst who follows the company
for Bear, Stearns. Perelman could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for the right to buy the additional shares,
MacAndrews &AMP; Forbes has agreed to release Sunbeam from any legal
claims arising from the Coleman purchase, in light of Sunbeam's
dismal performance, and to keep in place Perelman's hand-picked
management team. Jerry Levin, a turnaround expert associated with
Perelman who is now Sunbeam's chief executive officer, and other
key executives have signed three-year employment contracts to
continue to run the company.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, such a deal would have required a shareholder vote,
but Sunbeam appointed a special committee to approve the
transaction, saying putting it before investors would have taken
months and ``would inhibit Sunbeam's ability to reach a settlement
with MacAndrews &AMP; Forbes and to retain and hire senior management
essential to Sunbeam's business; and thus would seriously
jeopardize the financial viability of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Gittis, vice chairman of MacAndrews &AMP; Forbes, said in a
statement that the agreement was good for all investors because
``these warrants will only have value if Sunbeam shares appreciate
from current levels.''
</P>
<P>
   What is sweet about the deal that allows Perelman to buy more
stocks at $7 a share, however, is that the stock price does not
have far to go to get there. Shares of Sunbeam closed at $6.875, up
25 cents on the day.

<P>
   In the complex chain of global economic events, the malaise that
has brought pain and suffering to Asians has given American
consumers low interest rates _ a trend economists expect to
continue.
</P>
<P>
   One result is that home mortgage refinancings have hit their
highest levels in years. The average interest rate on a 30-year
mortgage, which started the year at 7.05 percent, is now 6.9

U.S. ROCKET CARRYING SPY SATELLITE EXPLODES AFTER LIFTOFF 
</HEADLINE>

 By DAVID STOUT   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An Air Force rocket carrying a spy satellite blew
up shortly after launching Wednesday, creating a $1 billion Roman
candle that showered debris and sparks across a wide swath of ocean
and dealing a setback to the country's space-reconnaissance
program.
</P>
<P>
   The Titan 4A rocket blew up about 40 seconds after its 7:30 a.m.
liftoff from Cape Canaveral, Fla., into a hazy sky.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force said the rocket's nose dipped slightly just before
the craft turned into a fireball some 20,000 feet up. Seconds
later, flight controllers triggered another explosion by radio to
break the falling debris into smaller, less dangerous chunks.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force officials said they had no idea what caused the
accident. An investigative board will be convened at once, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are sure to focus on problems that occurred during
fueling operations, when a stuck valve hampered ``topping off'' of
the rocket's upper stage with liquid hydrogen and delayed the
launching for 89 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The upper stage was meant to carry the satellite into orbit,
once the candlesticklike solid-fuel boosters on the lower stage had
burned out. The solid-fuel boosters were about half-exhausted when
he craft blew up, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   No one was injured, and there appeared to be no property damage
on land, officials said. Even so, the mood around the cape was one
of dismay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no,'' the launch announcer muttered as the Titan exploded.
``It appears that we've had a malfunction of the vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   The blast could be heard miles away and set off car alarms in
the region. Its echoes may be also felt in Pentagon planning rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite was intended to monitor air-defense radar networks
and track missile tests, according to an official intimately
familiar with the project who spoke on condition of anonymity.
While not a catastrophe, the loss dashes several years' of planning
and could delay further satellite launches.
</P>
<P>
   ``My initial thought is, `We're hurt,''' Brig. Gen. Randall
Starbuck, commander of the 45th Space Wing at Cape Canaveral, said
at a somber news conference. ``This is a sad day for the United
States Air Force.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Titan 4A rocket, largest in the Air Force's arsenal, was
carrying a Vortex-class satellite originally designed to eavesdrop
on communications like cellular telephone calls but now valuable
for pinpointing radar and missile activity, said the official
familiar with the project. Russia and post-Cold War problem regions
like Iraq and the Pakistan-India border would have been among its
surveillance targets, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite was to have been deployed for the National
Reconnaissance Office, a Pentagon agency that operates some three
dozen spy satellites. ``We are confident we can still do our job,''
said a spokesman for the agency, Rick Oborn. He declined to
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   John Pike, a missile expert at the Federation of American
Scientists in Washington, agreed with Oborn's assessment, and said
the agency already had satellites in orbit doing some of the work
that the one launched today was supposed to do.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Pike said, the accident was significant. ``Everybody's
collection and exploitation plans for next year assumed this
satellite was going to be operating by the end of the fiscal
year,'' he said. ``Well, that's not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The next Titan is to be launched from Cape Canaveral in
December, but it may be delayed. Starbuck said the Air Force would
not put up another until the cause of the accident is found. ``We
will launch no rocket before its time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pike, whose private Washington-based organization studies
technology issues, agreed that Wednesday's loss could exceed $1
billion. Reconnaissance satellites can cost $600 million to $800
million, he said. The rocket builder, Lockheed Martin, has a $16
billion contract to build about 40 rockets for the government,
meaning an average cost of $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-story Titan 4A launched Wednesday was the last of its
kind. The next generation of Titans, the 4B, has fewer parts and
thus might be less prone to malfunction, Pike said.
</P>
<P>
   The Titan that blew up Wednesday was the second to explode after
launch. The first blew up shortly after its launching from
Vandenberg Air Force Base in California in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed officials said Wednesday's failure would have no impact
on the company, because it sets aside money to cover launching
failures and is insured against launching-related personal injury
or property claims.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed's stock declined one-half a point, to 95\, in trading
Wednesday on Wall Street. The government must bear the cost of the
lost satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its ignominious end today, the Titan 4A has been a
reliable workhorse. It had only the two failures in 24 launchings _
an average that Pike said was pretty good. ``It's the cost of doing
business in space,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The unspent solid fuel is toxic, and officials cautioned people
who may find debris not to handle it.

NAZI SUSPECT SAYS HE WAS PRISONER AND UNAWARE OF ATROCITIES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jack Reimer, the former Brooklyn businessman accused
of hiding his past as a Nazi war criminal, interrupted his lawyer
at his trial on Wednesday to praise a survivor of the Treblinka
death camp who had testified earlier about escaping a mass
execution of Jewish prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   But Reimer, who maintains that he was a prisoner of war in an SS
training camp in Trawniki, Poland, testified in U.S. District Court
in Manhattan that he had been unaware of Nazi atrocities at
Treblinka or anywhere else in Poland.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was all under the strictest secrecy,'' he said. ``We
didn't know anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments came as Reimer, a 79-year-old former potato chip
salesman and restaurateur, took the witness stand to defend himself
against charges that he had been a commander in the Trawniki camp,
helped to liquidate the Jewish ghettos in Poland, and assisted in
mass executions of Jews.
</P>
<P>
   And although Reimer continued to maintain Wednesday that he had
been a captured Soviet soldier while in the camp and had never
killed anyone, his testimony included a series of assertions that
appeared likely to bolster the government's case against him.
</P>
<P>
   Reimer was asked about his role in the mass shooting of Jewish
prisoners in a pit outside the Trawniki camp _ an incident about
which he has given many conflicting accounts in recent years to
government lawyers and the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Reimer maintained that by the time he arrived at the
pit, all of the victims were dead. He said that they had been
executed by a group of SS men who had arrived earlier. He said that
he took only one shot, on orders from an SS officer, but directed
his rifle away from the victims.
</P>
<P>
   But then he acknowledged that one of the victims might have been
alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why it comes into my head that somebody moved or
pointed to his head,'' Reimer said. ``I don't know. It is
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The admission may be significant because the Justice Department
has asserted that Reimer should have been ineligible to enter the
United States under a law that, among other things, bars people if
it can be shown that they assisted in the persecution of people on
the basis of race, religion or national origin.
</P>
<P>
   Reimer, who was born in Ukraine, told investigators when he
applied to enter the United States in 1952 that he had been a
lieutenant in the Soviet Army who had been captured by the Germans
and held with other prisoners of war at Trawniki.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Reimer's testimony Wednesday focused on his time at
Trawniki, where he says that he was mainly a bookkeeper and
paymaster. He has denied the government's charges that he and other
Trawniki men participated in the mass executions there and the
liquidation of the Jewish ghettos of Warsaw, Lublin and
Czestochowa.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the day, the government closed its case with testimony
from Simon Friedman, 79, the former prisoner at Treblinka.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman, who described a day of mass executions at the death
camp in July 1944, did not identify Reimer or place him at the
scene of the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman testified that at one point, he and a group of about 20
others were ordered to lower their pants and underwear and hop
toward a grave dug by other prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   He decided to try to run through a field, and was shot in the
hand and neck. He lay there for hours, left for dead, as other
groups of prisoners were executed in the forest.
</P>
<P>
   Reimer sat impassively throughout Friedman's testimony, but
after he took the witness stand, he issued his compliment to the
Holocaust survivor. ``I have to give Mr. Friedman a lot of credit
at his age,'' Reimer said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Friedman scoffed at Reimer's assertion, saying that if he
were truly ignorant of what had occurred under the Nazis, ``he
wouldn't be sitting here.''

KIDS' FISHING VOYAGE A UNIQUE EXPERIENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They had seen it countless times before _ rabid
barracuda breaking the surface in pursuit of a meal.
</P>
<P>
   But there was an excitement in their voices rarely heard. ``Come
on, let's get 'em.'' Those who didn't know better might think these
old-timers were on their maiden fishing voyage.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense they were, for they were in the company of children,
reliving their early days on the water through the eyes of their
youthful companions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they get a lot of excitement out of us fishing,'' said
11-year-old Tabrin Gulley of Culver City, one of more than 250
predominantly disadvantaged youngsters who participated in the Los
Angeles Rod &AMP; Reel Club's recent 49th kids' trip, out of Santa
Barbara. ``It's like they're sitting in Chuck E. Cheese's; they
always want to stay a kid, they never grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the annual kids trip. It's the cornerstone of many fishing
clubs, the very reason for which some were founded. And their
purpose is appreciated far and wide in angling circles: Borrowing a
page from the baseball book's old ``knothole-gang theory,'' youths
who have only glimpsed the recreation from the outside are hosted
by experienced anglers in hopes they will support the industry and
preserve the resource when they grow up.
</P>
<P>
   The kids are underprivileged, from lower-income families, and
some have never seen the ocean, let alone been fishing or even on a
boat. Many are inner-city residents who too often turn to unsavory
diversions such as drugs and crime. For most, these trips offer
activities they could not afford. The theory is that picking up a
hobby might keep them ``off the streets.'' Or, perhaps, they might
pick up a tackle box instead of a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the overwhelming concern for the kids during these
outings are the benefits reaped by the club members themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It's a chance for the salts to ``give something back'' _ to
return a favor from long ago and expose a newcomer to the thrills
of fishing. By doing so, they promote a cherished sport and help
assure it will be as widely accepted by future generations in a
world that is becoming increasingly obsessed _ and often misguided
_ over animal rights.
</P>
<P>
   It's a form of self-preservation, and with it comes lessons in
conservation and preservation that might spawn environmental
guardians. The trips keep the volunteer mentors young. Best of all,
many say, is the sentiment they get from seeing kids have fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a good feeling deep in my heart,'' said Nick Nickson of
Simi Valley, who recently served as photographer on the Ventura
County Blue Water Sportfishing Club's inaugural kids trip, out of
Oxnard. ``This is what it's all about. Helping kids was the basis
of our whole club.''
</P>
<P>
   Simi's Richard Lapidus of the Los Angeles Rod &AMP; Reel Club echoed
the emotion on a day when young anglers all around him were
catching their very first fish: ``The immediate gratification is to
see some smiles, and there are some awfully big smiles out here
today. That makes all of us feel really, really good.''
</P>
<P>
   As children aboard the party boat Stardust reeled in dozens of
barracuda, calico bass and mackerel, Lapidus spoke to the
altruistic nature of the trips.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a kid, nobody in my family fished,'' he said. ``It
was only through the good auspices of a neighbor's father that I
got to learn the joy of going out on the ocean fishing, and I like
to just return that favor.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Gillingham of Duarte, a Glendora Rod and Reel Club board
member, stressed the importance of creating a new breed of anglers.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, in part ``for selfish reasons,'' Gillingham said, the
club escorts some 30 children to target trout and bass at Irvine
Lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know that fishing is going to last forever,'' he
explained. ``We need more new fishermen who will grow up and help
continue to provide fishing for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   To cement the experience, each young angler comes back from
Irvine Lake with a new rod and reel. Other clubs send kids home
with the fish they caught, Polaroids of their catches, trophies and
goody bags filled with terminal tackle to make the memory last.
</P>
<P>
   Club volunteers preach catch-and-release fishing, as well as
encourage angling by the rules and cleaning up trash, so that the
next visitors also can have an enjoyable adventure. There are other
lessons, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are teaching them sportsmanship. With sportsmanship, you
learn cooperation, evenhandedness, positive values,'' said North
Hollywood's Royal MacNair of the Los Angeles Rod &AMP; Reel Club.
``They are important aspects to anyone in any endeavor, and this is
just sort of a training ground, a fun training ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after a kids' trip, LARRC members begin planning for the
next. They've been doing it since 1950, when it was suggested that
members fish with underprivileged children once a year. A club
foundation was formed to raise funds, in part, club bylaws state,
``for the recreation of homeless children.'' Early on in the
program, participants were selected, ``without regard for race,
color, or creed, by Presiding Judge William B. McKesson of Juvenile
Court, with the help of county probation officers,'' according to a
November 1952 profile in Outdoor Life.
</P>
<P>
   Members of clubs have endured trials and errors of their own and
pass along to the kids only the most essential techniques to be
successful right away _ in fishing and in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want them to be part of what I have _ nature _ and to stay
away from the negative things and be involved with the positive,''
said LARRC's Michael Dinovitz of Calabasas. ``I myself was involved
with the negative things as a youngster, such as drugs, alcohol...
and all kinds of wild, crazy stuff. Then I got involved with my
father more; we got more into fishing. Now I'm a straight guy.''
</P>
<P>
   For the more grizzled club members, kids trips can be a fountain
of youth _ angling's Chuck E. Cheese's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it makes them feel like they are young again,'' said
first-time angler Celene Hampton, 14, of Inglewood, shortly after
boating a barracuda on the Stardust.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it does, Celene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought of my first time fishing, in 1940, on the Ventura
River, and remembered seeing steelhead swim up the river and
catching a little trout,'' said Thousand Oaks' Gordon Byrne,
president of the Ventura County Blue Water Sportfishing Club, after
the club's first kids trip. ``We gave kids the opportunity for the
same memories; it was absolutely awesome.'' &QL;

RABBIS STIR FUROR BY HELPING `CHAINED WOMEN' TO OBTAIN DIVORCES  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By NADINE BROZAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK_ At age 88, Rabbi Emanuel Rackman would just as soon be
spending his time writing his memoirs.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the rabbi, one of the leading figures in Orthodox Jewry
in New York, is embroiled in a bitter dispute that has pitted him
against virtually the entire spectrum of the Orthodox rabbinate.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the furor is the rabbinical court he and another
Orthodox rabbi, Moshe Morgenstern, established a year and a half
ago to help women whose husbands refuse to grant them a religious
divorce, known as a get. The court, which meets in Rackman's office
in Manhattan and Morgenstern's in Queens, grants the women
annulments instead.
</P>
<P>
   In Orthodox belief, a get is more important than a civil divorce
decree because, without one, a woman is considered to be in chains,
linked forever to her husband. Without a get, such a woman _ known
as an agunah _ remains in limbo: Though she no longer lives with
her husband, she cannot remarry within Orthodoxy, and should she do
so elsewhere, any children she may bear will be considered
illegitimate. In turn, those children cannot marry Orthodox Jews,
nor can their descendants.
</P>
<P>
   Men on the other hand, face no such consequences. They are
entitled to remarry so long as their new wives are not themselves
in need of a get, and their offspring are considered legitimate.
The justification for the discrepancy is that the Bible permitted
polygamy, but did not allow women more than one husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an extreme situation where hundreds of women are
suffering, for whom every day is a torture,'' said Rackman, whose
long career has included service as rabbi of the Fifth Avenue
Synagogue, provost of Yeshiva University and most recently,
Chancellor of Bar-Ilan University in Israel. ``So we are using an
extreme remedy: we give a get in such a way that it is not a get
but a dissolution.''
</P>
<P>
   The court, the Bet Din Tzedek Lebayot Agunot _ ``Righteous Court
for the Problems of Chained Women'' _ is made up of Rackman,
Morgenstern and a third member from a small, rotating group of
rabbis, to meet the requirement for three judges. So far, they have
ended 190 marriages _ or as they prefer to phrase it, ``freed 190
women.'' Many are from the New York area, but Morgenstern also
travels occasionally to Israel and Los Angeles, where he and two
other rabbis from the court _ sometimes by telephone _ grant
annulments.
</P>
<P>
   The court's annulments, like those in Roman Catholicism, state
that the marriage technically never existed. The children from the
annulled marriage are considered legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   With civil divorce on the rise even in the family-oriented
Orthodox community, the issue of how to deal with the end of a
marriage has taken on a new urgency in recent years. Increasing
numbers of those men, rabbis involved in such cases say, are trying
to withhold the get in exchange for reducing or eliminating support
payments or winning custody rights. But the annulments are proving
as troublesome an issue in Judaism as they are in Roman
Catholicism, where they have recently been under fire.
</P>
<P>
   Some people deem the two rabbis heroes for liberating women who
do not live in a marriage but cannot be released from it. Others,
including admirers of Rackman who fault him more in sorrow than
anger, contend that no matter how well-intentioned he may be, he is
bending immutable laws to fit contemporary cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and I always tolerated private disagreement, but for me to
take a public position has been very painful,'' said Rabbi Saul
Berman, a former student of Rackman and former senior rabbi of the
Lincoln Square Synagogue, who spoke in opposition to Rackman at the
recent annual convention of Hadassah.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is one of the most important issues before the
Jewish community,'' he said, ``and its resolution will be crucial
to the integrity of Orthodoxy.''

 NEW YORK: of Orthodoxy. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the heart of the dispute is whether annulment conforms to
Halacha, the body of law that governs Jewish life. The majority of
rabbinical authorities say that it does not, or at least, that
Rackman and Morgenstern have not produced the Talmudic or halachic
evidence that it does.
</P>
<P>
   In ancient times, it was acceptable under Jewish law to force a
reluctant husband to grant a get by boycotting his business,
ostracizing him from the community or even flogging him. In Israel,
recalcitrant husbands have been jailed, sometimes for many years.
But with such coercive methods illegal under American civil law,
Rackman said: ``We have found a loophole. If coercion is warranted
by the facts of the case and cannot be exercised because of state
law, then the only means available to help the wife get out of the
marriage is annulment.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Morgenstern, an accountant by profession, ``Every
one of the women we have freed has 20 to 30 grounds for annulment:
beatings, threats, verbal abuse, desertion, failure to support her
and her children.'' Both rabbis say there are many references to
annulment in the Talmud and in centuries of rabbinic rulings in
answer to questions raised by Jews.
</P>
<P>
   But Morgenstern does not believe that the availability of the
get ought be limited to brutality or abandonment.
</P>
<P>
   ``A woman is not a slave,'' he said. ``She is a person in her
own right. She has the right to say I loved you yesterday and if I
change my mind today, the man must let go.''
</P>
<P>
   The conflict has been intensifying since the creation of the
court. There have been public debates, and articles in the Jewish
press in New York and in Israel have produced barrages of letters
to the editor. In recent days, the coverage has become personal,
with the revelation that as a young man, Morgenstern himself had
refused to give his first wife a get for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Morgenstern, who is 67, says that experience led him to the
conclusion that ``when a woman does not want to continue a
relationship with a man, no matter how much in love they were
before, the man must let go.''
</P>
<P>
   In his case, he said his wife, who was pregnant at the time,
left him and returned to her parents after she developed colitis.
Her parents had disapproved of his uncertain prospects as a rabbi,
so he returned to school and studied accounting at Columbia
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't give the get because I always hoped that my wife
would return to me then, but to no avail,'' he said. ``In
retrospect, I am convinced I made an error and should have let her
go the minute she wanted out.''
</P>
<P>
   The opponents of the new court pretty much run the ideological
gamut of Orthodox Jewry.
</P>
<P>
   Berman, director of Edah, a group dedicated to the
revitalization of the more liberal wing known as modern Orthodoxy,
said he believed the power to annul should be allocated only to a
central court and not to every bet dinformed by three rabbis.
Instead, he advocated other means of resolution, like prenuptial
agreements with specific provisions for the get, and various forms
of community pressure on the recalcitrant husband.
</P>
<P>
   Another opponent of the new court is Rabbi Yaakov Feitman,
president of the ultra-Orthodox Young Israel Council of Rabbis.
``The overwhelming number of cases of agunot are not eligible for
any kind of annulment,'' he said, explaining that annulment was
only applicable in circumstances that involve fraud that predated
the marriage, such as a disease that was concealed from the bride.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hearts go out to agunot, but freeing them improperly only
transfers them to a worse prison,'' Feitman said. ``The
overwhelming number of rabbis around the world will not marry women
with those annulments and even worse, if they remarry without
rabbinic sanction, they will have children who will be declared
children of incest or adultery. That is a tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the chief criticisms, even among the rabbis' staunchest
supporters, is that they failed to produce evidence that the
annulments issued by their court fully conform to Jewish law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sources are there and anyone with a will to find them can,
but they did not circulate their halachic material,'' said Blu
Greenberg, an author and teacher who has written extensively on
feminism and Judaism. ``When you do something that is as unique a
departure as this, you must line up your ducks first.''
</P>
<P>
   But she emphasized, ``If this bet din succeeds, as I hope it
will, then it will be Halacha responding to a contemporary need.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgenstern countered the criticism by citing various scholarly
references to annulment and said: ``I can cite chapter and verse of
evidence and I write a legal brief for every case we adjudicate.
Anyone who wants to see my evidence is welcome to come and see
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Several women who have had their marriages annulled by the
Rackman-Morgenstern court said they had no doubts about the
validity of the procedure, nor do they fear problems should they
want to marry again.
</P>
<P>
   One woman from Long Island, who like others interviewed declined
to be identified for fear of retribution from their husbands, said:
``They helped me when I needed it, they made me feel there was a
way out. We had been married 20 years and he was using the get as a
monetary leverage. When Columbus said the world was round, everyone
said he was nuts. He proved everyone wrong and they will too.''
</P>
<P>
   A woman from New Jersey, who sought a divorce from her husband
of two and a half years because he became violent, said: ``I went
to all the rabbis I knew, and they said to me, `Isn't it worth your
giving him some money to be free?' I said, `No, I am not buying a
get.' I don't think God wants a woman to suffer just because she
didn't meet a good partner. If a man can't fulfill his duty, I
believe the marriage contract is void and my conscience is clear.''

SEC FILES SUIT AGAINST COMPANIES ALLEGING FRAUD WITH ONLINE CASINO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Federal officials have rolled out their sequel to
``Risky Business,'' suing Los Angeles-based companies they claim
operated a fraudulent investment scheme via the Internet that cost
investors $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint filed Wednesday by the Securities and Exchange
Commission in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles seeks to halt the
operations of Internet Casino Sports Gaming LLC and Internet Casino
Sports Gaming Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Also named were the companies' principals, Robert Matias, also
know as Robert DuVall, 35, and Alan Lenchner, also known as Alan
Lane, 62, both of Los Angeles, federal officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents have frozen corporate and individual assets, and
seized about $250,000 in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The government alleges that the men used money to be invested in
an online casino to pay salaries to family members and support a
lavish lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   The action is part of a nationwide sweep of allegedly bogus
entertainment-related schemes 40 states that cost unwary investors
more than $100million.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Casino's phones were still working Wednesday but
neither of the principals could be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Their attorney, Steven B. LeHat of Irvine, Calif., said he did
not want to discuss the issue at length.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite obviously their take on their operation is something
that under the circumstances would not be the subject of a news
report until we see what's coming down here,'' he said. ``We have
not seen any claims the federal government has made so we are
talking in a vacuum.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal lawsuit is a civil action and claims that from April
1997 to the present the two men and their companies raised about $2
million by selling shares to 152 investors nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   But only about 10 percent of the money was used for the
development and licensing of the Web site, said Lisa A. Gok,
assistant regional director in the SEC's office of enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The balance was used to fund a boiler room from which the
businesses were pitched, the paying of salaries for Matias' father-
and mother-in-law and Lenchner's daughter, and automobile
allowances, including a 1998 Mercedes-Benz sport-utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Gok said the men used the Internet to solicit potential
investors, who then sent their money to a mail drop in Studio City,
a Los Angeles suburb.
</P>
<P>
   She cautioned investors to read the SEC's Cyberspace Alert
before sending money to any business being promoted via the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   It is also available via the investor assistance and complaints
links on the SEC Web site at www.sec.gov. &QL;

ADVERTISING: KPMG AIMS TO STAND APART 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a firm sells business advice, it may be difficult to
imagine anyone remembering its advertising slogan or considering
its logo hip enough to wear as a fashion statement.
</P>
<P>
   And KPMG Peat Marwick LLP is certainly not expecting its image
to become as widely recognizable as McDonald's arches or its logo
as popular the Nike swoosh. But the accounting, tax and consulting
firm has, nonetheless, created a brand campaign intended to set the
firm apart in an industry in which potential clients often view
competing firms as largely one and the same.
</P>
<P>
   The new campaign comes after a proposed merger with Ernst &AMP;
Young, which last week consolidated its own ad accounts, fell
apart. The two firms planned to unite to create the world's largest
accounting and consulting firm, but abandoned the idea in February
because of growing opposition by foreign antitrust regulators.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the firms said the merger was critical to their
business and long-term survival. Now, KPMG wants to reinforce its
strengths in the minds of would-be clients.
</P>
<P>
   Using the tag line ``It's time for clarity,'' the ads are meant
to convey an ability to deliver the attributes clients say they
want from professional firms mired in the complexities of the
information age _ understandable business advice and practical
solutions that can be easily carried out quickly and efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   One television commercial shows prim grandmothers doling out
such advice as ``Always make sure you conduct a mass utilization
model before crossing the street.'' A print ad shows a weathered
mailbox and says: ``Remember what it was like before there was
overnight mail, voice mail and e-mail? You actually had time to
think.'' Both the spot and ad include the ``clarity'' tag line.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, which will include print, broadcast and billboard
advertising, was created by Lowe &AMP; Partners/SMS, in New York, part
of the Lowe Group unit of Interpublic Group of Cos. It represents
the initial phase of a $60 million worldwide branding effort for
KPMG, which operates in 155 countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our marketing strategy is to deploy a brand advertising
campaign that will significantly increase prospect and client
awareness for KPMG, help us create a place at the table when there
is business to be won _ and help our partners and professionals win
more of that business,'' said Tim Pearson, chief marketing officer
for the company. ``This is advertising that helps articulate KPMG's
strategy and captures who we are.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, which began late last month and is being expanded
domestically this month and internationally in the fall, includes
commercials on CBS' ``60 Minutes'' and ABC's ``Nightline.'' This
month, KPMG will expand the television advertising to such channels
as CNN, the Discovery Channel, MSNBC, the Learning Channel and
CNBC.
</P>
<P>
   The company will also run commercials during golf and tennis
tournaments and NCAA football bowl games. Print advertising will
appear in business newspapers and magazines and special interest
publications. The campaign will also include advertising on
billboards at major airports.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the brand message, a separate national print and
broadcast campaign will emphasize KPMG's services.
</P>
<P>
   One print ad promoting the firm's consulting business shows a
tricycle sitting in the grass. It includes this message: ``It's so
rewarding to watch a youngster fail over and over only to learn
from his mistakes. Just not when it's a consultant who's charging
you $275 an hour. Our consultants average 13.5 years of experience.
We figure you pay them for their business insight, not their
business education.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads will bear a modified KPMG logo since the firm expects to
adopt the shortened KPMG name by the end of this year to support a
consistent and recognizable global identity. In both the brand and
services campaign, the spots use humor and plain speaking to talk
to an audience that is business smart but has little tolerance for
insider lingo that can get lost on even the most seasoned
executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clarity also works because corporate leaders, the influentials
we're reaching, are charged with bringing clarity to their
shareholders and employees and they are frustrated with the level
of clutter, chatter and `white noise' in the current environment,''
Pearson said.

   Last chance &QL; 
for a major &QL; 
to remember
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
REDMOND, Wash. _ So we're down to one, the final major, albeit the
one they call the minor major.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. The PGA Championship, No. 80 in a series, can still
save the day _ I mean the year. Mark O'Meara's year.
</P>
<P>
   With all due respect to O'Meara, who happens to be a really nice
guy, a rock-solid family man and, in his own words, ``a very good
golfer, not a great one,'' any year that bears his stamp isn't a
year you're likely to remember for very long.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I've almost forgotten it already.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Janzen winning the U.S. Open most assuredly didn't help
much, either, although we must pump Janzen's hand for at least
preventing O'Meara from daring to think Grand Slam at Sahalee
Country Club this weekend. That would have been too much. As it is,
O'Meara is still attempting a Ben Hogan, the three-fourths Slam.
</P>
<P>
   This lumpy, average Joe of a fellow _ he could pass for a
sportswriter _ was once a National Amateur champion, but he had
trundled through 56 majors without sniffing victory before he
claimed the elusive prize at the Masters. There, almost out of
nowhere, he snuck past both a contemporary who had come to
overshadow him, Fred Couples, and a hot young lion in David Duval
to steal the show from a certain beloved old Bear.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, O'Meara was at it again, beating the field
and the wrath-of-God elements at Royal Birkdale. Tiger Woods should
have been the British Open champion. He was actually tied for the
lead after a spectacular finish on the last two holes. But no. It
would be O'Meara, suddenly a major master, who added the Old Claret
Jug to his new green jacket.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, my.
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't golf now supposed to be child's play? Hadn't the brat
pack pretty much laid siege to the tour in 1997? And the one place
the twentysomethings didn't kick butt, somewhere under a rainbow at
the PGA, Davis Love III did.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger's record romp through the '97 Masters seemingly announced
his candidacy for immortality. Ernie Els and Justin Leonard
followed suit, providing a sneak preview of the
Palmer-Nicklaus-Player troika for the next century. Until Duval
reeled off three straight victories at the close of the season to
give us a new Fab Four of the fairways heading toward the
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that was just kid stuff compared to seeing Love hurdle his
personal hump at the PGA, the workingman's major. Davis' father,
who died in a plane crash, was a much-loved teaching pro. Anyone
who knew of the dad's affection for the son _ and vice versa _ also
knew exactly who was responsible for that rainbow in the sky above
Winged Foot as Love conquered all.
</P>
<P>
   This year? Blah. For all the drama provided by the Masters and
the two Opens, and indeed the Sunday scripts have been
scintillating stuff at each venue, the wrong blokes keep turning up
on top.
</P>
<P>
   Face it: The stars make the tournament. U.S. Open TV ratings at
Olympic were down 18 points from '97, in no small part because
people didn't tune in by the jillions to see how Tiger was doing.
It has been awhile since his mere presence at an event made him a
safe bet to cash the first-place check.
</P>
<P>
   The Chosen One has exactly that many wins _ one _ to his name in
'98, which ties him with, among many others, Trevor Dodds. Who?
That's my point.
</P>
<P>
   But the PGA offers grand possibilities. Hope springs eternal, El
Nio or no El Nio. We can escape these doldrums, although it will
take a Tiger or a John Daly or a Couples or a Tom Watson to make it
happen.
</P>
<P>
   Daly, of course, invented himself at Crooked Stick's PGA, while
Couples, who came so close to claiming a second Masters, is a
Seattle homeboy. Watson, pushing 49, proved at Colonial he still
may have one last major in his yippy grip. Fact: Julius Boros was
only a couple months younger than Watson when he prevailed in the
PGA 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Stuart Appleby.
</P>
<P>
   His is the saddest imaginable story. Appleby decided to play
Sahalee less than three weeks after his wife, Renay _ who also was
his caddie _ was killed in a flukish accident in London. A taxi
backed into her, crushing her.
</P>
<P>
   Why did he come? It's either play golf, he figured, or go into a
shell from which he might never escape. Confronting the horrific
tragedy head-on, he conducted a half-hour news conference, telling
reporters to ask him anything they wanted. He got through it but
not without a lot of tears.
</P>
<P>
   If the compassion of one's peers counts for anything, Appleby is
the overwhelming PGA favorite. Also, oddly, he makes his home in
Isleworth, the gated enclave near Orlando where O'Meara and Janzen
live.
</P>
<P>
   Golf could use another rainbow.

SWISS BANKS AGREE TO PAY HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS $1.25 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: ADDS details on settlement, banks, background, and quotes
throughout; Adds dateline.) 
 (nk) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Representatives of Swiss banks and Holocaust
survivors announced a settlement Wednesday in which the banks
agreed to pay $1.25 billion in reparations to victims of the Nazi
era.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, intended to settle the claims of tens of
thousands of survivors whose families lost assets in World War II,
was hailed by Jewish groups and elected officials as providing
long-delayed justice for the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am tremendously pleased and gratified to announce that we've
reached a historic agreement,'' said Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.,
who led the move to pressure the Swiss banks into providing money
for a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was announced in front of U.S. District Court in
Brooklyn, where three suits filed over the last two years had been
consolidated into one class-action suit. The suits had accused the
banks of retaining the assets of Holocaust victims, assets that the
plaintiffs' lawyers said had been deposited in the banks by the
victims or that had been looted by the Nazis and stored in Swiss
banks.
</P>
<P>
   The litigation had been part of a growing effort to force the
banks to scour their records to identify dormant accounts and the
proceeds of Nazi plunder and to pressure them to return the assets
to the elderly and frail victims and their heirs.
</P>
<P>
   Among the banks are Union Bank of Switzerland and Credit Suisse,
said Marc Cohen, a lawyer for the banks.
</P>
<P>
   The effort galvanized many of the victims and stirred bitterness
in Switzerland. But animosity was replaced by expressions of good
will Wednesday, as D'Amato spoke before a battery of microphones
and cameras in downtown Brooklyn. The lawyers and representatives
of the two sides were joined by two people who added a moving touch
to the discussions of litigation and vast amounts of money to right
historical injustices.
</P>
<P>
   One was Estelle Sapir, 73, a concentration camp victim who is
among the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy,'' Ms. Sapir said in a barely audible voice.
``I think this should have happened long ago. People need the
money. They're getting very old, and this is not charity.''
</P>
<P>
   The second person was Christoph Meili, 30, a former night
watchman at a Swiss bank who was fired and subjected to death
threats and police interrogation in Switzerland for saving
Holocaust-era bank documents from a shredder. Meili is now living
in New Jersey and working as a guard at an office building in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great day,'' he said. ``We move a big step forward. I'm
happy. I'm glad to help the survivors.''
</P>
<P>
   The banks issued a statement saying: ``This development
represents a major milestone in our longstanding efforts to insure
that justice is served.''
</P>
<P>
   Many details of how to pay the money and who would qualify
remain to be worked out. The payments are to be made in four
installments over three years, with the first installment of $250
million not likely for nine months to a year because of the work
needed to implement the deal, according to lawyers for both side.
The work includes devising a plan to distribute the money to
victims with claims against the Swiss banks who live in the United
States and abroad, they said.
</P>
<P>
   A number of states and cities, including New York City and New
York state, had threatened to impose sanctions on the Swiss banks
if they did not agree to an acceptable settlement. The threat had
outraged the Swiss government, and the sanctions were also opposed
by the U.S. government, which feared that the threats could
complicate efforts at a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat said in a statement
Wednesday night that the accord ``represents a major step'' in
achieving justice for Holocaust survivors and strengthening
American-Swiss relations.
</P>
<P>
   One condition of the settlement, Eizenstat said in an interview,
was that the plaintiffs publicly call for all elected officials to
drop their threat of sanctions against the Swiss.
</P>
<P>
   The call for sanctions intensified after a settlement agreement
fell apart in June. In subsequent weeks, officials in New York
City, New York state and California said they would impose
sanctions on Sept. 1 against Swiss financial interests.
</P>
<P>
   Another condition of the agreement is that the plaintiffs drop a
separate suit against the Swiss National Bank, which along with the
Swiss government had refused to negotiate with the plaintiffs, and
indemnify the bank and all other Swiss companies against further
monetary claims by the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat said the National Bank's role in processing gold that
it knew had been looted was not in contention, but that essentially
taking the bank out of the case was a necessary condition to reach
a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to make the perfect the enemy of the good,'' he
said. ``I think additional monetary claims by the U.S. government
and by the private sector will not likely be forthcoming.''
</P>
<P>
   He said neither the Swiss government nor the Swiss National Bank
were contributing to the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The roots of the pact began decades ago, when thousands of Jews
deposited their money in Swiss banks for safekeeping in the face of
persecution in Germany.

REGENTS DEMAND REVIEW OF CUNY'S REMEDIAL PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The City University of New York and the New York
state Department of Education are battling over whether CUNY needs
the approval of the Board of Regents before it can enact a
far-reaching plan to bar students needing remedial help from its 11
senior colleges.
</P>
<P>
   The Education Department and the Regents maintain that they have
both the right and the responsibility to review any changes that
affect admissions policies at the state's public universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are obligated by statute to review the plan, and it is our
intention to do so with as much haste as good sense would permit,''
Carl Hayden, chancellor of the Board of Regents, said in an
interview Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But in a letter to the Education Department this week, CUNY's
chairwoman, Anne Paolucci, and its interim chancellor, Christoph
Kimmich, called the proposed review ``an unnecessary and
inappropriate incursion into the right of the Board of Trustees to
operate the City University of New York as set forth in the
education law in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   CUNY intends to enact the tougher standards at four colleges _
Hunter, Queens, Baruch and Brooklyn _ in September 1999. But a
state review could push back that date, because Education
Department officials have told CUNY that such a review is likely to
include public hearings and could take six to seven months.
</P>
<P>
   State officials promised Wednesday to hasten their review,
perhaps by scrutinizing preliminary versions of the plan before it
is formally proposed. But the possibility that the plan could be
delayed or even rejected leaves CUNY unable, in admissions
documents it is preparing now, to tell students applying to Hunter,
Queens, Baruch and Brooklyn Colleges what their admissions policies
will be.
</P>
<P>
   It is also too early to predict how the Regents would vote on
CUNY's policy. Several said Wednesday that they wanted more
information about its potential impact before they made a decision.
Some, like chancellor Hayden, have applauded CUNY's efforts to
toughen its standards. But some have also expressed concerns about
whether students who are turned away from the senior colleges would
be adequately served elsewhere, including at CUNY's community
colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there should be stricter entrance requirements,''
said Saul Cohen, a regent and the former president of Queens
College. ``But you should never use a sledgehammer if you can use a
scalpel,'' he said, indicating that he would have preferred a more
moderate policy that allowed students who needed limited remedial
work to enroll at the senior colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, ``a board has a right to make policy, and our
job is to see if the sky will fall in.''
</P>
<P>
   Education Department officials say that most policies that come
under review _ about 25 a year _ are approved, and that plans to
review the CUNY proposal do not necessarily suggest any opposition
to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When an institution changes or alters its mission in any
substantive ways, it is required to get prior approval from the
board of regents,'' said Gerald Patton, the deputy commissioner for
higher education, who is coordinating the planned review. ``We are
not doing this because we want to do this, but because we are
required to.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The state first notified CUNY in June that it wanted to
scrutinize the remedial policy. But CUNY officials did not become
concerned about the process until last month, when state officials
laid out a long list of questions they would be asking and said
that CUNY's formal plan would have to be submitted by Oct. 1 for
the Regents to make a decision by next April.
</P>
<P>
   CUNY officials told the department that they probably would not
be able to submit a detailed plan until December. Officials at
CUNY's campuses have until next month to submit their own proposals
to the chancellor's office, which will then develop a master plan.
That plan must then be reviewed by the CUNY board.
</P>
<P>
   Education Department officials had told CUNY that if the master
plan could not be submitted before December, CUNY should not seek
to adopt it until September 2000, since it would be difficult for
the regents to make a decision quickly enough for the policy to be
enacted next year.
</P>
<P>
   A delay would give at least a temporary reprieve to students who
might have been turned away from Hunter, Queens, Baruch and
Brooklyn Colleges next year if they could not pass all three of
CUNY's placement exams in reading, writing and mathematics. More
than a third of Baruch's entering freshmen and roughly half of
those at the other three colleges failed one or more of the exams
when then entered last fall.

TESTAVERDE COULD START FOR JETS AGAINST BALTIMORE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ The Jets' putative quarterback controversy
continued brewing Wednesday with the belief that 37-year-old Vinny
Testaverde, acquired in the off-season ostensibly as a backup, will
very likely start against his former team, the Baltimore Ravens,
Saturday night at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   When training camp began, coach Bill Parcells indicated that
Glenn Foley, a fifth-year pro, would replace Neil O'Donnell as the
starter. Foley was decent if not spectacular as the starter in last
Thursday night's 29-15 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Parcells said there was ``a pretty good chance'' he
would start Testaverde in the second preseason game. Before
Wednesday afternoon's practice, Parcells discussed his quarterback
plans with his coaches, but not with the quarterbacks, and he would
not disclose his decision. The starting quarterback usually takes
the most snaps in practice, but Wednesday afternoon Foley and
Testaverde split the work evenly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing has changed,'' Parcells said when asked whether
Testaverde has closed the gap on Foley. ``I'm not trying to be a
jerk. I'm not doing it to stir the pot. I look at different things
with different people.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to illustrate his point, Parcells said this week's
starters would probably include Marcus Coleman instead of Otis
Smith at cornerback, Jerald Sowell instead of Keith Byars at
fullback and a healthier Curtis Martin instead of Richie Anderson
at tailback. But quarterback is the position that attracts the most
attention on most teams, and the Jets' first two quarterbacks are
talking party line. They are saying nothing incendiary, nothing
even remotely argumentative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident in my ability to play quarterback, for this or
any team,'' Testaverde said. ``I tell myself I'm not going to try
to figure coach Parcells out. He may want to start me because we're
playing my old team, or it could be a hundred other reasons. I
don't look at it too much. I prepare myself as if I'm the starter.
It's a long season. A lot of people get to play.''
</P>
<P>
   And Foley said: ``I never looked at it as my job. I looked at it
as an open competition, and I'm for that. I have to understand that
everything I do, everything on the practice field, I have to be
perfect. There's always been controversy and competition. I don't
think it's that big an issue. If I do well, I should play. If I
don't, Vinny should play.''
</P>
<P>
   When Parcells was coaching the Giants, he had quarterback
controversies involving Phil Simms and Jeff Hostetler, both of whom
would win Super Bowls for him. He made light of the situation here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I already think I know what I'm going to do,'' he said. ``It's
just a question of how we're going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   A likely option is to start Testaverde on Saturday, follow him
with last year's third-stringer, Chuck Clements, and finish with
Foley. That would allow Parcells to see Testaverde with the first
offensive line and possibly allow Foley to run a game-ending
two-minute drill, something the coach also wants to see.
</P>
<P>
   But questions remain. Is Parcells dissatisfied with Foley so
far? Is he trying to egg Foley on? Can Testaverde wrestle away the
starting job? Parcells did not say.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of camp,'' Parcells said, ``I said Glenn is
going to get the benefit of the doubt. If it's obvious Vinny is
playing better, I've got to go by what I see, not just at
quarterback, but at any position, just not this year, but any
year.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer of who will start at quarterback Saturday may not be
known until Friday's walk-through practice. No one seemed overly
concerned. When Keyshawn Johnson, the wide receiver, was asked if
the team was talking about the quarterback situation, he shook his
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is talking about it,'' he told reporters. ``Just you.''

BOEING TO SHIFT SOME JET OUTPUT TO LONG BEACH IN '99 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aiming to ease the strain on one of its most troubled production
lines in Seattle, the Boeing company plans to announce Thursday
that it will begin building some of its single-aisle 737 jets in
Long Beach, Calif., beginning next year.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, which has been highly anticipated for months, is
good news for workers at the former McDonnell Douglas operations in
California, who have seen three of the four airplanes currently
built there canceled by Boeing since it bought McDonnell Douglas
last year for $16.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing executives and union officials acknowledged that the
move would only restore about 600 jobs, a fraction of the number
that will be lost when production on the discontinued Douglas jets
stops in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is expected to say that it will start building three of
the best-selling 737's a month in Long Beach starting in the second
half of next year, possibly rising to as many as five a month after
that, said executives who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement is part of changes to an overall consolidation
plan that Boeing first announced in March.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also expected to say that it will transfer some
of its satellite operations to California and will make St. Louis
the headquarters of all future production of fighter planes.
</P>
<P>
   Neither move will result in the transfer of many jobs. But the
St. Louis decision could be significant if Boeing wins the
competition to produce the Pentagon's new Joint Strike Fighter.
</P>
<P>
   The company has said that it expects to eliminate between 18,000
and 28,000 of its 238,000 jobs by 2000 but Thursday's announcement
is not expected to provide more details on how those targets will
be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officials declined to comment. The move was reported
Wednesday by The Seattle Times.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The 737 move has been opposed by the International Association
of Machinists, who represent 39,000 hourly Boeing workers in the
Puget Sound area. Though Boeing now has more orders for the 737
than it can handle and has paid heavy penalties to airlines for
missing delivery dates, workers fear that they will lose their jobs
if orders dry up in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The machinists' contract is set to expire next year, and Boeing
is eager to avoid a strike like the one it suffered in 1995. The
situation is complicated by the fact that the machinists' union and
the United Automobile Workers union, which represents 7,600 hourly
workers at Long Beach and is just as eager to get the new work as
the machinists are worried about losing it, are set to merge in the
next few years.

BRITISH TELECOM TO BUY MCI'S STAKE IN JOINT VENTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pulling one of the final threads from its tattered relationship
with MCI Communications Corp., British Telecommunications PLC
announced an agreement Wednesday to acquire MCI's 24.9 percent
stake in the companies' international joint venture for $1 billion
in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's deal was the denouement in a five-year relationship
that began with high hopes for a global telecommunications
partnership, blossomed into plans for a merger and then fell apart
amid a fight over money.
</P>
<P>
   With British Telecom's agreement to buy the stake in Concert, as
the venture is known, the British communications giant will be free
to move forward with plans to form a $10 billion joint venture with
MCI's rival, AT&AMP;T Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Neither MCI nor British Telecom would make any executives
available Wednesday to discuss the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Concert, which British Telecom formed in 1994, is meant to be a
vehicle for serving the global communications needs of
multinational corporations. With service in 52 nations, Concert
tries to allow its customers to use a seamless network that
functions identically in New York or New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   After buying MCI's portion of Concert, British Telecom will own
the entire venture. The British company expects Concert to generate
about $1 billion in revenue and to become profitable this year.
Financial analysts are unlikely to balk at the implicit value of $4
billion that Wednesday's deal placed on the operation.
</P>
<P>
   British Telecom's American depository receipts, which trade on
the New York Stock Exchange, rose $2 Wednesday, to $133.375. MCI
rose $1.625, to $61.75, on Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   MCI, the No. 2 long-distance carrier in the United States, began
its dealings with British Telecom in 1993, when BT bought 20
percent of the U.S. company for $4.3 billion. The companies formed
Concert the next year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, they announced that British Telecom had agreed to
acquire the 80 percent of MCI it did not already own for $24
billion, forming a trans-Atlantic communications giant called
Concert PLC.
</P>
<P>
   But the relationship soured last summer. Both companies'
shareholders had already approved the deal and the companies were
seeking regulatory approvals when MCI said in July that it could
lose as much as $800 million in its nascent local phone operation.
</P>
<P>
   British Telecom reacted to the announcement by essentially
forcing MCI to accept a $5 billion reduction in the value of their
deal, making it worth $19 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That opened the door for other communications carriers to bid
for MCI, which was not entirely pleased with the latest turn in its
relationship with British Telecom.
</P>
<P>
   Worldcom Inc., led by Bernard Ebbers, offered $30 billion in
stock for all of MCI early last October. Two weeks later, GTE
jumped into the competition with a $28 billion cash bid.
</P>
<P>
   British Telecom did not make a serious attempt to hold on to
MCI. After a flurry of negotiations among MCI, Worldcom and GTE,
MCI agreed to be acquired by Worldcom for $37 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   That deal will probably be completed in the next month. For its
20 percent stake in MCI, British Telecom will receive $7 billion in
cash. As for Concert, AT&AMP;T will become British Telecom's main
partner as soon as the British company finishes buying out MCI.

JONES KEEPS IT SIMPLE: RUN FAST, JUMP FAR, WIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Morocco, Denmark, Kenya)  (lb) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZURICH, Switzerland _ Marion Jones has designs on five gold
medals at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, and she
has yet to lose an event this season: not a sprint, not the long
jump, not even the one 400-meter race she ran in April.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night at the Weltklasse, the best known and best
funded of the six stops on track's Golden League circuit, she
started by winning the women's 100 into a slight headwind in 10.77
seconds. That was a bit of a disappointment because she had hoped
to break 10.7 seconds for the first time. She concluded by winning
the long jump with a leap of 23 feet 11} inches, which was a
delight because it matched her personal best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to run faster and jump farther than I have
before,'' said Jones, 22. ``It's not as complicated as you might
think. Obviously world records are in the back of my mind, and you
are always reminding me, even if they're not.''
</P>
<P>
   World records have long been synonymous with Zurich. Since 1959,
23 have been matched or bettered in this meet _ last year, three
were broken in a single, extraordinary evening. But there would be
no such number-crunching on Wednesday night, only nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   This was the 10th anniversary of the men's 400 record of 43.29
seconds set here by the American Butch Reynolds. Despite the
considerable efforts of Michael Johnson, the record still stands.
Reynolds was here Wednesday night to watch Johnson make another
unsuccessful run at it, although his time of 43.68 seconds was his
best since his 1996 Olympic season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's coming together,'' Johnson said. ``But it's not my
objective to be in the same shape as 1996. I just want to win
races.''
</P>
<P>
   Donovan Bailey of Canada, the world record-holder at 100 meters,
is not expected to race for the next three to four weeks after
pulling up midway through the 100-meter final with a strained thigh
muscle. With Bailey out and with Ato Boldon and Maurice Greene
training in Los Angeles because Zurich officials would not meet
their financial demands, the winner in the 100 was Seun Ogunkoya of
Nigeria in 9.96 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The best performance of the night came from Hicham el-Guerrouj,
the Moroccan world record-holder in the 1,500, and as he turned the
final corner, he was on pace to break his own mark of three minutes
26 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   But the wall of sound that greeted el-Guerrouj as he pushed
toward the finish could not quite help him break through the
barrier he had created in Rome last month. Instead, he would have
to settle for the second-fastest 1,500 meters in history: 3:26.45.
</P>
<P>
   And though el-Guerrouj missed the $50,000 bonus that is reserved
for those who break world records in a Golden League event, he is
still in the running for a larger payday. Those athletes who win
their events in all six of the Golden League events and the Grand
Prix/Golden League final will split $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   El-Guerrouj has now won the first four legs.
</P>
<P>
   So has Jones. So has the American Bryan Bronson, the winner of
the men's 400 hurdles in 47.70 seconds, and Haile Gebrselassie, the
Ethiopian who fell short of his world record in the men's 5,000,
but still managed to win handily in 12:54.08.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``It's too difficult to win so many competitions,'' Gebrselassie
said. ``I'm struggling, and there are three more stages to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones sounded more upbeat and much less weary. ``I don't have a
problem with it,'' she said of the new format. ``Obviously when
you're running fast and going fast, everything is hunky-dory.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything wasn't for Wilson Kipketer of Denmark, whose streak
of 28 victories at 800 meters came to an end.
</P>
<P>
   Japheth Kimutai, a 19-year-old who like Kipketer was born in
Kenya, is the world junior record-holder and the fastest man over
800 meters this season. And he was the better man Wednesday night
in 1:42.87. Kipketer finished second in 1:43.18, more than two
seconds off the world record he set here last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all the problems I had, I'm not surprised that I lost,''
said Kipketer, who contracted malaria in January and who missed
months of training and all of the early season. ``The other boys
are far ahead in training.''

WOMAN'S SILENCE POSTPONES EX-HUSBAND'S DEPORTATION HEARING 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ A deportation hearing for a man whom the FBI, in
secret documents, has linked to the terrorists who bombed New
York's World Trade Center was abruptly adjourned Wednesday when the
man's ex-wife refused to disclose what she had told federal agents
about him.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Hany Kiareldeen, a 30-year-old Palestinian, has been
detained for five months while the Immigration and Naturalization
Service has been trying to deport him. He had been waiting to have
his lawyers question his ex-wife, Amal Mohamed, about the secret
information, but the hearing stopped Wednesday, in its second day,
when Ms. Mohamed refused to answer some questions.
</P>
<P>
   Kiareldeen's lawyers said they planned to go to U.S. District
Court here to seek an order compelling her to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Shulman, one of Kiareldeen's lawyers, contends that the
terrorism charges against his client were the creation of Ms.
Mohamed, who he said has a history of vindictiveness toward her
ex-husband.
</P>
<P>
   In questioning by Shulman, Ms. Mohamed, a native of Egypt, said
she had met with FBI investigators at some point to ``confirm some
answers they had'' about Kiareldeen. But when asked for details,
Ms. Mohamed, who herself faces deportation proceedings later this
month, refused, saying that she had been threatened and that she
was concerned for her safety and the safety of her three children.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Earlier in the hearing, a lawyer for the INS, Leo Weber,
expressed concern about opening portions of the hearing, saying
that one of the unnamed informers who provided the secret
information had received death threats. An open hearing, he said,
could jeopardize the informer's anonymity and safety.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal rules governing the Executive Office of
Immigration Review, the office's 200 administrative law judges
cannot compel witnesses to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Daniel Meisner, after failing to persuade Ms. Mohamed to
answer Shulman's questions, concluded that Kiareldeen's lawyers
would have to seek an order from a federal judge to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   He adjourned the hearings until Sept. 18. In the process, he
left several witnesses who had gone to the federal building here to
testify for Kiareldeen sitting in an adjacent room.
</P>
<P>
   The developments highlighted the problem for immigrants who face
deportation partly because of classified information. Kiareldeen is
one of 30 Arab-Americans who are the subjects of secret FBI
information suggesting that they are terrorists. When such
allegations become part of a deportation proceeding, as they have
in his case, investigators are required to provide only general
summaries of them and do not have to divulge the details or the
source of the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Kiareldeen, a manager of an electronics store in Passaic, N.J.,
who has been in the United States since 1990, was picked up by
immigration officials and FBI agents in March for overstaying his
student visa _ a violation of immigration law not normally grounds
for automatic deportation.
</P>
<P>
   The following month, his lawyers learned from summaries of FBI
documents that informers had charged that Kiareldeen had met at his
home in Nutley, N.J., with Nidal A. Ayyad just a week before the
bombing of the World Trade Center on Feb. 26, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Ayyad was one of four defendants convicted in March 1994 in the
attack. The secret informers also alleged, according to the
summary, that Kiareldeen had threatened the life of Attorney
General Janet Reno.

GIULIANI TO STUMP FOR GOP AROUND U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., Iowa, N.H., Conn., S.C., Calif., R.I., Ariz., Fla.,
La.)   (bl)  
 By DAN BARRY    c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani will travel to several
states in the next few weeks to present himself as a Republican
visionary whose ideas about governance and politics have national
applicability. But those visits will not be limited to the exchange
of ideas; he will also be raising money for various Republican
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani is tentatively scheduled to attend a fund-raising event
for the Wisconsin Republican Party in Milwaukee on Aug. 25. The
next day, he will swing through Iowa, stopping to help raise money
for Rep. James Leach, the chairman of the House Banking and
Financial Services Committee, deliver a speech to a group of law
enforcement officials, and attend a fund-raising event for Jim Ross
Lightfoot, Iowa's Republican candidate for governor.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, Giuliani is to travel to South Carolina for a
``Victory '98'' dinner being held by the Republican State
Committee. In mid-October, he will make several appearances in New
Hampshire, including one before the Nashua Federated Republican
Women's Club.
</P>
<P>
   And his aides are working out details for possible visits to
other states, including California and Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primary figure
prominently in presidential races. But aides to the mayor were
quick to say that his visits to those states did not suggest any
presidential ambition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of the trips is to tell people the story of the
successes in New York City and to help influence the Republican
Party to accept his views on economic and social issues,'' said
John Gross, the mayor's longtime campaign treasurer. ``It is also
to try to help those candidates who share the same values that he
does.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Keith Fortmann, the executive director of the
Republican Central Committee of Iowa, said visits by prominent
out-of-state politicians always carry that undercurrent of
ambition. ``I know the assumption is that if someone is coming to
Iowa, it automatically means he's running for president,'' he said,
adding, ``I'm looking forward to seeing what Rudy says, like
everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   The trips will mark the first out-of-state political visits that
the mayor has made since addressing a gathering of Republican
National Committee members in New York City last month, during
which he maintained that the party's future success depended on its
ability to be more inclusive. It was an appeal that many read to be
as much personal as ideological. Giuliani, who is interested in
higher office, favors abortion rights and is for gay rights and gun
control _ positions that are anathema to the party's strong
conservative segment.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's new-found beneficence on behalf of the Republican
Party has not been limited to out-of-state visits. Next week, for
example, he is serving as the host of fund-raising events for Linda
Lingle, a gubernatorial candidate in Hawaii, and J.D. Hayworth, a
conservative congressman from Arizona. He has already held
functions in New York for Jeb Bush, a gubernatorial candidate in
Florida; Gary Franks, a Connecticut candidate for the U.S. Senate,
and Rep. Robert Livingston of Louisiana, the chairman of the House
Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   All this Republican-related effort by Giuliani comes at a time
when New York City has a shot at becoming the host to the
Republican National Convention in 2000; the city has traditionally
been perceived as too liberal for mainstream Republicans to bless
it with their presence. But the administration's hopes were
bolstered this week when the national committee announced that New
York was one of five finalists. A choice will be made before the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Cristyne Lategano, the mayor's communications director, said
some of the reasoning behind Giuliani's peregrinations was to
eliminate any lingering impressions of New York City as
crime-ridden, drug-infested and otherwise unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York City is one of the safest large cities in America,''
she said. ``Getting that message around is very helpful for New
York, especially in luring large conventions.''

HACKETT KEEPS QB OPTIONS OPEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE _ There's not exactly a quarterback controversy brewing
at USC's training camp, but, inevitably, coach Paul Hackett faces a
barrage of questions each day regarding the deepest and most
intriguing position on the team.
</P>
<P>
   When Hackett designated sophomore Mike Van Raaphorst the starter
last spring he also left himself some wiggle room, and that means
plenty of chances to speculate on the quarterback derby.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in two of the nation's top freshmen trying to elbow their
way up the depth chart and it's anything but a foregone conclusion
that Van Raaphorst will last the entire season at No.1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Van Raaphorst certainly has the inside track. He is the
starter,'' Hackett said. ``(But) he will really have to play well
to keep them at bay. Is it possible a freshman could start the
first game? That's very doubtful. Could it happen later in the
season? That's possible.''
</P>
<P>
   It's comments like those, along with some impressive play by
true freshman Carson Palmer during the first few practices, that
has kept any shred of a controversy alive.
</P>
<P>
   True to his word when he recruited Palmer and Jason Thomas last
winter, Hackett is giving the frosh plenty of practice time the
first week of training camp. Hackett, who said finding a backup is
one of the fall's early goals, realizes it's possible that an
injury could force him to juggle his lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas has been limited by a sore ankle, but Palmer, a 6-foot-4
All-American from Santa Margarita, has been drawing attention with
his accuracy and touch after just three days of practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to play this year. That's always been my goal,'' Palmer
said. ``I felt I've done pretty good so far. It's different.
Everybody's so much bigger and faster; there's so much you need to
know. There's so many little things I'm missing.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer said his goal is to be the No.2 quarterback entering the
season opener against Purdue. Thomas is even more precocious,
believing he, too, will thrust himself into the mix when he
recuperates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I get healthy, I guess the cream will rise to the top,''
Thomas said. ``If I have a chance, I'll be out there on the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   First, they have to get by Van Raaphorst. Van Raaphorst began
last year as the backup to John Fox, but by midseason he earned
starts against Washington and Stanford. He was knocked out of the
Stanford game with a sprained ankle, an injury that would keep him
sidelined for the season's last two games.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he has the No.1 designation, he's aware the freshmen
are receiving a longer than usual look this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to beat everybody out again,'' Van Raaphorst said.
``Everyone knows (the freshmen) have got talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I go out and if I make a mistake, it's not the end of the
world. It's nice going into the season (knowing) I'm the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost forgotten so far have been juniors Fox and Quincy Woods.
A year ago, Fox was the starter. But after seven games of
inconsistent production, Fox found himself the backup and only
started the last two games because of Van Raaphorst's injury.
</P>
<P>
   The adjustment to a reserve role has been difficult for Fox, who
threw for 1,940 yards with 12 touchdowns and eight interceptions in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where I'm at. I don't like that I'm not the
first-string quarterback,'' Fox said. ``I'm where I was a few years
ago. It's tough to let the young guys get reps. You understand they
need to get reps too, but it's tough. That's OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to become the starter is if I show them I can
compete every chance in the scrimmages.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who Hackett designated the No.2 quarterback after spring
drills, said he would have transferred if John Robinson had not
been fired. He decided to stay, he said, because he feels like he's
getting a new start.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure he's properly motivated, Woods said he kept every
newspaper article from last season questioning his ability or
chronicling his switch to wide receiver so that he can prove his
critics wrong when _ or if _ he gets on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned from the mistakes I've made, and I've become a
stronger player,'' Woods said.

ANDY GUMP, 88, FARM BOY BECAME SOUTHLAND'S KING OF PORTABLE
TOILETS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY DENNIS McCARTHY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Yes, there was a real Andy Gump. In the flesh. A
dirt-poor Oklahoma farm boy who rose to become a millionaire by
bailing out people in need.
</P>
<P>
   Bailing them out in parks, at concerts, sporting events, swap
meets and just about every public event where people gathered
outdoors in Southern California to work or have a good time.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Gump, king of the portable toilets, died Monday. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   His life was part Will Rogers, part Horatio Alger. He was a
humble guy who never changed over the years, not even when the big
money started rolling in and his famous name dotted the landscape
all over this town.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever you saw a long line of anxious-looking people hopping
from foot to foot, you knew there had to be an Andy Gump nearby.
</P>
<P>
   His name became synonymous with the outdoor sanitation business
in Southern California. It wasn't a portable toilet people went in
search of outside at public events. It was, and still is, an Andy
Gump.
</P>
<P>
   How all this transpired is a heck of a story from another
generation, says Barry Gump, Andy's son. It's the story of a kid
born into poverty back in 1910 in Claremore, Okla., the same town
where Will Rogers was born.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers' sister even baby-sat Andy a few times. The people in
Claremore tended to be humble, hard-working and as honest as the
day was long. Andy was no different. He never forgot where he was
from.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad was 19 when the Depression hit,'' Barry says. ``He
never knew it hit, though, because his family had nothing before
the Depression, either.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, the Gumps had moved to Campo, Colo., a tiny farming
town 325 miles southeast of Denver. The family tried to make ends
meet running Gump's service station and cafe out on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   But when the great dust storms blew through the Midwest in the
'30s, devastating crops and businesses alike, Andy and his wife of
two years, Irma, decided to join the migration west in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   They moved close to relatives in the L.A. area and, after a few
stints at odd jobs, Andy got a dump truck and started hauling rock
and gravel to construction sites up and down the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   It was after dumping off a load of gravel in Oregon sometime in
the mid-1940s that Andy got the idea to fill his empty truck with
Christmas trees and bring them home to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad met a man in Pacoima who owned a cesspool and sewer
business on San Fernando Road,'' Barry said. ``He let Dad rent out
part of his lot to sell the Christmas trees.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest, as they say, is history. The man took a liking to the
nice, personable Andy Gump, and sold him his business when he
retired a few years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad got a pump truck, and that eventually led to starting his
portable-toilet business in the mid-1950s,'' Barry says. ``He
called it Mission Sanitation.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy didn't know it, but he would soon catch the business break
of his life. He met a sign painter named Larry Fontana, who
convinced him that Mission Sanitation somehow didn't have the ring
to it that Andy Gump did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business wasn't that good, anyway, so my dad suggested to Andy
that he use his own name on the business instead,'' said Fontana's
son, Larry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There had been a popular comic strip with an Andy Gump cartoon
character, and Dad said why not use that? Andy told my dad he
really didn't want his name on portable toilets, but he tried it
anyway, and it worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Mission Sanitation folded and Andy Gump emerged _ from a
garage at the home of Andy and Irma Gump in Mission Hills, a Los
Angeles suburb. There was Andy and his two sons, Barry and Bill,
who passed away in 1980, and Barry's friend, Angelo Pascolla, out
in the garage building five plywood portable toilets.
</P>
<P>
   The group delivered them to construction sites and picking them
up when the jobs were over.
</P>
<P>
   Five portable toilets grew to 50, then 100, and finally 3,000,
as plywood gave way to fiberglass and plastic _ and Andy Gump
became the undisputed common name for portable toilets at public
and private events all over this town.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Gumps served the L.A. area during the 1971 Sylmar
Earthquake when entire neighborhoods had no usable bathrooms. More
than 900 Gumps were scattered throughout venues for the 1984 Summer
Games in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   And when then-presidential candidate Ronald Reagan decided to
throw a 1976 barbecue at his Santa Barbara ranch for politicians
and reporters, who got the call to duty?
</P>
<P>
   Andy Gump.
</P>
<P>
   Irma was the only one who called him by his given name _
Massena.
</P>
<P>
   To everyone else, from kindergarten through retirement, he was
Andy.
</P>
<P>
   Still humble and never forgetting where he was from. Still
driving his old Ford pickup truck to work every day well into his
80s _ still living with Irma in the same, modest Mission Hills home
they moved into more than 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gump is survived by his wife, Irma; daughter, Cherilyn; son,
Barry; three grandchildren; and seven great-grandchildren. &QL;

RECRUIT HAYES TO JOIN TEAM TODAY

<P>
   IRVINE _ USC recruit Windrell Hayes is expected to attend
practice today after pleading guilty Wednesday in Stockton to
writing bad checks.
</P>
<P>
   The transfer receiver from San Jose State had to pay $8,490.13
in restitution and was also sentenced to three years of probation
for the misdemeanor offense, according to San Joaquin County deputy
district attorney Patrick Slamon. If necessary, Hayes must also
testify against two other men involved in the scam.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes was scheduled to drive to Los Angeles on Wednesday night.
If he completes the necessary paperwork this morning at USC, he
will join the Trojans for their afternoon practice, coach Paul
Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said NCAA rules prohibit Hayes from working out in pads
for three days, and he would probably not participate in a contact
practice until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a position where a young man obviously has been in
error,'' Hackett said. ``He has a second opportunity at USC. I will
be very conscious to watch carefully how he proceeds. I believe he
deserves another chance.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if allowing Hayes on the team was inconsistent with
the one-game suspension levied against R. Jay Soward for poor
academic performance, Hackett said: ``When you become a member of
the team, you come under my rules and the standard of the team.
When you have recruit status, I think it is slightly different.''

   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said he will
not be ``scouring the woods,'' for defensive-line help in the
aftermath of Leon Lett's knee injury, which the coach said could
cause Lett to miss the Sept. 6 season opener against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Lett, the Cowboys' best pass rusher, injured his left knee when
Saints quarterback Billy Joe Hobert fell on him during a scrimmage
Tuesday night in Shreveport, La. A magnetic resonance imaging exam
performed on the defensive tackle early yesterday revealed a
sprain.
</P>
<P>
   The injury hurts a pass rush that has made little impact with
new starting ends Kavika Pittman and Greg Ellis. But since Lett is
not expected to be out more than three or four weeks, Gailey and
team owner Jerry Jones have decided not to make any major
acquisitions to beef up the club's depth on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed for Leon. It hurts our team to a certain
degree,'' Gailey said. ``But it's an opportunity for somebody else
to come in and show'' what they can do.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent among those players is fourth-round draft choice
Michael Myers, who Gailey said will assume Lett's starting duties.
And defensive coordinator Dave Campo said he can't wait to see how
tackle Darren Benson performs. Benson was the club's supplemental
draft choice in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm starting to feel pretty good about our tackles,'' Campo
said. ``We've got three or four who can really help us. Is our
depth better? I feel better right now about our depth at tackle
than I did a year ago. Darren Benson has come a long way. You've
got Antonio Anderson. Michael Myers is a gamer. He plays better in
games than he does in practice. Only time will tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Lett's injury is the second setback the defense has had in
training camp. Linebacker Broderick Thomas, who was expected to
provide pass-rushing help on long-yardage situations, sustained a
season-ending knee injury last month.
</P>
<P>
   It already has been a hard summer for Pittman and Ellis. Neither
has registered a sack in two preseason games, and Pittman has
missed the past three days of practice after sustaining an ankle
injury in last week's exhibition game against the Oakland Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey continues to say that he is not concerned with the lack
of pressure and added that the lack of sacks has come, in part,
because the team has not employed any special defensive fronts to
get the defensive ends to the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't game-planned anybody,'' Gailey said. ``There are
ways to create pressure. Certainly we'd like a better pass rush,
but like I said, I think we'll be able to develop in time.''

PLANE CHASE ENDS IN DRUG FIND BY CUSTOMS FIND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.)

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A suspect in a drug-smuggling case led U.S.
Customs Service officials on a chase through Southern California
skies before landing at Santa Paula Airport, where he was arrested
with more than 500 pounds of cocaine aboard his craft, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, identified only as 52 and a California resident, was
arrested Wednesday morning on suspicion of drug smuggling, firearms
violations and illegal entry into the country with what officials
said was between $4 million and $5 million worth of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He flew all over the Central Coast, making loops, going low,
going high,'' said John Hensley, customs special agent in charge of
the Los Angeles field division. ``We don't know if he saw the
planes behind him. Maybe that's just the way he operates.''
</P>
<P>
   Customs officials spotted the suspicious-looking plane at about
7:30 a.m. Wednesday just south of the U.S.-Mexico border operating
without a standard Federal Aviation Administration radar device and
flying low at altitudes of 150 feet.
</P>
<P>
   From their Domestic Air Interdiction Coordinating Center at
March Air Force Base in Riverside County, customs officials began
their pursuit after the plane bypassed a mandatory stop before
crossing the border.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft, a twin-engine Cessna turboprop with American
markings, then followed a known drug-running route along Laguna
Salada, which Hensley said is a below-sea-level valley bordered by
mountains and was once popular among smugglers because it was out
of radar's reach.
</P>
<P>
   From about 8 a.m. until 10 a.m., the man, described as clean-cut
and a registered pilot, was pursued by customs pilots. They trailed
him in a jet, two planes and a helicopter on what they called a
midspeed chase as the pilot crisscrossed the skies in an ``S''
pattern as he apparently kept looking for signs he was being
followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was kind of outgunned,'' Hensley said. ``He wasn't going to
get away.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials are unsure if the pilot planned to stop at Santa Paula
Airport or simply landed there because he was running low on fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Paula Police Department officials were notified of the
incoming plane, said Santa Paula police Cmdr. Bob Gonzales, and
along with customs agents surrounded the aircraft upon landing at
the airport that sits in the midst of citrus groves.
</P>
<P>
   A drug-sniffing dog was brought to the scene and ``did a
pirouette when it got close to the plane, so we knew something was
there,'' Hensley said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials found 14 duffel bags full of cocaine, with wholesale
value of between $4.1million and $5million, a revolver on the pilot
and two automatic pistols in the plane.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot was being held in a Ventura County customs facility
and was scheduled to be transferred to a federal detention center
in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   As of 1996, the plane was last registered to a Wilmington,
Del.-based company.
</P>
<P>
   At Santa Paula Airport, which was temporarily shut down,
officials had no record of the plane having stopped overnight or
fueled there before, office manager Janice Dickenson said.
</P>
<P>
   The airport sees about 100 planes daily and is more accustomed
to hobby pilots and vintage aircraft than the activity that flew in
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 20 years, I've never seen this happen,'' Dickinson said.
``This isn't a problem we've had here.'' &QL;

ENVOY'S REQUESTS FOR SAFER BUILDINGS HAD BEEN DENIED FOR BUDGET
REASONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(inserts new sentence after 6th grf) (See also: AFRICA-INQUIRY, AFRICA-BOMBING, AFRICA-ENVOY,
AFRICA-DEAD) 
(JT) 
 By PHILIP SHENON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. ambassador to Kenya and the Defense
Department were so alarmed about threats to the embassy in Kenya
that they requested a safer building, but were rejected for
budgetary reasons, the State Department said Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In Nairobi, the Kenyan government said it had detained several
suspects in last week's bombing of the embassy, which killed at
least 247 people, including 12 Americans. Federal law enforcement
officials said that FBI agents in Nairobi would question the
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Prompted by requests from news organizations, the State
Department revealed details of the security warnings issued to the
department over the last nine months by the ambassador to Kenya,
Prudence Bushnell, and the U.S. Central Command, the element of the
Pentagon that oversees American military interests in East Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Senior State Department officials said they did not believe that
Bushnell had cited any particular terrorist threat in her two
requests for a new embassy building _ the first made in a cable
last December, the second in April in a message sent directly to
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   ``She indicated that resource constraints were endangering
embassy personnel,'' said Patrick Kennedy, assistant secretary for
administration, who choked with emotion as he described the
warnings that the ambassador had made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, we simply lack the money to respond immediately
to all the needs of embassy construction _ it's just like a family
with limited resources,'' he said at a news conference. ``Look I've
been a foreign service officer for 25 years. And if anybody thinks
that everyone in the department isn't sick about this, they're just
wrong. We did the very best we could, given what we had.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if the department had agreed to the request, a new
building could not have been built before last week's bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said the department had to turn down the requests for a
new embassy because other projects had a higher priority, including
the construction of embassies in the Balkans and the nations of the
former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported Wednesday that Israeli
intelligence officers had advised their American counterparts
shortly before Friday's bombings to disregard a warning that the
Embassy in Kenya might be the target of an attack.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper reported that the man who relayed the warning had
been known to Israeli intelligence, and that American intelligence
officials had asked the Israelis to assess his credibility. The
newspaper said that ``based on their past experience with him, the
Israelis said the man's warning should be taken with a grain of
salt.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper did not provide any further details about the man
or the timing of the warning.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli official in Washington said that David Bar-Illan,
Netanyahu's spokesman, denied the report. Bar-Illan had said that
Israel had gone through the last six months of intelligence
exchanges with the United States and found no exchange like the one
Haaretz reported.
</P>
<P>
   The official said that Israel and Washington have ``ongoing and
intense exchanges'' of information about intelligence matters and
the East African bombings since they have happened. ``There is a
constant exchange of counter- terrorism information and
fragments,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior official of a foreign intelligence service confirmed
earlier this week that his government had learned of a warning that
preceded the attack. But the official did not say at that time
whether the United States had asked other governments to assess the
warning.
</P>
<P>
   Department officials noted Wednesday that even if a new embassy
building in Nairobi had been approved, it would not have been
completed for years. ``We still would have been in that embassy''
when it was bombed, Kennedy reminded reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Bushnell, a career foreign service officer who is highly
regarded at the State Department, made her first request for a new
embassy building last December in a cable to the department in
Washington
</P>
<P>
   ``She expressed her concerns on the vulnerability of the embassy
and requested a security assessment,'' Kennedy said. ``Her desire
was to have a new building. The department expressed its agreement
and shared its understanding.'' He described the tone of the memo
as ``concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   While the department declined to make public the ambassador's
message, officials said she had listed several security concerns,
noting that the embassy was close to the street at a busy
intersection, which made it vulnerable to a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were multiple threats at the embassy,'' Kennedy said.
``She talked about crime, she talked about administrative matters,
and she talked about safety.''
</P>
<P>
   But in January, the State Department's Foreign Buildings Office,
which reviews requests for construction and decides how that budget
will be spent, did not include a new embassy for Nairobi on its
priority of new projects. ``This discussion confirmed that other
embassy projects had a higher priority than Embassy Nairobi for our
limited funds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the U.S. Central Command issued a similar warning
to the State Department, recommending that the embassy be housed in
a new building.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the department, Kennedy said, the Central Command
``expressed to the department its concern over the vulnerability of
the Nairobi chancellery, noting that a planned renovation for later
in the year would not change the fact that the embassy was close to
the street.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the guidelines requested by the Inman committee,
the external wall of an embassy should be at least 100 feet from
streets or sidewalks. At the Nairobi embassy, which had been
considered a low-risk post for terrorists, the so-called setback
was only about 30 feet.

COMMENTARY: ALBANY LOSES A PART OF ITS PAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ELIZABETH KOLBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anthony Genovesi was something of a legend when this columnist
was first assigned to cover Albany nearly a dozen years ago.
Whenever there was talk, as often there was, about what was really
going on behind the scenes _ who owed what to whom and why, or who
hated whom and exactly how much _ his name invariably came up.
``Tony could tell you that,'' people would say, only to add, ``Of
course, he won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Genovesi rose, the way politicians used to, through the machine.
Before he was elected to the state assembly, he was a power broker
in Brooklyn, a macher in the Thomas Jefferson Democratic Club and a
protege of the infamous Meade Esposito. In those years, Genovesi
was the kind of man you turned to if you wanted a judgeship in the
borough, or a spot on the ballot, or if, instead, you just wanted
an opponent's nominating petitions thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   As the political strategist for Assembly Speaker Stanley Fink,
he later became a power player in Albany as well. From his post as
director of the Democratic Assembly Campaign Committee, he
determined who needed help from the party come election time. He
also decided who was loyal enough to the Democratic cause _ or,
more pertinently, to Fink _ actually to get it. The methods weren't
always pretty, but that wasn't what he aspired to.
</P>
<P>
   When he died on a slippery road in Dutchess County late Monday
night, Albany lost, if not a major figure, then an exemplary one,
and one that is not likely to be replaced any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   It has been decades since machine support has, on the national
scene, mattered as much as a telegenic smile, a good media adviser,
cash for television ads and a well-run polling operation. If there
is a symbol of the new age, it is not the smoke-filled room where
seasoned players call the shots.
</P>
<P>
   It is the conference room with the one-way mirror where
housewives, dentists and retirees air their pet peeves in focus
groups.
</P>
<P>
   The discreet knowledge of alliances, debts and lingering
hostilities that was so much a source of power to the
behind-the-scenes professionals of the past is now largely
irrelevant, replaced by a different kind of expertise: the ability
to read a poll or spin a story.
</P>
<P>
   In Albany, the transformation has been slower in coming, in part
because few outside state government seem to care much about what
happens there. Yet still, inexorably, it has arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of district-by-district understanding of the state that
Genovesi spent a lifetime acquiring has less and less utility. In
Albany, as in Washington, the crucial battles are increasingly
fought over the airwaves with attack ads crafted by outside
consultants who would not know how to invoke the Wilson-Pakula rule
if their life depended on it.
</P>
<P>
   Gruff and beefy, Genovesi was in most ways just the opposite of
a slick, focus-grouped politician.
</P>
<P>
   More liberal than the Assembly district in Canarsie he inherited
from Fink in 1986, he was a resolute opponent of the death penalty
even when it was clearly a losing issue. When he did speak to
reporters, he was blunt and unsentimental. And though he was chary
with commentary, what he did say seemed, remarkably enough, to be
what he actually believed.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment he took Fink's Assembly seat, it was widely
assumed that his political experience would make Genovesi a strong
contender to become Assembly speaker himself. After all, few in the
chamber knew better than he did the strengths _ and, perhaps more
significantly, the vulnerabilities _ of their colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   But Genovesi never did succeed in becoming the leader of the
Assembly and, in fact, saw his power wane even in Brooklyn. Twice,
he lost out to become the head of the borough's Democratic
organization. And for the last several years, he had been locked in
a nasty, mostly self-wounding battle with one of the men who beat
him, Assemblyman Clarence Norman Jr., over everything from
candidate endorsements to patronage to judgeships.
</P>
<P>
   Among his colleagues, Genovesi's death was mourned mostly in
purely personal terms. But as his former allies and rivals took
turns praising him, they repeatedly invoked the very kind of
virtues that are themselves in the process of passing out of
political life: genuineness, humor and loyalty.

BELL ATLANTIC PACT MAJOR VICTORY FOR UNION, EXPERTS SAY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By TERRY PRISTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   By reaching a tentative agreement this week that would force
Bell Atlantic to guarantee its union workers job security _ even in
digital technologies only now being developed _ negotiators
representing 73,000 of the company's employees scored a significant
victory, experts in labor relations agreed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no consensus on whether these gains would have
major repercussions in other industries and how they might affect
Bell Atlantic in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, announced Tuesday, ended a two-day strike that
began after the old contract expired at 12:01 a.m. Sunday. The
company agreed to guarantee that all installation, maintenance and
repair jobs involving advanced data communications, including
access to the Internet, would go to union members.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Bronfenbrenner, the director of labor education research at
Cornell University, said that workers in other industries were
likely to be inspired by Bell Atlantic's agreement to phase out a
nonunion customer service operation in Virginia _ one of the key
provisions in the proposed contract.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bell Atlantic's customer service employees, many workers
deal with the public only over the telephone and are fearful that
their jobs could be reassigned to nonunion personnel in other
states with the flick of a switch, she said. ``This is just going
to add weight to workers who think that this is a fight worth
fighting,'' Bronfenbrenner said. ``Other employers are going to
say, `We have to think twice about whether the secret to corporate
success is eliminating good jobs.'''
</P>
<P>
   She said that Bell Atlantic's management had underestimated the
resolve of the union, the Communications Workers of America. ``The
company realized that if they were going to break the union's
commitment, it was going to take a long time,'' she said, ``and
they couldn't afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jeffrey Keefe, a professor of labor relations at Rutgers
University, said that Bell Atlantic's situation was complicated
because it merged last year with Nynex, a company with a very
different approach to labor-management relations.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of a crippling four-month strike in 1989, Nynex
adopted a conciliatory approach toward its labor force, making
concessions to its employees, like limits on forced overtime, that
were not matched by other telephone companies. After the merger,
other Bell Atlantic employees insisted on having such provisions
extended to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nynex was a pushover,'' said Herbert Northrup, professor
emeritus of management at the University of Pennsylvania, ``so what
you have is a forcing of a foreign culture onto the Bell Atlantic
people.'' He said that extending job protection to workers in new
forms of communications could well put Bell Atlantic at a
disadvantage because most of its competitors in the high-technology
sphere are not unionized.
</P>
<P>
   Keefe pointed out that the proposed contract, which is subject
to ratification by the membership, extends only to the year 2000
and does not give the CWA the rights it sought to make it easier to
bring the 7,100 employees of Bell Atlantic's cellular phone unit
into the union fold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a big victory today,'' he said, ``but whether
it really changes the relationship with management _ which is what
the union is after here _ I think that still remains open.''

DENTIST DIVES INTO SPEARFISHING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM MATTHEWS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. _ By profession, Gerald Lim is a
mild-mannered dentist. When he isn't filling cavities, he has a
more-or-less secret life as the national spearfishing champion.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being gored by his own spear, Lim successfully defended
his individual title recently after two days of competition at the
U.S. National Freediving Spearfishing Championships in the waters
off Kings Beach in Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Lim, Bill Ernst of Malibu and Rene Rojas of Anaheim _
representing the Great Los Angeles Council of Divers _ fended off
the competition to retain their national team spearfishing crown.
</P>
<P>
   But the understated Lim will tell you the honors are not like
winning other titles. When he lets others know he is the national
spearfishing champion, the response is usually short and succinct:
``The what?'' So Lim usually doesn't talk about it much, but
spearfishing is an abiding passion in his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The ocean) is the final frontier,'' said the Redlands
recreationist. ``It's as far away from civilization as you can
get.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lim's accomplishments are certainly not lost on the
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no financial award and the sport is not widely known,
but among his peers it's a great honor,'' said competitive free
diver Terry Maas of Ventura, author of ``Blue Water Hunting and
Freediving.''
</P>
<P>
   Lim is now among an elite class of repeat winners of the
national title, which includes Maas, himself a four-time winner,
and Bill Ernst's brother, John.
</P>
<P>
   The annual spearfishing championships attracted more than 70 of
the country's best free divers _ anglers who hunt underwater sans
oxygen tanks, with only as much air as their lungs can hold _ to
compete individually and as part of 23 teams. Their dives usually
last from 90 seconds to 2{ minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In the first day of the event, July 30, Lim speared seven fish _
four tautog, or blackfish, at about 10 pounds each, two 5-pound
bluefish, and a 13-pound striped bass _ for a total of 67 points.
Each fish speared and weighed in is worth a point, and one point is
awarded for each pound the fish weighs. There is a maximum of 16
points awarded per fish.
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, Ernst had collected 66 points and Rojas had earned
65 points. The consistency of the three divers placed them high in
the first round's standings, yet a couple of divers had higher
scores.
</P>
<P>
   The trio relied on advance scouting for the second day of
competition. Prior to the event, the three had flown back early and
had scouted the area extensively. Knowing that most of the diving
pressure would be near shore, the trio focused much of their
scouting on offshore reefs and humps, some as far as 2{ miles from
off the beach. Since all competitors must either swim or kayak to
their hunting areas, most spearfishermen don't travel that far.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the first day, we tried to hit the stuff everyone else was
going to hit and save the outside for the second day. That really
paid off,'' Lim said. ``When you shoot one striper in a school, the
whole school is gone. Most of the stuff near shore gets hammered
very quickly, and things get much tougher the second day.'' The
second day the spearfishers went to their more distant spots, and
on Lim's first dive he shot a 28-pound striper. While bringing it
back to his kayak, he noticed a bluefish was staying with the
speared fish. Lim quickly got another speargun and hit the bluefish
with what what he thought was a kill shot.
</P>
<P>
   While collecting the bluefish, however, it suddenly began
thrashing wildly and Lim soon found his own spear driven deeply
into his thigh.
</P>
<P>
   One wouldn't think that someone who performs root canals for a
living would get queasy over the sight of blood, but Lim didn't
want look at the wound for fear of passing out. He remained at the
surface to make sure he hadn't cut the femoral artery. He didn't
get weak, the wound eventually stopped bleeding and Lim speared
another striper, four more tautog and a bonito, finishing the day
with an individual best 77-point tally.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates did nearly as well. The trio finished the two-day
event July 31 with 377 points, nearly 100 points ahead of their
nearest competitors because of a smart strategy. The team has since
been selected to represent the United States in the world
spearfishing championship, to be held Sept. 17-20 in Croatia.

FOOTBALL COLUMN: GIANTS THRIVE AT SPARTAN CAMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Two years ago, taking a cue from the New York
Giants who were about to make SUNY-Albany their summer training
camp home, New York Knicks officials took a tour of the
university's campus and athletic facilities. The Knicks were
considering these serene Hudson Valley grounds as the site for the
team's fall training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the Knicks returned to Charleston, S.C., where they
had trained previously.
</P>
<P>
   One factor in the Knicks' decision not to relocate to Albany: no
Albany-area hotel had the 12 to 15 luxury suites the team needed to
house its players.
</P>
<P>
   When the Giants wrap up their third training camp at SUNY-Albany
next week, nearly 85 players, including stars such as Jason Sehorn
and Danny Kanell, will move their belongings out of the dorm rooms
they have called home since July 24.
</P>
<P>
   They will say goodbye to the cafeteria where they have served
themselves three times a day. They will clear out of the gymnasium
that has been converted to a spartan locker room, and leave behind
the classrooms where they have met until 10 p.m. almost every night
going over films and diagrams in their playbooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one complains about the dorms,'' said the Giants' backup
quarterback, Kent Graham, who has been to seven National Football
League camps with three teams. ``We know the coaches never want to
put you up in too much luxury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoot, it's all irrelevant anyway. We're never in that room.
All we need is a good mattress. That's football.''
</P>
<P>
   John Dunn is the Giants' strength and conditioning coach,
affectionately nicknamed, Mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Camp never was supposed to be plush,'' Dunn, a former player
now with his fourth NFL team as a coach, said Wednesday. ``Ever
since you were a kid going to football camp, you knew it was
supposed to be like boot camp in the military.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the mind-set that sets football players apart from their
sporting brethren.
</P>
<P>
   The players' parking lot has as many pickup trucks as it has
Porsches, pranks abound as if these millionaires were high
schoolers, and prima donnas are browbeaten back into the sameness
of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   Overdressing is forbidden, T-shirts and shorts are the
off-the-field uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Rookies have to sing for veterans whenever asked and they also
carry the veterans' equipment off the practice fields.
</P>
<P>
   Being out of shape is very much noticed and denounced. Being
injured does not excuse you from practice _ most likely the team
trainers will have you riding a stationary bike and doing
calisthenics on the sideline anyway.
</P>
<P>
   No one is above the team _ just like everyone gets the same size
dorm room.
</P>
<P>
   When the Giants came to Albany last year, coach Jim Fassel
noticed that the layout of the makeshift locker room separated the
defensive players from the offensive players, with some players
seeming to get positions of honor.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel had the lockers rearranged, going end to end numerically
by uniform number.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first job as a coach was high school baseball,'' Fassel
said this week, looking back some 24 years. ``I decided pretty
quick I wasn't cut out to coach anything but football. I was too
much of a tyrant.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel smiled, as if he liked that thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football is much more of a team concept game,'' he said.
``Baseball and basketball, they're more individual. Football teams
have a bunker mentality. These guys have to rely on one another or
they could get killed. It breeds a certain camaraderie.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last week, the rookie quarterback Ben Anderson has been
thinking of camaraderie whenever he looks at his blue right foot.
Anderson's foot has been blue since Graham put some combination of
colorless, odorless _ and apparently harmless _ bluish purple dye
in Anderson's sock.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wear that sock and once you sweat, it turns your foot blue
for a week to 10 days,'' Anderson said. ``Kent said they did it to
him as a rookie. I walk through the locker room now and everyone
screams and yells that I've got the bubonic plague.''
</P>
<P>
   If that were Anderson's only worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can never put my helmet on without checking it first,''
Anderson said. ``They'll put vaseline in it. Or sometimes, mushed
up bananas.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's linebacker Scott Galyon. At lunch one day this
month, his fellow linebackers Pete Monty and Ryan Phillips encased
Galyon's entire pickup truck in a sort of industrial-strength saran
wrap.
</P>
<P>
   Galyon had to cut his way into the driver's seat.
</P>
<P>
   Camaraderie. It's what makes the players put on a talent show
every year. Last year, along with the usual song-and-dance acts,
there was a videotape titled: What do the kickers really do during
practice?
</P>
<P>
   It showed kickers Brad Daluiso and Brad Maynard sneaking away
from the SUNY-Albany campus, their spikes clattering across the
street as they headed for a nearby bar. There, the videotape showed
Daluiso and Maynard in their Giants' uniforms playing pool with
cigarettes dangling from their mouths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, really funny,'' Fassel said later, though one wondered
if he meant it.
</P>
<P>
   Daluiso said: ``I'm not positive, but I think I heard some guys
in the room saying to each other: `That's a joke, right?''' &QL;

CARDS' CAMP ENDS AS NO STINKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. _ Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin used his first
meeting of training camp to inform his team there would be a
skunk-free zone.
</P>
<P>
   He told the players that he wouldn't tolerate a similar prank of
a year ago, when then-rookie quarterback Jake Plummer carried a
maimed skunk into his dormitory room, thinking it was a plastic bag
filled with chicken wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``People used the excuse that (pranks) were part of tradition,''
center Aaron Graham said. ``Coach said as far as he was concerned,
much of the tradition around here stinks, so let's get rid of that.
I agreed.''
</P>
<P>
   So when the club breaks training camp this morning and returns
to the Valley, the worst punishment rookies endured was
fourth-round pick Michael Pittman having his clothes tied together
and free-agent wide receiver Kevin Drake finding ink in his
sandals.
</P>
<P>
   Last year at this time, animal activists were upset with the
team.
</P>
<P>
   This year, they might have been part of the record crowds that
attended workouts at Northern Arizona, including 7,000 for a
scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked to see that type of turnout,'' wide receiver Rob
Moore said. '`But it tells you what expectations are.''
</P>
<P>
   Other camp highlights:
</P>
<P>
   The Eric Swann-Simeon Rice tiff, which ended with Tobin flexing
his muscles.
</P>
<P>
   While first-round draft pick Andre Wadsworth held out, rookies
Corey Chavous, Pat Tillman, Anthony Clement and Terry Hardy showed
they can provide immediate help.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries depleted the cornerback and wide receiver positions.
</P>
<P>
   The ``West Coast'' offense, installed by new offensive
coordinator Marc Trestman, has a tremendous upside, but count on
growing pains.
</P>
<P>
   Legitimate tough guy
</P>
<P>
   Swann walked out of practice July 31 because he didn't think
Rice, who missed the workout because of asthmatic bronchitis, was
ill.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin had long talks with both players and addressed the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He handled it,'' Moore said of Tobin. ``It wasn't an issue you
had to whisper about. He said, `This is the way it's going to be.'
' &QL; 
Baby boomers
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator Dave McGinnis doesn't think first-round
pick Wadsworth's 21-day holdout has been a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``This staff doesn't waste time on things it can't control,''
McGinnis said. ``We have enough to do.''
</P>
<P>
   So while Wadsworth did his media blitz _ was there any Valley
radio talk show or TV sportscast he wasn't heard on this week? _
and contemplated furthering his education, other rookies came up
big.
</P>
<P>
   Chavous, a converted cornerback, and Tillman, a former
linebacker, were expected to have a rough transition but look as if
they'll be starting safeties in 1999, if not sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Chavous, a second-round draft pick from Vanderbilt, is
second-team strong safety and cornerback. Tillman, a seventh-round
pick from Arizona State, is the No. 2 free safety and nickel
linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely pleased with Pat, and Corey is what we thought
he was and continues to improve,'' McGinnis said. ``Moving from
cornerback to safety, where (Chavous) sees the field from a
different perspective and makes the calls, is a bigger jump than
what Pat is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Clement, a second-round pick from Southwestern Louisiana, is
further along than team officials expected and is pushing James
Dexter for the starting right offensive tackle job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is going to be a great one,'' veteran center Mike Devlin
said. '`He's so strong. You're not going to overpower the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardy, a fifth-round pick from Southern Mississippi, has shown
no effects from a shoulder injury and has been a big surprise. &QL; 
Thin and thinner
</P>
<P>
   First, the Cardinals lost wide receivers Anthony Edwards (knee)
and Chad Carpenter (broken wrist). Then, this past week, Moore
(groin), Eric Metcalf (back) and Fred Brock (groin) missed
practice.
</P>
<P>
   The cornerback spot also has been hit. Starter Tom Knight
remains out because of a shoulder injury and backups J.J. McCleskey
(hamstring) and Ty Howard (knee) are recovering. &QL; 
Learning on the run
</P>
<P>
   Plummer has struggled at times trying to execute the West Coast
offense, but he's not the only one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we all grasp exactly what we are supposed to do, it'll
be a little rough, but not as rough as people think,'' Moore said.
``We have so many weapons. The sky's the limit.'' &QL;

ANDRE'S TUNE FALLS FLAT WITH GREED WEARY FANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Hey, Andre. You're losing it.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look around. Sniff the air. Understand that no one cares
about your principles, no one thinks you deserve more cake than
Ryan Leaf, no one believes you're willing to spend another year in
a Tallahassee dormitory.
</P>
<P>
   So, you might win in the long run. You might be a cornerstone of
the franchise, worthy of the comparisons you so easily evoke. And
maybe you'll prevail in this torturous end game, forcing reform in
a stodgy organization.
</P>
<P>
   But you're losing the people. The same crowd that stood up and
cheered when your name was announced on draft day. The same group
melted by your charisma and geeked by your enthusiasm, some of whom
seemed willing to offer up their daughters for marriage.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same crowd that might boo your backside when you
finally put on the uniform.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, you know I'm with you on this subject of creative
financing. It's no coincidence that two of the old-guard franchises
_ the Cardinals and the Bears _ have high-profile holdouts. As the
NFL roars into the new millennium, as $17 billion worth of
television revenue trickles down from the top, you can no longer
ignore concepts such as voidable years and expect impact rookies to
waltz into camp.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals need to change this policy. For the sake of the
present and the future.
</P>
<P>
   But this has nothing to do with right or wrong. This is about
perception. And for the first time in memory, the majority is not
outraged by penny-pinching ownership.
</P>
<P>
   They are screaming at you, Andre.
</P>
<P>
   You are a smart, affable guy, which is why you've spent most of
the week with a phone attached to your ear, spending more time on
talk radio than Rush Limbaugh. But as much as you plead your case,
insisting you couldn't live with yourself if you settled for a $10
million bonus that locked you into a six-year contract, you're
losing it.
</P>
<P>
   Convictions? Try telling that to the guy sizzling in the stands,
wondering if he can afford another beer without blowing the rent.
</P>
<P>
   Fans are simply tired of the greed. Tired of Kevin Garnett
turning down $104 million, holding out for another $21 million,
then insisting it wasn't about the money. Tired of Keith Tkachuk.
Tired of Mike Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   Even the old-timers who always bristle at big money will concede
to performance. No one blinked when Terrell Davis walked off with a
$56 million contract, a just reward for winning a Super Bowl. No
one cares when Michael Jordan earns $100 million a year, a guy with
six championship rings.
</P>
<P>
   It's the money demanded by pups that drives people nuts,
especially when holding firm to a belief foreign to the rest of us:
that you deserve a gold mine before accomplishing anything.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing festers quicker than greed, and this goes beyond the
annual dance of NFL holdouts. There are people convinced the NBA
lockout will not last, citing the mind-set of today's player. There
is no principle, no sense of history, no real solidarity. Just a
bunch of wealthy, skewed kids with big posses and fast cars, a
group not willing to sacrifice a single paycheck. Don't think David
Stern and the rest of the owners don't know as much.
</P>
<P>
   And don't think the Cardinals fail to realize this shift in
momentum. They know you're starting to twist in the wind. They
don't believe you have any intentions of going back to school. They
are playing a game of chicken, seeing how deep your convictions
really are.
</P>
<P>
   As I'm writing this, the phone rings. It's Chuck from Phoenix.
He wants to know how to get in touch with you, and I'm curious why.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want him to come to work with me, see what it's like to work
50 hours a week,'' he says. ``He's complaining about an $8 million
signing bonus? It'll take me 200 years to make that much. And I
don't see myself living that long.''
</P>
<P>
   See what I mean, Andre? And, hey, good luck. Especially if you
resemble Bruce Smith only in mouth. &QL;

IOANE MAKING MARK WITH SUN DEVILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PAYSON, Ariz. _ The first time Junior Ioane saw football pads,
he thought, ``Now what?''
</P>
<P>
   As all the other high school freshmen headed to the practice
field, Ioane sat at his locker, ashamed. How do you put these on?
He was from Samoa, where rugby is the sport of choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was too shy to ask,'' the Arizona State defensive tackle
said. ``I was the last one there when this one kid came in late. I
was planning to go home, and I finally got the nerve to get help.''
</P>
<P>
   Who knew he would develop into one of Utah's top high school
players and become one of Arizona State's most coveted recruits?
When the Sun Devils begin drills today at Camp Tontozona, the
6-foot-5, 290-pound Ioane (pronounced Ee-oh-WAH-nay) will be vying
for a starting job on the defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   The move from Utah, where he has lived since he was 13, has been
difficult, but he is adjusting. He has been responding to audibles
all his life.
</P>
<P>
   He was reared since the age of 3 by his uncle, Pula Pitone, and
his wife, Phyllis Ioane, a Utah-raised missionary for the Church of
Latter Day Saints who was living in Samoa. His birth mother moved
to the United States when Ioane was an infant to seek a better
life.
</P>
<P>
   After Pitone died in 1985, his wife remained in Samoa for
several years before moving to Utah with her four adopted children.
</P>
<P>
   For Junior Ioane, it was culture shock.
</P>
<P>
   He used to love to play in the warm rain in Apia. He tried it in
Utah, and it was freezing.
</P>
<P>
   And he was stunned by the behavior of his classmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back home, we have a lot respect for parents and teachers,''
he said. ``We don't talk back. We get hit if we do. . . . And I was
the only Samoan kid in town. Everywhere I'd go, people would look
at me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a tough road for someone who dislikes being the center of
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understood English, but he really didn't speak it,''
Phyllis Ioane said. ``And he was so shy, he was worried he might
say something wrong. It was difficult because everything was so
different. The food, the weather.''
</P>
<P>
   When football coaches at North Sampete High School spotted
Ioane, they sought him out for the football team. Little did they
know he knew nothing about the game.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it mattered. His rugby experience made him comfortable
with the sport. He was a standout offensive and defensive lineman
and recruited heavily his senior season. When he couldn't arrive at
the necessary ACT score required by the major colleges courting
him, he went to nearby Snow College.
</P>
<P>
   He excelled there and was named a first-team All-American after
collecting 30 solo tackles, 21 assists and 11 sacks last season.
</P>
<P>
   Division I schools came calling again, and Ioane narrowed his
choices to ASU and Brigham Young. He was torn.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Defensive line coach) Kevin (Wolthausen) did an excellent
job,'' recruiting coordinator Robin Pflugrad said. ``Every chance
we could legally be there, Kevin was there. Coach Snyder went once,
and we took a couple of other coaches so Junior could get to know
our football family a little more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he's so quiet, it's hard to get to know him and read
his personality. You really have to be yourself. We really tried to
let him understand that we care about him on and off the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Although BYU was closer and many of Ioane's friends were there,
ASU's coaches won him over.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, he's adjusting. He did his first media interview, ever,
five days ago. He's adapting to the heat and getting beyond the
homesickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's quiet, but once you get to know him, he jokes and kids
around,'' said Erik Flowers, Ioane's roommate and another highly
coveted junior college defensive lineman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an adjustment, but now that I'm getting to know the
guys, it's better,'' he said. ``I've adjusted before.'' &QL;

UA'S TOMEY STILL SURVIVING STAFF SHUFFLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOUGLAS, Ariz. _ More than two decades as a head football coach
is a lesson in survival, if not humility. Survivor Dick Tomey will
tell you there's really nothing complicated about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no geniuses in this business,'' Tomey said Wednesday
after he opened his 12th preseason camp at Cochise College as
Arizona's coach. ``That's proven every week.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, there are effective assistants and coordinators. They
are the stuff, the staff, of long-term success. Lose the good ones,
and you lose your job. Simple as that.
</P>
<P>
   Tomey will begin the 1998 season with a very different staff
from last year. There are five changes.
</P>
<P>
   Dino Babers moves from running backs to Homer Smith's successor
as offensive coordinator. Former Hawaii head coach Bob Wagner takes
over the linebacking and defensive special-team duties.
</P>
<P>
   Former University of Washington offensive coordinator Jeff
Woodruff, the head coach at Tucson's Cholla High School last year,
will direct the running backs. Pete Alamar moves from inside
linebackers to tight ends. Marc Lunsford goes from tight ends to
director of football operations.
</P>
<P>
   Does anybody have a flow chart and few name tags to go along
with the X's and O's?
</P>
<P>
   The staff shuffle is one of many as Arizona confronts a new
season. It's another element that makes the Wildcats such a wild
card in the Pacific 10 race.
</P>
<P>
   The mix of philosophy, personality and experience will go a long
way toward determing Arizona's identity. For now, it's a work in
progress.
</P>
<P>
   `It's new blood but an old perspective,'' said Babers, 37, whose
resume includes San Diego State, Purdue, Northern Arizona,
Nevada-Las Vegas, Hawaii and Arizona State. ``Coach Tomey is going
to give us our leeway, but certain things have to be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of the turnover with assistants or coordinators, I
think the team will line up and play according to the personality
of the head football coach.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tomey's case, it appears to be the personality of a manager
who delegates authority freely and confidently.
</P>
<P>
   In large part, the confidence is rooted in the staff's
experience. In Smith, Tomey relied on an ex-boss whose approach to
offense was said to be one of the most creative in college
football. Smith retired for health reasons.
</P>
<P>
   In Wagner, Tomey brought in another former head coach. Wagner
was a defensive coordinator for Tomey before he succeeded his old
boss at Hawaii, where he spent 19 years and won the school's only
Western Athletic Conference title. Wagner was without a football
job and living in San Diego last year when Tomey hired him. He also
was a candidate for a job at Texas Christian.
</P>
<P>
   They know each other. Trust each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about being a good fit,'' said Tomey, who has been a
head coach for 21 years.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, however, a former head coach as an assistant can
create problems. The new assistant has never given up the role and
the habits of a head coach. Suddenly, a stable staff becomes a
banana republic, with rumors of a locker room coup. Tomey knows the
stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``On some staffs, egos get the best of each other,'' Tomey said.
``You see that all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   But if ego can be separated from the task, Tomey said, a former
head coach or high-profile assistant can be invaluable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain times when experience really matters on the
sideline and in the press box,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   From 1992 through 1995, Tomey said, he encouraged Jim Young, a
former head coach at Arizona, Army and Purdue, to take on
additional responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted Jim Young to be more involved in other areas''
he said. ``He just wasn't interested at that point in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that kind of experience is invaluable.''
</P>
<P>
   And pragmatic.
</P>
<P>
   There wouldn't be survivors without it. &QL;

COLLEAGUES GLAD TO SEE MAYFAIR'S GOOD FORTUNE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ There have been bigger victories this season
than Billy Mayfair's win last weekend at the Buick Open. Few,
however, have been as popular among the players.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfair gets that kind of respect because in the sometimes
pompous world of professional golf, the Scottsdale pro is truly a
good guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You lucky (expletive),'' Scott Verplank quipped, slugging
Mayfair in the arm to express his affection in jocular fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, you hit some guy in the head (on the eighth hole
Sunday), and the ball bounces back into the fairway. Then you chip
in from everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfair does not miss his opportunity to return the good-natured
ribbing. ``Like you didn't, right?'' he countered with Verplank's
second-place finish at the Buick, which came on the strength of a
closing 64.
</P>
<P>
   So it goes as Mayfair sits in the locker room at Sahalee Country
Club, the site of this week's PGA Championship. One by one,
everyone stops by to pat Billy on the back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love you, man,'' said close friend Mark Calcavecchia, giving
Mayfair a hearty embrace. ``I called my mom Sunday night and told
her Billy won in a breeze. He made winning by 2 (shots) look
easy.''
</P>
<P>
   The parade of well-wishers goes on _ Phil Mickelson; Tom Lehman;
Payne Stewart; Paul Azinger; Davis Love III, who is the defending
champ here this week. Finally, Mayfair's head doctor, Bob Rotello,
capped the congratulatory train with a few choice words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told you so,'' he said to Mayfair with a wink.
</P>
<P>
   Life has not always been so sweet for Billy Mayfair, Arizona's
favorite son who rose from the junior ranks to be a state champion
at Camelback High School and an All-American at Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Bob said I just needed to be patient when I was going
through that slump,'' said Mayfair, who was No. 2 on the money list
in 1995 before dipping to No. 55 in '96 and No. 79 in '97, when he
rallied from 150th place late in the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I've won twice in one season (he earlier captured the
Nissan Open) for the second time in my career (he also won twice in
'95). My confidence is really high, and I think it's all because
the putting has come around.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfair, whose unorthodox stroke with the flat stick occurs by
cutting the blade across the ball, also changed putters, although
not brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week I switched from a PING Pal 2, a putter I've used
most of my pro career, to a PING ZING 5KS,'' he said. ``It's a
little heavier, especially in the center point. I was having
trouble with eight-footers, and the heavier center really
stabilized my stroke.''
</P>
<P>
   Stable pretty much sums up Mayfair, both in personality and his
play these days. He ranks 10th on the money list with $976,889.
He's also 10th in the standings for the Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning the Buick was huge because I played so well coming
down the stretch,'' said Mayfair, who celebrated his 32nd birthday
last Thursday with the belated present on Sunday. ``Truthfully, I
couldn't breathe until I hit the green at (No.) 16.''
</P>
<P>
   It marked the first time that Mayfair's wife, Tammy, had not
been present for one of his five career wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tammy's sister had a baby boy, and we decided that was pretty
important, too,'' said Mayfair, who is in his 10th season as a pro.
``But she met me here when I got off the flight late Sunday night,
and we celebrated.''
</P>
<P>
   The only cloud lately, he said, was the death of the Mayfairs'
close friend, Renay Appleby, the wife of Stuart. She was killed in
a bizarre accident three weeks ago in London. She was crushed
between a cab and a car.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that has ever hit me harder was Heather's
death,'' he said of the fraternal relationship he developed with
Heather Farr, the former LPGA star from Phoenix who died of
complications from breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that was different, because we knew Heather was sick. This
other just came out of the blue. Tammy and I are still in shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfair added that he felt it was a good thing that Appleby
decided to return this week for the PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he's hurting, but _ and it's better for him to say this
_ I know Renay would want him to get on with his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfair also plans to keep pointing to the future, although he
discounts his chances for a strong showing in the PGA, where his
best finish has been a tie for fifth in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to get over what just happened at the Buick and go
out and play the best I can,'' he said. ``But I'll be OK once we
get started (today).''
</P>

UNION WON'T FIGHT BOEING PLANS FOR ASSEMBLY WORK IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KAREN WEST  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ After last-minute negotiations Wednesday, Boeing's
largest union agreed not to fight the company's plans to set up 737
assembly operations in California in exchange for a promise from
Boeing to limit its monthly production rate there to no more than 5
airplanes a month, according to people familiar with the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also promised the machinists union that no layoffs would
occur in the Puget Sound area as a result of the California work at
least until its labor contract expires in December 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But separately, Boeing has already developed a tentative
timeline that managers could use if the company chooses to
implement layoffs as a result of cutbacks already announced.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest layoffs could occur in Boeing's commercial aircraft
division would be early December, according to the company's
1998-99 ``Redeployment Schedule,'' obtained by the
Post-Intelligencer.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing could choose, however, to forego the layoffs until after
the Christmas holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement with the machinists' union, reached late
Wednesday, was the final hurdle Boeing needed to clear in order to
announce Thursday that it will begin building next-generation 737s
this fall at its Douglas Products Division aircraft factory in Long
Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   While Boeing promised that no local layoffs would result from
the new California assembly line, the company already has announced
that it anticipates some layoffs as part of its plan to reduce
employment by 18,000 to 28,000 by the end of next year. Boeing also
previously announced it will cut 12,000 jobs just from the
company's commercial aircraft division beginning this year.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing employs about 238,000 people in 27 states. About 118,000
work for the commercial aircraft division, headquartered in Renton.
</P>
<P>
   The ``redeployment schedule'' outlines a tentative layoff
timeline for Boeing Commercial Airplane Group workers beginning
with 60-day warn notices being issued in October and layoffs
becoming effective the first week of December.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is required by law to issue ``warn'' notices to workers
60 days and 14 days before a layoff becomes effective.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing executives still have not specified exactly how many job
cuts will occur or where and no decisions have yet been made to
implement layoffs this year.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing normally has a 4 percent to 5 percent attrition rate per
year, but it is too early to tell how many of the job cuts will
come from attrition or layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   While the bulk of the job cuts are expected to come from the
company's commercial aircraft division, other reductions could come
from further consolidation of Boeing operations throughout the
country, which the company also expects to announce today.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Wednesday's agreement between Boeing and the union
also included a promise from Boeing to keep fabrication of 737
airplane wings in the Puget Sound and fuselage sections in Wichita,
Kan., where they are currently built.
</P>
<P>
   The union was concerned that Boeing would try to move that work
to California or other locations.
</P>
<P>
   By next summer, Boeing plans to build the next-generation 737
airplanes at a rate of three a month in California and possibly
five a month by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Boeing will start by building its corporate Business
Jet version of the 737-700, but eventually the California assembly
line will be used to produce all versions of the next-generation
737s.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officials say the new assembly line is needed to ease
congestion at the company's overburdened aircraft factory in Renton
where 14 next-generation 737 airplanes are currently built each
month. Boeing plans to increase that rate to 21 a month in October.
</P>
<P>
   The deal reached Wednesday was viewed as favoring Boeing, mainly
because the company's promise to limit the California production of
its 737s is only good until the current Machinists labor contract
expires in December 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Johnson, president of District Lodge 751 of the
International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers in
Seattle, was not available for comment Wednesday and a Boeing
official declined to discuss the meeting or Thursday's planned
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   But a union representative, who spoke on the condition he not be
named, said the agreement was a ``win, win'' for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``This keeps union jobs from being lost in Puget Sound,'' the
source said.
</P>
<P>
   The Machinists union had threatened to take legal action if
Boeing went ahead with plans to establish the assembly line in
California.
</P>
<P>
   But after weeks of negotiations, the union backed off and
officially signed off on the agreement late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has been struggling for nearly a year to fill all its
commercial airplane orders on time _ mainly next-generation 737s _
because of parts shortages, lack of trained assembly workers, a
rapid increase in production rates and other manufacturing
bottlenecks.

ORLANDO COUNTING ON COACH  
 WANTS GRUDEN TO DELIVER ELUSIVE ARENA CROWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Orlando Predators Coach Jay Gruden, still young and cocky enough
to run the scout team offense, likes to remind his star, Barry
Wagner, how he used to burn him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I complete them on the dime,'' Gruden says.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner occasionally still runs his mouth at Gruden, once his
biggest rival at Tampa Bay, but Gruden keeps the wide
receiver/defensive back in his place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can quiet him down,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Gruden does that by showing off his four ArenaBowl rings.
</P>
<P>
   He won them in six years as the quarterback of the Tampa Bay
Storm, sometimes at the expense of its in-state rival.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner has six straight Ironman Awards for being the league's
best two-way player. He keeps them in his living room, where the
row of golden helmets hides his pet boa, Bo, who resides in a
glass-encased cage. But Wagner has no rings. Nada.
</P>
<P>
   It irritates Wagner and his teammates that they've been tagged
as the Buffalo Bills of the Arena league for losing three titles
games, including the ultimate gag in '94 at home to the underdog
Rattlers.
</P>
<P>
   The Predators believed so much in Gruden as the guy who could
bring them the jewelry, that last winter they gave the Nashville
Kats cash estimated between $50,000 and $100,000 and lineman Jerry
Sharp to pry him loose.
</P>
<P>
   The Kats were reluctant to let go of their offensive
coordinator, who, in Nashville's expansion season, helped the Kats
win 10 games and make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville liked Gruden so much that it originally asked for
Wagner, considered the Michael Jordan of Arena football. Then, the
Kats asked for offensive specialist Mac Cody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very fortunate in having the opportunity to even be
allowed to speak to Jay about a position,'' Predators President
Jack Youngblood said. ``Nashville had a contract with him, and they
didn't have to let me speak to him. It was out of professional
courtesy that they did. He certainly could not take a lateral
position with anybody in the league. If offered a head coaching
position, he could.''
</P>
<P>
   And Gruden was gone, back to Florida, this time at war for the
``other'' guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little awkward at first,'' he said. ``But they
welcomed me.''
</P>
<P>
   There was rumor that Gruden was even going to don the Predators
uniform. He's 30, only a year older than Wagner and three years
older than the average age of the players he inherited from Perry
Moss.
</P>
<P>
   ``He petitioned the league to play,'' Rattlers Coach Danny White
said. ``I was not involved in it, but the league wouldn't let him.
You can't be a coach and a player. They're afraid teams would hide
players by paying them a coach's salary.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Gruden has the Predators (10-5) rolling. They beat
Nashville in the first round. Now they'll try to beat the Rattlers
(11-4) for the second time this season at America West Arena. The
semifinal game is Saturday at 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   One of Gruden's last games as a player came against the Rattlers
in '96, when he led the Storm to a 55-54 semifinal win.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the '96 title game, I was pretty beat,'' he said. ``It
was my fourth title. Nashville gave me a call and offered a nice
package. I decided to give my body a break. I can still wing it a
little bit. But I enjoy what I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   White calls Gruden one of the league's new wave of young
coaches, guys who spent several years as Arena players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you, it was a tremendous acquisition for us,''
said Youngblood, the former Los Angeles Rams All-Pro. ``Not only
from the standpoint of a coach and a person, but for what is ahead
of us. You have to look down the road. Where can Jay Gruden go?
He's got so much ahead of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Some wonder whether Gruden will end up in Oakland, where his
brother, Jon, is in his first year as head coach of the Raiders.
Jay, a former quarterback at Louisville, has had chances to join
NFL staffs. But he says he believes in the Arena league and where
it's going.
</P>
<P>
   Once considered a fad, the league is in its 12th season, ESPN
has gone from showing games on tape delay to telecasting them live
and, for the first time, the title game will be shown on national
network TV, by ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Gruden's fairy tale would be complete by beating his former
team, the top-seeded Storm, in the championship game in Tampa on
Aug. 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't get ahead of ourselves, but, yeah, that's a dream,''
Gruden said. ``That's the goal of any coach, winning the
championship.''

ARIZONA BOYS MAKING NAMES IN GYMNASTICS

<P>
   PHOENIX - The best-kept secret in Arizona gymnastics is not some
new twist or turn, or a preteen being able to float through the
air.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing that complex. This is simple: There are young male
gymnasts who are making as big of a splash in the sport as their
female counterparts, who get the bulk of the publicity at most
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Cody Moore is a twisting, turning, jumping example of just that.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, 17, one of the the top teenage gymnasts in the country,
will carry his No. 1 national ranking into next week's U.S.
Gymnastics Championships in Indianapolis.
</P>

   He'll be competing in the 17-and-under Junior division. His best
event is the pommel horse, and he hopes his effort there will
springboard him to the top of the heap.
</P>
<P>
   The top 12 finishers in both the Seniors and Juniors will make
the international traveling team, and from that group, the 2000
Olympians will be chosen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm expecting a good meet,'' said Moore, who will be a senior
at Horizon High School. ``I think I can finish in the top 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore, who competes for the Arizona Sunrays, and the other top
juniors in the country compete in the preliminary and event finals
Wednesday. Finals will be next Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   While this is seen as a major step toward the next Olympics,
that won't be on Moore's mind in Indianapolis. Thinking about that
pressure is fodder for another time. Now he just wants to
concentrate on being in top form next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot of time and practice (to get to this point),''
said Moore, who also plays golf and hockey while maintaining a 4.0
grade-point average. ``But it's worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because it takes male gymnasts longer to reach their
full potential, it's usually the females who get the most
recognition. But they get their payback if they stick with the
sport because they are usually able to compete longer.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, boys seem to stick with the sport longer than girls,
although Brian Robinson, Moore's coach, said that there has been a
drop-off in the number of boys competing nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of notice can be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get frustrated because of that,'' he said. ``You never
see a large number of people around. You have to love the sport. I
just started out liking it and never stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Gymnastics in the Valley suffered a jolt five years ago when
Arizona State University demoted the sport to club status. That
just added to the theory that men's gymnastics was on a lower rung.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Witenstein, the owner of the Sunrays club, which has about
1,500 members, said there are hundreds of boys involved in the
sport at his gym. And top-notch performers, such as Moore, usually
don't hit their peak until their early 20s. ``These are guys who
could be doing other sports, as well,'' Witenstein said. ``We're
proud of him. He has a good shot at winning.'' &QL;

UCLA LOADED FOR PAC-10  
 NEW PLAYERS EX PECTED TO FILL HOLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It says something about the respect UCLA commands _ or the
questionable judgment of Pac-10 media members _ that the Bruins
were picked to finish first in the conference despite losing seven
defensive starters and their top tailback.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's great, that's exciting,'' Coach Bob Toledo said.
``We're looking forward to it. Our players have a great attitude.
They're enthusiastic, and this adds fuel to the fire. They accept
challenges. And I don't mind it. I just hope to be ending up
first.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, who won their last 10 games, including a Cotton Bowl
victory against Texas A&AMP;M, edged ASU in the preseason poll by three
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Junior quarterback Cade McNown had a lot to do with that.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-1 left-hander led the nation in pass efficiency, and
his 168.6 rating was the best in conference history. The Bruins are
promoting him as a Heisman Trophy candidate. He will square off
against another one, Ricky Williams, in UCLA's opener against
Texas, a team it trounced last season, 66-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're going to be mad as hell,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA must replace three key offensive players: running back Skip
Hicks, tackle Chad Overhauser and wide receiver Jim McElroy. Hicks
and McElroy combined for 37 touchdowns last season.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks' backups, Jermaine Lewis and Keith Brown, will have shots
at the starting job, but don't be surprised if Toledo fills several
holes with younger players.
</P>
<P>
   Highly recruited tailback DeShaun Foster is among four true
freshmen who will be considered for the starting job.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're physically capable and mature enough, there's no
reason not to do it,'' Toledo said. ``In this day and age, with the
lack of (scholarships), freshmen have to contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though UCLA lost Overhauser and left guard Chad Sauter,
some believe the Bruins' line could be even better, thanks to the
return of Kris Farris (left tackle), Shawn Stuart (center) and Andy
Meyers (right guard).
</P>
<P>
   The defense was hit harder. Among those gone is defensive
coordinator Rocky Long. He was replaced by Nick Aliotti, who came
from the NFL's St. Louis Rams and also was behind the ``Gang
Green'' defense that helped Oregon win a conference title in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He'll have many holes to fill, including those created by
linebacker Brian Willmer and safety Shaun Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo believes his line could be more imposing than last
season. Starter Kenyon Coleman has added about 15 pounds since last
season, and junior Pete Holland looked solid in the spring, Toledo
said.
</P>
<P>
   Brendon Ayanbadejo, who had 15 tackles for losses as a junior,
returns at outside linebacker and should receive national
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot to replace,'' Toledo said. ``But I feel good
about what we have to work with.'' &QL;

FREEDMAN GIVEN OK TO PLAY IN '98

<TEXT>
<P>
   PAYSON _ Safety  &UR; Mitchell Freedman successfully completed his
summer school course work and is academically eligible to compete
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be on the bus,'' Arizona State Coach  &UR; Bruce Snyder said
before the team left for Camp Tontozona on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Running back  &UR; Marlon Farlow, receiver  &UR; Ricky Boyer and
linebacker  &UR; Larry
 &UR; Johnson did not make the trip. ASU does not know yet about those
players' eligibility, and they are not allowed to attend camp until
their records are approved.
</P>
<P>
   They could come to camp later in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Freedman's eligibility is a relief to a defense that returns
only one other starter, cornerback  &UR; Courtney Jackson, in the
secondary. Freedman was an all-Pac-10 pick last season. &QL; 
Decisions, decisions
</P>
<P>
   Former Mesa Mountain View High School star  &UR; Todd Heap couldn't
bear the thought of redshirting his first year at ASU, being
confined to the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't really been on the sideline much in the last three
years, so I didn't really know what I'd do if I was there,'' the
1997 ``Arizona Republic'' Class 5A football Player of the Year
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the freshman has thought plenty about skipping two full
seasons with the Sun Devils in order to complete a Mormon mission.
</P>
<P>
   When Heap signed, he made it clear to the coaching staff that he
intended to take a two-year vacation from football in order to
concentrate on his religious obligations. Heap originally planned
to take the break during what would have been his sophomore and
junior seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But now, after whispers have circulated that he could see
substantial playing time at tight end, Heap isn't so quick to etch
his future plans in stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to focus on having a good year here,'' Heap said.
``I'm focusing on this year, and then we'll go from there.'' &QL; 
Sometimes, scales do lie &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Redshirt freshman offensive lineman  &UR; Scott Peters said he didn't
realize the importance of conditioning during his first season with
the Sun Devils. Peters didn't figure out he wasn't staying in
proper shape until the spring game, where, he said, his lack of
conditioning led to a disappointing performance.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Peters began to make changes. He spent the entire
summer working out with ASU strength coach  &UR; Rich Wenner to increase
his endurance. The 6-foot-3 Peters, who appears much slimmer than a
year ago, said he didn't lose weight, but rather ``moved it around
a little.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Wenner got on me pretty good,'' said Peters, who weighs
315 pounds. ``The running did it for me, the heat really takes it
off you. And lifting just transferred the weight to better
places.''
</P>
<P>
   Peters has more upper-body strength and said his legs also feel
stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely learned my lesson,'' he said. &QL;

CHANGES IN THE AIR AT NAU  
 NEWCOMERS ABOUND WITH LUMBERJACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GINTONIO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Northern Arizona will have to rework a familiar phrase. The
Lumberjacks are hoping that unfamiliarity breeds success.
</P>
<P>
   First-year Coach Jerome Souers welcomes 85 players to today's
first practice, but 41 of them are new to the program. Included in
that number are 16 scholarship freshmen and 14 transfers.
</P>
<P>
   Souers was the defensive coordinator for Big Sky rival Montana
for 12 years. He inherits a team that went a disappointing 6-5 last
season after a 9-3 mark the previous year under former Coach Steve
Axman.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a special opportunity,'' Souers said. ``I think there
is a chance to develop a tremendous program and build on the
successes they have already had here.''
</P>
<P>
   There are eight starters returning, four each on offense and
defense. Headlining the offense is quarterback Travis Brown of
Phoenix, who was a finalist for the 1997 Walter Payton Award.
Defensively, linebackers Jake Crissup and Terrance Petty,
all-conference selections last season, return.
</P>
<P>
   One player who was expected to be a big contributor this season,
defensive end Nick Petrucci, has not fully recovered from a knee
injury suffered in the 10th game last season and will sit out the
season. NAU is expected to petition the NCAA for a sixth season of
eligibility for Petrucci.
</P>
<P>
   The Lumberjacks will hold two-a-day workouts through Aug. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everything will be new around the field. As Souers and
his staff puts in their system, working with the large group of
newcomers, a few other things will change, as well. In the morning
sessions, the team will be split into two groups to allow players
more time to learn the system and get in more repetitions. The
entire squad will be together for the afternoon practices.
</P>
<P>
   Services for former player &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Funeral services are scheduled for 1 p.m. Friday in Tucson's
Bring Funeral Home for David Couture, 23, a former NAU player who
was killed in a skydiving accident Sunday in Pierce County, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   He started all 11 games at defensive end last fall and was named
the school's Golden Eagle Scholar-Athlete of the Year, NAU's
highest student-athlete award.
</P>
<P>
   With a degree in mechanical engineering, he had accepted a
position with Boeing in Everett, Wash. &QL;

EDITORIAL: A $48 BILLION BET ON OIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Aug. 13:
</P>
<P>
   That a proposed merger of two oil companies can be the largest
international takeover ever proposed is a reminder that oil remains
an essential part of the world economy. But the proposed
combination of British Petroleum and Amoco announced this week also
shows just how weak that industry is at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   The oil industry, like many other commodity-based businesses,
has been damaged by the weakness of the world economy in the wake
of the Asian financial crisis. Asia had been the most rapidly
growing market for oil. Now Asian sales are shrinking, and world
oil prices have fallen despite repeated efforts by producing
countries to limit supplies. Adjusted for inflation, oil is cheaper
now than it was before the first oil shock, a quarter of a century
ago.
</P>
<P>
   That is good news for consumers, and not completely bad for the
oil industry. There is less talk of alternative energy sources that
will supplant oil, and a lower cost of crude oil means that the oil
companies' refining and marketing operations have a better chance
for profits, in part because lower prices stimulate demand over
time.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the trend to energy-inefficient sport utility
vehicles would have been less likely had oil prices stayed high.
But those benefits are more than offset by the lower profits made
from finding and selling the now-cheap crude oil.
</P>
<P>
   The big question facing international oil companies is not
addressed by this deal. It is the issue of how aggressive they
should be in going after new sources of oil, particularly in
volatile areas like the Caspian Sea Basin with high political risk
and a need for extensive investment to get out any oil that is
found.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the big international projects now under way make no
sense economically at current levels of oil prices. If prices fail
to rise, companies that make big bets on those projects will
suffer. But if prices do recover, a failure to invest now could
lead to a deterioration in competitive position in future years.
</P>
<P>
   Those who think the BP-Amoco merger will be the first of a
series argue that a large size and international diversification
are needed to enable a company to make needed investments while not
being overly exposed in a single region or project. But it is hard
to believe that BP, whose 1997 revenues came to $72 billion, was
not large enough before it agreed to pay $48 billion for Amoco.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the success or failure of this merger will not be
based on the benefits of size, or in the $2 billion of annual
savings the companies hope to wring out of duplicated and
overlapping operations. It will depend on the success of the
company in finding and developing new oilfields at a reasonable
cost, and on whether oil prices remain depressed for a prolonged
period.

RECEIVER MCDANIEL HAS WILDCATS TALKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOUGLAS, Ariz. Some of Arizona's highest expectations for the
1998 football season have surrounded wide receiver  &UR; Jeremy
McDaniel, a redshirt last year beacuse of a thigh injury.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday morning's opening practice, there were 10 reasons
for all the talk.
</P>
<P>
   McDaniel, a 6-foot-1, 194 pound senior, caught 10 passes. One
was a beautful reception of a tipped ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of 1996, he was the best receiver in the Pac-10,''
Coach
 &UR; Dick Tomey said of McDaniel, who is best remembered for 14
receptions and 283 yards in a four-overtime game against
California.
</P>
<P>
   UA coaches say McDaniel has improved from 1996. One reason is
off-season work against Wildcats cornerback  &UR; Chris McAlister, a
preseason All-American. &QL; 
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   A full complement of 106 players is expected in camp today.
Nineteen players missed Wednesday morning's opener at Cochise
College. They were still in Tucson for final exams.
</P>
<P>
   The first practice in pads is scheduled for Saturday. Until
there is some hittiing, Tomey said it will be difficult to make any
solid judgments about some areas of concern along the offensive and
defensive lines.
</P>
<P>
   Junior tailback  &UR; Trung Canidate, a starter last season from
Central High School, will miss at least the first few days of camp.
His right foot is still in cast. He underwent off-season surgery
for a stress fracture. The cast is scheduled to be removed Friday,
when physicians hope to determine if the fracture has mended.
 &UR; Kelvin
 &UR; Eafon is the probable starter if Canidate can't play.
</P>
<P>
   McAlister, on the possibility that he'll see double duty as a
receiver: ``The  &UR; Charles Woodson era would soon disappear.''
Woodson turned double duty at Michigan last season into the Heisman
Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   New offensive coordinator  &UR; Dino Babers, on whether he will use
McAlister at receiver: ``Maybe by the 12th game.''
</P>
<P>
   At the cornerback spot opposite of the much-hyped McAlister,
there is  &UR; Kelvin Hunter, who plans to play with a metal plate and
nine screws in an ankle that was broken during last year's
Insight.com Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Tomey has sophomore  &UR; Bruce Wiggins penciled in as starting
center. At backup?  &UR; Steven Grace, a redshirt freshman last year who
already is listed at starting left guard. &QL;

EDITORIAL: MINING PLATINUM IN MONTANA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Aug. 13:
</P>
<P>
   One of the hardest problems facing anyone who cares about
environmental matters is keeping a sense of scale. The big battles
are so wearing that it can be hard to concentrate on the small
ones, and true disasters _ an Exxon Valdez, for instance _ set a
precedent that seems to diminish the importance of more modest
offenses.
</P>
<P>
   But the principles that govern the environmental movement are
not scalable. They apply just as readily in limited cases of
potential damage as they do in cases of wholesale negligence or
criminal intent.
</P>
<P>
   A good example is the East Boulder platinum mine now being
developed by Stillwater Mining Co. in Montana's Absaroka Mountains.
At first glance the project seems far less threatening than the
infamous New World gold mine, which was blocked at an early stage
in 1996. The New World mine was sited only a few miles from
Yellowstone National Park, in seismically active terrain, and any
runoff from the acidic wastes it generated would have drained into
the Clark's Fork of the Yellowstone River, as well as the park
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Platinum, moreover, is arguably a more essential metal than
gold, and Stillwater Mining Co. already operates a platinum mine _
the only one in the Western Hemisphere _ on the east side of the
Absarokas. Most of the permits for the East Boulder mine are in
place, exploratory drilling has begun, and the new mine is hiring.
It is business as usual. But business as usual in Montana hard-rock
mining has left the state dotted with Superfund sites and dead
streams, and the potential exists for a similar result at the East
Boulder mine.
</P>
<P>
   Every mine needs to dispose of water, usually water discovered
during tunneling. The company's plan is to discharge the water
directly into the East Boulder River, a pristine stream containing
native cutthroat trout. The mine water is unusually high in
manganese and iron, and under present state regulations governing
groundwater contamination, it would have to be treated.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Montana's Department of Environmental Quality is
preparing to weaken those rules _ in effect giving the company a
license to pollute while overriding other state laws that now give
the river special protected status. The Environmental Quality
Department has long been excessively sympathetic to industry's
ambitions. It plans to do as little to protect Montana's
environment in this case as it has done in others.
</P>
<P>
   Local environmentalists are pressing the department to require
treatment of the mine water before it is released into the river,
along with extensive monitoring of the river. Unless this is done,
the department should withhold any further permits and the mine
should not proceed.
</P>
<P>
   As always, what looms behind a mining story is the archaic but
forceful 1872 Mining Law, which stipulates that mining is the
highest and best use of land. The opposite has been proved in
Montana many times over. At the East Boulder mine, Stillwater
Mining has an opportunity to take the lead in environmentally sound
mining practices. It cannot do so if, in complicity with a
mining-friendly agency, it begins by weakening standards designed
to protect the environment. &QL;

 By FIONA ORTIZ, with SERGIO R. BUSTOS in Miami 
 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    GUATEMALA CITY _ Roberto Castaneda exported an average of 40,000
flats of luscious raspberries to the United States each year,
fetching prices of up to US$30 per flat. He says he and other
raspberry farmers were exporting 1.5 million trays a year, with 80
percent bound for the U.S. market. But the good times ended last
year when U.S. authorities found a parasite called cyclospora, and
traced it to Guatemala.
 &HT;    The parasite sickened more than 1,000 people in the United
States and Canada with diarrhea.
 &HT;    With U.S. supermarkets rushing to cancel orders, Guatemalan
raspberry farmers were forced to suspend exports for four months in
mid-1997. The suspension was followed by a ban earlier this year by
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The two actions
devastated Guatemalan growers.
 &HT;    ``After two seasons without exporting, a lot of people got out
of the business for good,'' says Castaneda, president of a growers
organization called the Guatemala Berry Commission. At least 20
farmers went out of business, while others abandoned the U.S.
market in search of buyers in Europe, he says.
 &HT;    Guatemala was not the only country censured by U.S. authorities
for exporting tainted food. Last year, Mexican strawberry growers
were blamed for a breakout of hepatitis in five U.S. states. And,
in 1992, a case of Histamime poisoning involving 74 people on the
U.S. East Coast was traced back to Ecuadorean fishermen who
exported fresh tuna.
 &HT;    The public health concerns over imported food safety have
prompted a political furor in the United States. And the furor
isn't showing any signs of disappearing. In June, U.S. Senator John
Dingell, of Michigan, introduced a bill in Congress that will give
the FDA more authority to inspect food products, slap a $20 charge
on all food imports and require ``country-of-origin'' labeling on
all imported food products. The bill _ The Imported Food Safety Act
of 1998 _ has 15 co-sponsors. This summer, Congress is holding
hearings, with one specifically focusing on Central American
raspberry exports.
 &HT;    ``American consumers are being used as guinea pigs,'' Dingell
recently told Congress in introducing his bill. The bill was
prompted by a recent U.S. General Accounting Office study that
found that less than 2 percent of all food products imported into
the United States were ever inspected or tested by FDA officials.
 &HT;    For Latin American farmers, who count on the U.S. market to
receive their exported array of food products, the harsher line
being taken threatens to hurt sales of fresh fruits and fresh
vegetables. Over the last five years, the volume of imported food
has doubled into the United States. Last year, the United States
imported more than 38 percent of the fresh fruit and more than 12
percent of fresh vegetables consumed nationwide. U.S. government
figures show that Latin America and the Caribbean supplies 100
percent of all banana imports and 80 percent of all fresh fruit
imports.
 &HT;    Since being singled out for their tainted raspberries,
Guatemalan growers have promised to improve sanitation standards by
installing biological water filters, establishing a coding system
to identify flats of raspberries and insisting that raspberry
workers wash their hands more often. But the efforts are not enough
for U.S. authorities who have yet to lift the ban on Guatemalan
raspberries.
 &HT;    Ironically, it was the U.S. government in 1991 _ through the
Agency for International Development (AID) _ that helped nurture
the growth of the lucrative Guatemalan raspberry business. Growing
the fruit was touted as a way for Guatemala to diversify its
coffee-dependent agriculture industry and to satisfy American
demand for off-season raspberries.
 &HT;    The Guatemalan case is problematic because there are no lab
tests to find cyclospora on fruit. Also, nobody knows if the
parasite comes from the dirty hands of raspberry workers in packing
plants, contaminated irrigation water or some other source.
 &HT;    ``A lot of information is not known,'' says Carl Reynolds, an
FDA official.
 &HT;    Guatemalan farmers insist there is no definitive proof the bug
is on their raspberries. They say the cyclospora scare was fueled
by U.S. and Chilean farmers who could not compete with the
Guatemala raspberry boom. They say slim scientific evidence is
being used as a political trade barrier.
 &HT;    ``This measure by the U.S. will boomerang, because when they
begin to demand such minute standards, they will have to apply them
in their own territory,'' says Ricardo Santa Cruz, of Guatemala's
Association of Exporters of Non-Traditional Products.
 &HT;    Today, despite being dejected and disgruntled with U.S.
authorities, Guatemalan growers are trying to meet FDA demands.
Guatemalan Agriculture Minister Mariano Ventura has set up a joint
government-business committee to inspect all farms using a rigorous
point system, examining everything from water quality to packing
houses. The growers are also setting up a numbering system for
every flat of berries to make sure inspectors can trace any
outbreak back to a specific grower.
 &HT;    Back on Castaneda's 26-acre farm, Planessa, near the colonial
town of Antiqua, he has installed filters _ at a cost of $7,000 _
to screen parasites out of water used on the farm. Raspberry
sorters in his plant wear hair nets, dusters and masks, and a
monitor logs every time a workers goes to the bathroom and washes
their hands. The new procedures and equipment raised operating
costs by 15 percent, he says.
 &HT;    Other growers balk at the costs, and are waiting to see whether
Castaneda's filters do the trick before they install their own.
Castaneda says a dozen growers will be certified to export in 1999,
but it remains to be seen whether they can recapture the lost
market.
 &HT;    ``The hardest part is to recover the image for our
raspberries,'' he says.

STEEL COMES BACK AT CALLAWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Callaway Golf went back to the future on
Wednesday, announcing its new Big Bertha ``Steelhead'' line of
woods at the PGA Championship. The California-based club
manufacturer hopes the club will turn around a struggling market
that has sent Callaway stock plunging in the first half of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Steelhead, which is made from old-fashioned steel, features
significant weighting in the bottom of the club and a new ``Hawk
Eye'' sole plate. The club is a departure from titanium, the metal
that has dominated the market for the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   The new line is an obvious move to regain sales Callaway has
lost to smaller, shallow-faced woods made by Orlimar and Tight
Lies. Both rely on a low center of gravity like the Steelhead, but
the Steelhead is 33 percent larger, a feature that Callaway claims
allows the average golfer more latitude on mishits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a reasonably high respect for the competition, but I
take exception to their claim that `oversized is overrated,' ''
said company founder Ely Callaway, pointing out that half of the
woods used in professional golf are made by his company, and
another 30 percent of the market is dominated by other oversize
manufacturers, according to the Darrell Survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the shallow-faced club is a basic design flaw, and we
don't build flaws into our clubs.''
</P>
<P>
   Callaway said his company will continue to manufacture the Big
Bertha titanium woods, but that the Steelhead will replace its
Warbird line.
</P>
<P>
   The Steelhead also is more reasonably priced. The Big Bertha
woods cost between $300 and $500; the new line will retail in the
$250 to $275 range.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Dye, company president and chief executive officer, said
the Steelhead will boost sales, which were down to $410 million
during the first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been under some level of assault because our stock moved
from the high 20s to the low teens,'' Dye said.
</P>
<P>
   Callaway Golf trotted out its stable of stars for the
announcement, including Colin Montgomerie, Paul Azinger and John
Daly, who stole the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I signed my driver (on Tuesday) and gave it to a little fellow
on the eighth hole (at Sahalee Country Club),'' Daly reported.
``Goodbye, titanium; hello, steel.''
</P>
<P>
   The Steelhead fairway woods go on sale today in 52 countries,
although the driver will not be available until October. &QL;

CARDINAL HELPS PARALYZED TEEN

<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. _ Thanks to one huge benefactor, a Cardinals
defensive lineman, 17-year-old B.J. Carlson is free again to roam
the beautiful piney countryside around here.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 14, 1996, the first day of school, a bus carrying 32
kids rolled on its way to Sinagua High School. All 32 were injured,
with Carlson being one of the most severely injured. Ever since, he
has been a paraplegic and needs a wheelchair to get around.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals lineman, who is known for his part in several
charitable activities but requested that his name be withheld, has
presented Carlson with a three-wheel, hand-controlled mountain bike
at no small expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Christian man and I do deeds like this from my heart and
not for publicity, so please don't involve my name,'' the lineman
said. ``If I gain publicity from it, it takes away from the
sincerity of the act.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlson, an upbeat young man who hopes someday to leave his
wheelchair ``if medical science comes through,'' is a senior at
Sinagua who plans to attend college and become an engineer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an exercise machine in my house, but it's inside, and I
don't get to see things,'' he said after the Cardinals' morning
practice Tuesday. ``This gives me a chance to be outside and see
the trees, the countryside, and enjoy it. It really means a lot to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Flagstaff resident Larry Weidner has established a B.J. Carlson
Education Fund and is selling raffle tickets in the area to help
cover Carlson's college costs. The winner will receive a new Ford
F-150 truck. &QL;

TEXAS JURY CLEARS WEALTHY EX-BOOKIE IN WIFE'S SLAYING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE BREWER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A wealthy ex-bookie accused of plotting his estranged
wife's death to protect his fortune in a divorce was acquitted of
capital murder Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Angleton, who had been incarcerated since his arrest Aug.
1, 1997, said one of the first things he would do is visit the
grave of his wife, Doris McGown Angleton.
</P>
<P>
   As the jury's verdict was read before a packed courtroom
Wednesday, Angleton tearfully hugged two of his defense attorneys,
Stanley Schneider and George Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors Ted Wilson and Lyn McClellan appeared stunned, and
the courtroom fell silent for several seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, after his release from the Harris County Jail,
Angleton spoke briefly to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't get much happier than I feel right now,'' he said,
before being whisked away by his lawyers in a large sports utility
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Angleton's mother, Ann Borochoff, would only say that she
was relieved the long trial had ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just grateful that it's over,'' said Borochoff, flanked
by relatives and friends. ``It's been very emotional for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Angleton, who made his fortune running an illegal gambling
operation, is only the second capital murder defendant in Harris
County history to win acquittal when a death sentence was sought.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors, who were sequestered by state District Judge Brian Rains
for two nights, handed down the decision after 18 hours of
deliberations over three days.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the panel said a tape recording prosecutors claimed
incriminated Angleton was the key to their decision.
</P>
<P>
   They said after hearing testimony from a defense voice expert,
who was initially hired by the state, they were not convinced the
voice on the tape was Angleton's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key in the case is that his voice is not on that tape,''
said lead defense attorney Michael Ramsey after the verdict. ``The
only piece of evidence in the case that was of any consequence was
the tape recording, and once we found out his voice was not on that
tape to a certainty, and it was just virtual certainty, then it was
just a matter of waiting for justice to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Angleton was accused of conspiring with his brother, Roger, to
kill Doris Angleton, whose body was found by police in the couple's
River Oaks area home April 16, 1997. She had been shot 13 times,
seven times in the head, during an ambush while her husband and
twin daughters were at a softball game.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers were arrested on murder charges, but Roger Angleton
killed himself in jail Feb. 7, leaving notes behind claiming that
he had framed his brother as part of an elaborate extortion
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Rains ruled the suicide notes inadmissible, and prosecutors
discounted them, arguing that Robert Angleton hired his brother to
carry out the slaying to protect the bookie's millions from an
impending divorce.
</P>
<P>
   The defense countered that Robert Angleton was a victim of a
bizarre plot hatched by his oddball brother, who had blackmailed
him once before, in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the defense said, the divorce between Robert and
Doris was proceeding amicably.
</P>
<P>
   Those contentions came in the face of circumstantial evidence
that prosecutors believed unerringly linked Robert Angleton to the
murder.
</P>
<P>
   The state relied on notes outlining the plot that were found in
Roger Angleton's briefcase when he was arrested in Las Vegas in
June 1997 on an unrelated charge.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the briefcase was $64,000 in cash and money wrappers
that had Robert Angleton's fingerprints on them.
</P>
<P>
   But the most vital evidence was the tape. Two men can be heard
on the scratchy audiotape plotting the murder and discussing
security at the Angleton home. Prosecutors said the voices are
those of the brothers and they called a procession of witnesses to
identify the defendant's voice.
</P>
<P>
   Those witnesses included friends of the victim, police officers
and an FBI agent who heard Robert Angleton's voice on a wiretap in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey attacked the credibility of some of the state's voice
witnesses. He characterized many of them as members of the ``Nancy
Drew division'' of a tennis club, where he says they sat around
drinking cocktails and gossiping about the case.
</P>
<P>
   The defense also called its own string of witnesses, including
Angleton's twin daughters, who said it wasn't their father's voice.
</P>
<P>
   There was also the testimony of voice-analysis experts,
especially Steve Cain, and that's what defense attorneys say turned
the case in their favor.
</P>
<P>
   Cain, who is based in Wisconsin, was hired by prosecutors to
compare the tape seized from among Roger Angleton's belongings with
a voice sample of Robert Angleton taken by Houston police.
</P>
<P>
   Cain told prosecutors the trial tape was probably a copy of an
original recording and that it was ``possible'' to eliminate Robert
Angleton as being one of the men on it.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, Cain was hired by the defense. His
videotaped testimony, taken before trial, was played for jurors and
was backed up by another expert who testified in person.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Steve Cain's honest assessment of the voice on the
tape along with (the other expert) was the cincher,'' Schneider
said afterward. ``The science is what won it.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had another voice-analysis expert of their own
waiting in the wings but opted not to call him to the stand.
Instead, they tried to convince jurors that their witnesses,
combined with the content of the tape, were good enough to link
Robert Angleton to the plot.
</P>
<P>
   Another twist was a defense theory that two gunmen, not one,
killed Doris Angleton. Though prosecutors dismissed that as a
convenient way to explain the two voices on the tape, at least one
juror said he believed it.
</P>
<P>
   After the shock of the verdict had worn off, prosecutors said
they could only accept the jury's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really, frankly thought it would be a guilty verdict or a
hung jury,'' Wilson said. ``I'm assuming there must have been some
reasonable doubt about whether he was on the tape or not.''
</P>
<P>
   McClellan said he looks forward to talking to the jurors soon to
get their thoughts, especially since prosecutors thought the case
was solid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept waiting for something (from the defense) to fall out of
the sky and hit me like a safe, but that just didn't happen,''
McClellan said.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict notwithstanding, Robert Angleton's legal problems
might not be over.
</P>
<P>
   McClellan said he thinks the IRS should look into the bookie's
illegal financial dealings in light of the millions found stashed
in safety deposit boxes during the murder investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the IRS doesn't look at that, I don't know what they're
doing,'' McClellan said.

   FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. _ Peering behind those dark sunglasses Friday
night at Sun Devil Stadium could be Andre Wadsworth, the Cardinals'
unsigned first-round draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth, continuing to make the rounds on the Valley
sports-talk radio circuit, said Wednesday on KMVP-AM (860) that he
might attend a game ``in person.'' He said he would go incognito.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals play host to the Chicago Bears on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know,'' he said. ``I might sitting in the stands. .
. . I'll just wear a cap,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Ferguson, vice president of player personnel of the
Cardinals, said, ``We'd love to have him.'' But Ferguson didn't say
if Wadsworth would have to buy a ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth's holdout reached its 21st day Wednesday and the two
sides remain far apart.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth also said he plans to ask the Cardinals for a one-year
contract after the club rejected his offers for four- and five-year
deals. The most the Cardinals could pay Wadsworth in a one-year
deal is $1.88 million, including a $1.636 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth, the Florida State defensive end who was the third
pick overall in the draft, could earn as much as a $10.4 million
signing bonus in a six-year deal. &QL;

 Por FIONA ORTIZ, con SERGIO R. BUSTOS en Miami 
 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    CIUDAD DE GUATEMALA _ Roberto Castaneda Solares exportaba todos
los anos a Estados Unidos un promedio de 40.000 bandejas de
preciosas frambuesas, a un precio de US$30 la unidad. Afirma que el
y otros cultivadores guatemaltecos ya exportaban un millon y medio
de bandejas al ano, el 80 por ciento al mercado estadounidense.
Pero los buenos tiempos se acabaron el ano pasado, cuando las
autoridades sanitarias de EU descubrieron la presencia de un
parasito llamado ciclospora en un cargamento de frambuesas, y la
investigacion los llevo hasta Guatemala.
 &HT;    Mas de un millar de estomagos sufrieron los efectos del parasito
en Estados Unidos y Canada.
 &HT;    Cuando los supermercados estadounidenses se apresuraron a
cancelar sus pedidos, los cultivadores guatemaltecos de frambuesas
se vieron obligados a detener las exportaciones a mediados de 1997.
A la suspension siguio una prohibicion a principios de este ano por
parte de la Direccion de Alimentos y Medicamentos de EU (FDA).
Estos dos acontecimientos devastaron a los cultivadores
guatemaltecos.
 &HT;    ``Despues de dos cosechas sin exportar, muchos se retiraron
permanentemente del negocio,'' afirma Castaneda, presidente de una
organizacion de cultivadores llamada Comite de Berries de
Guatemala. Al menos 20 cultivadores se retiraron del negocio y
otros abandonaron el mercado estadounidense en busca de compradores
en Europa, agrega Castaneda.
 &HT;    Guatemala no fue el unico pais censurado por las autoridades
norteamericanas por exportar alimentos contaminados. El ano pasado,
Estados Unidos culpo a varios cultivadores mexicanos de fresas por
una epidemia de hepatitis en cinco estados norteamericanos. Y en
1992 se determino que el atun fresco exportado por pescadores
ecuatorianos causo un envenenamiento con histamina que afecto a 48
personas en la costa este norteamericana.
 &HT;    Las preocupaciones sobre la seguridad de los alimentos
importados para la salud publica han creado un furor en Estados
Unidos, que no muestra senales de ceder. En junio, el senador John
Dingell, de Michigan, presento un proyecto de ley que da a la FDA
mas autoridad para inspeccionar alimentos, aplicar un impuesto de
US$20 a todas las importaciones de alimentos y exigir una
denominacion de origen a todos los productos alimenticios
importados. El proyecto de ley, llamado Ley de Seguridad de 1998
para los Alimentos Importados, cuenta con 15 copatrocinadores. Este
verano boreal el Congreso de EU celebrara audiencias sobre el tema,
y una de ellas se centrara en las exportaciones de arandanos
centroamericanos.
 &HT;    ``Los consumidores estadounidenses hacen las veces de conejillos
de Indias,'' expreso recientemente Dingell ante el Congreso al
presentar su proyecto legislativo. El proyecto surgio de un
reciente informe de la Oficina de Fiscalizacion, brazo
investigativo del Congreso, que determino que la FDA inspecciona
menos del 2 por ciento de los alimentos importadosa que llegan al
pais.
 &HT;    Para los agricultores latinoamericanos, que cuentan con el
mercado de EU, las nuevas restricciones amenazan las ventas de
frutas y hortalizas frescas. Durante los ultimos cinco anos, el
volumen de alimentos que EU importa se ha duplicado. El ano pasado,
EU importo mas del 38 por ciento de las frutas frescas y mas del 12
por ciento de las hortalizas frescas que se consumieron a nivel
nacional. Las cifras que maneja Washington indican que America
Latina y el Caribe cubren el 100 por ciento de las importaciones de
bananos y el 80 por ciento de todas las frutas frescas.
 &HT;    Por su parte, los cultivadores guatemaltecos de frambuesas han
prometido mejorar sus normas sanitarias con la instalacion de
filtros especiales de agua, el establecimiento de un sistema de
codificacion para identificar las bandejas de frambuesas e insistir
en que sus empleados se laven las manos con mas frecuencia. Pero
esos esfuerzos no son suficientes para las autoridades
estadounidenses, que aun no han levantado la prohibicion.
 &HT;    Ironicamente, fue el gobierno estadounidense el que en 1991 _ a
traves de la Agencia para el Desarrollo Internacional (AID) _ ayudo
a desarrollar el lucrativo negocio de las frambuesas en Guatemala.
El cultivo de las frambuesas se considero una forma en que el pais
podia diversificar su agricultura, dependiente del cafe, y
satisfacer a la vez la demanda de frambuesas.
 &HT;    El caso de Guatemala es problematico porque no existe ninguna
prueba de laboratorio que detecte la presencia de ciclospora en la
fruta. Ademas, nadie sabe si el parasito proviene de la suciedad
que pudiera afectar las manos de los empleados en las plantas de
empaque, de agua contaminada u otras fuentes.
 &HT;    ``No se tiene mucha informacion,'' reconoce Carl Reynolds,
funcionario de la FDA.
 &HT;    Los agricultores guatemaltecos insisten en que no hay una prueba
definitiva de que sus frambuesas esten contaminadas y alegan que el
temor a la ciclospora fue alentado por granjeros estadounidenses y
chilenos que no podian competir con las frambuesas guatemaltecas.
Tambien insisten en que una evidencia cientifica muy poco
convincente se usa como barrera politica al comercio.
 &HT;    ``Esta medida de Estados Unidos terminara por afectarlos porque
cuando comiencen a exigir controles tan minuciosos, entonces
tendran que aplicarlos en su propio territorio,'' dice Ricardo
Santa Cruz, de la Asociacion de Exportadores de Productos No
Tradicionales de Guatemala.
 &HT;    Hoy, a pesar del rechazo de las autoridades estadounidenses, los
agricultores guatemaltecos tratan de cumplir las normas de la FDA.
El ministro de Agricultura de Guatemala, Mariano Ventura, ha
establecido una comision conjunta entre el gobierno y el
empresariado para inspeccionar todas las granjas que usan un
riguroso sistema que controla desde la calidad del agua hasta la
plantas de empaque. Los agricultores tambien han comenzado a
implantar un sistema de control de inventario para cada bandeja de
frambuesas, con el fin de que los inspectores puedan saber
exactamente de que productor provienen.
 &HT;    En la finca de 10,5 hectareas de Castaneda, llamada Planessa,
cerca de la ciudad colonial de Antigua, se han instalado filtros de
agua (a un costo de US$7.000) para eliminar cualquier parasito
presente en el agua. En su planta, el personal usa gorros y
mascaras, y un inspector anota cada vez que los empleados van al
bano y se asean las manos. Los nuevos equipos y procedimientos han
hecho aumentar los costos operativos en un 15 por ciento, afirma
Castaneda.
 &HT;    Otros agricultores dicen que el costo es demasiado elevado y
prefieren esperar a ver si los filtros que instalo Castaneda dan
resultados antes de hacer la inversion. Castaneda afirma que en
1999 se certificara a una docena de productores para la
exportacion, pero todavia hay que determinar si se pueden recuperar
los mercados perdidos.
 &HT;    ``Lo mas dificil de todo es recuperar la imagen de nuestras
frambuesas,'' dice Castaneda.

y una de ellas se centrara en las exportaciones de arandanos
centroamericanos.
 &HT;    ``Los consumidores estadounidenses hacen las veces de conejillos
de Indias,'' expreso recientemente Dingell ante el Congreso al
presentar su proyecto legislativo. El proyecto surgio de un
reciente informe de la Oficina de Fiscalizacion, brazo
investigativo del Congreso, que determino que la FDA inspecciona
menos del 2 por ciento de los alimentos importadosa que llegan al
pais.
 &HT;    Para los agricultores latinoamericanos, que cuentan con el
mercado de EU, las nuevas restricciones amenazan las ventas de
frutas y hortalizas frescas. Durante los ultimos cinco anos, el
volumen de alimentos que EU importa se ha duplicado. El ano pasado,
EU importo mas del 38 por ciento de las frutas frescas y mas del 12
por ciento de las hortalizas frescas que se consumieron a nivel
nacional. Las cifras que maneja Washington indican que America
Latina y el Caribe cubren el 100 por ciento de las importaciones de
bananos y el 80 por ciento de todas las frutas frescas.
 &HT;    Por su parte, los cultivadores guatemaltecos de frambuesas han
prometido mejorar sus normas sanitarias con la instalacion de
filtros especiales de agua, el establecimiento de un sistema de
codificacion para identificar las bandejas de frambuesas e insistir
en que sus empleados se laven las manos con mas frecuencia. Pero
esos esfuerzos no son suficientes para las autoridades
estadounidenses, que aun no han levantado la prohibicion.
 &HT;    Ironicamente, fue el gobierno estadounidense el que en 1991 _ a
traves de la Agencia para el Desarrollo Internacional (AID) _ ayudo
a desarrollar el lucrativo negocio de las frambuesas en Guatemala.
El cultivo de las frambuesas se considero una forma en que el pais
podia diversificar su agricultura, dependiente del cafe, y
satisfacer a la vez la demanda de frambuesas.
 &HT;    El caso de Guatemala es problematico porque no existe ninguna
prueba de laboratorio que detecte la presencia de ciclospora en la
fruta. Ademas, nadie sabe si el parasito proviene de la suciedad
que pudiera afectar las manos de los empleados en las plantas de
empaque, de agua contaminada u otras fuentes.
 &HT;    ``No se tiene mucha informacion,'' reconoce Carl Reynolds,
funcionario de la FDA.
 &HT;    Los agricultores guatemaltecos insisten en que no hay una prueba
definitiva de que sus frambuesas esten contaminadas y alegan que el
temor a la ciclospora fue alentado por granjeros estadounidenses y
chilenos que no podian competir con las frambuesas guatemaltecas.
Tambien insisten en que una evidencia cientifica muy poco
convincente se usa como barrera politica al comercio.
 &HT;    ``Esta medida de Estados Unidos terminara por afectarlos porque
cuando comiencen a exigir controles tan minuciosos, entonces
tendran que aplicarlos en su propio territorio,'' dice Ricardo
Santa Cruz, de la Asociacion de Exportadores de Productos No
Tradicionales de Guatemala.
 &HT;    Hoy, a pesar del rechazo de las autoridades estadounidenses, los
agricultores guatemaltecos tratan de cumplir las normas de la FDA.
El ministro de Agricultura de Guatemala, Mariano Ventura, ha
establecido una comision conjunta entre el gobierno y el
empresariado para inspeccionar todas las granjas que usan un
riguroso sistema que controla desde la calidad del agua hasta la
plantas de empaque. Los agricultores tambien han comenzado a
implantar un sistema de control de inventario para cada bandeja de
frambuesas, con el fin de que los inspectores puedan saber
exactamente de que productor provienen.
 &HT;    En la finca de 10,5 hectareas de Castaneda, llamada Planessa,
cerca de la ciudad colonial de Antigua, se han instalado filtros de
agua (a un costo de US$7.000) para eliminar cualquier parasito
presente en el agua. En su planta, el personal usa gorros y
mascaras, y un inspector anota cada vez que los empleados van al
bano y se asean las manos. Los nuevos equipos y procedimientos han
hecho aumentar los costos operativos en un 15 por ciento, afirma
Castaneda.
 &HT;    Otros agricultores dicen que el costo es demasiado elevado y
prefieren esperar a ver si los filtros que instalo Castaneda dan
resultados antes de hacer la inversion. Castaneda afirma que en
1999 se certificara a una docena de productores para la
exportacion, pero todavia hay que determinar si se pueden recuperar
los mercados perdidos.
 &HT;    ``Lo mas dificil de todo es recuperar la imagen de nuestras
frambuesas,'' dice Castaneda.

COOL DRIVE ON A HOT DAY  
 FOLLOW THE MEAN DERING TRAILS THROUGH BRADSHAW MOUNTAINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This isn't the time of year considered prime for off-highway
trips in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, it's too hot. And without vehicle windows open, you
lose touch with the wilderness passing by. Besides that, the air
conditioner might heat up the engine when you climb steep grades.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes you get lucky.
</P>
<P>
   It was cloudy, warm and humid in Phoenix at 6:30 Monday morning.
But Ed Fouts of Phoenix had planned a trip to higher country _
through the Bradshaw Mountains, to be precise.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to get off Interstate 17 at the Bumble Bee exit and
ride unpaved dirt roads for 60 miles or so to U.S. 89 near Kirkland
Junction.
</P>
<P>
   The air conditioner ran all the way to the Bumble Bee turnoff,
where we stopped and dropped the air pressure in the Blazer's tires
to about 30 pounds. Washboard and rocky roads would seem much
smoother with the tires made softer.
</P>
<P>
   It also was much cooler at this higher altitude. So down went
the windows for much of the long trip ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The first leg of this trip would wind through the old mining
town of Cleator, famous for its independent residents. The sign was
gone, but there used to be one that said, ``Trespassers Will Be
Shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Having Fouts, who has traveled the desert seemingly forever, as
a rider is like traveling with a talking history book. He pointed
out the various mines, bridge abutments that supported supply
wagons on their way to the mines and the path of the mining
railroad.
</P>
<P>
   That all was impressive, but no more so than the desert
vegetation. Usually, by this time of year, there is a predominance
of dried plants. Not this year. The desert was green and lush as
the road traveled higher and higher. Agave plants sent up tall
stalks topped by bright yellow flowers. Closer to the ground were
all types of wildflowers.
</P>
<P>
   Then we were into the switchbacks on the steep climb to Crown
King, the mining town turned vacation community. The road is built
on the old railroad bed, and at the switchbacks, Fouts pointed out
where trains used to pull in and then back up the next grade, since
the turns were too tight for them to make.
</P>
<P>
   This part of the trip to Crown King can be made by car, but when
you leave the old mining town on Senator Highway toward Prescott,
the road gets much rougher. A high-profile vehicle is necessary,
but four-wheel drive is not.
</P>
<P>
   The road down from Crown King also was beautiful, not so much
because of the flowers, but because of the pines that kept
temperatures cool despite the slowly vanishing clouds. Like the
trip up on the switchbacks, there are great views on this road. A
look to the west even revealed the distant Harquahala Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Near the base of the mountains, Senator Highway (Forest Road
259) takes a curve to the right toward Prescott, but a marker
pointing to the left announces Wagoner Road (FR362). That would
take us through mining and ranching country, through the former
site of Wagoner, an old ranching and mining community, and to U.S.
89.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, Fouts said, this road was well-maintained because
of heavy traffic. It isn't anymore. The road is rocky, rough and
complete with plenty of washouts _ not a place you'd want to take
your car.
</P>
<P>
   Now it began to heat up in the oak-juniper country. But the
terrain was beautiful and lush. We dropped into Minnehaha Flat, a
stretch of private land complete with some primitive dwellings.
Then Fouts ordered a stop to look at well-preserved Button Mine.
The mine is closed to the public, but we could get a good look from
the road.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a drive past the remains of Wagoner, past Walnut Grove
and a crossing of the Hassayampa River into ranching country. Some
of the fences at these ranches cost more than my home. It was hot
by now, and the air conditioner was running. Fouts took a nap.
</P>
<P>
   Just as well. The drive back to Phoenix through Wickenburg
seemed as if it took forever. &QL;

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: THE HIGH PRICE OF REPRIEVING MIKE BARNICLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By HOWELL RAINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trust is the glue that holds newsrooms together and ultimately
binds readers to a specific newspaper and to newspapers in general.
The Boston Globe's decision not to dismiss its star columnist Mike
Barnicle is understandable as a matter of loyalty, public relations
and readership, but when it comes to the keeping of consistent
professional standards, it does not pass the trust test.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, there is no painless fix when things get as messed up
as they did between Barnicle and his editors at The Globe. Granted,
too, that there is a a certain awkwardness in discussing Barnicle's
reinstatement for anyone writing for The New York Times, since The
New York Times Co. owns The Globe.
</P>
<P>
   The Times Co., as a matter of policy, allows all its media
properties a high degree of editorial independence. Because of
this, it let The Globe deal with a difficult situation in its own
way.
</P>
<P>
   But that corporate philosophy cuts both ways and thus allows, in
this space, an examination of the implications for journalism of
The Globe's pardoning of Barnicle and its earlier dismissal of
Patricia Smith, a black columnist who confessed to making up people
and quotes.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe dropped Ms. Smith like a hot rock, and rightly so. But
upon her dismissal there were immediate rumblings that the
newspaper had, for years, looked the other way when confronted with
reports that Barnicle was writing what Mark Twain called
``stretchers'' in his colorful but apparently well-reported
columns.
</P>
<P>
   In what seemed a pathologically self-destructive or defiant act,
Barnicle then published a column that used, without attribution,
jokes very similar to those in George Carlin's book, ``Brain
Droppings.'' When challenged by his editors, he said he had not
read the book and had got the material from a friend without
checking its origin. There soon surfaced a tape of Barnicle
recommending the book on television as having ``a yuk on every
page.'' Barnicle told his editors that while he had recommended the
book, he had not actually read it himself.
</P>
<P>
   Amidst this hurricane of evasions and didn't-inhale excuses,
Globe editor Matt Storin quite properly asked for Barnicle's
resignation. Storin later relented, saying that his original
decision had been hasty and that it was unfair to give Barnicle the
same penalty as Ms. Smith, since his lapse was so much more
marginal than hers.
</P>
<P>
   With all respect, I can't buy that.
</P>
<P>
   Life is full of gray areas, but the intellectual contract that
makes mainstream newspapering possible is stark and clear. Editors
have to be able to trust what reporters and columnists write and
say. Journalists do not make things up or present others' writing
and thought as their own. All Barnicle had to do to get around his
problem with the 10 lifted jokes that he got from a friend was to
present them as 10 funny things he heard from a friend, rather than
present them as his own wit. No matter which interpretation you
prefer, this was unattributed material presented as original
writing in a column headlined ``I was just thinking . . .''
</P>
<P>
   At The New York Times and other newspapers, people have been
dismissed for making things up. The Times, The Globe and The
Washington Post have all given lesser punishments to reporters for
failing to attribute material first used in other publications'
news articles.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe's vacillation in a case that combines borrowing and
lack of candor with the editors illustrates a general rule. Public
respect for newspapering is wounded when rules that would be
enforced with doctrinal ferocity among the mass of journalists are
lightened for a star who has great value to the paper. The damage
is internal as well. It says to young journalists that the contract
of trust that we ask them to sign _ about what they write and what
they tell their editors _ is not really absolute or equally
enforced.
</P>
<P>
   This brings us to an important point about the sociology of
journalism. Barnicle is an immensely popular figure in Boston and
in the journalistic world. In the last few days, he has been the
beneficiary of a vigorous public-relations campaign among the
profession's old-boy network. Important broadcast journalists have
promoted the idea that Barnicle was being sacrificed for minor
mistakes so that The Globe could get by with firing a black woman.
His middle-aged white male colleagues at The Globe have rallied
around.
</P>
<P>
   I am haunted by something I know in my bones. If you take
Barnicle out of the picture and imagine instead Ms. Smith being
brought up on the charges of using unattributed material and
misleading her editors, she would not have such prominent and
persistent defenders. That is because Barnicle, like this writer,
is a product of a male-dominated, mostly white tribal culture that
takes care of its own. A great deal of effort has been expended
throughout journalism over the past 20 years to make sure the
newsroom tribe includes every color, gender and sexual orientation.
Long after Barnicle settles back into his column, the historical
bottom line of this event will be that a white guy with the right
connections got pardoned for offenses that would have taken down a
minority or female journalist.
</P>
<P>
   You'll buy my position, of course, only if you believe in strict
enforcement of rules about borrowing, lifting and leveling with
colleagues, and if you believe, as I do, that if you have to choose
between a worthy but erring colleague and the newspaper itself, you
choose for the paper.
</P>
<P>
   After all, all the members of this profession know the rules
when we sign up. They are rules based on a tradition of trust that
cannot be ignored without stirring anxiety in the newsroom and
suspicion among the readers.

ARIZONA'S CON TRIBUTED TO MAJOR LEAGUE ROSTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It's the summer's dog days, and there was Curt
Schilling making Shadow Mountain look like high school was in full
session.
</P>
<P>
   The parking lot was nearly full. The marching band had worked
for weeks, preparing for Schilling's grand return to campus.
</P>
<P>
   The fight song played on, as children, adults, alumni coaches
and administrators stood to welcome back the ex-Matador who grew up
to become one of baseball's fiercest pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, whose high school jersey number was retired during
Tuesday's ceremony, is one of more than 100 Arizonans to have
played in the major leagues. According to research by Mike Holden,
editor of ``Baseball AZ,'' 54 Arizona-born players made it to The
Show. Many more major leaguers, such as Schilling, Chad Curtis and
Tim Salmon, spent much of their youth in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Who could have thought Schilling would join that illustrious
list? Many of his high school teammates in the mid-1980s had better
statistics. Schilling mostly just pitched for Shadow Mountain, and
sometimes he let his emotions get in the way of his performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that every problem was the end of the world, and I
realize now that none of it meant a whole lot in the grand scheme
of things,'' the Philadelphia Phillies star said. ``I learned a lot
of things. Coach (William) Hatcher was somebody who, early in life,
taught me a lot of lessons about life, not just about baseball. I
don't think I realized that until after I left here. I kind of
thought maybe I'd get a fair shake a lot of times here, and I
realized it's not always going to be fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon, now making his riches in an Anaheim Angels uniform, was
a year behind Schilling in school, hammering tape-measure shots at
Greenway.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, I didn't know who he was,'' Salmon said. ``All of
a sudden, he made it, and I thought, `Hey, I remember that guy.' I
kind of remember playing against him in American Legion.'' &QL; 
Others were stars &QL; 
Schilling is an exception in the crowd of ex-Arizona high school
baseball players who made it to the major leagues. Most dominated
at the prep level.
</P>
<P>
   There were pitchers Lerrin LaGrow at Glendale and John Denny at
Prescott, catcher Duffy Dyer at Cortez and outfielder Jay Schlueter
at Central in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   There were catchers Terry Kennedy at St. Mary's and Ozzie Virgil
Jr. at Moon Valley, outfielder Mickey Hatcher at Mesa and infielder
Bob Horner at Glendale Apollo in the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Salmon at Greenway, infielder/outfielder Curtis at
Benson, pitcher Gil Heredia at Nogales and shortstop Shawn Gilbert
at Avondale Agua Fria in the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, pitchers Marc Kroon of Shadow Mountain, Matt Perisho
of Tempe McClintock and Bobby Howry of Glendale Deer Valley, and
catcher Paul Konerko of Scottsdale Chaparral have seen big league
playing time.
</P>
<P>
   One thing they all had, including Schilling, was a never-say-die
desire to make it and the abilities to turn dreams real.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never felt like I was the best,'' said Dyer, now a bench
coach for the Oakland Athletics. ``I had buddies who were just as
good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just always felt I had a shot at making it. I didn't know
how good the competition was. I was just thinking all the time,
`I'm going to play pro ball.' '' &QL; 
Growing up &QL; 
Salmon in right and batting third. Horner hitting cleanup. Virgil
behind the plate. Curtis in center. Schilling, Jim Palmer and Denny
in the rotation. LaGrow and Kevin Wickander closing.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad all-time Arizona baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   They all made their dent in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer and Denny were Cy Young Award winners. Salmon has been an
explosive hitter for the Angels. LaGrow once finished second to
Sparky Lyle in the Fireman of the Year balloting in the American
League. Virgil was a two-time All-Star in the mid-'80s and enjoyed
the thrill of playing in the 1985 classic while his father was one
of his coaches on the National League team.
</P>
<P>
   But high school coaches are surprised that not more have gone to
the top.
</P>
<P>
   Only four players born in Arizona were on major league Opening
Day rosters this year: Rex Hudler (Tempe) of the Phillies, Jeff
Huson (Scottsdale) of the Seattle Mariners, Albie Lopez (Mesa) of
the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and Tom Pagnozzi (Tucson) of the St. Louis
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame we don't have more,'' said Greenway Coach Ted
Blake, who coached Salmon and former San Francisco Giants pitcher
Randy McCament in high school. ``I think we've got some kids who
can play.''
</P>
<P>
   But in defense of the scouts, Blake said, ``It's a crapshoot.
You roll your dice and take your chances.'' &QL; 
Big league ingredients &QL; 
It's all about timing, work ethic and ability.
</P>
<P>
   Take one away from the other, and it's difficult for anybody to
make it.
</P>
<P>
   Most find the journey to the big leagues long and winding and
sometimes frightening.
</P>
<P>
   Virgil, who graduated from Moon Valley in 1976 and lost to
Horner's Apollo Hawks in the 1975 state championship game, signed
out of high school with the Phillies and spent 4{ years in the
minors before embarking on a major league career that lasted about
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Virgil said he grew up a ``clubhouse brat,'' hanging in the
summer with the Giants, for whom his his father, Ozzie Virgil Sr.,
was a coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time in San Francisco, Gaylord Perry came walking in (the
clubhouse) after being pulled in the first inning,'' Ozzie Jr.
said. ``There was a big spread on the table. He flipped the table
and everything flew all over the place. At 12, all I could think of
was, `Oh, man, I'm not eating today.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Virgil, who now lives in Glendale and is learning how to fly
airplanes, said that as a junior in high school, he took batting
practice with major leaguers such as Jack Clark and feel he was
blistering the ball just as far and as hard as the big boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is easy, I thought,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not that easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're away for the first time, you're having to learn
everything on your own,'' he said. ``Mom isn't doing your clothes
and feeding you anymore. I had to pay for everything. It's a big
adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing about baseball, it's all about adjusting to
everything. Guys who adjust to the pitching and the environment are
the ones who keep playing.''
</P>
<P>
   The adjustment seemed easy for Horner, who went straight from
the College World Series with Arizona State to the Atlanta Braves,
where he put together an outstanding career. Horner now resides in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   LaGrow, who has a son entering his senior year at Scottsdale
Desert Mountain, stayed in the minors long enough for a cup of
coffee. After his ASU career ended in 1969, he entered the Detroit
Tigers' clubhouse, a frightened child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared to death,'' LaGrow said. ``I had this old,
beat-up bag, and this guy walked up and said, `You must be Lerrin.'
I thought I was in trouble. He stuck out his hand and said, `I'm Al
Kaline, welcome to the Detroit Tigers.' It took all the pressure
off immediately.'' &QL; 
Progression, regression? &QL; 
Eras have changed. As the 1970s turned into the 1980s, sandlot
games in 110-degree weather, for many, turned into Nintendo
baseball battles on comfy couches.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a kid, I lived in the inner city, and we didn't
have much,'' said Jay Schlueter, who now works in commercial real
estate in Scottsdale, where his son, Brian, will be a sophomore
outfielder at Chaparral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball was the only thing. We would play home-run derby. We
couldn't wait until Saturdays, when they had the ``Game of the
Week'' on TV. We'd mimic the players' batting stances. Playing
major league baseball was my dream from Day One. It didn't matter.
Every time I blew out the candles on my birthday, I wanted to be a
baseball player.'' &QL; 
Return to roots &QL; 
Tom Pagnozzi owns the distinction of being the first Arizona-born
person to play an official major league game in Arizona. That
happened July 30, when he started at catcher for the Cardinals
against the Diamondbacks at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, Paul Konerko, now 22, returned to Arizona as both a
Los Angeles Dodger and a Cincinnati Red, as did Salmon with the
Angels. But neither was born in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never doubted his ability to succeed in anything he went
into,'' Hank Konerko said of his son, who used to hit so many
Little League home runs in north Scottsdale that parents dubbed him
the next Babe Ruth. ``He has an absolute commitment to winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Konerko is struggling to stay in the majors. He's been up and
down twice this season, once with the Dodgers and now with the
Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Dad doesn't believe son will stay down long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing his drive and commitment to to play well, I'd hate to
bet against him,'' Hank said. ``Some of his latest struggles could
be the best thing that ever happened to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Konerko can look at Schilling's journey as evidence that
patience and perseverance pay off. Schilling wasn't highly
recruited out of high school, struggled early in his pro career,
but look where he is now: the Phillies' ace, a strikeout terror.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling became the first former Arizona high school player to
win an official major league game on Arizona soil. He did it this
week, shutting out the Diamondbacks, 3-0, yielding three hits.
</P>
<P>
   Many who saw him growing up couldn't help but smile and shake
their heads afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always dreamed of being a big league ballplayer,''
Schilling said. ``I think the one thing that my father gave me was
that I never doubted myself. I always believed I could do it.'' &QL;

CATCHERS

<P>
   PHOENIX - An organization can always use one more good catcher _
even the Diamondbacks, who have a number of hot, young prospects on
the minor league level.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't have enough good catchers,'' said  &UR; Mel Didier, the
Diamondbacks' director of player development. ``You can make a
trade with them if you have to. We're fortunate to have guys who
are absolute prospects.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those young guns is  &UR; Rod Barajas at Class A High Desert,
recently named a Player of the Week in the California League. He
homered in three consecutive at-bats and was a big factor as his
club won 10 straight games. He has 21 homers, surpassing his total
of 17 from the previous two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect him to get better,'' Didier said. ``He's only 22.
His biggest problem is that he's like  &UR; Joe Torre and a number of
other guys in the past who have had to fight his weight. He's not
fat (5 feet 11, 220 pounds), but he's a guy who has a little
softness. We want to try to get rid of that. He's not short, but he
is a stocky guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He works real hard, has good hands, power and throws well. He
has a chance to be a player.''
</P>
<P>
   Barajas will have an opportunity to play for the Diamondbacks'
new Double-A club next season, and he might even get a shot at
Triple-A with the Sidewinders, Didier said. The Diamondbacks are
hoping to find a spot for Barajas in winter ball, probably in
Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that he is in professional ball is somewhat of a
surprise in itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy (Barajas) walks into a tryout camp in California, and
they (Diamondbacks scouts) look at him, and kind of say, `He ain't
gonna do nothing.' But he hit the ball, and he hit it well,''
Didier said.
</P>
<P>
   Barajas isn't alone among catchers trying to climb to the big
club.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jose Lopez, 18, is making an impression at Class A South Bend.
He's hitting under .200, but Didier says he has an above-average
arm. He's been catching only a year since he was converted from a
third baseman.
</P>
<P>
   Other top young guns include  &UR; Robert Hammock at Rookie
Lethbridge, 21, and 18-year-old  &UR; Stan Closser of the Rookie Tucson
Diamondbacks. &QL; 
Award winners &QL; 
 &UR; Jack Cust of the Lethbridge Black Diamonds and  &UR; Brad Penny of the
High Desert Mavericks were named the Diamondbacks' Player and
Pitcher of the Month for July. Cust, an outfielder who was a
first-round selection in 1997, batted .404, and had 11 doubles,
seven home runs and 30 RBIs. He also was named the Pioneer League
Player of the Month.
</P>
<P>
   Cust, one of the most highly touted high school prospects last
year, leads the Pioneer League with 17 doubles and a .542 on-base
percentage. He is second in slugging percentage (.649), extra-base
hits (26) and runs (52). The left-handed hitting outfielder, who is
fourth in the league with a .364 batting average, leads the Black
Diamonds in 10 categories.
</P>
<P>
   Penny won the distinction for the fourth time. He was 4-0 during
July with a 1.58 ERA. &QL; 
Moving up &QL; 
Moving up the ladder hasn't had a negative effect on left-handed
pitcher  &UR; Stephen Randolph. Since his July promotion to the
Sidewinders from High Desert, he has appeared in 11 games, pitching
15 innings with 14 strikeouts. Hitters have managed only a .226
average against him. &QL;

DEVIL RAYS' IMAGE TARNISHED BY TIRADES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the Diamondbacks' biggest problems are struggling over
wins and losses and whether it's a little steamy in the upper
reaches of Bank One Ballpark, just remember, things could be a lot
worse.
</P>
<P>
   Take the other expansion club, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, for
example.  &UR; Vince Naimoli, the Devil Rays' equivalent to  &UR; Jerry
Colangelo in stature and title, has not made himself look very good
in public lately.
</P>
<P>
   After an article appeared in the ``Orlando Sentinel''
documenting Tropicana Field's numerous problems, Naimoli ripped
into the writer in a profanity-laced tirade that had some observers
thinking they were watching ``The Caine Mutiny'' when Captain Queeg
shouts, ``WHERE ARE THE STRAWBERRIES!''
</P>
<P>
   Naimoli also took exception with a ``Tampa Tribune'' story in
which a business writer chronicled Naimoli's alleged past clashes
with various persons over business related to the baseball club.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this summer, Dillard's stores pulled all their Devil
Rays merchandise because of another tirade from Naimoli to the area
manager of the chain.
</P>
<P>
   Naimoli was incensed because outfielder/first baseman  &UR; Dave
Martinez appeared in a newspaper advertisement for a charity event
at Dillard's wearing his Devil Rays uniform, a no-no unless the
club gives its permission.
</P>
<P>
   The store's manager admitted he did not know of the rule. He
offered to buy another advertisement to apologize for the mistake.
But when Naimoli continued berating the Dillard's official, the
manager basically said, ``forget you,'' although he wound up buying
the ad and then pulled the club's merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Persistent rumors continue to swirl that the Devil Rays' other
limited partners are disenchanted with Naimoli's iron-fisted way of
handling problems and is tarnishing the club's image in the local
community.
</P>
<P>
   While removing someone from the managing general partnership is
almost unheard of, if Naimoli, who owns 16 percent of the Devil
Rays, continues to lash out and to look like an out-of-control
hothead, expect something to happen in the off-season. &QL; 
Stale fish for sale! &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at a four-hour drive south on Interstate 75, the
proposed $169 million sale of the Florida Marlins trudges along at
a snail's pace. Marlins President  &UR; Don Smiley is having so much
trouble putting together investors to buy the club that a new
potential owner, commodities trader  &UR; John Henry, has surfaced, and
suddenly, Smiley may wind up on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Smiley has had 10 months to put together a group and is still
more than $15 million short of his goal. Marlins owner and scourge
 &UR; Wayne
 &UR; Huizenga, who oversaw one of the greatest shams in recent sports
history, may be souring on Smiley's troubled effort and leaning
more toward Henry.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Henry is real,'' a source close to the negotiations told
the Associated Press. ``Smiley is looking highly unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   The big difference between Smiley and Henry is Henry's ability
to finance a new home for the Marlins, whereas Smiley has said he
would need public funding for a new ballpark or consider the
possibility of the Marlins moving. &QL; 
It's almost over &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even with the New York Mets battling for the wild-card spot, the
spotlight hasn't dimmed much on catcher  &UR; Mike Piazza, who,
according to several New York papers, has told teammates he is not
digging the New York scene.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, in turn, said last week that any negotiations with
Piazza will be put off until after the season, almost assuring that
he will enter the free-agent market, which will open 15 days after
the end of the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had hoped to work something out, but we didn't,'' Piazza
said. ``There is no acrimony. I'm trying to do everything I can to
help this team get into the playoffs. I don't see why everybody has
to make such a big issue out of the contract. The issue should be
on the baseball season, that's it. Now is not the time to address
that issue. The priority is the season. I'll just give 110 percent
until the end of the season and then think about my future.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Piazza didn't talk quite like that when he and the
Dodgers were negotiating earlier this season. At one point, Piazza
turned down an $86 million offer from Los Angeles, which turned out
to be one of the last things he did in a Dodgers uniform.
</P>
<P>
   There is growing speculation that Piazza may head over to the
American League, possibly to play for Baltimore or Boston. Of
course, Los Angeles also will remain a player in the Piazza
sweepstakes. And never discount the deep-pocketed Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   One aspect, though, seems a lock: It's looking highly doubtful
that Piazza will entertain another $86 million offer from anybody. &QL; 
Now batting . . . who? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When  &UR; John Mabry started at first base for St. Louis in a game
in Milwaukee last week, he knew full well what kind of reception he
would receive.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 25,969, many of whom came to watch  &UR; Mark McGwire
slug a home run, booed loudly every time Mabry came to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been there before,'' Mabry said of the jeers.
</P>
<P>
   Mabry gave a McGwire-like performance, hitting a home run in his
first at-bat, his first since July 1. Mabry added an RBI single
later in the game while the cascading of boos continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get that going in St. Louis all weekend,''
Cardinals Manager  &UR; Tony La Russa joked. ``Every time John comes to
bat, all the fans boo him. I bet you it will do some good.''
</P>
<P>
   The best line heard all night?
</P>
<P>
   ``You think I paid $80 to see you hit?'' one fan yelled at
Mabry, who turned to the fan and asked, ``If I hit a home run, will
you buy me a beer?'' &QL;
