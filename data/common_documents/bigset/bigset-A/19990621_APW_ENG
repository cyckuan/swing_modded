<HEADLINE> Homeless Shelter Director Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT ARTHUR, Texas (AP) -- A homeless-shelter director suspected  
of embezzling $120,000 when he disappeared more than a month ago 
has been arrested in Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	David Gillooly, 42, was arrested Sunday night at the Louisville  
airport after authorities got a tip that he might be there. 
Detectives would not say whether he was about to board a plane. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive director of Port Cities Rescue Mission is wanted  
on theft charges in Texas. He disappeared May 13. 
</P>
<P>
	What the agency didn't know at the time was that Gillooly was  
also wanted in Virginia, where authorities said he has been a 
fugitive since violating his parole in 1996. He faces a 10-year 
prison sentence there. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been jailed in Virginia on charges of forging checks  
while executive director of a nonprofit AIDS organization in 
Norfolk, Va.

<HEADLINE> Slain Civil Rights Workers Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA, Miss. (AP) -- Ben Chaney walked slowly down the  
rural Mississippi road to where his brother and two other civil 
rights workers were murdered 35 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	His face solemn, Chaney stopped at the place where the young men  
died at the hands of Ku Klux Klansmen, and remarked, ``There is no 
monument and no markers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chaney led more than 100 people Sunday to Neshoba County for  
ceremonies honoring James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Mickey 
Schwerner. The group traveled by bus to re-create the historic 
``Freedom Rides'' through the South during the push to register 
black voters. 
</P>
<P>
	James Chaney, Schwerner and Goodman -- all workers for the  
Congress on Racial Equality, which organized voter registration 
drives in Ku Klux Klan strongholds -- were traveling down a Neshoba 
County road on June 21, 1964, when they were chased down and shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Their bodies were not found until 44 days later when the FBI  
recovered them from an earthen dam. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has been convicted of the killings although seven  
Klansmen, including a sheriff's deputy, were convicted of federal 
conspiracy charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Ben Chaney, 16-year-old Ryan Turnage of St. Louis believes  
the three men deserve a monument at the site of their deaths 
because ``they sacrificed their lives for us so we could walk the 
streets safely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They just left a piece of history and it was Christlike for  
them to give up their lives like that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day Sunday, the group traveled through Alabama,  
crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma where voting rights 
marchers were attacked in March 1965 by Alabama state troopers in 
an event known as ``Bloody Sunday.'' The confrontation sparked the 
historic Selma-to-Montgomery voting rights march led by Martin 
Luther King Jr.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Runner Trains for Eating Contest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- Some people dream of winning a marathon,  
maybe even an Olympic medal. For George Glum, real achievement 
means being able to shove 15 hot dogs down his throat in 12 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``By the fifth one, they're going to start tasting bad -- no  
matter how good they are,'' he said. ``Your mind says stop, but you 
have to find a way to get over that and keep going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glum -- or ``Garbage Gut,'' as he is known competitively -- is  
currently in training for the Super Bowl of competitive eating: the 
Nathan's Famous hot dog eating championship, held July 4 on New 
York's Coney Island. 
</P>
<P>
	The 35-year-old's first big test comes this Saturday, when he  
must out-eat more than a dozen other hopefuls in his qualifying 
event in Jersey City, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll give it my best shot and if I make it to the finals, it  
would be pretty incredible,'' the Biddeford resident said while 
chewing the fat at Mark's hot dog stand in Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	Quite a challenge for a man who admits he rarely eats more than  
two franks at one sitting. But Glum says he's always shown signs of 
being a gustatory gladiator. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always cleaned my plate,'' Glum said. ``I've always eaten a  
lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 6-feet-tall and 210 pounds, Glum is about 50 pounds heavier  
than he was in the mid 1980s when he ran the New York Marathon in 
less than three hours and qualified for the Boston Marathon. When 
knee problems halted his distance running, he turned to karate, 
reaching black belt status. 
</P>
<P>
	Entrants in the Nathan's contest come in all shapes and sizes.  
The man Glum will try to dethrone, three-time hot dog-eating champ 
Hirofumi ``The Tokyo Terror'' Nakajima, was a mere 135 pounds when 
he set the all-time record last year by inhaling 24 1/2 hot dogs. His 
closest rivals weighed in at 387 pounds and 381 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Glum's recalls his interest in fast eating being piqued by a  
scene in the 1967 movie ``Cool Hand Luke'' in which Paul Newman 
plays a prisoner who wins a bet with a guard by swallowing 50 eggs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw it several times,'' he said. ``It was an inspiration.''  
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't until last year that his latent talent came to the  
fore when he noticed a plaque heralding the local pasta eating 
champ at Fresh Market Pasta. 
</P>
<P>
	By March of last year he became sufficiently motivated to put  
his skills to the test. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure enough, ``Garbage Gut'' sucked down 4 1/2 bowls of pasta in  
two hours, eclipsing the previous mark of four bowls set by a 
competitor named ``Pig Boy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He demonstrated his prowess once again by consuming a  
three-pound hamburger in 45 minutes at Lena's eatery in Beverly, 
Mass., a feat that got his name alongside the 17 other big eaters 
on the restaurant's ``wall of fame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glum's primary training food remains pasta, just as it was in  
his marathon days. Within a few days of the competition, he plans 
to load up on cabbage and other vegetables, grains such as oats, 
and plenty of water to expand his stomach. 
</P>
<P>
	The Villanova graduate said his friends and co-workers at  
Northeast Paging in Westbrook, where he is an executive marketing 
assistant, are giving him plenty of support. 
</P>
<P>
	He sees the Nathan's contest as ``my last hurrah.'' But if he  
defies the odds and defeats Nakajima and the rest of the field, 
Glum would happily return to Coney Island to defend the bejeweled 
yellow belt awarded to the champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be honored to do that,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Breast Implants, Illness Not Linked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Silicone breast implants do not cause major  
illnesses, an independent panel of scientists convened by the 
Institute of Medicine has determined, The New York Times reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some women with breast implants are indeed very ill, and the  
IOM committee is very sympathetic to their distress,'' wrote the 
group of 13 scientists in a report to be released Tuesday. 
``However, it can find no evidence that these women are ill because 
of their implants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The primary safety concern with implants is their tendency to  
burst or deflate and lead to infections or hardening or scarring of 
breast tissue, the 400-page report says. There is no reason to 
believe implants cause rheumatoid arthritis, lupus or any other 
systemic disease, it says. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOM report is the latest evaluation to conclude that there  
is no scientific evidence supporting the liability lawsuits of 
women who claim breast implants made them sick. It could encourage 
women to accept settlements from implant makers instead of taking 
their cases to court, the Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, thousands of women who claim silicone breast  
implants made them ill or want the implants removed overwhelmingly 
approved a $3.2 billion settlement with Dow Corning Corp., once the 
largest maker of the implants. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOM is part of the nation's most prestigious scientific  
organization, the National Academy of Sciences. Members of the 
committee were prohibited from discussing the report until it is 
officially made public, The Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel relied primarily on research done by scientists and  
submitted by implant companies and women with implants, but it did 
not conduct original research. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have not convinced me that their review is correct,''  
said Sybil Goldrich of Command Trust Network, an advocate for women 
with silicone breast implant problems. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1.5 million to 1.8 million American women have had  
silicone breast implants for enlargement or reconstruction after 
mastectomy.

<HEADLINE> Fire Kills Boy, Badly Burns Father </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMBLER, Pa. (AP) -- A 5-year-old boy playing with matches started  
a fire that killed the little boy and badly burned his father as he 
tried to rescue his four children from their burning row house on 
Father's Day. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire also damaged 14 other row houses.  
</P>
<P>
	The body of Daniel Gaskins was found under debris on the second  
floor of his house after Sunday's fire, which burned out of control 
for three hours in this Philadelphia suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel started the fire while playing with matches on a sofa  
bed, Whitpain Township police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel's father, 39-year-old Nathan Gaskins, was burned over 20  
percent of his body as he tried to rescue his children. He was in 
critical condition Monday at Crozier-Chester Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could see him being baked,'' neighbor Estella Clemons said.  
She saw Gaskins lifting one of his twin daughters through a 
second-story window onto their porch roof. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was panicking. The skin was off him,'' said another  
neighbor, Tony Thornton, who grabbed the little girl from Gaskins 
and carried her to safety past flames in his own living room. 
</P>
<P>
	The twin girls were not injured. An 8-year-old brother was in  
good condition with third-degree burns on his arms at St. 
Christopher's Hospital for Children. 
</P>
<P>
	Their mother, Cheryl Gaskins, was home at the time of the fire  
but was uninjured. 
</P>
<P>
	Four firefighters and another person also were injured, fire  
officials said.

<HEADLINE> Women Filing for Bankruptcy More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Women are turning to the shelter of bankruptcy  
court in greater proportion than men and married couples, according 
to new data from a Harvard law professor critical of legislation 
making it tougher for people to erase debts through bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	As Congress debates the legislation to rewrite the bankruptcy  
laws, the new study being written by Elizabeth Warren, a widely 
quoted expert, is likely to become fresh ammunition for opponents 
of the proposed restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	But another bankruptcy expert voiced skepticism about the study  
Monday, saying it doesn't appear to demonstrate conclusively a link 
between gender and bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not much there,'' said Sam Gerdano, executive director  
of the American Bankruptcy Institute, a group of 6,400 attorneys, 
judges, bankers, and professors that does not take positions on 
bankruptcy issues. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Gerdano acknowledged that divorce is a major factor in  
bankruptcy for men and women and that divorced women are more 
likely than other women to have financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Warren was traveling Monday and not available for an  
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Her study -- based on bankruptcy court filings in eight of the 94  
federal bankruptcy districts -- indicates that 39 percent of the 
filings in the 12 months ending March 31 were made by women. That 
compares with 28 percent for men and 33 percent for married 
couples. The findings were reported first in Monday's editions of 
USA Today and confirmed by a Harvard colleague. 
</P>
<P>
	The House, seeking to stop the nationwide increase in personal  
bankruptcies, last month passed a bill sought by credit card 
companies that would make it more difficult for people to erase 
their debts in bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has opposed the bill that cleared the  
House by a veto-proof 313-108 margin. The measure got solid support 
from Republicans but split the Democrats. Reps. George Gekas, 
R-Pa., and Jim Moran, D-Va., were the top sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have concerns about the hardships that this bill will  
impose on many responsible lower- and middle-income debtors who are 
trying to get a fresh start,'' White House spokesman Jake Siewert 
said Monday. ``And the fact that this hardship falls 
disproportionately on single women is further cause for concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parallel legislation, which is somewhat less stringent toward  
debtors, is pending in the Senate. Its chief author, Sen. Charles 
Grassley, R-Iowa, has been trying to work out compromises with key 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley and the House measure's sponsors say the legislation  
helps women whose husbands or former husbands have filed for 
bankruptcy by giving child support and alimony payments a higher 
priority than credit card debt and other obligations. Under the 
current law, debts such as bankruptcy lawyers' fees, student loans 
and other obligations must be paid before child support or alimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women would be treated a lot better than they are now,'' said  
Carey Dearnley, a Gekas spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	But opponents maintain that the legislation, by barring certain  
credit card debts from being erased in bankruptcy, would force 
single mothers and children owed support by bankrupt fathers to 
compete with credit card companies in collecting debts. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation ``will exacerbate the problems faced by the  
growing number of women in the bankruptcy system,'' said Sen. 
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. ``The bill's supporters claim they are 
protecting women and children, but the protections are a sham.''

<HEADLINE> 2 Officers Indicted in Torture Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two plainclothes police officers were indicted  
Monday on federal charges of lying to authorities investigating the 
torture of a Haitian immigrant in a police station bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Rolando Aleman, 28, and Francisco Rosario, 34, were decorated  
members of the roving Street Crime Unit who were booking a gun 
suspect at the precinct at the time of the assault on Abner Louima 
on Aug. 9, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	During questioning, they ``repeatedly lied and misled the  
federal government about what they saw in the stationhouse that 
morning,'' said prosecutor Alan Vingrad. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictments came two weeks after a jury convicted a  
patrolman, Charles Schwarz, of holding down Louima while another 
officer, Justin Volpe -- who pleaded guilty -- sodomized the prisoner 
with a broken broomstick. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictments ``come as no surprise,'' said Aleman's attorney,  
Edward Jenks. ``It was strategic: They waited to see if they could 
get some convictions in (the Louima case) before they made their 
next move. ... It's a shame because my client had nothing to do 
with Louima.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rosario's attorney, Richard Levitt, said his client ``will be  
fully vindicated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No arraignment date was set for the officers, who have been  
assigned desk duty. If convicted, they face up to five years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI arrested the two officers late last year, but the  
charges were quietly dropped because they were not indicted within 
the required 30 days. At the time, defense attorneys accused 
authorities of arresting their clients to keep them from testifying 
as defense witnesses for Volpe, and to pressure them into 
cooperating with the government.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Memorial Ideas Pour In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKEWOOD, Colo. (AP) -- Stained-glass steppingstones, each carved  
with a victim's name. A wish garden, for remembering those lost. A 
sobbing angel hovering over a field of flowers. 
</P>
<P>
	These are just a few of the ideas that artists, students and  
others have offered for a permanent memorial to the victims of the 
April 20 Columbine High School massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	Art Zohn, a Denver graphic artist whose daughter will be a  
senior at Columbine this fall, said he felt he had to submit a 
design ``to get it out of my system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His concept features 13 marble benches, a waterfall and a  
stained glass window looking out on the mountains, where ``friends 
and family could gather there and rally around one (bench) or all 
of them,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Easton, district executive director, is coordinating the  
project, along with school, parks and county officials, who are in 
the initial stages of reviewing designs, picking a site and lining 
up the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Although no budget has been set, three funds established by the  
parks district, school district and Jefferson County have set aside 
$25,000. About 28 offers of in-kind services have been made by 
contractors, landscapers and others. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no preconceived notions at this point,'' Easton  
said. ``The real key is a high level of involvement by the high 
school students, the parents, victims and families. We want to be 
sure it accurately reflects their desires.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The site has not been chosen, although public sentiment seems to  
favor Clement Park, where a makeshift memorial sprang up next to 
the high school soon after two heavily armed students killed a 
dozen classmates and a teacher inside the school. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no talk of remembering the gunmen, Dylan Klebold and  
Eric Harris, who ended their rampage by killing themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Easton expects a committee of 20 to 25 people, including victims  
and other members of the public, to make the final decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals stacked on Easton's desk arrived from as near as  
Littleton and as far away as Washington state. Many were created by 
artists, but just as many were not. Some people have children at 
Columbine or are alumni; others have no connection other than their 
sorrow. 
</P>
<P>
	The ideas range from a brief note asking that any design include  
the columbine -- the bell-shaped state flower -- to an elaborate 
floor plan for a memorial resembling a Greek temple, with a cafe, 
theater and library. 
</P>
<P>
	One artist sees a pair of 7-foot bronze hands cupping a  
columbine. Another proposes a sobbing angel in a field of 
columbines, her body draped over a tombstone inscribed with the 
victims' names. 
</P>
<P>
	Stained-glass artist Barb Fowler of Dayton, Ohio, proposed 13  
stained-glass steppingstones engraved with the victims' names. 
</P>
<P>
	``I must have heard about it the minute the news broke,'' she  
said. ``My reaction was probably the same as everyone else in the 
country -- total disgust and shock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sculptor Randy Rau, a 1979 graduate of Columbine, has suggested  
a large bronze bell that would ring 13 times each year on the 
anniversary of the shootings. Thirteen concrete pillars intertwined 
by a bronze ribbon held up by 13 doves would surround the bell. 
</P>
<P>
	Many proposals call for stone tablets engraved with the victims'  
name or circular walkways around reflecting pools. Students at 
nearby Dakota Ridge and Chatfield high schools have designed a 
``Columbine Wish Garden'' with a brick path leading to a wishing 
well. Bricks would be sold to donors to pay for the monument. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fowler said whichever design is chosen, it is important for  
a memorial to be built ``so that nobody forgets. That would be the 
worst tragedy of all.''

<HEADLINE> Layden Retires From Coaching Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Frank Layden's tenure as coach in the WNBA  
didn't even last one year. 
</P>
<P>
	The 67-year-old Layden, a former NBA Coach of the Year,  
unexpectedly resigned Monday because of the long workdays and 
traveling. 
</P>
<P>
	Layden said he leaves with more respect for professional women's  
basketball than the men's game. The women, he says, have superior 
work and team ethics. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gets old,'' said Layden, who was replaced by 42-year-old  
assistant Fred Williams, formerly the coach of Southern California. 
``I was getting tired. Time is a precious commodity right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Layden's resignation, however, was abrupt. His comments about  
the team were invariably optimistic and less than two weeks ago, he 
told a sportswriter that taking over the team gave him a newfound 
purpose in life. 
</P>
<P>
	He will remain president of the NBA's Jazz -- the Starzz' big  
brother. He came to Utah as general manager of the Jazz in 1979 
when the New Orleans team was moved to Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	He coached the Jazz for eight seasons (277-294) and was named  
NBA Coach of the Year in 1984. He retired from coaching in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	A decade later, in July 1998, he took over the Starzz team,  
replacing coach Denise Taylor. Layden won just two of 11 games in 
his first season. 
</P>
<P>
	But the team was revamped for this year and is 2-2 after beating  
Sacramento on Saturday. There is reason for optimism, especially 
with the addition of Natalie Williams, the former MVP of the 
defunct ABL, who is averaging nearly 18 points and 12 rebounds a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Layden said he planned to stay only two years as Starzz coach  
and is cutting that short to spend more time with Barbara, his wife 
of 41 years, their three children and six grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' first game as head coach will be Thursday when the  
Starzz again play the Monarchs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a dream for me. I didn't think it would come so soon,''  
said Williams, who has been with the Starzz since 1998. A year 
before, he coached the Southern California women's team to a 20-9 
record and the second round of the NCAA tournament.

<HEADLINE> NBA Finals Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Marcus Camby's smile and words gave away Jeff  
Van Gundy's big secret. 
</P>
<P>
	Camby started in place of Chris Dudley for the New York Knicks  
on Monday night in Game 3 of the NBA Finals against the San Antonio 
Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the shoot-around this morning, Jeff came up to me and said,  
`I might start you,''' Camby said in the locker room before the 
game Monday night. ``I said, `Fine. Whatever it takes to get the 
win.' 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to go. I can't wait. I know it's going to be crazy out  
there. I just want to get started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Camby, making his first start for the Knicks, was the last  
player announced during pregame introductions. He jumped up and 
down in the middle of the huddle, pumping his fist wildly. 
</P>
<P>
	Camby provided a huge spark as a reserve in the Knicks' victory  
over Indiana in the Eastern Conference Finals, but has struggled 
with foul trouble as New York fell behind San Antonio 2-0 in the 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``To start the game, I can bring my energy and enthusiasm and  
hopefully get us going and get the crowd going,'' Camby said. 
``Then I can go out and get a blow and come out in the second 
quarter and do the same thing in the second half.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy refused to officially announce the change before the  
lineups were announced, but he laid out the compelling reasons for 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``His energy to us is critical, and I think playing him one long  
stretch at a time has left him more fatigued,'' Van Gundy said. 
``If I decide to start him, it's to try to finish the halves better 
and fresher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition of Camby from Toronto for popular veteran  
Charles Oakley -- and Camby's subsequent lack of playing time under 
Van Gundy -- have divided the entire Knicks organization this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Camby's first start since he played for the Toronto  
Raptors against Philadelphia last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lost that game,'' Camby said. ``One of the 66 that we lost.  
Big turnaround, though. Big turnaround. I'm happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dudley has a badly hyperextended elbow that was so painful he  
has been practicing his free throws left-handed. He's a 46 percent 
foul shooter in his career right-handed. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *STERN VS. LJ:* NBA commissioner David Stern had some stern  
words for Knicks forward Larry Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson and the Knicks were fined $25,000 each Sunday after  
Johnson unleashed a profanity-laced tirade. It was directed toward 
an NBA official and reporters who were trying to interview him 
during a mandatory media session. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our players and teams are going to comply with our rules, and  
if they don't they will be dealt with accordingly,'' Stern said 
Monday at his annual NBA Finals news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``We recognize that there are individual pressures at times, and  
we are not mindless in our enforcement. We know that there are 
pressures on coaches and players and that the very event that we 
have here intensifies those pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy speculated -- tongue-in-cheek --  
before the game that pain medication was to blame for Johnson's 
outburst. Johnson is playing with a sprained knee that was injured 
in the Eastern Conference finals against Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's taking a lot of pain medication just to get out there,''  
Van Gundy said. ``I think you either have to ask him about it 
before the pain medication or after, I'm not sure which.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time this postseason Johnson and the team were  
fined. The league fined them $10,000 each on June 8 because Johnson 
twice failed to make himself available to the media following 
practices on June 4 and 5. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ALL BUSINESS:* The Spurs' locker room was barren before the  
game. At one point when Tim Duncan and David Robinson came in, they 
were approached and asked one question. Both said they don't talk 
before games. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DUNCAN FOR MVP?:* Some believe that Spurs center Tim Duncan  
would have won the MVP award instead of Utah's Karl Malone if 
voters had waited until the regular season ended to send in their 
ballots. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe we should consider getting them in your hands later,''  
commissioner David Stern said. ``But I think we feel as though we 
are dealing with adults and they have a pretty good idea based upon 
a full season what they want to do.''

<HEADLINE> Sprewell May Play Point Guard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Desperation. It is a word that aptly describes  
the New York Knicks' predicament in the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	So here comes a new plot twist, just in time for Game 3 tonight  
between the Knicks and San Antonio Spurs. Expect some new lineups 
from the Knicks, who are open to suggestions on how to slow down 
the sweepmobile currently being driven down Broadway by co-pilots 
Tim Duncan and David Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	While Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy hedged on his lineup  
intentions, Latrell Sprewell publicly lobbied for a change Sunday 
that would move him to point guard with Allan Houston at shooting 
guard. Van Gundy called Sprewell's suggestion a ``viable option, 
but we won't start that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs lead New York 2-0 in the best-of-7 series, which is in  
need of rescuing on several fronts -- quality of play, television 
ratings and possibly, duration. If the Spurs keep playing their 
calm, effective style and the Knicks' changes don't make any 
difference, the broom-waving fans in San Antonio won't get to watch 
another game in the Alamodome. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams are tentatively scheduled to play three games at  
Madison Square Garden this week. The Spurs only need to win two. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to put serious pressure on them by winning the third  
game and kind of put the series out of reach,'' said Tim Duncan, 
averaging 29.0 points, 15.5 rebounds and three blocks in the first 
two games. ``But to stay alive, for them, that's the game they need 
right there. Going down 3-0 would be a tough thing, next to 
impossible, to come back from.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, no team in NBA history has ever come back from a 3-0  
deficit in any round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody out in San Antonio thinks it's won already,'' the  
Spurs' Sean Elliott said. ``Guys in here know we still have a lot 
of work to do. The series probably isn't even started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That is what NBC and the league must be hoping, but alas, it's  
not true. Ratings for Game 1 were down 36 percent from last year's 
Bulls-Jazz opener, and overnight ratings for Game 2 were even 
worse. Spurs guard Mario Elie said the quality of play might be one 
reason fans are reaching for the remote control. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been nasty,'' Elie said.  
</P>
<P>
	More so for the Knicks than for the Spurs. New York averaged 72  
points in the two losses and is still searching for a way to 
replace Patrick Ewing's offense. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks' point guards, Charlie Ward and Chris Childs, are  
averaging 9.0 points and 5.0 assists. Childs is 3-for-16. Larry 
Johnson, hindered by a sprained knee, is shooting 20 percent from 
the field, and Marcus Camby has been hindered because of foul 
trouble after playing a pivotal role in the Knicks' victory over 
the Indiana Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus, Van Gundy was bombarded by questions about his lineup on  
Sunday. One possibility is sending Ward to the bench and playing 
Sprewell at the point with Houston at shooting guard. The Knicks 
used such a lineup in Game 2 against the Pacers when Ward and 
Childs were in foul trouble. Sprewell said the team has run plays 
in practice with him playing point guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``It worked then, who's to say if it'll work now,'' Sprewell  
said. ``We don't know, but at least it's worth a try, I think, at 
some point during the game. ... Maybe that's something that can 
create a mismatch that favors us. 
</P>
<P>
	``If something's working, then I think you need to work it until  
they find a way to stop it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It would mean the hobbled Johnson would have to guard the  
quicker Elliott. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the opportunity arises, I'll try to take him to the basket,  
absolutely,'' Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said using a full-court press to  
exploit Sprewell's shaky ballhandling skills wouldn't be an option. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't remember the last time we pressed,'' Popovich said.  
``I don't think we've ever pressed, ever. Not once.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy said he doesn't necessarily favor changing the  
starters, but he doesn't rule out going to the big guard lineup at 
some point during the game. A more likely change is Kurt Thomas or 
Camby for Chris Dudley, who is so bothered by a hyperextended elbow 
that he was practicing free throws left-handed on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you make all the changes that everybody wants -- start  
Marcus, Kurt, Larry, Allan and Latrell -- your bench now has two 
point guards and an unhealthy Chris Dudley,'' Van Gundy said. 
</P>
<P>
	No tinkering should be expected from Popovich, whose team is on  
an NBA-record 12-game postseason winning streak -- including 6-0 on 
the road. San Antonio hasn't lost since Game 2 of the first round 
against Minnesota on May 11. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a focused group,'' Elie said. ``We know what's at stake,  
we know what we have to do. We're the `Road Warriors.' We went to 
Minnesota and won two, to Portland won two, to the Lakers and won 
two. We don't feel any different coming into the Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can get Game 3, we might as well finish them off.''

<HEADLINE> Court To Review Jury Selection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to use an  
Arizona drug case to decide whether some criminal convictions must 
be overturned because of jury-selection errors. 
</P>
<P>
	The court will hear an appeal in which prosecutors say a  
drug-trafficking conviction was valid even though the judge failed 
to remove a potential juror who showed signs of bias. That failure 
caused the defendant to use one of his limited number of challenges 
to remove the man from the jury pool. 
</P>
<P>
	Judges are required to remove prospective jurors who show bias,  
leaving prosecution and defense lawyers free to use their 
challenges to remove jurors for other reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Abel Martinez-Salazar was arrested in Phoenix on charges of  
conspiracy, possession of heroin with intent to distribute and 
using or carrying a firearm during a drug crime. He was convicted 
and sentenced to 10 years and three months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	During jury selection, one prospective juror said he probably  
would favor the prosecution and that he assumed ``people are on 
trial because they did something wrong.'' He also said, however, 
that he understood defendants are presumed innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial judge refused to remove that man from jury service for  
bias. Martinez-Salazar's lawyer then used one of his automatic 
challenges to remove him as a potential juror. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez-Salazar had been allowed 11 automatic, or peremptory  
challenges, which can be used to remove prospective jurors without 
having to give a reason. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year ruled that  
Martinez-Salazar is entitled to a new trial. Noting that he 
eventually used all of his automatic challenges, the appeals court 
said his due-process rights were violated because federal law does 
not require defendants to use their automatic challenges to remove 
potential jurors for bias. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, Justice Department lawyers said  
other courts have ruled that such errors do not require throwing 
out a conviction unless a biased juror was seated. All the jurors 
in Martinez-Salazar's case were impartial, and therefore the error 
should be considered harmless, government lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez-Salazar's lawyers said such an error never should be  
considered harmless. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is U.S. vs. Martinez-Salazar, 98-1255.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Develop Tiny Robot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese electronics companies have developed a  
micro-machine the size of an ant that can crawl around thin pipes, 
inspect and even fix problems at power plants, officials said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The box-shaped robot is only 5 millimeters (0.2 inch) long, 9  
millimeters (0.36 inch) wide and 6.5 millimeters (0.26 inch) high. 
</P>
<P>
	It has a pair of round connectors on both sides that can be  
linked up with other robots for more extensive assignments. 
</P>
<P>
	With a weight of only 0.42 grams (0.0147 ounces), the robot can  
lift objects twice as heavy as itself and can move at a speed of 2 
millimeters (0.1 inch) per second, said Koji Hirose, spokesman for 
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi Electric Corp., Sumitomo Electric Industries Ltd. and  
Matsushita Research Institute Tokyo, Inc. developed the machine 
under the government's 25 billion yen ($206 million) ``micro 
machine'' project that began in 1989, Hirose said. 
</P>
<P>
	The robots are one of three types of machines designed for use  
in different environments, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The robots, which can crawl into the tiniest gaps around bundles  
of pipes, are expected to speed up inspection and repairs at 
electric and nuclear power plants because they can be sent in while 
the plants keep running. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists are working to add new functions to them so the  
robots can climb up and down a pipe while connected to other 
machines. They also plan to develop robots with motors and 
problem-detecting sensors.

<HEADLINE> Shutdown Hits Hard in Factory Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKLIN, W.Va. (AP) -- Jerry Bowers, at 39, has been making  
shoes more than half his life. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many others in this Eastern Panhandle town, he had only one  
option upon joining the work force at age 17 -- Hanover Shoe Co. 
</P>
<P>
	But now Hanover's parent company plans to close the plant in  
January, shifting production overseas and putting 350 people out of 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a business decision, even a common one. But the move will  
have a profound impact on the people of this small company town, 
who have long pinned their lives on the classic men's shoes made 
here. 
</P>
<P>
	``I may go into construction. Definitely, we'll have to  
travel,'' Bowers said, half-shouting over the clatter of industrial 
sewing machines. He vows to stay put until his teen-age son 
finishes high school. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll tough it out for two years and see what happens,'' he  
said. ``We have been seeing it coming. We just weren't expecting a 
total shutdown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many factors have brought Hanover to this point -- an  
unprofitable past, a change in tastes and an overall shift to 
manufacture shoes abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanover's parent firm, C&AMP;J Clark International Ltd. of Somerset,  
England, once operated seven plants in North America. Hanover, 
which once employed 700 workers on two shifts, is the last. Work is 
now centered in Australia and England. 
</P>
<P>
	The coming closure is ``one more step in the dismantling of the  
manufacturing economy of this country,'' said Glen Eisenhower, who 
took over supervising the plant in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	When Eisenhower started, Hanover was suffering annual losses  
from $1.5 million to $3 million and carrying a 9 percent defect 
rate. Six months -- and some managerial shuffling -- later, its 
defect rate was down to 2 percent, and the plant was profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this (shutdown) had happened three years ago, we could  
understand it,'' he said. ``But not when it's making money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet profits weren't all Hanover was up against.  
</P>
<P>
	The factory, which produces 4,500 pairs of wingtips, tassel  
loafers and other classic men's dress styles every day, specializes 
in what worker Leslie Dodrill calls ``the old man's shoe,'' the 
kind that only looks right with a suit. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been 'in' forever, but not anymore,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Further, experts say about 85 percent of all shoes on the U.S.  
market are now imported. China is now America's largest shoe 
supplier. 
</P>
<P>
	``Manufacturing overseas has become a lot more sophisticated,''  
said Michael Appell, president of Two/Ten International Footwear 
Foundation. Countries with low labor costs have developed better 
supplier networks, he said, and the Internet has made doing 
business faster and simpler. 
</P>
<P>
	There are a few manufacturers left in the United States,  
including Dexter Shoes and Eastland Shoe in Maine, and Munro &AMP; Co. 
in Arkansas. ``But many American companies just can't compete,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	When factories close, the communities that suffer are often like  
Franklin -- small, rural and predominantly white. Often, most of the 
workers are women. 
</P>
<P>
	To help, Appell's foundation provides social services, career  
training, referrals and counseling, as well as direct financial aid 
to those reluctant to relocate. This year, the foundation will 
distribute nearly $1 million to shoe-industry workers, some in 
direct aid to families but much of it as scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people are just barely subsisting,'' Appell said.  
``They come to us for help because they can't make ends meet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Hanover, 125 miles east of Charleston, the average employee  
has been on the job for 16 years. About 60 percent are women, many 
of whom took the job for the insurance benefits. The base wage is 
$5.50 an hour, but the average employee earns between $8.50 and $9. 
</P>
<P>
	Pendleton County officials are already searching for a tenant to  
replace Hanover, and Clark, the parent firm, has donated $30,000 to 
the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	But it hasn't eased the concerns of residents, who wonder if  
Franklin -- and America -- will ever be the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``My fear,'' said Leslie Dodrill, ``is that one of these days,  
all the things that say 'Made in the U.S.A.' won't be.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Jets Bomb Iraqi Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- U.S. warplanes bombed Iraqi air defense  
sites Monday in response to Iraqi fire in the northern and southern 
no-fly zones, U.S. military officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Air Force F-16s and F-15s dropped laser-guided bombs on an  
Iraqi command and control site north of the city of Mosul, some 250 
miles north of Baghdad, the Germany-based U.S. European Command 
said in a statement released on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	An F-16 also attacked a surface-to-air radar site east of Mosul  
with anti-radiation missiles, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	In southern Iraq, U.S. Navy F-18s dropped precision-guided bombs  
on two Iraqi surface-to-air missile sites near As Samawah, about 
150 miles south of Baghdad, military officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	That attack was a response to Iraq's firing of anti-aircraft  
artillery at allied planes patrolling the southern no-fly zone, a 
statement from the U.S. Central Command at MacDill Air Force Base 
in Florida said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iraqi army claimed that U.S. warplanes hit civilian sites in  
southern Iraq, wounding six people, the official Iraqi News Agency 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	No allied aircraft were damaged in the incidents -- the latest of  
a series of confrontations between Iraq and allied warplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and British warplanes are enforcing a no-fly zone in  
northern Iraq to protect Iraqi Kurds against Baghdad's forces. 
Another no-fly zone was set up in southern Iraq to protect Shiite 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Baghdad, saying the zones violate international law, has  
challenged allied planes there since December.

<HEADLINE> Gov. Signs Fla. School Voucher Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Gov. Jeb Bush signed the nation's first  
statewide school voucher law Monday, enabling students at Florida's 
worst schools to get a private or parochial education at taxpayer 
expense. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to give parents other options when their schools --  
the most important public service that we provide -- don't work for 
their needs,'' the Republican governor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the law said will file a lawsuit on Tuesday. Bush  
said the state is ready to defend the constitutionality of the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the law, schools will be graded A, B, C, D or F. Students  
in failing schools can choose to go to private school with the tax 
dollars that would otherwise go to the public school. The amount 
could range from $3,000 to $25,000, depending on what extra 
services the student needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Students at only two schools, both in Pensacola, will initially  
be eligible for vouchers. But tougher standards approved last year 
may push that number up dramatically.

<HEADLINE> Bush Promotes Abstinence Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush said Monday  
that if elected president, he would increase the federal 
government's role in encouraging sexual abstinence by teen-agers to 
prevent sexually transmitted disease and unwanted pregnancies. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, shown in polls as the front-runner for the Republican  
presidential nomination, congratulated students and community 
leaders in an abstinence education program in Greenville. The 
students were part of a Charleston-based abstinence program, 
Heritage Community Services. 
</P>
<P>
	Abstinence isn't just about not having sex, he said: It's about  
saying ``yes to a happier, healthier future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said family issues will be a central element of his  
campaign. He said he will use federal funds for abstinence 
education in amounts equal to that now provided for teen-age 
contraception. 
</P>
<P>
	He also wants to ensure that churches, synagogues and other  
faith-based groups can compete for education grants. And he said 
the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, 
should study of the effectiveness of federally funded sex education 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement by Bush's campaign staff said that in texas, the  
Bush administrstion has contracted with 32 community organizations 
to provide abstinence education. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first campaign foray in South Carolina, Bush also made  
appearances in West Columbia and capped his visit with a 
fund-raising reception at the Greenville-Spartanburg International 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Another GOP contender, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., was in Myrtle  
Beach and Columbia on Monday. His campaign released a list of 17 
state legislators who are backing his effort and said as many as a 
dozen of them had earlier backed Bush, or leaning in that 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
	However, state House Speaker Pro Tem Terry Haskins and state  
Rep. Rick Quinn, two of McCain's supporters, said they could not 
name which of the lawmakers had previously supported Bush.

<HEADLINE> Women Filing for Bankruptcy More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Women are resorting to personal bankruptcy  
more frequently than men and married couples, according to new data 
released by a Harvard law professor who specializes in bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	As Congress debates legislation to make it harder for people to  
erase debts in bankruptcy, the new study being written by Elizabeth 
Warren, a widely-quoted expert, will likely become fresh ammunition 
for opponents of the proposed restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	But another bankruptcy expert voiced skepticism Monday about the  
study, saying it doesn't appear to conclusively demonstrate a link 
between gender and bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not much there,'' said Sam Gerdano, executive director  
of the American Bankruptcy Institute, a group of 6,400 attorneys, 
judges, bankers, and professors that does not take positions on 
bankruptcy issues. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Gerdano acknowledged that divorce is a major factor in  
bankruptcy for men and women and that divorced women are more 
likely to have financial problems than other women. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Warren was traveling Monday and not available for an  
interview. Her data, first reported in Monday's editions of USA 
Today and confirmed by a Harvard colleague, show that 39 percent of 
bankruptcy court filings in the 12 months ended March 31 were made 
by women. That compares with 28 percent for men and 33 percent for 
married couples, according to the study of filings in eight of the 
94 federal bankruptcy districts. 
</P>
<P>
	The House, seeking to stop the nationwide increase in personal  
bankruptcies, last month passed a bill sought by credit card 
companies that would make it tougher for people to erase their 
debts in bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has opposed the bill, which cleared  
the House by a veto-proof 313-108 margin -- getting solid support 
from Republicans but splitting the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have concerns about the hardships that this bill will  
impose on many responsible lower- and middle-income debtors who are 
trying to get a fresh start,'' White House spokesman Jake Siewert 
said Monday. ``And the fact that this hardship falls 
disproportionately on single women is further cause for concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parallel legislation, which is somewhat less stringent toward  
debtors, is pending in the Senate. Its chief author, Sen. Charles 
Grassley, R-Iowa, has been trying to work out compromises with 
Democratic opponents such as Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellen Nissenbaum, legislative director for the liberal Center on  
Budget and Policy Priorities, said the legislation ``seems to move 
the bankruptcy system in a much less balanced and equitable'' 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
	She said some changes are needed in the bankruptcy laws to curb  
abuses, but the legislation now before Congress goes too far. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley and sponsors of the House measure, led by Reps. George  
Gekas, R-Pa., and Jim Moran, D-Va., say the legislation does help 
women whose husbands or former husbands have filed for bankruptcy, 
by giving child support and alimony payments a higher priority than 
credit card debt and other obligations. Under the current law, 
debts such as bankruptcy lawyers' fees, student loans and other 
obligations must be paid before child support or alimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women would be treated a lot better than they are now,'' said  
Carey Dearnley, a spokeswoman for Gekas. 
</P>
<P>
	But opponents maintain that the legislation, by barring certain  
credit card debts from being erased in bankruptcy, would force 
single mothers and children owed support by bankrupt fathers to 
compete with credit card companies in collecting debts. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation ``will exacerbate the problems faced by the  
growing number of women in the bankruptcy system,'' Kennedy said. 
``The bill's supporters claim they are protecting women and 
children, but the protections are a sham. The (legislation) is an 
unfair sweetheart deal for the credit card companies at the expense 
of hard-pressed women and children.''

<HEADLINE> Report: No Implants-Illness Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Silicone breast implants do not cause  
life-threatening illnesses, though they can cause problems in some 
women, a federal advisory panel reports today. 
</P>
<P>
	The implants have generated controversy in recent years with  
some women contending that they can break open and lead to such 
diseases as cancer and nerve and immune disorders. 
</P>
<P>
	But the new report from the Institute of Medicine, an arm of the  
National Academy of Sciences, concludes that women with silicone 
breast implants are no more likely than the rest of the population 
to develop serious illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although studies do not show a risk of life-threatening  
illness from silicone breast implants, it is clear that they can 
cause serious problems,'' said the committee chairman, Stuart 
Bondurant, professor of medicine at the University of North 
Carolina, Chapel Hill. ``It is essential that women fully 
understand these risks before they decide to undergo this 
surgery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 2 million women in the United States and Canada have  
received the implants either as part of reconstructive surgery or 
for cosmetic reasons. But in 1992, the Food and Drug Administration 
banned the use of silicone breast implants except in clinical 
studies of women receiving them after a mastectomy. Saline-filled 
implants are still approved for use in cosmetic or reconstructive 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturers insist the devices are safe, but thousands of  
women who had sued approved a $3.2 billion plan earlier this month 
to settle with implant maker Dow Corning Corp. A federal judge next 
week must decide whether to approve the plan, which would give 
claimants who want their silicone implants removed $5,000 for the 
surgery, or $20,000 if their implants have ruptured. 
</P>
<P>
	The institute report said the rate of complications varies  
considerably depending on the type and age of the implant, but the 
chance that a woman will experience a problem increases with time. 
</P>
<P>
	Many women with breast implants have complained that they were  
not given sufficient information before receiving the implants. 
</P>
<P>
	The report urged that researchers monitor women for extended  
periods to determine the incidence of health problems with 
implants. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said the most serious problems associated with  
implants arise when the tissue around them contracts, when the 
implant ruptures, or when infection occurs. As a result, many women 
experience substantial pain and discomfort and many undergo surgery 
to replace or remove the implants. 
</P>
<P>
	While much previous information on implants has been anecdotal,  
the report said new studies led to several conclusions: 
</P>
<P>
	--There is no evidence to suggest that the silicones used in  
implants are toxic to humans. 
</P>
<P>
	--There is no established link between implants and a unique  
disease syndrome. Problems ascribed to implants generally involve 
symptoms that are nonspecific and common in the general population. 
</P>
<P>
	--There is no evidence that conclusively links silicone to  
harmful effects on the immune system. Follow-up analyses have 
failed to uncover associations with specific immunological diseases 
or other conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	--Although evidence is lacking for any relationship between  
breast implants and cancer, the presence of implants may make it 
more difficult to detect cancer through mammography. Despite this, 
breast cancer mortality is not higher in women who have implants. 
</P>
<P>
	--There is no evidence that mothers with implants pass silicone  
on to infants when breast-feeding. Much higher levels of silicon -- 
the element on which the silicone family of organic compounds is 
based - have been found in cows' milk and commercially available 
infant formula than in the milk of nursing mothers with implants. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the women who have received implants, about 70 percent  
obtained them for cosmetic reasons and 30 percent for breast 
reconstruction after surgery for cancer or other conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	The report notes that in developed countries, people are  
commonly exposed to the kinds of materials used in implants through 
foods, cosmetics, lubricants for machinery, hypodermic syringes, 
insulators and other products. About 10 million people in the 
United States have some type of implant in their bodies, such as an 
artificial joint or pacemaker, and many of these implants are made 
at least in part from silicone.

<HEADLINE> Early Campaign Finance Vote Slows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An effort to force campaign finance  
legislation to the floor ahead of Speaker Dennis Hastert's 
timetable appears becalmed in the House, where a petition drive has 
failed to gather any new GOP support in more than three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Chris Shays of Connecticut, the leading Republican advocate  
of the measure, says, ``I make no assumptions'' about whether any 
additional GOP lawmakers will sign the petition. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus far, 195 Democrats and independent Rep. Bernie Sanders have  
backed the effort to force the bill to the floor in advance of 
Hastert's date of mid-September. Six Republicans also have signed, 
leaving the petition drive a dozen short of the 218 needed to 
prevail. 
</P>
<P>
	But no Republican has joined them since the six added their  
names last May 26. 
</P>
<P>
	That was also the week that Hastert made a direct appeal to the  
GOP rank and file to work together on a common agenda, lest 
Democrats regain control of the House in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., convened the first  
in a series of House Administration Committee hearings last week to 
explore the issue. Democrats immediately charged it had been 
explored enough already. 
</P>
<P>
	The centerpiece of the legislation would ban so-called soft  
money, which are large, unregulated donations that parties and 
politicians solicit to advance their causes. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign finance measure is likely to pass the House when it  
finally reaches the floor, since a nearly identical bill cleared a 
year ago. Supporters say, however, that September is too late if 
the measure is to pass both houses this year

<P>
	Senate Democrats forced an early, inconclusive skirmish with  
Republicans during the day over White House-backed legislation to 
enhance the rights of patients dealing with their health care 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Byron Dorgan of North Dakota offered the bill as an  
amendment to a routine agriculture spending bill. 
</P>
<P>
	That prompted Republicans to require the Senate reading clerk to  
read the health care measure word for word, a time-consuming 
process that customarily is dispensed with. Before the reading was 
over, Majority Leader Trent Lott went to the floor and pulled the 
spending bill from consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	In an exchange between Lott and the Democrats, the two sides  
agreed the issue would be back for a fuller debate and series of 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
	House Democrats are expected to begin a push for the same bill  
on Wednesday, when they plan to sign a petition to force the 
measure to the floor. Republicans are at work on a health bill of 
their own in the House, as well as in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	Across the Capitol, Democrats are already weighing a plan to  
force gun control votes on routine spending bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun control legislation failed in the House last week, but  
officials said Democrats on the Appropriations Committee were 
giving thought to trying to attach pieces of it to legislation 
providing funding for the Treasury Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Ready with amendments are Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., whose  
proposal would tighten requirements for sales at gun shows; Rep. 
Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., who wants to raise the minimum age of hand-gun 
buyers from 18 to 21; and Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., who favors 
mandatory safety devices with all hand guns.

	NATO, KLA Agree on Demilitarization  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Kosovo Albanian rebels signed a  
wide-ranging demilitarization pact with NATO today, allowing the 
peacekeeping force to impose its control on the province and try to 
prevent a backlash of ethnic violence. The pact, which aims to 
neutralize the Kosovo Liberation Army as a military force, was 
signed just after midnight, only hours after the last of the 
Serb-led Yugoslav forces left the province. The role of the KLA has 
been a critical issue for post-war Kosovo. Around 50,000 Serbs have 
fled the province over the past week, fearing the guerrillas would 
exact bloody revenge for Serb forces' campaign of killings and 
expulsions against Albanians over the past 2 1/2 months.

	BATALIK, India (AP) -- Pounded by Pakistani artillery, Indian  
soldiers dug into newly won positions on a mountain ridge today and 
prepared for an assault on the last pockets of Islamic guerrillas 
in the mountainous Kashmir region. As India claimed new military 
victories, the leaders of the world's most industrialized nations 
and Russia urged a halt to the fighting in Kashmir. The divided 
territory has been the trigger for two wars since India and

have split them recently. President Clinton was conferring with top 
officials of the 14-nation European Union today in advance of a

discussion reconstruction efforts following the end of NATO's 
78-day air war that forced Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With NATO having officially declared its air

aircraft carrier to the western Pacific in a move made more urgent 
by renewed tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The Navy has been 
without an aircraft carrier in the Pacific since early April, when 
the USS Kitty Hawk carrier battle group went to the Persian Gulf to

stairs to the six-story granite building that loomed over manicured 
hills, Mahathir shook hands with his staff then performed a Muslim 
prayer before entering. Civil servants are expected to shift into 
Putrajaya, 25 miles south of Kuala Lumpur, in coming months. In the

British newspapers contended the couple would take only four days 
off at the queen's Scottish retreat before returning to work. ``Too 
busy for a proper honeymoon,'' read the headline in the Daily Mail, 
which said the couple chose to spend their brief honeymoon on the 
royal Balmoral estate partly to deter the paparazzi. They 
reportedly spent the first night at Birkhall Lodge, a house on the 
estate usually used by Edward's grandmother, the Queen Mother 
Elizabeth.

6.8 runs, have scored 54 runs in their last six games and remain on

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mixed; Dow Down 39.58 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks pulled back slightly Monday,  
but technology shares rallied for a fifth straight session, pushing 
the Nasdaq market toward its first record high since late April. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average finished 39.58 lower at  
10,815.98 after recovering from an afternoon slide of nearly 100 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite index jumped 2.6 percent, finishing 66.84  
higher at 2,630.28. The index has now rallied 232 points, or nearly 
10 percent, in just five sessions, and sits just 22 points from its 
all-time best close of 2,652.05 set on April 26. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow, which last week gained 365 points, remains about 200  
points below its May 3 closing record of 11,014.69. Still, the 
measure of 30 blue-chip companies holds a surprising gain of more 
than 1,600 points, or nearly 18 percent, for 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mostly positive Monday, but posted  
slimmer gains than the tech-dominated Nasdaq market. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology shares fell sharply in recent weeks amid fears the  
Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to slow the economy and 
contain inflation. But with investors now expecting Fed Chairman 
Alan Greenspan to seek only a small increase in rates, the 
discounted prices in the technology group are looking more 
attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	``The conventional wisdom is that interest rates are a done  
deal, based on what Greenspan said last week'' in an appearance 
before Congress, said Richard Dickson, a market analyst at Scott &AMP; 
Stringfellow in Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Dickson also said the market is growing more confident about  
profit reports for the nearly-ended second quarter, but cast doubt 
on how long any rally might last at these levels. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the market can make new highs, but I don't see it  
going much farther,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among leading Nasdaq technology names, Dell Computer rose 2  
15/64 to 38 15/16, Microsoft rose 3 15/16 to 88 15/16, Cisco 
Systems rose 3 3/4 to 123 1/8 and Intel rose 1 7/8 to 56 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, IBM rose 4 to 124 3/4 and Hewlett-Packard rose 2 1/8 to 93 7/8  
to cushion the Dow, which was yanked lower by Alcoa, down 4 3/16 to 
63 3/8. Energy shares also weighed on the Dow, with Chevron falling 2 1/2 
to 90 11/16 and Exxon falling 2 1/8 to 78 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks also continued to rebound from a steep decline,  
with Yahoo! rising 14 7/16 to 158 7/8 and Amazon.com rising 12 3/16 to 
123 1/2 in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other popular indexes, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 turned  
higher late in Monday's trading and rose 6.16 to 1,349.00. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 0.39 to 636.94 and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 2.82 to 765.75. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 4.39 to 449.44.  
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a small margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,599 up, 1,420 down and 539 
unchanged. Nasdaq advancers led by a wider gap. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled an anemic 676.12 million shares as of 4  
p.m., down sharply from Friday's tally 902.35 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.76 percent.  
Germany's DAX index rose 0.34 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 
1.50 percent, and France's CAC-40 rose 0.12 percent.

<HEADLINE> Duncan, Spurs are Long Shot in 4th </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With touch-and-go shooting from his supporting  
cast, Tim Duncan tried to rescue the San Antonio Spurs in the 
fourth quarter of Game 3 in the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't score. The Spurs didn't win. They won't sweep the New  
York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	That simple.  
</P>
<P>
	Duncan had his worst game of series with 20 points and was  
0-for-4 in the fourth quarter as the Spurs lost 89-81 to the Knicks 
in Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tim still had 20,'' said point guard Avery Johnson, one of  
Duncan's teammates who didn't give him much help. ``He's not going 
to get 33 every night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three of Duncan's misses came as the Spurs desperately tried to  
get closer than six points down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	The last one was an ugly, uncharacteristic 3-point attempt from  
the top of the circle that would have cut the Knicks' lead to 88-84 
-- if it hadn't clanked nastily off the front iron. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a stupid play,'' said Duncan, who passed up a shot  
in the post before attempting the 3-pointer. ``I should have shot 
the ball. I should have turned around and shot the ball. I made the 
wrong decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps Duncan, who had averaged 29.0 points and 15.5 rebounds  
in Games 1 and 2, had lost confidence in his ability to carry the 
Spurs. Defended solidly by Larry Johnson, Kurt Thomas and Chris 
Dudley for the first time in the series, Duncan's 20 points were a 
series-low for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Elie, who had six points and five fouls, said the Knicks --  
especially Johnson -- deserved credit for ``not letting him get to 
that sweet spot on the floor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They were a little more aggressive on me,'' Duncan said of his  
nightmarish fourth quarter. ``I couldn't get to the middle as easy 
as before. But I missed some shots I usually make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the Spurs' NBA record 12-game postseason winning  
streak came to an ignominious end in the unfamiliar territory of 
Madison Square Garden. So did their perfect 6-0 record on the road 
in these playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, who was furious at the refs and got  
a technical in the first quarter, assessed Duncan's off-game with a 
veiled slap at the officiating. Duncan, who had 12 rebounds, was 
only 4-for-4 from the foul line. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their team was very physical. They did a great job of helping  
on him and double-teaming him,'' Popovich said. ``They just made it 
very difficult for him to get anything done down there. That was 
evident in the fact that he only shot four free throws with all 
those touches. So they must have done something right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fairness to Duncan, he didn't get much help from his  
teammates -- aside from David Robinson's 25 points. Sean Elliott 
scored only seven on 3-for-9 shooting. Johnson had 10 points and a 
couple of costly turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
	Never was the Spurs' desperation more evident, though, than when  
Duncan let that 3-pointer fly.

<HEADLINE> Stars Shine in Stanley Cup Clincher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- A long game ended too quickly for the  
Buffalo Sabres and the Dallas Stars walked off with the Stanley Cup 
under a cloud of controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	All of a sudden, the troublesome man-in-the crease rule had  
become a major issue in the NHL. The question now over the summer: 
Should it be changed? 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody will remember this as the Stanley Cup that was never  
won in '99,'' said Buffalo's Joe Juneau after the Stars won a 2-1 
triple-overtime thriller on Brett Hull's questionable goal Saturday 
night in Game 6 of the Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Sabres wanted to put an asterisk next to the Stars' name  
in the Stanley Cup record book, you couldn't blame them. They felt 
they had been cheated out of a chance to win the Cup because of a 
bad call by NHL officials. The television replay showed Hull had a 
skate in the crease when he scored the game winner with 5:09 left 
in the third overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Usually the man-in-the-crease rule is a strict interpretation  
with no gray matter: It disallows a goal if an offensive player has 
any part of his body in the goalie crease. Not this time. 
</P>
<P>
	The official response from the league: This one counted because  
the player (Hull) had full control of the puck. 
</P>
<P>
	``The debate here seems to be, did he or did he not have  
possession and control,'' said Bryan Lewis, the NHL's director of 
officiating. ``Our words from upstairs and our view was that, yes, 
he did. He played the puck from his foot to his stick, shot and 
scored.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rule has been the bane of skaters for some time. Many a goal  
has been disallowed even by infractions that are purely incidental 
to the play, such as a teammate's skate in the crease away from the 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, the NHL's general managers met just a few days before  
at the finals to discuss the controversial ruling. Commissioner 
Gary Bettman said the league was worried about the game losing some 
of its spontaneity when play is stopped for a video review of a 
goal. He added the ruling was under review for a possible change. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't have to worry about spontaneity Saturday night.  
</P>
<P>
	As soon as Hull scored, the Stars, wearing Stanley Cup  
championship baseball caps, leaped over the bench onto the ice and 
started hugging each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's got to be the worst nightmare right there,'' Sabres coach  
Lindy Ruff said. ``They knew that they ran the risk of an overtime 
goal meaning a series. Stanley Cup pandemonium sets in and they 
can't go back to review it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said the goal was, in fact, reviewed quite thoroughly.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our immediate reaction is to take a look at it, back up tapes  
from a variety of angles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said officials looked at the play ``probably six, eight  
(times).'' 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy at the end overshadowed a superb contest between  
two evenly matched teams. Every game in the finals was pretty much 
a carbon copy of the next -- low scoring and high tension. There was 
plenty of hard hitting and good goaltending from Dallas' Ed Belfour 
and Buffalo's Dominik Hasek. 
</P>
<P>
	Belfour, shaking off the tag that he couldn't win big games,  
made 53 saves in the clinching Game 6. Hasek pretty much lived up 
to his title as ``World's Greatest Goalie'' with 48. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were such a great team,'' Hull said of the Sabres, who  
came into the finals as underdogs to the top-ranked Stars after 
finishing as the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference. ``They are 
so well coached and worked so hard. I tip my hat to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Playing underdog all the way through, the Sabres knocked off  
Ottawa, Boston and Toronto to make it into the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	In a remarkably close series, the Sabres and the Western  
champion Stars were either tied or just one goal apart for all but 
5:05 of the six-plus games, including two that went into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars were pretty much bucking odds themselves. The last  
team to win both the Presidents' Trophy with the league's best 
record and the Stanley Cup was the New York Rangers in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to redeem themselves after winning the trophy and then  
losing in the playoffs last year, the Stars beat Edmonton, St. 
Louis and Colorado before Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had it in our minds that we were going to do this in  
September,'' said Stars forward Brian Skrudland, ``and we were 
going to win this in any way we could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In some ways, the Sabres felt the Stars had gone too far. Sabres  
captain Michael Peca charged that the Stars were a dirty team. 
</P>
<P>
	They were certainly an injured team. That didn't keep their top  
players off the ice for long, however. Hull was forced to miss one 
game with an injured groin, but came back to play with a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday night, he was at his best while also playing with an  
injured knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Jere Lehtinen scored a first-period goal for Dallas and Stu  
Barnes in the second for Buffalo. That was all the scoring until 
Hull found himself in front of the net late in the third overtime, 
won the battle over several other players for the puck and punched 
the game winner over a prone Hasek. 
</P>
<P>
	The game winner went to Hull and the Conn Smythe Trophy as the  
playoffs' MVP to Joe Nieuwendyk, who had six game-winning playoff 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels incredible,'' said Nieuwendyk, who won the first Cup  
in Calgary in 1989 before winning the first for Dallas. ``It is 
just one battle after another and it makes it all the worthwhile in 
the end. It has been a great ride for us.''

<HEADLINE> EU Seeks Larger Probe of Coca-Cola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- As top executives lobbied to lift a ban  
on sales of Coca-Cola's major soft-drinks, the European Union today 
requested further investigations to find what caused dozens of 
people to become ill after drinking the company's products. 
</P>
<P>
	The call for additional study came as the health scare spilled  
into Africa and as Coca-Cola and its local distributors launched a 
European advertising campaign defending the quality of their 
products as beyond reproach. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola Co.'s chairman, M. Douglas Ivester, returned to  
Brussels on Monday with the company's marketing chief, Charles 
Frenette, for meetings with Belgian government officials in an 
attempt to speed up the resumption of sales of Coke, Sprite and 
Fanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgium banned all Coca-Cola products on June 14, and only  
restored some of its brands to store shelves on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta-based Coca-Cola has blamed defective carbon dioxide,  
used to put fizz in its drinks, for problems at its Antwerp 
manufacturing plant in Belgium, while the company said that the 
outside of cans made in Dunkirk, France, were contaminated with a 
wood preservative during shipping. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said these two unrelated problems have led to  
similar symptoms of nausea and vomiting. One company-commissioned 
study suggested the health problems were in the victims' heads. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, the first children with Coke complaints were  
hospitalized in Belgium. Since then, some 200 people have been 
treated for nausea, vomiting and hyperventilation after drinking 
Coca-Cola products. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is still nothing clear about the cause of the  
contamination,'' said Belgian Health Ministry spokesman Marc 
Pattyn. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the lingering uncertainty, the EU's executive body,  
the European Commission, called for additional investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Belgium and France will have joint inspections on Coca-Cola  
plants in the next few days,'' said Pietro Petrucci, a spokesman 
for the 15-nation EU Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Begium's ban on both cans and bottles of Coke,  
Sprite and Fanta, France has stopped sales of all Cokecans produced 
at Dunkirk, although it is allowing sales of cans produced at the 
country's other Coke plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials in both countries have vowed to continue some  
sort of a ban until a precise explanation for the illnesses is 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	The Netherlands and Switzerland also have imposed selective  
bans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ivory Coast seized nearly 50,000 cans of Coke imported from  
Europe as a precautionary measure and pulled them from supermarket 
shelves, trade officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to protect the lives of Ivorian consumers against  
any contamination,'' said Yao Konan, an official with the Ministry 
of Internal Trade in the Ivory Coast. There was no evidence, 
however, that anyone in the Ivory Coast has become ill by drinking 
imported Coke, which accounts for only 1 percent of the Coca-Cola 
products consumed in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Coca-Cola said reports it commissioned from  
toxicologists found no serious health risks in samples from the 
Dunkirk and Antwerp plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Kroes of Utrecht University in the Netherlands, said that  
while there were unpleasant odors from the samples, any impurities 
were well within acceptable limits and much too weak to account for 
the illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	In a similar analysis, toxicologist D. Lison at Catholic  
University in Louvain, Belgium, suggested the problem could be ``a 
mass sociogenic illness,'' or physical discomfort aggravated by an 
emotional reaction. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials in Belgium were skeptical.  
</P>
<P>
	``Thirty children had to be hospitalized. Eight had to spend the  
night in hospital. Four had to spend two nights in hospital. It 
makes me doubt any argument about psychosomatic,'' said Pattyn, the 
Health Ministry spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola advertisements, meantime, began appearing in France,  
Italy, Greece and Spain defending the quality of the company's soft 
drinks. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad appearing in major French dailies said that analyses by  
Coca-Cola and by independent teams show that ``the drink is not in 
question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Its quality is irreproachable.''  
</P>
<P>
	The theme was the same in Italy. ``There is no relation between  
The Coca-Cola Company's drinks produced in Italy and the incidents 
that have happened abroad,'' the newspaper ad read.

<HEADLINE> Intel Chosen for TV Set-Top Boxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Intel Corp. will provide Hughes  
Network Systems with microprocessors for its latest television 
set-top receivers, the companies announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes, a leader in satellite products and network systems, will  
use Pentium MMX microprocessors in set-top boxes enabling Internet 
access as well as its own satellite-driven DirecTV service. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel, the world's largest  
chip maker, it signals a significant foray outside the personal 
computer business. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies agreed to collaborate on a number of television  
set-top box products, the first being the AOL TV satellite 
receiver, capable of supporting AOL TV, the service from America 
Online Inc., which will bring AOL to the television, as well as the 
200-plus channels of digital TV available through DirecTV. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies also announced that Intel is licensing DirecPC  
technology from Hughes in order to integrate the technology into 
future products. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes Network Systems, a unit of Hughes Electronics Corp., is  
based in Gaithersburg, Md.

<HEADLINE> Weyerhaeuser Purchases Mac. Bloedel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Weyerhaeuser said its purchase of Canadian  
forest-products competitor MacMillan Bloedel for $2.45 billion in 
stock will expand its product line and immediately add to earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Weyerhaeuser already is the world's largest producer of softwood  
lumber and market pulp, and the deal would make the Federal 
Way-based company a leader in packaging as well. 
</P>
<P>
	When complete, the transaction will boost Weyerhaeuser's annual  
sales to about $13.3 billion from $10.8 billion last year, 
Weyerhaeuser said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	Weyerhaeuser also expects to achieve some $150 million in annual  
benefits through savings in transportation and distribution, 
improving purchasing practices, increasing the balance in its 
manufacturing system and streamlining operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Weyerhaeuser shares fell Monday, closing at $67.12 1/2, down  
$2.62 1/2, or 3.8 percent on the New York Stock Exchange. MacMillan 
Bloedel shares were up 23 percent, or $3.37 1/2, to close at 17.81 1/4 on 
the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	The boards of both companies have approved an agreement under  
which MacMillan Bloedel shareholders would get 0.28 share of 
Weyerhaeuser stock for each share of MacMillan Bloedel. 
</P>
<P>
	The transaction, which is expected to close this fall, is  
subject to regulatory approval in the United States and Canada, 
court approval in Canada and a favorable vote by MacMillan Bloedel 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal took some analysts by surprise.  
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't looking for it. I don't think anyone else was  
either,'' said Seattle analyst Lee Childress, who has followed 
Weyerhaeuser for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But MacMillan Bloedel had become an attractive target for  
acquisition under CEO Tom Stephens, Childress said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The company had done a nice job in the last year and a half of  
turning things around in a tough pricing environment,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Weyerhaeuser is one of the world's largest integrated  
forest-products companies, with offices or operations in 12 
countries. Of its 35,000 North American employees, 5,900 work for 
Weyerhaeuser Canada, based in Vancouver, British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The company owns or manages 5.3 million acres of U.S. timberland  
and has timber licenses on 27 million acres in Canada. Its North 
American operations produce pulp, paper, packaging, lumber and 
structural panels that are sold around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	MacMillan Bloedel employs 9,500 people, with 5,500 in Canada. It  
has 6.9 million acres of productive timberlands -- 427,500 acres in 
the United States -- and 33 distribution centers in the United 
States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven R. Rogel said Weyerhaeuser did not foresee laying off a  
large number of workers, since MacMillan Bloedel operations already 
are efficient and the companies meshed well. 
</P>
<P>
	Some job cuts likely will result from the merger of MacMillan  
Bloedel's corporate office in Vancouver, British Columbia, with 
Weyerhaeuser's own office there, he said.

<HEADLINE> 'Geisha Chic' Takes Hold in America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Geisha chic is quietly taking hold.  
</P>
<P>
	It started with Arthur Golden's novel ``Memoirs of a Geisha,''  
which sold over 1 million copies. Then Steven Spielberg bought 
rights to the film. Then it hit the fashion runways. 
</P>
<P>
	Fashion shows introduced the obi, a carefully tied sash that is  
worn over a kimono, this spring; Madonna wore a red vinyl obi and 
gown with jumbo kimono sleeves to this year's Grammy Awards. 
Fashion magazines tell women to ``Geisha-ize.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a veteran geisha who knows Golden is annoyed that her art  
has been appropriated by American pop culture. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took a very strict examination to become a geisha. I studied  
very, very hard,'' said Kiharu Nakamura, her eyes moist as she 
remembers long nights with drunken clients and exhausting days of 
lessons in traditional arts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to correct the idea of geisha,'' she said, ``but then I  
go to a party and see people putting chopsticks in their hair. 
Ridiculous!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the geisha's image as a sort of high-class prostitute,  
the women are really professional entertainers and generally do not 
sleep with clients. Traditionally, they dance, tell amusing stories 
and play party games; the name geisha means ``practitioner of 
arts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Nakamura, 87, spent years studying Japanese dance, flower  
arrangement, the tea ceremony, poetry, and other skills. Before 
becoming a geisha, she had to pass a grueling exam. 
</P>
<P>
	In pre-war Japan, she entertained scores of men -- including  
Charlie Chaplin and Babe Ruth -- in sake-drinking evenings at tea 
houses in Tokyo. In stunning kimono, hairdo and make-up, she had to 
ensure each client had a good time. 
</P>
<P>
	She has lived in the United States since 1956 and now lives in  
the borough of Queens. She dresses in kimonos, lives amid rice 
paper shoji screens and teaches the samisen, a traditional stringed 
instrument. 
</P>
<P>
	Golden was friends with Ms. Nakamura before writing his best  
seller but used another geisha, from Kyoto, as a primary source for 
the book. Steven Spielberg's film depiction of the novel is due out 
in December 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Golden, whose book seems so believable many readers forget it is  
fiction, spent years researching his story about the highly 
controlled and stylized world of Chiyo, a girl from a poor fishing 
village who is forced into life as a geisha in Kyoto. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking the name Sayuri, she becomes a hugely successful geisha.  
Eventually she moves to New York where she dictates her memoirs to 
a fictional Dutch scholar. 
</P>
<P>
	The beauty of the world of pre-war Japan so carefully described  
in the bestseller quickly proved irresistible to consumers a world 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	``Business has improved this year,'' confirmed Yumiko Sakuyama,  
manager of Kimono, a shop selling kimonos and Japanese accessories 
in New York's East Village. ``Maybe it's because of that book, or 
maybe Madonna. It's hard to tell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Japanese-style clothes are easy to come by, Ms. Nakamura  
said real geisha chic requires hard work and discipline. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now young people have no patience, no obedience. ... If a girl  
has very good talent, she becomes a cocktail waitress, a bar girl -- 
that is more money,'' she said, shaking her head in dismay as she 
touches one of the ornate decorations in her hair. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Golden's protagonist, Ms. Nakamura was a Tokyo geisha.  
She is from a wealthy family of doctors and chose to become a 
geisha, with her grandfather paying the hefty cost of her training 
and her silk kimonos. 
</P>
<P>
	But much like the protagonist, she has written her own memoirs --  
``Edokko Geisha Ichidai-ki'' (Biography of a Tokyo Geisha) -- along 
with more than a dozen other books. 
</P>
<P>
	Available only in Japanese and German, the memoirs will be  
translated into English next year, said Ms. Nakamura, who is now 
working on a book about the Japanese language. She is now invited 
to give lectures on her life. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Nakamura seems to thrive in the geisha-style world she has  
created for herself. But she has nothing for disdain for those to 
try and emulate the style. 
</P>
<P>
	``How phony it is. I don't like imitation for anything,'' she  
said. ``I'm proud of my job.''

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Move Lower / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean and grain futures prices were mostly  
lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade as 
doubts arose about last week's forecasts of hot, dry weather this 
week in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, soybean and corn futures soared on reports that some  
forecasters expected temperatures could surpass the hundred-degree 
mark in key growing regions in the Plains states, possibly lowering 
yields. 
</P>
<P>
	But forecasters are now calling for more favorable growing  
temperatures and light rains in much of the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures prices found more support than corn and soybeans,  
in part because rain could cause further delays in the winter wheat 
harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	In early trading today, wheat for July delivery broke even at  
$2.54 3/4 a bushel; July corn fell 3 cents to $2.17 3/4 a bushel; July 
oats dropped 1/2 cent to $1.17 a bushel; and July soybeans fell 2 1/4 
cents to $4.72 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, meat and livestock futures prices fell in early  
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle fell 0.42 cent to 63.45 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle fell 0.67 cent to 76.45 cents a pound; July lean hogs 
fell 0.77 cent to 50 cents a pound; July pork bellies fell 1 cent 
to 42.20 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Cisneros' Ex-Mistress Takes Stand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawyers for former Housing Secretary Henry  
Cisneros sought Monday to keep prosecutors from using tapes 
secretly recorded by his ex-mistress, saying they constitute 
``tampered, inauthentic evidence'' that shouldn't be allowed at his 
upcoming conspiracy trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tapes shouldn't come in,'' said Barry Simon, a member of  
Cisneros' legal defense team. ``The bottom line is the government 
has advised the court already ... they were tampered with. End of 
story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Mark Jackowski acknowledged that Linda Jones had  
deleted portions of her taped phone conversations with Cisneros, 
editing out passages where she threatened him or that dealt with 
their sex life or other people. But Jackowski said the tapes are 
``relevant evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She just edited out these offensive passages or what she  
believed to be offensive passages,'' Jackowski said, adding that 
she destroyed the originals after making copies. 
</P>
<P>
	He said only five of the 33 tapes the government intends to use  
at Cisneros' September trial were altered. The independent 
counsel's office wants to use the tapes to corroborate witness 
testimony that the former Cabinet member conspired with his 
one-time lover to conceal more than $264,000 in ``hush money'' 
payments to her. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones, who ran afoul of the Cisneros prosecutors and was put  
in prison in part because she misrepresented the tapes as 
originals, took the witness stand Monday. She provided details 
about the extramarital affair and her decision to begin taping 
Cisneros, on the advice of a friend, after the highly publicized 
liaison ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones, 50, said she was ``devastated'' by media reports in  
the fall of 1988 of her affair with Cisneros, then mayor of San 
Antonio. Her husband filed for divorce and the publicity cost her 
her career as a political fund-raiser, she said. ``No one was going 
to hire me because I was the story,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones said she and Cisneros, who was not in court, began to  
discuss financial support for her after he returned to his wife in 
late 1989. ``I didn't have a way to support my daughter and I 
didn't see a way to do it,'' she said. Later, she added: ``He knew 
all of the press stories were his fault.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She is serving a 3 1/2-year prison sentence at a federal medical  
facility in Fort Worth, Texas after pleading guilty last year to 28 
counts involving fraud, conspiracy, money laundering and 
obstruction. The office of David Barrett, the government's special 
prosecutor, has suggested a willingness to support a reduction in 
her sentence and dismiss two pending counts depending on her level 
of cooperation at Cisneros' trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros, who served as HUD secretary from 1993 to 1996, was  
indicted in December 1997 on 18 felony counts of conspiracy, 
obstructing justice and making false statements to the FBI about 
his payments to Ms. Jones. He has pleaded innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he acknowledged providing financial support,  
prosecutors contend he falsely told the FBI during his Cabinet 
background check that he never paid her more than $2,500 at one 
time or more than $10,000 annually. The indictment alleges that he 
paid her more than $264,000 between 1990 and 1993, in installments 
as high as $15,000.

<HEADLINE> Colder Climate May Stifle Volcanoes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The thick glaciers that accumulate during ice  
ages may put a lid on volcanoes. 
</P>
<P>
	A study of volcanoes in eastern California indicates that, over  
millions of years, eruptions alternated with cycles of colder 
climate. 
</P>
<P>
	While scientists have long known that the gases blasted into the  
air by volcanoes can briefly cool the weather, the new findings are 
prompting speculation that it works both ways -- glacial conditions 
can suppress volcanoes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The correlation between volcanic outbursts and climate  
suggests that the two are linked,'' a team of researchers write in 
a paper appearing in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. 
</P>
<P>
	California isn't the only place that a similar correlation  
occurs, lead researcher Allen F. Glazner said in a telephone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was kind of crazy until I went to the library''  
and found similar patterns reported by other researchers, said 
Glazner, a University of North Carolina geology professor. 
</P>
<P>
	He said volcanoes could be suppressed in various ways, including  
changes in the stress on the earth's crust caused by the weight of 
ice or lake water, and changes in the amount and location of water 
underground in the area where magma builds volcanoes. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of those things is going to suppress a volcano forever,  
but they might delay it'' for thousands of years, Glazner said. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, he said, if a volcano is near eruption ``and you  
put the weight of 300 to 400 meters (975 to 1,300 feet) of ice on 
it, it might be enough confining stress to keep it from erupting 
another 10,000 years or so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, he noted that glacial times had a lot more rainfall and  
snowfall so ``there might be a cooling of the crust by water flux 
through it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In at least one area studied, numerous stone deposits indicated  
early hot springs, showing that water seeping through the earth was 
heated and rose to the surface, which could have provided an 
efficient heat transfer to cool volcanic magma. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers studying California's Long Valley, Big Pine and  
Coso volcanic fields found peaks of volcanic activity 10 million, 
100 million, 185 million, 320 million and 690 million years ago, 
alternating with periods of glacial climate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although the short-term effect of volcanism on climate is  
clear, it is unlikely that the correlation ... is a result of 
volcanically induced climate change,'' the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The climate impact of volcanoes has long been a topic of  
speculation, going back at least to Benjamin Franklin. The eruption 
of the Indonesian volcano Tambora was blamed for a worldwide 
cooling in 1816 -- the ``year without a summer'' when snow fell over 
New England in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The effect was more recently observed in the Philippines. The  
year after the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo, the average global 
climate cooled a degree or two because dust in the atmosphere 
blocked the sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
	But such effects tend to last only a year or two, and  
researchers say they are unlikely to lead to anything as severe as 
a major glacial period. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the paper concludes, ``it appears that climate has  
affected the timing of volcanism in eastern California.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the coldest periods, glaciers averaged more than 300  
yards thick over the Sierra Nevada, increasing to 1,500 yards in 
some deep canyons.

<HEADLINE> Newspaper Comment Disputed NHL Goal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Brett Hull's goal near the end of the third overtime Sunday  
morning gave Dallas a 2-1 victory over Buffalo to win the NHL 
finals series 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Bryan Lewis, the NHL's chief referee, Hull's goal  
counted because he didn't lose control of the puck as his skate 
entered the crease in front of Buffalo goalie Dominik Hasek. A 
player is not allowed to enter the crease without the puck. 
</P>
<P>
	Here is a sampling of comments on the disputed goal:  
</P>
<P>
	 *Kevin Paul Dupont, Boston Globe:* The fact that Hull's foot was  
in the crease, in truth, had no bearing on his winning shot going 
in the net. If there is any solace here for Sabres fans, it should 
be that. Up until the league fell in love with its replay gadgetry, 
no one ever looked twice at the kind of goal the Golden Brett 
scored. Hull also has blue eyes. In this case, the color of his 
eyes and the placement of his foot had the same influence on 
whether Hasek could stop the shot: none. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *Gare Joyce, Ottawa Citizen:* There's only one plausible  
scenario. The review officials realized too late that the goal 
couldn't stand. The truth was plain in (NHL director of officiating 
Bryan) Lewis's demeanor. It was plain in the glassy-eyed gaze of 
(referee Bill) McCreary as he stood at the scorer's bench. They 
looked like (Buffalo goalie Dominik) Hasek in many ways. They had 
come so far, come so close and, in the end, let one get away. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *Jerry Sullivan, The Buffalo News:* That's where the NHL stands  
credibilitywise right now -- even with pro wrestling. That's the 
only other sport where the referees turn their heads and pretend 
not to see. Of course wrestling is fake. The NHL is real. Isn't it? 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *Keith Gave, Dallas Morning News:* As you'd expect, the winning  
goal that video replays suggested might not have been entirely 
kosher wasn't much of a topic of discussion while a bunch of guys 
sprayed bubbly all over the room. That was someone else's headache. 
The Stars would have theirs the next day, unless some chose to 
stickhandle around their hangovers by just not going to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *Joe Lapointe, The New York Times:* This is not the first time  
the Cup has been won on a disputed goal by a road team in a Game 6 
overtime. In 1966, the Montreal Canadiens beat the Detroit Red 
Wings at Olympia Stadium on a goal by Henri Richard, who, the Wings 
charged, swept the puck into the net with his arm as he slid along 
the ice. Had this happened in 1999, the goal would have been 
reviewed on videotape and possibly negated. Back then, there was no 
video review. The goal stood and the Canadiens won. That game, 
theoretically, could still be in progress. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *Les Bowen, Philadelphia Daily News:* In Buffalo, a city with an  
inferiority complex the size of Lake Erie, this one goes up on the 
mantel right next to Scott Norwood missing the field goal wide 
right, only this is worse -- to Buffalonians, it's as if the Giants 
had been caught on tape roughing the kicker, and it wasn't called. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *Jack Todd, Montreal Gazette:* Hull did not interfere with  
Buffalo goaltender Dominik Hasek, so without the crease rule no one 
would have filed the meekest protest. But the rule does exist. This 
time, flying by the seat of its pants as usual, the NHL decided not 
to apply it. The solution? Deep six the crease rule now. Call 
goalie interference tightly when it applies. And apologize 
profusely to the Sabres and their fans. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *Don Cherry, former Boston Bruins coach, in his syndicated  
column:@ It is a sad thing that they call back a zillion goals for 
a toe in the crease, then let the most important goal of the year 
count with Brett Hull's foot in the crease. They say (and I feel 
for head of officiating Bryan Lewis having to take the heat) Hull 
had control of the puck. No way. ... It was an accident waiting to 
happen. It was just a matter of time till they got burnt. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *Al Strachan, Toronto Sun:* There should have been no  
controversy whatsoever. When Hull first kicked the rebound on to 
his stick, he had neither foot in the crease. At the instant he 
kicked the puck, he became in control of it. It was only in the 
follow-through of that kick that his left foot moved into the 
crease.

<P>
	 *Terry Jones, Edmonton Sun:* Five years ago it would have been a  
goal. Next year it'll be a goal again. But at 1:33 a.m. EDT 
(Sunday) morning it wasn't a goal. If this toe-in-the-crease, 
let's-go-upstairs, wait-a-couple-minutes-before-you-can-cheer 
idiocy had any chance of surviving for another season, the good 
news is that it went out the window at 54:51 into overtime on the 
NHL clock in Game 6 of the Stanley Cup final. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *John Kernaghan, Hamilton Spectator: Unfortunately, the  
104-minute marathon will not get its due in the history of the game 
because of an ill-conceived and ill-explained crease rule. If you 
can get past that, though, it was a crackling contest that 
developed from some heavy-hitting and stages of cautious play in 
the first two periods to a third regulation and three OT periods 
which produced a series of thunderclaps.

<HEADLINE> Surging Orioles Seek To Join Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Two weeks ago, the Baltimore Orioles were 15  
games under .500 and entrenched in last place. Manager Ray Miller 
was in danger of losing his job, the starting pitching was awful 
and the team led the league in runners left on base. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no reason to believe things would change by September,  
let alone by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	Even in victory, the Orioles had problems. Coming off a humbling  
doubleheader loss to Florida, Baltimore rebounded to beat the 
Marlins 4-2 on June 9. But in the ninth inning, Albert Belle and 
Miller engaged in an expletive-laced shouting match in the dugout 
after Belle jogged to first base on a grounder and was removed in a 
double switch. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Belle has gone 16-for-38 and the Orioles are on a  
10-1 roll that has lifted them out of the AL East cellar and in 
position to make an impact in the AL East. 
</P>
<P>
	The starters are 8-1 during the streak and the Orioles have been  
consistently clearing the bases behind a home run spree. Miller's 
biggest problem these days is figuring a way to get all his hot 
hitters into the game. 
</P>
<P>
	During a stretch in which they played 18 of 24 games on the  
road, the Orioles turned a 13-game deficit to just 8 1/2 and climbed 
within a game of third-place Toronto in the AL East. Their only 
loss since that doubleheader fiasco in Florida came against the 
Chicago White Sox on Thursday, and Baltimore followed that by 
hitting 10 homers in three straight wins. 
</P>
<P>
	Now things get interesting. The Orioles follow an off day Monday  
with a six-game homestand against the Boston Red Sox and New York 
Yankees, the top two teams in the division. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a ways to go yet, but we feel good about our club,''  
Miller said after the Orioles raised the team average to .284 with 
a 12-hit effort in Sunday's 8-4 win over the White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore's recent run was a long time coming. The Orioles came  
out of spring training with a $78.5 million payroll and high hopes 
of being a contender, but they've been struggling to reach .500 
since dropping two of three to Tampa Bay in the season-opening 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent surge is not unprecedented. Last year, Baltimore  
stumbled into the All-Star break with three straight losses to the 
Yankees and a 38-50 record. A nine-game winning streak followed and 
the Orioles eventually got 10 games over .500 before fading to a 
79-83 finish. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no telling if this streak will also be in vain. But if  
the Orioles continue to play as they have the past two weeks, 
anything is possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've gotten solid pitching. We've swung the bats very, very  
well,'' said B.J. Surhoff, whose career-high hitting streak stands 
at 21 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Even when the bats are silent, the Orioles have found a way to  
win. During the current streak, Baltimore has won by scores of 4-2, 
3-2 and 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Another sign that perhaps things really are turning around:  
Boston ace Pedro Martinez (13-2, 2.10 ERA) pitched Sunday against 
Texas and is not scheduled to will not throw in the series that 
concludes Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Against Yen, Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen Monday as Japan  
yet again intervened to prop up its currency and lower the risk of 
prematurely cutting short any nascent economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also rose against the euro as Italy's prime minister  
made unsettling remarks that traders thought damaging to the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a demand for dollars,'' said Ralph DelZenero, a  
foreign exchange marketing vice president at First National Bank of 
Chicago's hometown office. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar rose to 122.42 Japanese yen  
from 120.44 yen Friday. The euro was quoted at $1.0345, down from 
$1.0384. 
</P>
<P>
	As the yen strengthened Monday, the Bank of Japan intervened  
several times to buy dollars and sell yen, in a bid to weaken the 
Japanese currency. Traders estimated the bank spent $5 billion in 
its efforts in what is believed to be the fourth intervention in 10 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan has few options in fighting its worst recession since  
World War II. Recent economic reports indicate the picture is 
improving, but those gains largely come from government spending 
that creates jobs and allows workers to stimulate the economy by 
spending more. 
</P>
<P>
	Another way out is to export goods. But exporters can lose  
profits if they are less competitive because of a stronger 
currency. 
</P>
<P>
	``The BOJ is strong-arming the dollar,'' said Ken Landon, senior  
currency strategist at Deutsche Bank in Tokyo, but the impact is 
likely to be short term. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar-buying spread to euro/yen transactions, although the  
euro had larger concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	European Commission President-designate Romano Prodi was  
reported to say that Italy might have to leave the Economic and 
Monetary Union because of its economic problems. Already, the 
European Union has allowed Italy to default on its first-year 
obligation to lower the debt to GDP ratio. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market took it as an undermining of the euro,'' said  
DelZenero. When Prodi later tried to clear up his remarks, ``the 
market shrugged off the clarification,'' DelZenero said. 
</P>
<P>
	Against other currencies, the dollar was quoted at 1.5428 Swiss  
francs, up from 1.5383, and 1.4714 Canadian dollars, up from 
1.4645. The British pound rose to $1.5913 from $1.5997. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on the euro's exchange rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8907 
German marks, up from 1.8835; 6.3412 French francs, up from 6.3170; 
and 1,872.66 Italian lire, up from 1,864.67.

<HEADLINE> Bush To Meet With Senate Supporters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush makes his first trip  
to the Capitol on Tuesday as the front-runner for the Republican 
presidential nomination, and will meet privately with his 
supporters in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no public announcement of the meeting, but word was  
spread by personal letter from Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush ``will be joined by 20-plus senators who have endorsed his  
candidacy and who are hosting a meeting,'' Coverdell wrote in a 
letter sent to all GOP senators except rival White House contenders 
John McCain and Bob Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	``You would be more than welcome to attend if convenient to  
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's campaign web site lists the names of 14 senators who have  
endorsed him. He has the support of 121 Republican House members, 
more than half the GOP rank and file. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., gave the Texas governor a  
big political boost recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Interviewed on the CNN program ``Evans, Novak, Hunt &AMP; Shields,''  
Hastert said Bush had ``really done a phenomenal job'' of rallying 
support in the party. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether the Texas governor had just about wrapped up the  
nomination, Hastert replied, ``I think so. I think, from somebody 
who just observes politics for a long time, it looks like pretty 
much a done deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has the first Washington fund-raiser of his candidacy  
scheduled for Tuesday evening.

<HEADLINE> Ascent Reaches Agreement in Suits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Ascent Entertainment Group announced Monday it had  
reached an agreement to settle lawsuits filed by shareholders who 
challenged the sale of the Denver Nuggets, Colorado Avalanche and 
the new Pepsi Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Ascent spokesman Arthur Aaron denied the agreement canceled the  
$400 million deal with Bill Laurie, whose wife, Nancy, is heiress 
to the Wal-Mart fortune. The sale had been scheduled to close June 
30. 
</P>
<P>
	``We anticipate announcing a three-way agreement with the  
Lauries and the plaintiffs in the near future,'' Aaron said. ``This 
has been a three-way negotiation for the last couple of weeks, and 
the agreement in principal includes all three parties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Ascent's news release muddied the issue by saying ``the  
agreement in principle provides that Ascent will conduct a new open 
auction for these assets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron said the agreement canceled Thursday's scheduled hearing  
on the shareholder lawsuits in Wilmington, Del., where Ascent is 
incorporated. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders contend the sale price is as much as $150 million  
too low. They filed three separate lawsuits and claim Ascent did 
not follow an open-bidding process. They have also questioned 
Ascent chairman Charlie Lyons' role in the sale because of his 
plans to become a partner with the Lauries in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver financier Donald Sturm had reportedly bid $440 million  
for the teams. 
</P>
<P>
	In another lawsuit, Colorado businessman Bjorn Erik Borgen and  
ski resort magnate George Gillett claim they negotiated a deal to 
buy the Avalanche for $80 million from the Lauries. 
</P>
<P>
	Borgen, former owner of Denver-based Founders mutual funds, also  
claimed he was discouraged from bidding on both teams and the new 
$160 million Pepsi Center, scheduled to open in the fall.

<HEADLINE> Woman Throws Cash Before Suicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A woman plunged to her death from the 29th floor  
of a hotel after throwing jewelry and handfuls of cash out her 
window. 
</P>
<P>
	Police recovered $36,000, all in large denominations, from her  
room and the alley below the St. Moritz Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said the 56-year-old woman spent about 10 minutes on  
the ledge outside her window Sunday while police and hotel maids 
tried to persuade her to go back inside. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was on the ledge holding on to something, then she leaned  
back, lifted her arms like she surrendered, and she was gone,'' 
Chantal Mytych of West Palm Beach, Fla., told the New York Post. 
</P>
<P>
	Another witness, Carol DeRosa of New Jersey, told the Daily News  
that the woman stretched out her arms ``as if she were doing a 
stunt in a movie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 689-room hotel is on fashionable Central Park South, but the  
woman's window was on the side facing away from the park. 
</P>
<P>
	Police withheld the woman's identity. She was registered at the  
hotel under an assumed name.

<HEADLINE> Allan Houston's 3 Saves Knicks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- One second to go on the shot clock was plenty of  
time for Allan Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	With the New York Knicks going through one of their patented  
shooting droughts, Game 3 of the NBA Finals seemed ready to swing 
San Antonio's way on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	But what may have been the biggest three of Houston's 34 points  
started the Knicks on the way to an 89-81 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks had missed 12 straight shots, and were on their way  
to an unlucky 13 in the third quarter. This is a team that went 
1-for-19 during one distressing stretch of Game 2 so the 
possibilities were frightening. What once had been a 14-point lead 
was down to no lead at all with the Spurs tying the game at 58-58. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the shot clock was running down and New York was searching  
frantically for a shot, any shot. The Knicks nearly wound up with 
no shot at all. 
</P>
<P>
	The ball squirted loose and another New York possession seemed  
doomed. Then, somehow, Kurt Thomas got it into Houston's hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jeff Van Gundy had talked Monday about New York's  
inability to get the ball in the right place at the right time. 
With Houston hot, this was certainly where the Knicks needed it at 
that point. 
</P>
<P>
	With one slim second left to shoot, Houston lofted a 3-pointer  
from 24 feet that found nothing but net. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a hustle play,'' Houston said. ``Kurt had a series of  
hustle plays on offensive rebounds. That's the nature of the team. 
That's what happens when you keep digging in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That was big for them,'' San Antonio's Tim Duncan said. ``We  
played hard throughout the whole possession and Allan came up big 
for them. He played an awesome game tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tie game evaporated. Suddenly, with 3:05 left in the period,  
the Knicks were three points ahead again and this time they stayed 
in front. 
</P>
<P>
	``Allan has shown an ability to make critical shots for us down  
the stretch of games,'' Van Gundy said. ``That's a rare quality in 
this league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks scored just 16 points in the period and Houston had  
13 of them. The 34 points matched his career playoff-high and 
included a perfect 12-for-12 from the foul line. 
</P>
<P>
	None of his 10 baskets, though, was as vital as the 3-pointer  
that stopped the third quarter dry spell and got the Knicks moving 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's ironic,'' Houston said. ``When I first came in the  
league, all I did was shoot 3s. I've been able to get to the 
basket, but I'm still not passing up the 3. I missed two or three 
in the first half. That wide open one feels good to make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich was asked to describe Houston's  
night. ``He was a pain in the neck,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks guard liked that.  
</P>
<P>
	``I hope to be a pain in the neck all the time,'' he said.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Associated Press erroneously reported April 7  
that Baxter International Inc. plans to stop making intravenous 
bags from polyvinyl chloride because of concern the material is 
unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
	Baxter is developing alternatives to PVC and will substitute  
them if they prove to be superior, but has no plans to stop using 
PVC altogether, according to company spokeswoman Deborah Spak. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmental groups have raised concerns that a suspected  
carcinogen used in the manufacture of PVC could leach into fluids 
in IV bags. Baxter, however, believes PVC is safe, Spak said.

<HEADLINE> Natural Gas Falls on Less Demand  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Natural gas futures fell sharply Monday on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange as cooler weather across the eastern half of 
the country reduced demand from utilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Unleaded gasoline and crude futures also retreated. On other  
markets, coffee fell sharply, while cocoa rose. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas futures tumbled as temperatures in the Northeast and  
Southeast returned to normal or fell below-normal, during a period 
when temperatures usually are on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
	The moderating temperatures took the steam out of a rally that  
saw prices jump nearly 30 percent in the past three months on fears 
supplies in storage will not meet summer cooling demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas is used to power turbines for utilities, who see  
increased consumer demand for powering air conditioners and fans 
during the summer months. Some analysts also noted that supplies in 
storage appear to be ample for the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas prices also were pressured by the Commodity Futures  
Trading Commission's release late Friday of a report detailing 
investors' positions in the market. That report showed speculative 
positions made up a large share of recent futures purchases. Such a 
stake leaves market participants vulnerable to a sudden selloff. 
</P>
<P>
	The outlook for unleaded gasoline led to additional weakness in  
energy markets. Investors continue to fret about summer driving 
demand despite a recent sharp increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline inventories, however, have maintained a year-over-year  
surplus. Investors also speculated that cheap imports soon may come 
to market as sales in the United States continue to fetch greater 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas for July delivery fell 7.1 cents to $2.237 for each  
1,000 cubic feet; July crude fell 29 cents to $17.70 a barrel; July 
unleaded gasoline fell 1.12 cents to 51.18 cents a gallon; July 
heating oil fell .58 cent to 43.89 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent Blend crude oil for delivery in  
August fell 13 cents to $16.37 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee futures tumbled on the Board of Trade of the City of New  
York as the latest forecasts for weather in Brazilian growing areas 
showed no signs of crop-damaging frost. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee's fortunes in the past few weeks have been tied to the  
outlook for poor growing weather in Brazil, the world's largest 
producer. 
</P>
<P>
	A sustained frost could damage young trees and reduce  
production, but the early cold weather period has seen little 
chance of that occurring. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures prices have held support, however, as supplies of  
gourmet-style arabica coffee out of Colombia are being marketed at 
a slower-than-expected rate. 
</P>
<P>
	September arabica coffee fell 2.35 cents to $1.055 a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Cocoa futures jumped on the New York Board of Trade amid  
continued concern that Ivory Coast's deregulation of its cocoa 
marketing system could lead to supply disruptions later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivory Coast and Ghana are the two West African countries that  
produce a majority of the world's cocoa for use in making 
chocolate. The two are set to meet in July to consider cooperation 
pacts aimed at boosting prices, but skeptical market participants 
believe the two competitors will be unable to reach agreement and 
could enter a new marketing year with no formula for exports. That 
could lead to short-term supply disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivory Coast, which is the world's largest cocoa producer, also  
has been plagued by dry weather that have resulted in weak 
flowering in many major growing areas. While the cocoa tree is 
hardy enough to bounce back ahead of the new marketing year that 
begins Oct. 1, speculators are betting production will be 
curtailed. 
</P>
<P>
	September cocoa rose $34 to $1,157 a ton.

<HEADLINE> Government Expecting Big Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government recorded a budget  
deficit in May as receipts slowed from April's flood of last-minute 
tax filers. 
</P>
<P>
	The May budget deficit was $24 billion compared with a $113.5  
billion surplus in April, the Treasury Department said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the government is still running an overall surplus this  
year that is more than double what it was at this time last year -- 
the first year of budget surpluses since 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first eight months of fiscal 1999, which began Oct. 1,  
1998, the government surplus totaled $40.7 billion, compared with 
$16 billion for the same period in fiscal 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration is forecasting a surplus of $79.3  
billion for all of 1999, and congressional accountants are 
predicting $111 billion. The total 1998 surplus was $69 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, government spending of $122.6 billion was 19.7 percent  
below April's outlays of $152.7 billion, and 8.6 percent lower than 
the $134.1 billion spent in May 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said spending was lower in part because May 1 fell on a  
Saturday this year so that many government payments were instead 
made on Friday, April 30. 
</P>
<P>
	And since tax refund checks are paid only on Fridays, some  
checks that would have come out of May's receipts came out of 
April's instead. Refunds are counted by subtracting from government 
revenues, not adding to outlays. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, tax refunds of $112.7 billion so far this year are  
running 24.3 percent ahead of last year. That's in part because of 
a new $400 per child credit. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, government receipts dwindled by 63 percent last  
month, to $98.6 billion from the $226.1 billion collected during 
the April's tax filing rush.

<HEADLINE> $100M Seinfeld Suit Thrown Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A judge threw out a $100 million lawsuit filed  
by a man who claims Jerry Seinfeld and his TV producers stole his 
identity for the character of George Costanza. 
</P>
<P>
	State Supreme Court Justice Harold Tompkins said Michael  
Costanza's suit was frivolous. 
</P>
<P>
	Costanza, a real estate agent who lives on Long Island, said his  
rights were violated when the show used his ``name, likeness and 
persona'' to create the neurotic and nutty George for ``Seinfeld.'' 
</P>

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks pulled back today, but  
technology shares rallied for a fifth straight session, pushing the 
Nasdaq market back toward record terrain. The Dow Jones industrial 
average finished 39.58 lower at 10,815.98 after recovering from a 
nearly 100 point slide. The Dow, which rose 365 points last week, 
is about 200 points below the May 3 closing record of 11,014.69. 
Broader stock indicators were mostly positive. The 
technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index rose 2.6 percent, 
finishing about 21 points from its all-time best close of 2,652.05 
set on April 26. It was up 66.84 at 2,630.28. The Standard &AMP; Poor's

	U.S., Europeans Pledge Cooperation  
</P>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- President Clinton and European leaders  
pledged greater cooperation today to ensure that minor trade 
disputes between economic giants don't mushroom into full-blown 
conflicts. Officials said their new conflict resolution system 
could have helped defuse two simmering fights involving European 
bans on bananas sold by American companies and U.S. beef raised 
with growth hormones. U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky 
said the two disputes, in which the United States is threatening 
nearly $300 million in punitive tariffs on European products, were 
brought up during the talks between Clinton and European Union 
officials, but there were no breakthroughs.

	Commerce Sec. Wary of Steel Quotas  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. farmers and businesses that rely heavily  
on exports to other countries might suffer if the domestic steel 
industry obtains quotas on foreign steel, Commerce Secretary 
William Daley said today. The quotas could hurt U.S. steel 
companies as well if an international trade war erupts, cutting off 
U.S. exports from foreign markets, Daley said. He said a fifth of 
the steel used domestically goes into products later sent abroad.

	EU Seeks Larger Probe of Coca-Cola

<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Union today requested  
further investigations to find what caused dozens of people to 
become ill after drinking Coca-Cola products. The call for 
additional study came as its local distributors launched a European 
ad campaign defending their products as beyond reproach. Belgium 
banned all Coca-Cola soft drink products on June 14, and restored 
only some of its brands to store shelves on Thursday. France has 
stopped sales of all Coke cans produced at Dunkirk, although it is 
allowing sales of cans produced at the country's other Coke plant. 
Meanwhile, Ivory Coast seized nearly 50,000 cans of Coke imported 
from Europe as a precaution, trade officials said today. Coca-Cola 
was at 61 9/16, down 1 7/8.

	EU Still Split on Chocolate Purity

	LUXEMBOURG (AP) -- The European Union governments today failed to  
find an answer to a question that has divided them for years: How 
much vegetable fat -- other than cocoa butter -- can you put in 
chocolate and still call it chocolate? The EU interior ministers 
were close to an answer until Belgium rejected a compromise 
proposal, officials said. The EU's chocolate debate pits eight 
purist nations against seven that take a relaxed view of chocolate. 
Belgium, France, Italy, Spain, Luxembourg, Germany, Greece and the 
Netherlands ban cocoa-butter substitutes in chocolate. The others -- 
Britain, Ireland, Denmark, Portugal, Austria, Finland and Sweden -- 
don't.

	AOL Invests in Satellite TV Service  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- America Online Inc. will invest $1.5 billion  
in DirecTV creator Hughes Electronics Corp. in an agreement that 
deepens ties between the world's largest Internet provider and the 
leading U.S. satellite TV service. Company executives said the deal 
would help increase DirecTV's subscriber base while boosting the 
market for AOL's planned interactive TV and high-speed Internet 
services. Analysts consider access to cable -- with its wide reach 
into American households -- crucial to AOL's campaign to convert to 
high-speed Internet delivery. But cable companies have resisted 
calls for them to allow open access to Internet service providers. 
AOL shares were at 115 13/16, up 3 13/16.

microprocessors in set-top boxes enabling Internet access as well 
as its own satellite-driven DirecTV service. For the Santa Clara, 
Calif.-based Intel, the world's largest chip maker, it signals a

	Study: National Homeownership Soars  
</P>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- National homeownership soared in 1998  
and probably will continue increasing for the next decade, 
according to a new study. Low mortgage interest rates and low 
unemployment get the credit. The study released today by Harvard 
University's Joint Center for Housing Studies found that about 1.8 
million homes have been built each year since 1996, and that the 
national homeownership rate reached 66.3 percent last year. The 
report says more members of minority groups are buying homes but 
their homeownership rates still lag those of whites. Education is a 
factor, according to the report.

today. Janssen Pharmaceutica said the decision to stop selling 
Hismanal was a voluntary business decision, calling the allergy 
marketplace too crowded. The decision is not a recall -- Hismanal 
supplies left on store shelves will continue to sell until supplies

	$100M Seinfeld Suit Thrown Out

	NEW YORK (AP) -- A judge threw out a $100 million lawsuit filed  
by a man who claims Jerry Seinfeld and his TV producers stole his 
identity for the character of George Costanza. State Supreme Court 
Justice Harold Tompkins said Michael Costanza's suit was frivolous. 
Costanza, a real estate agent who lives on Long Island, said his 
rights were violated when the show used his ``name, likeness and 
persona'' to create the neurotic and nutty George for ``Seinfeld.'' 
Tompkins said he found the lawsuit baseless and assessed sanctions 
of $2,500 each against Costanza, 43, and his lawyer, Jonathan

<HEADLINE> Individuals Can Savor Stars' Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Ken Hitchcock kept saying his Dallas Stars didn't  
want this season to end because they were having so much fun 
chasing the Stanley Cup. Now that it's theirs, they probably won't 
mind taking time to savor what they've accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
	For Ed Belfour, Brett Hull and Mike Modano, winning the Cup  
means trading in their tainted reputation for a new identity: NHL 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
	For 39-year-old Guy Carbonneau, 38-year-old Craig Ludwig and  
36-year-old Brian Skrudland, former Cup winners who kept playing to 
relive the satisfaction, victory feels even better than they 
remembered. 
</P>
<P>
	And for grinders Derian Hatcher and Pat Verbeek, knowing their  
name will forever be engraved on their sport's most cherished 
trophy is affirmation that all the lumps and bruises were worth it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a special, magical group that will never be  
repeated,'' Hitchcock said early Sunday following a 2-1 
triple-overtime victory over the Buffalo Sabres that secured a 4-2 
series win. ``We may have more talented teams or more skilled 
teams, but we'll never be as tight as this group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars were the best regular-season team the past two years  
and, if they didn't win the Cup, critics would have said they 
peaked too soon. 
</P>
<P>
	But winning the Presidents' Trophy came in handy when Game 7 of  
the Western Conference finals between top-seeded Dallas and 
second-seeded Colorado was played at Reunion Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Sabres learned the Stars still had plenty of energy and  
passion left as they rallied from a loss in the opener, then won 
two straight games after being tied 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
	In their sixth season in Dallas, the franchise that began as the  
Minnesota North Stars ended a 32-year wait for the organization's 
first title, matching the longest in NHL history. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars also became the league's first champions from the Sun  
Belt -- a concept hockey fans never could have imagined when the 
'90s began. 
</P>
<P>
	A look at some of the people who made it possible and what it  
took to do it: 
</P>
<P>
	--Belfour had played more postseason games (107) without winning  
a championship than any goaltender in league history, which led to 
the knock he cracks under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Eagle'' soared this postseason, maintaining his cool  
during a 16-7 championship run that included two triple-overtime 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
	``I stayed focused and I stayed strong,'' said Belfour, who  
outplayed Patrick Roy in the Western finals and was at least the 
equal of Dominik Hasek in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The championship also saved Belfour's job, as Dallas will look  
to trade promising backup Roman Turek rather than expose him in the 
upcoming expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	--Joe Nieuwendyk's absence from the playoffs last year left  
Dallas a scorer away from challenging Detroit in the conference 
finals. Now the Stars really know what they were missing as he led 
the playoffs with 11 goals, including a record-tying six 
game-winners. 
</P>
<P>
	He was voted postseason MVP for the second time, a decade after  
leading Calgary to the Cup. The Flames traded him to Dallas because 
they thought he was too fragile; overcoming surgeries on both knees 
and enduring a grueling rehabilitation that sidelined him early 
this season proved he's not. 
</P>
<P>
	--Hull was brought in to be a postseason sharpshooter and he was,  
scoring the Cup-winning goal and knocking in the game-winner in 
Game 2. He did it all despite groin and knee injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	--Modano shed the pretty-boy image that's hung over him his  
entire career. No one played better the last two games and he did 
it despite a broken wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ludwig and Skrudland, teammates on the 1986 Cup-winning  
Montreal Canadiens, went 13 years between titles, the longest span 
in league history. 
</P>
<P>
	--Mike Keane, whose two goals in Game 7 of the conference finals  
ousted his former Colorado teammates, became the ninth player to 
win titles with three clubs. Next up for Keane is getting this Cup 
tattooed on his ankle next to ink images of the trophies he won 
with Colorado in 1996 and Montreal in '93. 
</P>
<P>
	Carbonneau, the league's oldest player this season, also won his  
third title. 
</P>
<P>
	--Benoit Hogue missed three weeks with two torn knee ligaments,  
then played the final two games. By delaying surgery, he risked 
further injury and guaranteed he won't be ready for the start of 
next season, which will make it tough for the free agent to find a 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	--General manager Bob Gainey, who won five Stanley Cups in his  
Hall of Fame playing career, put the team together in his own 
image. Third-year owner Tom Hicks opened his checkbook to let him 
do it. 
</P>
<P>
	--Hitchcock, a successful coach in midgets and juniors for 16  
years who didn't get a shot at the NHL until slimming down from 478 
pounds, pushed, pulled and laid off his players at all the right 
times to get the most out of the second-oldest team (30.6 years) to 
win an NHL title. Toronto in 1967 averaged 31.4. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you see the absolute joy and the raw emotions of the  
players, it's unbelievable,'' Hitchcock said. ``You appreciate what 
it takes to get here.''

<HEADLINE> Evacuation Escalates to Near Riot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONROE, Va. (AP) -- Angry at being cooped up in stuffy buses  
after their job training center had been evacuated for a bomb 
threat, students clashed with police equipped with riot gear. 
</P>
<P>
	Students spat on officers and threw cigarette lighters and  
balled-up T-shirts at them during the confrontation Sunday at the 
Old Dominion Job Corps Center. No one was injured, police and 
school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 40 police officers squared off against the students, and  
prepared to use a high-pressure water hose in case the students 
charged, said Amherst County Sheriff L.T. Ayers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a mess there for about an hour or so,'' Ayers  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The residential training center was evacuated after authorities  
received two bomb threats telephoned from inside the campus. No 
bomb was found and no arrest had been made as of today, center 
administrator Bob Barlow said. 
</P>
<P>
	Students were told to sit in stuffy buses and vans for nearly  
two hours because it was raining and police had to wait for 
bomb-sniffing dogs to arrive, Barlow said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were sitting there for about two hours without bathrooms  
and proper ventilation,'' Barlow said. 
</P>
<P>
	The confrontation began after a 17-year-old became disruptive,  
and was dragged off a bus by deputies who sprayed him with pepper 
spray. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17-year-old was charged with obstruction of justice and  
assault on a police officer, Ayers said. The young man was being 
held in a juvenile detention center today and was not identified. 
</P>
<P>
	About 300 students from across Virginia and a few other states  
attend the center, operated by the U.S. Department of Labor.

<HEADLINE> Avalanch's Forsberg To Have Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Colorado Avalanche center Peter Forsberg will  
undergo surgery next week to repair an unstable left shoulder and 
is expected to be sidelined for four to six months. 
</P>
<P>
	``We anticipate nothing less than a complete recovery,'' said  
Avalanche trainer Pat Karns. 
</P>
<P>
	Forsberg aggravated the shoulder problems when he was hit by  
Dallas Stars defenseman Richard Matvichuk during the playoffs. 
Avalanche coaches complained about the hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Forsberg led the Avalanche in points (97) and assists (67) and  
also was their leading scorer during the playoffs. His 24 playoff 
points led the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``Peter was examined by our medical staff at the end of the  
season, and after undergoing additional tests in Denver, sought a 
second opinion back in Sweden,'' Karns said. ``A few days ago, the 
same diagnosis was reached by the Swedish doctors, and the decision 
to move ahead with surgery was taken,'' Karns said. 
</P>
<P>
	Team orthopedist Dr. Andy Parker will perform the surgery.

	Clinton Praises Slovenia  
</P>
<P>
	LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) -- President Clinton became the first  
U.S. president to visit Slovenia today and congratulated the former 
Yugoslav republic for breaking away from Slobodan Milosevic. 
Clinton and Slovenian President Milan Kucan shared two grinning 
handshakes as Clinton praised Slovenia for its economic revival and 
stability. Slovenia won independence in 1991 and now wants to join 
NATO. Clinton will also meet Milo Djukanovic, the president of 
Montenegro, the smaller of the two remaining Yugoslav republics. 
The pro-Western Djukanovic has opposed Milosevic's policies.

	Clinton: No Yugoslav Economic Aid  
</P>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- ``Not a penny'' of U.S. money will be used  
to help rebuild parts of Yugoslavia, President Clinton pledged 
today, especially with Slobodan Milosevic still in power. Clinton 
said rebuilding Yugoslavia's infrastructure would constitute 
economic assistance that he didn't feel comfortable extending while 
Milosevic is still president. Clinton did say the United States 
would help with humanitarian aid, such as repairing hospitals and 
power plants to restore electricity to the Serb population.

	Court To Rule on TV Sex Channels  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to decide  
whether a federal law intended to shield children from sex-oriented 
cable TV networks violates the free-speech rights of channels such 
as Playboy Television. The justices said they will review a Clinton 
administration appeal aimed at reviving the law, which a federal 
judge in Delaware struck down. The judge said the law swept too 
broadly in trying to keep children from seeing adult programming on 
networks only partly scrambled for non-subscribers. The law 
required cable operators that don't fully scramble or block 
sex-oriented networks for non-subscribers to show those channels' 
``indecent'' programs only between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Doctors frustrated with the managed care system  
will discuss forming a physicians' union today at the American 
Medical Association convention. One doctor said his colleagues are 
angry that third parties have intruded into their day-to-day 
practice. The five-day convention includes 494 delegates 
representing about one-third of U.S. physicians. AMA board 
president Dr. Randolph D. Smoak Jr. said that the union might be a 
non-traditional one, without permitting strikes.

	China Working on Cloning Panda

<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Scientists have taken a step toward cloning a  
giant panda by growing an embryo that contains a dead animal's 
genes -- a development China hailed as a possible breakthrough in 
efforts to save the endangered species. Only about 1,000 pandas 
live in the wild, with another 100 in zoos. Experts have warned 
that the animal could become extinct in a couple of dozen years. 
Scientists grew the embryo by introducing cells from a dead female 
panda into the egg cells of a Japanese white rabbit.

	Study: National Homeownership Soars  
</P>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- A new study shows that national  
homeownership soared last year and will continue to rise, thanks to 
the lowest mortgage interest and unemployment rates since the 
1960s. Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies found 
that about 1.8 million homes have been built each year since 1996, 
and that the national homeownership rate reached 66.3 percent last 
year. Most of the growth has occurred outside of cities and in the 
South and the West. Although more minorities are buying homes 
because of low interest rates and specially tailored mortgage loan 
programs, the gap between white and nonwhite home ownership widened 
from 1994 to 1998, the study found.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sets Goal for Wind Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson on  
Monday promised continued economic support for wind energy research 
and development and support for tax incentives in announcing a plan 
to increase the country's capacity to get power from wind. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson committed the government to have wind power produce 5  
percent of the nation's electrical needs by 2020. Currently, about 
one-tenth of one percent of the nation's electric needs are 
provided by the wind. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want tomorrow's generators to produce power at half the  
cost of today's machines,'' Richardson said at a wind energy 
conference. ``That is no small challenge, but this administration 
is committed to making that goal a reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1980 wind energy cost about 40 cents per kilowatt hour. Now  
it's about a nickel. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the so-called Wind Powering America initiative,  
Richardson announced $1.2 million in grants to wind turbine testing 
projects in 10 states. One of those projects will be in Maine. He 
did not say where the other nine would be. 
</P>
<P>
	The money will be used to provide support for the design and  
installation of new small wind turbines for field testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson's message was welcome news to wind power advocates  
from across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been wandering in the wilderness since the Carter  
administration,'' said Tom Gray, the deputy executive director of 
American Wind Energy Association, which sponsored the four-day 
conference.

<HEADLINE> Flamboyant Fashion Exec Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATAVIA, N.Y. (AP) -- Fashion executive John Badum lived in New  
York's East Village, filling his fast-paced world with stylish 
friends and exuberant, over-the-top gestures. He loved costume 
parties, a good loud laugh, anything flamboyant. 
</P>
<P>
	If Badum's life was musical theater, his death was pure opera:  
He was killed with a meat cleaver by his former boyfriend, who then 
threw himself to his death in front of a minivan. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said it was a green card dispute that led Badum, 46, from  
New York's fashion world to his sister's apartment in Batavia, 
where the May 30 attack occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Badum's sister, Theresa Badum, 40, had married Hamid Ouhda, a  
23-year-old Moroccan, earlier this year at her brother's request in 
hopes that Ouhda could get a green card to stay in the United 
States, police said. But the relationship between Badum and Ouhda 
soon soured, and the Badums sought to dissolve the marriage and 
deport Ouhda. 
</P>
<P>
	Ouhda found out and apparently flew into a murderous rage.  
</P>
<P>
	Ouhda climbed to Ms. Badum's second-floor balcony, slammed a  
brick through a sliding glass door and went to the kitchen, where 
he found a cleaver and knife, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Badums locked themselves in a bedroom. But Ouhda broke the  
door and lunged inside. Ms. Badum, after fending off blows, fled 
through a fire escape. Ouhda stabbed Badum at least a half a dozen 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	With his dying breaths, Badum identified Ouhda as his attacker.  
</P>
<P>
	An hour after the attack, Ouhda died after apparently walking in  
front of a minivan on a country road. The driver told police it was 
as if Ouhda was attacking the van. 
</P>
<P>
	At a memorial for Badum last week, friends gathered at an  
elegant New York City hotel amid champagne, chandeliers and 
chocolate to read poems and share songs. 
</P>
<P>
	Barneys New York creative director Simon Doonan remembered his  
friend as ``a combination of Albert Einstein, Louis IX, Phyllis 
Diller, Mama Cass and Liberace,'' and said Badum maintained a salon 
where he gathered artists, aristocrats and rock stars together. His 
circle of friends included designers Todd Oldham and Thierry 
Mugler. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavyset with flowing black hair, Badum also ``had a bit of the  
old hippie about him,'' Doonan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mugler described how Badum would act out roles and bring him to  
a belly laugh. ``He was so incredibly brilliant,'' Mugler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends also recalled particular eccentricities: his fondness  
for hand-held fans and ``pinkie-popping,'' or flipping his pinkie 
straight into the air. And also his generosity, which ranged from 
opening his home to newcomers getting settled in town, to passing 
out money, vitamins and sneakers to Jamaican children during trips 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	``He combined an incredible joie de vivre with a genuine  
philanthropic streak,'' Doonan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years after Badum's arrival as national sales manager at  
L'Zinger, the Go Silk label was launched. At its height, L'Zinger 
generated $30 million in sales on the popularity of the oversized 
silk shirt. 
</P>
<P>
	He resigned from the company in 1995 and spent the last few  
years traveling around the world, only recently returning to New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	Weeks before his death, Badum and his sister feared trouble from  
Ouhda. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Badum contacted a lawyer to discuss divorce proceedings and  
Ouhda's status with the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The 
lawyer advised Ms. Badum to seek an order of protection. 
</P>
<P>
	She filed for the order May 27, three days before the attack.

<HEADLINE> 'Tarzan,' 'Austin' Rule Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Two swingers -- one human, one cartoon --  
dominated the weekend box office as ``Tarzan'' opened at No. 1 with 
$34.1 million and the Austin Powers sequel scored $31.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The military thriller ``The General's Daughter'' with John  
Travolta was third with a better-than-expected $22.3 million, while 
``The Phantom Menace'' had $17.8 million for fourth, crossing the 
$300 million mark and overtaking ``The Lion King'' as the No. 6 
movie of all time. 
</P>
<P>
	Studio executives were impressed with the weekend numbers. They  
said it was the first time they could recall that three movies 
grossed more than $20 million on the same weekend. Receipts for the 
top films totaled $123 million, up 21 percent from the same weekend 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This says that when people make good movies, no matter how  
many, there's room in the marketplace,'' said Disney distribution 
head Chuck Viane. ``The marketplace will expand to meet as much 
demand as it needs to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The box office was led by the animated ``Tarzan,'' featuring the  
voices of Minnie Driver, Rosie O'Donnell and Tony Goldwyn, and 
songs by Phil Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	It was best opening weekend for a Disney animated film since  
``The Lion King,'' which debuted with $41 million in June 1994 on 
its way to a domestic gross of $313 million. 
</P>
<P>
	If the weekend estimates that were released Sunday hold up,  
``Tarzan's'' debut also will have topped that of ``A Bug's Life,'' 
with $33.3 million last November. 
</P>
<P>
	Close behind was ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,''  
returning Mike Myers as both the international man of mystery and 
Austin's bumbling nemesis Dr. Evil. 
</P>
<P>
	``Austin 2'' dropped a steep 42 percent in the second week but  
still collected an impressive take of nearly $32 million to bring 
its total to $116.7 million. It crossed the $100 million mark on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Proving the star power of Travolta, ``The General's Daughter'' --  
which had appeared doomed to be lost in the hype over ``Tarzan,'' 
``Austin Powers'' and ``The Phantom Menace'' -- delivered a strong 
opening weekend, the best for a Travolta film since ``Face/Off'' in 
June 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``Star Wars: Episode 1 -- The Phantom Menace'' remained strong,  
losing just 31 percent of its business in the fifth week, to bring 
its total to $327 million for sixth on the all-time list. 
</P>
<P>
	In the next few weeks, it will easily pass No. 5 ``Forrest  
Gump'' ($330 million) and No. 4 ``Jurassic Park'' ($357 million) as 
it seeks to challenge the original ``Star Wars'' ($461 million) for 
second all-time behind ``Titanic'' ($600 million). 
</P>
<P>
	Also at the box office, the romance ``Notting Hill'' with Julia  
Roberts finished fifth with $7 million, but ``Instinct,'' Disney's 
other man-lives-with-gorillas movie, proved to be a disappointment, 
plunging 55 percent in its third week. The Anthony Hopkins-starring 
film finished sixth with $3.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Mummy'' was seventh with $3 million, ``The Matrix'' eighth  
with $1.3 million, ``Entrapment'' ninth with $1.2 million and ``Tea 
With Mussolini'' 10th with $635,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Sunday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final figures 
are to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Tarzan,'' $34.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' $31.9 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``The General's Daughter,'' $22.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace,'' $17.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``Notting Hill,'' $7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``Instinct,'' $3.1 million  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``The Mummy,'' $3 million.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Exxon-Valdez Capt. Serving Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Nine years after his conviction for  
illegally spilling oil in pristine Alaska waters, Capt. Joseph 
Hazelwood started his punishment Monday on the litter patrol. 
</P>
<P>
	Hazelwood, former skipper of the tanker Exxon Valdez, spent the  
day loading up a truck with abandoned auto parts and assorted junk 
thrown along the roadsides of Anchorage. He worked with one other 
man and a supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
	The work was the beginning of his month in Alaska doing litter  
patrol and other cleanup tasks as punishment for his 1990 state 
conviction for his part in the nation's largest oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll be doing different things each day,'' said Fred  
Fulgencio, who heads Anchorage's community work service program. 
``Tomorrow he could be cleaning parks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This will be the first of five summers Hazelwood will spend  
laboring in Alaska. His sentence calls for 1,000 hours of community 
work, broken out as 200 hours each year. 
</P>
<P>
	An Anchorage jury found Hazelwood guilty of negligently  
discharging oil in the waters of Prince William Sound in March 
1989, when the Exxon Valdez drove up onto a charted reef. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 11 million gallons of oil spilled into the sound,  
coating 1,000 miles of shoreline and killing tens of thousands of 
birds and marine mammals. 
</P>
<P>
	Hazelwood was acquitted of several misdemeanors, including  
operating a tanker while intoxicated, and one felony count of 
second-degree criminal mischief, but found him guilty of spilling 
oil. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge who sentenced Hazelwood said his community service  
should include scrubbing rocks oiled by the Exxon Valdez, but beach 
cleanup efforts wrapped up years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentence had remained on hold during more than eight years  
of appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	Hazelwood showed up early Monday morning at the Anchorage work  
service office, but he didn't return to the office with the other 
workers in the afternoon. He instead caught a ride with his lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	The elusive Hazelwood, who lives in New York, was unavailable  
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Fulgencio said he spoke to Hazelwood before work started, and  
his demeanor was nothing memorable. 
</P>
<P>
	``Normal -- just like the others,'' he said. ``He just wants to  
come in and get it over with.''

<HEADLINE> Germany Cuts Budget To Help Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- Germany unveiled its most drastic postwar  
spending cuts today in an effort to make Europe's biggest economy 
more competitive and boost the euro currency. The proposed budget 
reform would cut corporate taxes next year by $4.2 billion and cut 
government spending by 1.5 percent, according to a Finance Ministry 
document. The plan's broader goal is a balanced budget sometime 
between 2002 and 2006. 
</P>
<P>
	If adopted, the reform ``will give an important signal for the  
stability of the euro,'' the document said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said with the $15.9 billion in proposed spending  
cuts next year, it had sealed ``largest savings package in postwar 
German history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Cabinet is expected to approve  
the plan before the end of June, then submit it to parliament.

<HEADLINE> Arrest in Playground Chemical Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Eleven children and an adult suffered burns  
to their faces, hands and legs after a man allegedly spread a 
skin-dissolving chemical on a playground merry-go-round. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested Delin Swanigan, 51, who witnesses said was at  
Watkins Park playground Saturday with a jar containing a bluish 
substance. He was charged with 12 counts of battery Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was sitting at the picnic table near the playground  
equipment. He was acting strangely, chanting,'' police Sgt. Paul 
Ciesielski told The Indianapolis Star. 
</P>
<P>
	Detectives were seeking a motive.  
</P>
<P>
	State health officials planned to test the jelly-like chemical  
to determine what it was. Ciesielski likened it to ``a drain 
cleaner or some acidic type of solvent or paint remover.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All 12 victims were sent to Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis  
with irritated skin on their faces, hands, and legs. At first, it 
appeared as though they'd been stung by bees, said Moshia Scott, 
whose 3-year-old son was one of the children burned. 
</P>
<P>
	``My sister was watching them, and they started screaming and  
jumping off the merry-go-round,'' Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott's 5-year-old niece, Aynna Granderson, underwent surgery at  
Methodist to treat the burns. She was released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	No surgery was required for the other victims, who were treated  
at the hospital and released.

<HEADLINE> Lemieux Will Take Less Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Mario Lemieux's revised plan for rescuing the  
Pittsburgh Penguins calls for ousting both Civic Arena landlord SMG 
and broadcaster Fox Sports Net Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux filed his plan with bankruptcy court on Monday and  
representatives of SMG and Fox met with Lemieux's lawyers 
throughout the day. Lemieux's plan was scheduled to be confirmed in 
bankruptcy court Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The talks are accelerated and intense, because of the  
deadline,'' Fox spokesman Larry Eldridge said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the revised plan, the NHL Hall of Famer said he would pay  
himself substantially less than he originally proposed and give up 
his right to sue former Penguins co-owner Roger Marino for past 
wages. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the revisions, other creditors of the team also would  
abandon their claims against Marino. In return, Marino will make a 
$500,000 payment to the team's unsecured creditors and pay off a 
loan the team took from the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's new plan calls for converting $20 million of his $32.5  
million in debt into an ownership stake in the team. He will get a 
$5 million payment and forgive the other $7.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The old plan called for him to be repaid the entire amount over  
10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux also said he would have $50 million in new money to  
operate the team and satisfy some debts if his plan is approved. 
The Penguins have been operating with court protection from 
creditors since last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Lemieux's plan, the NHL has filed a plan to sell the  
team and move it from Pittsburgh or dissolve the franchise and 
auction off its players. SMG and Fox also have submitted a 
reorganization plan that would make Lemieux a minority owner and 
consultant. Lemieux has rejected that offer. 
</P>
<P>
	SMG lost its control over the Penguins' agreement at the Civic  
Arena when U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz invalidated the 
deal earlier this month. On Friday, he ruled that it was a loan, 
not a lease as SMG had argued. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's new plan calls on Markovitz to determine how much is  
owed on the $24 million loan SMG made to help former Penguins owner 
Howard Baldwin buy the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's plan also calls on SMG to repay with interest any  
amount the judge determines the Penguins may have overpaid in 
satisfying the loan. 
</P>
<P>
	As far as Fox's broadcast rights are concerned, the revised plan  
calls for a newly reorganized Penguins franchise to make a deal 
with a broadcaster without identifying the media outlet. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirby Campbell, chief executive of the Kittanning-based  
Armstrong Group of Companies, which includes a cable company, has 
said he is talking with Lemieux about joining the former center's 
investment team. Campbell did not return calls for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox spokesman Eldridge said that his company remained interested  
in broadcasting Penguins games. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's revised plan also calls for his investment team to  
retain rights to the American Hockey League franchise in the 
Scranton Wilkes-Barre area.

<HEADLINE> Police Can Search Cars for Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Police generally do not need a warrant to  
search a car they have reason to believe is carrying illegal drugs, 
the Supreme Court said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The court ruled in a Maryland case that a search warrant is not  
required even if police had plenty of time to get one after 
receiving a tip that a car would be carrying drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The court reinstated Kevin Darnell Dyson's conviction of  
conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute. 
</P>
<P>
	Dyson was arrested early in the morning of July 3, 1996, in St.  
Mary's County. At 11 a.m. on the previous day, police received an 
informant's tip that Dyson would return to the county that night in 
a rental car after going to New York City to buy cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	The informant gave a description and license number of the  
rental car, and police confirmed with the rental company that the 
car had been rented to Dyson. 
</P>
<P>
	Police stopped Dyson and searched his car at about 1 a.m.,  
finding 23 grams of crack cocaine in a bag in the trunk. Dyson was 
convicted after a trial judge ruled the police could search his car 
without a warrant once they had reason to believe it contained 
evidence of a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	A mid-level Maryland appeals court reversed, saying the search  
was unlawful because police would have had time to get a warrant. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the Supreme Court ruled in an unsigned opinion that the  
police did not need a warrant. 
</P>
<P>
	The Constitution's Fourth Amendment generally requires police to  
get a warrant before conducting a search, but the court established 
an exception in 1925 for automobile searches. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices noted they ruled in 1982 and 1996 that once police  
have reason to believe a car contains contraband, they can search 
it without having to show some emergency existed. 
</P>
<P>
	All nine justices agreed the police did not need a warrant in  
Dyson's case. But Justice Stephen G. Breyer dissented from the 
result, saying the court should not reverse the lower court without 
hearing arguments in a case where the defendant's lawyer did not 
file a response to prosecutors' appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Maryland vs. Dyson, 98-1062.

<HEADLINE> Sprewell May Play Point Guard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Desperation. It is a word that aptly describes  
the New York Knicks' predicament in the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	So here comes a new plot twist, just in time for Game 3 tonight  
between the Knicks and San Antonio Spurs. Expect some new lineups 
from the Knicks, who are open to suggestions on how to slow down 
the sweepmobile currently being driven down Broadway by co-pilots 
Tim Duncan and David Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	While Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy hedged on his lineup  
intentions, Latrell Sprewell publicly lobbied for a change Sunday 
that would move him to point guard with Allan Houston at shooting 
guard. Van Gundy called Sprewell's suggestion a ``viable option, 
but we won't start that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs lead New York 2-0 in the best-of-7 series, which is in  
need of rescuing on several fronts -- quality of play, television 
ratings and possibly, duration. If the Spurs keep playing their 
calm, effective style and the Knicks' changes don't make any 
difference, the broom-waving fans in San Antonio won't get to watch 
another game in the Alamodome. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams are tentatively scheduled to play three games at  
Madison Square Garden this week. The Spurs only need to win two. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to put serious pressure on them by winning the third  
game and kind of put the series out of reach,'' said Tim Duncan, 
averaging 29.0 points, 15.5 rebounds and three blocks in the first 
two games. ``But to stay alive, for them, that's the game they need 
right there. Going down 3-0 would be a tough thing, next to 
impossible, to come back from.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, no team in NBA history has ever come back from a 3-0  
deficit in any round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody out in San Antonio thinks it's won already,'' the  
Spurs' Sean Elliott said. ``Guys in here know we still have a lot 
of work to do. The series probably isn't even started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That is what NBC and the league must be hoping, but alas, it's  
not true. Ratings for Game 1 were down 36 percent from last year's 
Bulls-Jazz opener, and overnight ratings for Game 2 were even 
worse. Spurs guard Mario Elie said the quality of play might be one 
reason fans are reaching for the remote control. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been nasty,'' Elie said.  
</P>
<P>
	More so for the Knicks than for the Spurs. New York averaged 72  
points in the two losses and is still searching for a way to 
replace Patrick Ewing's offense. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks' point guards, Charlie Ward and Chris Childs, are  
averaging 9.0 points and 5.0 assists. Childs is 3-for-16. Larry 
Johnson, hindered by a sprained knee, is shooting 20 percent from 
the field, and Marcus Camby has been hindered because of foul 
trouble after playing a pivotal role in the Knicks' victory over 
the Indiana Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus, Van Gundy was bombarded by questions about his lineup on  
Sunday. One possibility is sending Ward to the bench and playing 
Sprewell at the point with Houston at shooting guard. The Knicks 
used such a lineup in Game 2 against the Pacers when Ward and 
Childs were in foul trouble. Sprewell said the team has run plays 
in practice with him playing point guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``It worked then, who's to say if it'll work now,'' Sprewell  
said. ``We don't know, but at least it's worth a try, I think, at 
some point during the game. ... Maybe that's something that can 
create a mismatch that favors us. 
</P>
<P>
	``If something's working, then I think you need to work it until  
they find a way to stop it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It would mean the hobbled Johnson would have to guard the  
quicker Elliott. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the opportunity arises, I'll try to take him to the basket,  
absolutely,'' Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said using a full-court press to  
exploit Sprewell's shaky ballhandling skills wouldn't be an option. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't remember the last time we pressed,'' Popovich said.  
``I don't think we've ever pressed, ever. Not once.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy said he doesn't necessarily favor changing the  
starters, but he doesn't rule out going to the big guard lineup at 
some point during the game. A more likely change is Kurt Thomas or 
Camby for Chris Dudley, who is so bothered by a hyperextended elbow 
that he was practicing free throws left-handed on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you make all the changes that everybody wants -- start  
Marcus, Kurt, Larry, Allan and Latrell -- your bench now has two 
point guards and an unhealthy Chris Dudley,'' Van Gundy said. 
</P>
<P>
	No tinkering should be expected from Popovich, whose team is on  
an NBA-record 12-game postseason winning streak -- including 6-0 on 
the road. San Antonio hasn't lost since Game 2 of the first round 
against Minnesota on May 11. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a focused group,'' Elie said. ``We know what's at stake,  
we know what we have to do. We're the `Road Warriors.' We went to 
Minnesota and won two, to Portland won two, to the Lakers and won 
two. We don't feel any different coming into the Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can get Game 3, we might as well finish them off.''

<HEADLINE> NBA Commissioner Goes on Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- David Stern defiantly defended his low-rated  
finals and lockout-tainted season, even while announcing that a 
panel will recommend changes to improve the quality of NBA games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was nice to have a season,'' the commissioner said Monday  
at his annual NBA Finals news conference. ``We think the fans 
appreciated both the settlement of the collective bargaining 
negotiations and the fact that teams like San Antonio -- the 
league's smallest market -- have an opportunity to continue to 
compete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stern faced a stream of questions about the league's troubles --  
the huge drop in television ratings for the finals, the trend 
toward stagnant offenses and low-scoring games, players entering 
the league at a younger age and the fallout from the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	The news conference was held several hours before the start of  
Game 3 of the finals between the New York Knicks and San Antonio 
Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, there is an absence of the world's most famous  
person, no less that world's most famous athlete, Michael Jordan,'' 
Stern said. ``But I think we're seeing the creation in front of our 
eyes of the kinds of teams ... that are going to get known. So the 
state of the league is one that finds us very optimistic about the 
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 16-member committee, composed of coaches, former players,  
team executives and owners, will meet Tuesday to discuss rules 
changes for next season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 season was marked by a significant drop in scoring,  
with only one team, the Sacramento Kings, averaging 100 points a 
game. This continued a decadelong trend toward a lower-scoring 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	One questioner, a journalist from Spain, pointed to San  
Antonio's unappealing 80-67 victory in Game 2 and wondered whether 
his countrymen should have bothered to wake up at 3 a.m. to watch 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the basis of one game and relatively low shooting  
percentages, I wouldn't think that game as you know it has come to 
an end,'' Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's true, (Game 2) was not the prettiest game that we've ever  
had in the NBA finals, and it does continue a trend of very 
aggressive defense. It's an issue that obviously is a concern to 
us,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The special committee is made up of coaches Lenny Wilkens, Rudy  
Tomjanovich, Rick Pitino, Pat Riley and Mike Krzyzewski, players 
Antonio Davis of Indiana and Steve Smith of Atlanta, broadcasters 
Isiah Thomas, Hubie Brown and Doug Collins, executives Kevin 
McHale, Donnie Walsh, Billy King and Dan Issel and owners Jerry 
Colangelo (Suns) and Gordon Gund (Cavaliers). 
</P>
<P>
	The committee will focus on four areas:  
</P>
<P>
	--officiating: how games are called and whether NBA basketball  
has gotten too physical. 
</P>
<P>
	--the lane: creating more open space near the basket.  
</P>
<P>
	--clock rules: having 24 seconds to shoot and 10 seconds to bring  
the ball past midcourt. 
</P>
<P>
	--defense: whether to allow zone defenses.  
</P>
<P>
	``The general consensus is that we need to do some correcting  
here,'' deputy commissioner Russ Granik said. ``Our goal is to try 
to implement whatever recommendations they come up with by the 
start of next season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Game 2 of the finals drew a 9.6 rating, making it the  
lowest-rated game since Game 5 of the Knicks-Rockets series in 
1994. That game drew an 8.0 rating, with many viewers watching the 
famous O.J. Simpson chase. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's Game 2 between Chicago and Utah drew a 17.7 rating,  
which means the audience shrank 42 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not alarming to me,'' Stern said, pointing to the  
possible end of the Jordan era and the end of the Chicago Bulls' 
dynasty as factors that drew extra viewers last season. ``We 
expected a huge, huge dropoff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stern also said he would like to establish a minimum age for NBA  
players, perhaps 20. Any such limit would have to be agreed upon by 
the players' union, as stipulated in the new labor agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no timetable for holding discussions on the age-limit  
issue, and both sides are awaiting word from the NCAA on whether it 
would be feasible to give low-interest loans to likely first-round 
draft picks who would be forced to stay in college if a limit was 
adopted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got an open mind on the subject,'' union director Billy  
Hunter said. ``It's obviously something we have to look at, along 
with the various ramifications and consequences it would produce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for the lockout, Stern said he did not regret losing the  
first three months of the season while the owners and players 
fought over the terms of an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We like to see players stay with their teams while at the same  
time having the right to change teams,'' he said. ``That's what we 
think we've achieved here, and that will cause teams to make better 
investments and more investments and make this a very, very 
competitive league. 
</P>
<P>
	``And basically, as a business, that's what we sell. We try to  
create competition so that fans in the various cities, when the 
season begins, will feel that their team has a chance to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would very much do it again.''

<HEADLINE> EU Seeks Further Probe of Coca Cola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- As Coca-Cola executives lobbied to get  
their products back on Europe's store shelves, the European Union 
pushed for further investigations into what caused dozens of people 
to become ill after drinking the company's soft drinks. 
</P>
<P>
	The call Monday for additional study came as the health scare  
spilled into Africa and as Coca-Cola and its local distributors 
launched a European advertising campaign defending the quality of 
their products as beyond reproach. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola Co.'s chairman, M. Douglas Ivester, returned to  
Brussels on Monday with the company's marketing chief, Charles 
Frenette, for meetings with Belgian government officials in an 
attempt to speed up the resumption of sales of Coke, Sprite and 
Fanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgium banned all Coca-Cola products on June 14, and only  
restored some of its brands to store shelves on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta-based Coca-Cola has blamed defective carbon dioxide,  
used to put fizz in its drinks, for problems at its Antwerp 
manufacturing plant in Belgium, while the company said that the 
outside of cans made in Dunkirk, France, were contaminated with a 
wood preservative during shipping. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said these two unrelated problems have led to  
similar symptoms of nausea and vomiting. One company-commissioned 
study suggested the health problems were in the victims' heads. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, the first children with Coke complaints were  
hospitalized in Belgium. Since then, some 200 people have been 
treated for nausea, vomiting and hyperventilation after drinking 
Coca-Cola products. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is still nothing clear about the cause of the  
contamination,'' said Belgian Health Ministry spokesman Marc 
Pattyn. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the lingering uncertainty, the EU's executive body,  
the European Commission, called for additional investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Belgium and France will have joint inspections on Coca-Cola  
plants in the next few days,'' said Pietro Petrucci, a spokesman 
for the 15-nation EU Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Begium's ban on both cans and bottles of Coke,  
Sprite and Fanta, France has stopped sales of all Coke cans 
produced at Dunkirk, although it is allowing sales of cans produced 
at the country's other Coke plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials in both countries have vowed to continue some  
sort of a ban until a precise explanation for the illnesses is 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	The Netherlands and Switzerland also have imposed selective  
bans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ivory Coast seized nearly 50,000 cans of Coke imported from  
Europe as a precautionary measure and pulled them from supermarket 
shelves, trade officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to protect the lives of Ivorian consumers against  
any contamination,'' said Yao Konan, an official with the Ministry 
of Internal Trade in the Ivory Coast. There was no evidence, 
however, that anyone in the Ivory Coast has become ill by drinking 
imported Coke, which accounts for only 1 percent of the Coca-Cola 
products consumed in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Coca-Cola said reports it commissioned from  
toxicologists found no serious health risks in samples from the 
Dunkirk and Antwerp plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Kroes of Utrecht University in the Netherlands, said that  
while there were unpleasant odors from the samples, any impurities 
were well within acceptable limits and much too weak to account for 
the illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	In a similar analysis, toxicologist D. Lison at Catholic  
University in Louvain, Belgium, suggested the problem could be ``a 
mass sociogenic illness,'' or physical discomfort aggravated by an 
emotional reaction. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials in Belgium were skeptical.  
</P>
<P>
	``Thirty children had to be hospitalized. Eight had to spend the  
night in hospital. Four had to spend two nights in hospital. It 
makes me doubt any argument about psychosomatic,'' said Pattyn, the 
Health Ministry spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola advertisements, meantime, began appearing in France,  
Italy, Greece and Spain defending the quality of the company's soft 
drinks. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad appearing in major French dailies said that analyses by  
Coca-Cola and by independent teams show that ``the drink is not in 
question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Its quality is irreproachable.''  
</P>
<P>
	The theme was the same in Italy. ``There is no relation between  
The Coca-Cola Company's drinks produced in Italy and the incidents 
that have happened abroad,'' the newspaper ad read.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer in Cali Drug Case Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- One of several lawyers accused of aiding Colombian  
drug kingpins was sentenced to two years in prison Monday for money 
laundering and obstructing justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Ferguson will remain free on bond until Aug. 9, U.S.  
District Judge William M. Hoeveler ruled in sentencing him. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson was indicted with dozens of others in June 1995 and was  
one of four lawyers who agreed to cooperate with the government. 
Two lawyers whose case went to trial were convicted in July of 
conspiracy to commit racketeering and launder drug money. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the defendants laundered more than $1 billion  
in Cali cartel narcotics proceeds and imported hundreds of 
thousands of kilograms of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Abbell, a former Justice Department extradition expert,  
was sentenced to seven years in prison last week. Miami lawyer 
William Moran was sentenced to five years in prison earlier this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorneys were accused of delivering drug money payoffs to  
families of defendants, relaying threats from the drug lords to 
prevent cooperation and preparing false affidavits.

<HEADLINE>  Parade Honors Stanley Cup Champs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The Dallas Stars' bandwagon rolled through  
downtown today as thousands of fans gathered for a parade to honor 
the Stanley Cup champions. 
</P>
<P>
	Captain Derian Hatcher hoisted the silver NHL championship cup  
and forward Mike Modano chomped on a cigar while riding on a float. 
</P>
<P>
	The parade started at City Hall and snaked through downtown  
toward a victory party at Reunion Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Forward Dave Reid waved to fans while wearing a black cowboy  
hat. On another float, team owner Tom Hicks sported new cowboy 
boots emblazoned with an image of the cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans along the route waved green flags and cheered their  
champions, who won the cup with a triple-overtime victory over 
Buffalo that ended early Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've lost a lot of sleep but it's been thrilling,'' said one  
fan, who had green and white ribbons pinned to her shoulders. 
``It's so great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vendors along the parade route found booming business. A booth  
selling $25 T-shirts and $10 golf caps was crowded with buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	For the better part of this spring, the Stars managed to capture  
the imagination of a city that usually reserves its excitement for 
Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	Flags flew from automobiles, power plays were discussed at water  
coolers and more attention was given to Modano's bum wrist than to 
Deion Sanders' bad toe. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stanley Cup victory sparked celebrations that began in  
sports bars and spilled into downtown streets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The city is appreciative of what the Stars have done,'' said  
Tom Burke of Dallas, who was one of hundreds waiting Sunday at a 
grocery store for tickets to the victory rally. ``The city has 
embraced the Stars. We feel like we know the players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 fans were waiting for the Stars when they arrived at  
the airport at 6:45 a.m. Sunday, and 16,000 tickets for today's 
rally were quickly snapped up. 
</P>
<P>
	The hysteria surrounding the first Stanley Cup's first trip to  
Texas hasn't been lost on the Stars themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've come from the point where people didn't know what a goal  
was or any of the rules to everybody being crazy about the sport -- 
it's gone 180 degrees,'' said Craig Ludwig, one of three former 
Minnesota North Stars still on the roster. ``It's incredible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before this weekend, no professional team from the Dallas area  
had ever won a championship in a major sport other than football. 
The Cowboys have won five Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas Rangers have been in Dallas since 1972, but have won  
just one playoff game. The Dallas Mavericks arrived in 1980 and 
haven't been in the playoffs since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's brought the whole city together,'' Rob Parker of Dallas  
said. ``There are no barriers, racial or otherwise, when you talk 
about the Stars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first title in the franchise's 32-year history came six  
years after previous owner Norm Green moved the team from 
Minneapolis because of small crowds. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> O'Brien Withdraws From US Nationals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Olympic champion and world-record  
decathlete Dan O'Brien withdrew from the U.S. track championships 
on Monday because of turf toe. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien will not participate in the meet, held in Eugene, Ore.,  
from June 24-27, because of the injury to his left foot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am extremely disappointed that I will not be able to compete  
this week in front of an Oregon home crowd,'' O'Brien said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien won the gold medal in the decathlon at the 1996  
Olympics, holds the world record in the 10-event competition and is 
a three-time world champion. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien, who turns 33 next month, said the International Amateur  
Athletic Federation may grant him a wild-card invitation that would 
allow him to compete for his fourth world championship despite not 
participating in the U.S. event. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am hopeful that I will be given this opportunity and that my  
foot will heal so that I can still reach my goal of 9,000 points at 
the 1999 World Championships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The World Championships will be held from August 21-29 at  
Seville, Spain.

<HEADLINE>  Parade Honors Stanley Cup Champs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The Dallas Stars' bandwagon rolled through  
downtown today as thousands of fans gathered for a parade to honor 
the Stanley Cup champions. 
</P>
<P>
	Captain Derian Hatcher hoisted the silver NHL championship cup  
and forward Mike Modano chomped on a cigar while riding on a float. 
</P>
<P>
	The parade started at City Hall and snaked through downtown  
toward a victory party at Reunion Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Forward Dave Reid waved to fans while wearing a black cowboy  
hat. On another float, team owner Tom Hicks sported new cowboy 
boots emblazoned with an image of the cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans along the route waved green flags and cheered their  
champions, who won the cup with a triple-overtime victory over 
Buffalo that ended early Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've lost a lot of sleep but it's been thrilling,'' said one  
fan, who had green and white ribbons pinned to her shoulders. 
``It's so great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vendors along the parade route found booming business. A booth  
selling $25 T-shirts and $10 golf caps was crowded with buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	For the better part of this spring, the Stars managed to capture  
the imagination of a city that usually reserves its excitement for 
Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	Flags flew from automobiles, power plays were discussed at water  
coolers and more attention was given to Modano's bum wrist than to 
Deion Sanders' bad toe. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stanley Cup victory sparked celebrations that began in  
sports bars and spilled into downtown streets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The city is appreciative of what the Stars have done,'' said  
Tom Burke of Dallas, who was one of hundreds waiting Sunday at a 
grocery store for tickets to the victory rally. ``The city has 
embraced the Stars. We feel like we know the players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 fans were waiting for the Stars when they arrived at  
the airport at 6:45 a.m. Sunday, and 16,000 tickets for today's 
rally were quickly snapped up. 
</P>
<P>
	The hysteria surrounding the first Stanley Cup's first trip to  
Texas hasn't been lost on the Stars themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've come from the point where people didn't know what a goal  
was or any of the rules to everybody being crazy about the sport -- 
it's gone 180 degrees,'' said Craig Ludwig, one of three former 
Minnesota North Stars still on the roster. ``It's incredible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before this weekend, no professional team from the Dallas area  
had ever won a championship in a major sport other than football. 
The Cowboys have won five Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas Rangers have been in Dallas since 1972, but have won  
just one playoff game. The Dallas Mavericks arrived in 1980 and 
haven't been in the playoffs since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's brought the whole city together,'' Rob Parker of Dallas  
said. ``There are no barriers, racial or otherwise, when you talk 
about the Stars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first title in the franchise's 32-year history came six  
years after previous owner Norm Green moved the team from 
Minneapolis because of small crowds. 
</P>
<P>
	When the club arrived in Texas, the Dallas fans certainly  
weren't the most knowledgeable, but Hicks saw enough interest to 
buy the team in December 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Hicks had deep pockets but there was also the front-office savvy  
of general manager Bob Gainey and the steadiness of coach Ken 
Hitchcock.

<HEADLINE> Intel Chosen for TV Set-Top Boxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Intel Corp. will provide Hughes  
Network Systems with microprocessors for its latest television 
set-top receivers, the companies announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes, a leader in satellite products and network systems, will  
use Pentium MMX microprocessors in set-top boxes enabling Internet 
access as well as its own satellite-driven DirecTV service. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel, the world's largest  
chip maker, it signals a significant foray outside the personal 
computer business. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies agreed to collaborate on a number of television  
set-top box products, the first being the AOL TV satellite 
receiver, capable of supporting AOL TV, the service from America 
Online Inc., which will bring AOL to the television, as well as the 
200-plus channels of digital TV available through DirecTV. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies also announced that Intel is licensing DirecPC  
technology from Hughes in order to integrate the technology into 
future products. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes Network Systems, a unit of Hughes Electronics Corp., is  
based in Gaithersburg, Md.

<HEADLINE> Senate Votes on Longer Lobbying Wait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers who become lobbyists would have to  
wait two years before buttonholing their former colleagues in 
Congress under legislation passed by the Senate that would double 
the existing moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
	As under current law, however, they could still sell advice and  
counsel to corporate clients and could set up a lobbying shop right 
away by hiring underlings to make the formal contacts with House 
and Senate members. They just couldn't call their former colleagues 
on behalf of a client. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a career path followed by several powerful lawmakers who  
left office this year, including former Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., 
who was briefly in line to be House speaker, and former House Rules 
Committee Chairman Gerald B.H. Solomon, R-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Senate legislation, staff members also would have to  
wait two years before lobbying any member in the house of Congress 
that employed them. Currently, former staffers are under a one-year 
moratorium that only prohibits lobbying the lawmaker or committee 
they worked for. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., added the little-noticed provision  
to the Senate version of the spending bill for congressional 
operations approved last week. The House version of the spending 
bill, passed last month, does not include the provision. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional negotiators will decide whether the tougher  
moratorium will be in the final spending bill. A similar 
Feingold-sponsored provision passed the Senate in 1996 but 
negotiators left it out of the final legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Feingold said the longer ban means that an entire two-year  
session of Congress would end before an ex-lawmaker could lobby 
former colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``A crucial part of the culture of special interest influence  
that pervades Washington is the revolving door between public 
service and private employment,'' Feingold said. 
</P>
<P>
	``By putting a lock on this revolving door for some period of  
time, we can send a message that those entering government 
employment should view public service as an honor and a privilege -- 
not as another wrung on the ladder to personal gain and profit,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the American League of Lobbyists opposes special  
restrictions on lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's punitive to former members,'' said league president  
Kenneth Feltman. ``Simply because someone has been a member of 
Congress should not lead to the presumption that they need two 
years to reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The measure wouldn't affect lawmakers who have already left  
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Livingston has registered to lobby on behalf of several defense  
contractors, including Avondale Industries, Bollinger Shipyards and 
Halter Marine Group. Each is seeking a share of the federal funds 
Livingston helped allocate as chairman of the powerful House 
Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	While in Congress, he received more financial support from the  
defense industry than any other interest, and helped the Pentagon 
fend off bigger budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Livingston was in line to succeed Newt Gingrich as House  
speaker, but resigned his seat in the midst of the impeachment 
proceedings against President Clinton after admitting to his own 
extramarital affair. He left office in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Another important committee chairman, Solomon, left this year  
and signed up as a lobbyist for General Electric, a major employer 
in his former congressional district in northeastern New York. He 
has sided with GE against efforts to force the company to dredge 
toxic PCBs from the Hudson River. In 1998, Solomon tried to amend 
the giant surface transportation bill to stop the Environmental 
Protection Agency from ordering any dredging until another study 
was done. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Coats, R-Ind., and Wendell Ford, D-Ky., are among former  
senators who have joined established lobbying firms, as did 
ex-Reps. Bill Paxon, R-N.Y., and Vic Fazio, D-Calif. All did not 
seek re-election in 1998.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Man Guilty in Internet Hoax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An employee of PairGain Technologies Inc.  
pleaded guilty to securities fraud Monday for posting a phony news 
report of an acquisition on the Internet to drive up the company's 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Dale Hoke, an engineer for the company in Raleigh, N.C.,  
pleaded guilty to two counts in an agreement with federal 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoke, who was scheduled to go on trial July 6 on five counts,  
faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison on each count and 
fines up to $1 million on each count. 
</P>
<P>
	Under sentencing guidelines he is expected to get a much shorter  
sentence of 10 months to 16 months, but that could be changed by 
the judge, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher Painter. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoke remained free on $50,000 bond. Sentencing was scheduled for  
Aug. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Hoke was a middle level engineer in electronics  
development at PairGain, a telecommunications equipment 
manufacturer. He owned stock in the company and options to purchase 
other shares, according to a plea agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoke, 25, admitted to posting the fake report that suggested  
PairGain, based in Tustin, was about to be acquired by an Israeli 
company for $1.35 billion. The story was made up to look like it 
had been posted on a Bloomberg News Service Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	The April 7 hoax pushed up PairGain stock from up $8.50 per  
share to as high as $11.25. Trading on the stock April 7 amounted 
to 13.7 million shares, about seven times the average trading 
volume for the stock. The price of PairGain stock fell back to 
$9.38 per share when the company issued a statement denying such a 
deal was in the works. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoke was arrested at his Raleigh home after the FBI traced  
Internet addresses to him. He agreed to pay full restitution, 
potentially millions of dollars, to victims of the false report. 
</P>
<P>
	Bloomberg LP, parent company of the news service, recently filed  
a lawsuit against Hoke seeking unspecified damages.

<HEADLINE> Hamm Asserts Herself in World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Trotting around the Giants Stadium field, saluting the largest  
crowd to see a women's sporting event in this country, the U.S. 
soccer team was missing someone: Mia Hamm. 
</P>
<P>
	No big deal. Having Hamm in the lineup is much more crucial than  
having her around for celebrations like the one that followed a 3-0 
victory over Denmark in the Women's World Cup opener Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamm did wave to the record gathering of 78,972. She clapped her  
hands above her head in tribute. But she also headed quickly to the 
locker room after both her calves cramped late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The subsequent victory lap was one of the few things the  
Americans did well without their star striker, who scored once and 
set up another goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be games where my team needs someone to light a  
fire,'' Hamm said. ``Maybe it will be me, or Kristine (Lilly) or 
Julie (Foudy). That's what is great about this team. I wouldn't be 
the player I am without this team. They are the ones who make 
players like me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps. Lilly and Foudy did score, after all. But they didn't  
set the tone against the Danes. Hamm, the sport's career 
goal-scoring leader, did. 
</P>
<P>
	``Up until the first goal, we really weren't playing our game,''  
said Cindy Parlow, one of the main culprits in not converting her 
opportunities on Saturday. ``We were playing a lot of defense, and 
they were getting in (threatening position). And then we get one 
chance, and Mia puts it away. That's a veteran player for you. 
</P>
<P>
	``She settled everyone down. She scored the important goal. I  
think that did a lot for us. It relaxed us all. It was like, `OK, 
we can do this.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	What they want to do next is beat Nigeria in Chicago on Thursday  
night. That would clinch a spot in the quarterfinals -- and a place 
in the 2000 Olympics, as well. 
</P>
<P>
	First, though, they're entitled to look back at the opener,  
which they hope was a harbinger for the tournament and women's 
soccer in general. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a very, very proud moment for us and for our  
sport,'' Hamm said of playing before the largest crowd for a sports 
event at Giants Stadium ``We still have a long way to go to win the 
Cup, and it's not going to be easy, but what a great first day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Brandi Chastain, whose long pass to Hamm led to the first  
goal: 
</P>
<P>
	``It does something to you inside. Your heart beats a littler  
harder and you stand a little taller, and it lets you know the 
people out there really acknowledge what you do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What Hamm usually does is establish the tone of a game,  
something she did perfectly against Denmark. While most of her 
teammates appeared nervous early on, Hamm was dominant. On her 
second touch of the game, she accepted a long pass from Chastain 
with her right foot. Immediately, Hamm tapped the ball around 
defender Katrine Pedersen and onto her left foot for a blast into 
the top of the net. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a personality player is like what Mia was today,''  
coach Tony DiCicco said. ``She wanted the responsibility. She 
wanted the ball. She wanted the responsibility of feeding the 
players in the best area for a shot, or taking the shot herself. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the quality of player and person Mia is. As a coach,  
you can't measure how important it is for your star player to be 
such a leader and a character person.''

<HEADLINE> Chile Announces Economy Boost Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Chile announced a multimillion-dollar  
public works program Monday and offered financial aid to indebted 
businessmen to boost the economy and create jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	In a nationally broadcast address, President Eduardo Frei noted  
that Chile's economic activity dropped 3.2 percent during the 
January-April period this year compared to a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	While attributing part of the problem to the Asian economic  
crisis, he said Chile must resume growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Monday, the Central Bank announced a drop in interest  
rates from 5.75 percent to 5 percent, a move Frei called ``an 
invitation to bet on our country and dismiss pessimism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Conditions for resuming growth are here,'' he said, predicting  
a 4.5 percent to 5 percent growth for next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan will pay special attention to creating jobs, as  
unemployment has reached 8.2 percent, compared to around 5 percent 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Frei said government agencies will spend more than $60 million  
on public work programs to build schools, water and sewer plants, 
pave city streets and develop irrigation projects. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the government-owned State Bank will launch a  
program to help more than 60,000 heavily indebted small businessmen 
and farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan will allow urban businessmen to defer repayments of  
their debts until next January and farmers until March.

<HEADLINE> No Implants-Illness Link Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Silicone breast implants do not cause major  
illnesses yet they frequently break open and leak, which can cause 
pain, disfigurement and repeat surgery, concludes a long-awaited 
report that says women must be forewarned about breakage. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's report is unlikely to end a decade-long controversy  
over breast implants, which thousands of women blame for severe 
illnesses from cancer to rheumatoid arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Institute of Medicine, citing concern that many  
Americans were told their implants would ``last for life,'' 
recommended a national ``informed consent'' form explaining high 
breakage rates for every potential implant recipient. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration said it would figure out how to  
give women that warning. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-ribbon science panel insisted that women who think  
their implants gave them serious illnesses are mistaken. Other 
scientific panels also have concluded there is no evidence that 
implants cause major illnesses, but the new report, mandated by 
Congress, was much anticipated because it is considered the most 
thorough and unbiased review. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of these women are seriously ill and we were moved by  
their suffering,'' said panel chairman Dr. Stuart Bondurant of the 
University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. However, ``women with 
breast implants are no more likely than other women to develop 
these systemic illnesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The institute posted a condensed version of the 400-page report  
on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	But the report won't end the controversy.  
</P>
<P>
	Women who say they were injured by implants seized on the  
warning about high breakage rates. They said they wished they'd 
been warned, but continued to insist that's not the only problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``I may never be able to remove all the toxic chemicals that  
have leaked to all parts of my body,'' complained Marlene Keeling 
of Houston, who had ruptured implants surgically removed 16 years 
ago and has a nerve disease. 
</P>
<P>
	And next week, court hearings begin on a proposed $3.2 billion  
settlement between Dow Corning Corp., a former implant maker, and 
thousands of women who stand to receive the payments. Monday's 
report is positive news, but it will not affect the proposed 
settlement, said Dow spokesman T. Michael Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 1.8 million American women have received silicone breast  
implants since 1962 -- a time before the FDA required proof that all 
medical devices were safe and effective. Complaints that implants 
broke and caused illness began in the late 1980s, and in 1992 the 
FDA banned silicone gel-filled breast implants except for breast 
cancer patients in special clinical trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Implants made of a silicone shell but filled with saline, or  
salt water, were not restricted. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two California-based companies, Mentor and McGhan Corps.,  
continue to study gel implants for cancer patients. McGhan also 
recently won FDA permission to try gel implants for cosmetic 
augmentation, in a 500-patient trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies say they warn women that implants could break or  
leak. Mentor said it cannot tell women how big a risk that is. 
McGhan called a 2 percent per year breakage rate ``acceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``For a breast implant to be acceptable by surgeons and by  
patients, it can't be a truck tire,'' said McGhan executive vice 
president Jeff Barber. But ``there will always be some percentage 
of failure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But implant recipients told the Institute of Medicine that  
manufacturers or surgeons often promised them the implants would 
``last for life'' and ``are completely safe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, about 24 percent of women who received silicone gel  
implants required repeat surgery for rupture, hardened scar tissue 
around the implant or infection within five years, said panel 
member Dr. Virginia Ernster of the University of California, San 
Francisco. The risk appeared higher -- up to 40 percent in some 
studies -- for women who had gel implants for reconstruction after 
breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA said it would make manufacturers warn women about these  
higher rates of risk. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Mexico City Rattled by Small Quake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Office buildings swayed and workers swarmed  
into the streets of the capital Monday when the second earthquake 
in as many weeks hit Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries from  
Monday's quake, whose epicenter was a sparsely populated mountain 
area 165 miles southwest of Mexico City, according to the U.S. 
Geological Survey in Golden, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency estimated the quake's magnitude at 5.7, while  
Mexico's National Seismological Service placed the temblor's 
strength at 5.8 -- neither approaching the strength of the 
6.7-magnitude quake that struck central Mexico on June 15. 
</P>
<P>
	That earthquake killed at least 17 people and injuring nearly  
200. It also damaged or destroyed more than 7,700 homes and 
numerous colonial-era churches in the states of Puebla and Oaxaca. 
</P>
<P>
	Radio reports from Puebla indicated the quake was felt only  
slightly there. There were no reports on whether any of the 
structures damaged in last week's quake had been weakened further 
by Monday's temblor. 
</P>
<P>
	Nervous residents in Mexico City poured into the streets, and  
some said they were disturbed by the length of the quake. The June 
15 temblor lasted a few seconds, while Monday's quake featured 32 
seconds of unpleasant swaying. 
</P>
<P>
	``These quakes are frequently felt more strongly in Mexico City  
than near the epicenter'' because the city is built on an extremely 
unstable former lake bed, said Bill Smith, a seismologist at the 
U.S. Geological Survey.

<HEADLINE> Suspected Serial Killer Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MURPHYSBORO, Ill. (AP) -- An alleged serial killer who is  
apparently making his way from town to town by hopping freight 
trains was charged Monday with murdering a father and daughter in 
Illinois, bringing to eight the number of slayings he is linked to. 
</P>
<P>
	Rafael Resendez-Ramirez was also put on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted  
list Monday. He is wanted for questioning in five killings in Texas 
and one in Kentucky since August 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I do know is that if this person is the person we suspect  
in these crimes, it's a very dangerous and violent person,'' said 
Don K. Clark, the agent in charge of FBI's Houston office and 
leader of the nationwide task force searching for the suspect. The 
task force has more than 200 investigators working the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities believe Resendez-Ramirez, 39, has been riding the  
rails, finding victims along the way. All eight slayings took place 
on or near railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	As for a motive, Clark said: ``I wish I could tell you.''  
</P>
<P>
	The task force, assembled earlier this month after authorities  
connected the killings, has stopped and searched freight trains as 
part of its manhunt, and freight railroads have stepped up 
security, watching for drifters hopping trains. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agents also have circulated photographs of Resendez-Ramirez  
in communities along his suspected path. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we've learned about him through profiling, it's just a  
matter of time before he kills again,'' said Mike Cox, spokesman 
for the Texas Department of Public Safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson County, Ill., State's Attorney Mike Wepseic said  
fingerprints found on an abandoned truck connect Resendez-Ramirez 
to the two southern Illinois killings. The bodies of George Morber, 
80, and his 52-year-old daughter, Carolyn Frederick, were found 
June 15 in his home in Gorham, 100 yards from the railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Morber's truck was found Wednesday in a school parking lot in  
Cairo, about 60 miles south of Gorham. The fingerprints on it 
matched Resendez-Ramirez's, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, an FBI spokesman in Chicago said the agency was  
investigating whether Resendez-Ramirez was involved in the slayings 
of a couple found dead over the weekend in a rural farm house near 
railroad tracks in Apple Valley, about 335 north of Gorham. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI also increased a reward for information leading to an  
arrest and conviction from $75,000 to $125,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Numerous sightings of Resendez-Ramirez have been reported  
throughout Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	A tip to police from Donna McHugh helped them connect the Gorham  
killings to Resendez-Ramirez. McHugh identified a photo of him as 
the man she saw Saturday staring at her through the window of a 
laundry in Percy, about 22 miles north of Gorham. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just looked scary,'' McHugh said.  
</P>
<P>
	Resendez-Ramirez was charged in Illinois with murder and home  
invasion. Federal authorities also charged him with unlawful flight 
to avoid prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	He is accused of shooting Morber in the head with a shotgun and  
beating Ms. Frederick in the head with the shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our community has just been stunned by this senseless act,''  
said Morber's son, Bill Morber. ``Everyone is scared, they're on 
edge, and I think they will be until this Ramirez is caught.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Resendez-Ramirez, a native of Puebla, Mexico,  
has used numerous aliases and changes his appearance by altering 
his hair style and wearing glasses. He has scars on his right ring 
finger, left wrist and forehead, a snake tattoo on his left arm and 
may have a flower tattoo on his left wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	The ex-convict has a criminal record in California, Florida and  
New Mexico on weapons and burglary charges.

<HEADLINE> San Diego Utility Expected To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Sempra Energy is expected to shop around for  
new acquisitions after its planned purchase of Colorado-based KN 
Energy for nearly $2 billion collapsed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Utility industry analysts said Sempra still seeks to expand its  
natural gas transmission and storage capacity and, with some $800 
million in cash on hand, has the resources to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Diego-based utility, which has been aggressively  
expanding its Latin American investments this year, also badly 
wants to add new markets to its U.S. holdings -- something the KN 
Energy deal would have helped it to do, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They obviously have bigger ambitions and I'm sure they are on  
the prowl for another company,'' said Edward J. Tirello of Deutsche 
Bank Alex. Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Likely candidates for an acquisition or merger are Columbia  
Energy Group, based in Herndon, Va., or El Paso Energy Corp., 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still think they would like to be a larger national company  
and I think they will look for ways to do so,'' said Michael Heim, 
a natural gas industry analyst for A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons. 
</P>
<P>
	If the KN Energy deal had gone through, Sempra would have  
assumed about $4 billion in the Colorado company's debt in addition 
to a payment of about $1.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Sempra would have extended its natural gas pipeline 25,000 miles  
throughout the Midwest and boosted its customer base to become the 
largest of any utility company nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The two utilities provided little information about why the deal  
fell through. A joint statement said ``it was more prudent for both 
companies to pursue their business objectives individually.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the agreement to end the merger talks, Sempra agreed  
to pay KN Energy nearly $6 million as reimbursement for expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Sempra shares closed Monday down $1.12 1/2, or 4.7 percent, at  
$22.81 1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. The volume of 5.3 million 
shares was more than seven times the average. 
</P>
<P>
	KN Energy, which also warned that its second quarter earnings  
would fall below expectations, was battered in heavy trading. The 
stock fell 28 percent, or $5.12 1/2, to close at $13. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it would see a loss of 20 to 25 cents per share  
in the second quarter instead of the 16 cent profit projected by 
analysts surveyed by First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	KN Energy, the nation's sixth-largest natural gas company, said  
the shortfall was caused by record warm winter temperatures two 
years in a row.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets closed higher Monday,  
with the key index in Hong Kong surging more than 4 percent after 
the government announced that it will sell stocks it bought 10 
months ago to prop up the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hong Kong market's Hang Seng Index rose 585.96 points, or  
4.4 percent, closing at 13,994.23, its highest level since Oct. 13, 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hong Kong government said it plans to put the U.S. $15.1  
billion blue-chip stocks it bought in August into mutual funds and 
sell them. 
</P>
<P>
	Ti-liang Yang, chairman of Exchange Fund Investment Ltd., which  
was set up to manage the government's shareholdings, said the sale 
of the mutual funds, called unit trusts, would be carried out ``in 
an orderly manner without disrupting the market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The news eased fears that those shares, now valued at more than  
U.S. $26 billion, will be dumped onto the market directly. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in Tokyo soared to their highest level since  
October 1997 amid strong buying from overseas financial 
institutions, on hopes that the Japanese economy is finally picking 
up steam. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 307.59 points,  
or 1.76 percent, ending the day at 17,738.85. On Friday, the 
average fell 39.19 points, or 0.22 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	During a three-day meeting of the Group of Seven major  
industrialized nations, which ended Sunday in Cologne, Germany, 
other leaders urged Japan to do more to ensure it is on a 
domestic-led growth path. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said that the Japanese government  
will take every measure available to ensure stable growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar rose sharply against the yen  
following what traders believed was dollar-buying intervention by 
the Bank of Japan to push down the Japanese currency. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 122.34 yen in the late afternoon, up  
3.02 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late Friday 
level in New York of 120.44 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In Seoul, the key index rose 3.7 percent as concerns eased over  
a possible increase in U.S. interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 31.27 points to close  
at 869.00, its highest level since June 19, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Thai shares also soared on buying from local speculative  
investors, who were in a buoyant mood given the strong performance 
across the region's bourses and declining interest rates at home. 
The SET index rose 19.55 points, or 3.8 percent, to 538.36. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Shares closed sharply higher, boosted by  
better-than-expected May trade data. The benchmark Straits Times 
Index rose 2.4 percent, or 49.75 points, to close at 2,120.38. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed higher on heavy buying of select  
electronics issues. The market's key Weighted Stock Price Index 
rose 139.12 points, or 1.7 percent, to 8,413.48. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed slightly lower. The  
benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index slipped 1.91 points, or 0.09 
percent, to 2,089.90. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed higher, boosted by the latest  
rate cuts by the central bank. The Philippine Stock Exchange index 
of 30 selected companies rose 18.98 points, or 0.7 percent, to 
2,448.62. 
</P>

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Backup point guard Chris Childs of the New York  
Knicks sprained his left knee in the first half of Monday night's 
Game 3 of the NBA Finals against San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	Childs was hurt when he tried to run down Tim Duncan from  
behind, committed a foul on the play and tumbled to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	He sat out almost the entire third quarter, returning with just  
over 1 second left in the quarter with his leg heavily wrapped. He 
did, however, start the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	His injury added to the physical woes of the Knicks, already  
playing without Patrick Ewing, who has a torn Achilles' tendon. 
Larry Johnson sprained his right knee in the final game of the

<HEADLINE> Mickelson One Shot Short at US Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- Sometime this month, Phil Mickelson  
expects to be called Dad. He'll have to wait longer to be known as 
U.S. Open champion. 
</P>
<P>
	With a melancholy grin on his face, Mickelson stood by  
helplessly Sunday while Payne Stewart rolled in a 15-foot par putt 
on the final hole, claiming the championship by one stroke at famed 
Pinehurst No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson was clearly disappointed after failing to win his  
first major title, but he'll get over it quickly. Back home in 
Scottsdale, Ariz., his wife, Amy, is awaiting the birth of their 
first child. 
</P>
<P>
	The big event is only weeks away -- maybe even days.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would have made a cool story for my daughter to  
read about as she got older,'' said Mickelson, who led the 
tournament with three holes to go but couldn't hold on. ``This is 
still something special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a beeper in hand, the 29-year-old Mickelson was prepared to  
drop his clubs and return home as soon as his wife went into labor 
-- even if he was leading the Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Amy Mickelson isn't scheduled to deliver until June 30, but a  
few rocky moments early in the pregnancy made the expectant father 
a little skittish about being so far from home. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not worth the tournament,'' Mickelson said a few days  
ago. ``As important as the U.S. Open is to me and every other 
player in the field, this is the birth of my first child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson was one shot behind Stewart when they teed off  
together in the final round. Never separated by more than two 
shots, they waged a stirring battle of one-upmanship through the 
North Carolina pines on a cool, misty day. 
</P>
<P>
	At No. 15, Mickelson nearly made a 40-footer for birdie, the  
ball spinning all the way around the cup before popping out. He 
tapped in for par and took the lead for the second time when 
Stewart missed from 5 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Going into the last three holes, I felt I had it under  
control,'' Mickelson said. ``All I needed was pars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As it turned out, his math was correct. But he couldn't execute  
the game plan, missing a 6-footer at No. 16 for his first bogey of 
the round. Stewart, meanwhile, made a 25-footer for par to reclaim 
a share of the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	At 17, Stewart put his tee shot within 4 feet of the cup, then  
Mickelson nearly matched him with a sterling drive that settled 7 
feet away. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson missed. Stewart didn't.  
</P>
<P>
	Going to the final hole down by a stroke, a playoff seemed  
likely when Stewart's tee shot disappeared into the tall grass off 
the right side of the fairway. Mickelson's drive was straight down 
the middle and he put his second shot 25 feet from the flag. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart laid up from the rough and chipped onto the green,  
leaving an uphill putt to save par. Mickelson was a little further 
away, with a difficult left-to-right slope to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
	The left-hander's birdie putt slid just by the hole, leaving an  
even-par round of 70 and an even-par tournament of 280. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson moved to the edge of the green and sensed he had lost  
the tournament, even while Stewart was still studying his putt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought there was a good chance he would make it,''  
Mickelson said. ``His putt was straight uphill and he could be 
aggressive with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the ball disappeared into the cup, he walked out to shake  
Stewart's hand. The new champion put both hands around his dejected 
foe and tried to find the words that would ease Mickelson's pain of 
once again failing to win a major despite his eighth top-10 finish. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing like being a father,'' Stewart told Mickelson.  
</P>
<P>
	On the course, Stewart couldn't afford to show any sympathy to a  
player whose best years are ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wasn't going to hand the trophy over to him,'' Stewart,  
42, said. ``Phil is going to have an opportunity to win again. I 
might be on the short list.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson walked off the course and immediately called his wife,  
who was suffering just as much as he was. But little Amanda -- the 
name they have picked out for their child -- should help ease the 
pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a disappointing day,'' Mickelson said. ``But in the  
next couple of days we're expecting our first child, so that evens 
it out.''

<HEADLINE> McGwire: No Postseason Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire knows two things for certain: He  
won't match his 70-homer season and the St. Louis Cardinals won't 
make it to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with 22 homers after connecting in his third straight game  
Monday night, McGwire is a month off his 1998 pace. And with the 
Cardinals 8 1/2 games out of first going into Monday night's game 
against division-leading Houston, he thinks it will be difficult to 
make up the gap. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to play too perfect,'' McGwire said. ``We can't afford  
to make mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire said the Cardinals must do more than acquiring a pitcher  
such as Curt Schilling or Kevin Appier. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just one player,'' he said. ``If it was two or three  
players coming into the mix and jelling, I think that might make a 
difference, yeah. But one player is not going to make a huge 
difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire thought the Cardinals would contend, but that was before  
season-ending injuries to starters Matt Morris and Donovan Osborne 
and before rookie J.D. Drew hurt his quadriceps in early May. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to sit here and say, yeah, we're going to roll off  
seven in a row,'' McGwire said. ``Knowing you have to play perfect, 
it's hard to do over a period of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis came off a four-game series against the New York Mets  
in which they lost three. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at what the Mets did all weekend, they capitalized on our  
mistakes,'' McGwire said. ``We just can't do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Going into the Astros series, McGwire was hitting .254 with 21  
homers and 54 RBIs. He hit his 22nd in the third off Sean Bergman, 
a drive to the second tier of the upper deck measured at 473 feet -- 
topped this season only by the 484-foot drive he hit out of Dodger 
Stadium on May 23. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not giving him anything to hit,'' batting coach Mike  
Easler said before the game. ``It's right on the corner, right on 
the black, or way the hell in. They're pitching him nasty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Tony La Russa pointed out even though McGwire hasn't  
recreated his 1998 magic, he's only two homers behind Sammy Sosa, 
the NL leader. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's right there with anybody in the league,'' La Russa said.  
``I think he's been pretty hot. I'll take what he's been doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So will McGwire.  
</P>
<P>
	``There won't be another year like last year, I just want to  
have a normal year,'' McGwire said. ``I don't know if I ever want 
to go through what I went through last year. I'd retire if I had to 
do that again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He doesn't want to hear that his projected home run total would  
make him the major leaguer to hit 50 or more in four straight 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pace,'' he scoffed. ``I don't know why people even talk about  
paces anymore. There's no pace for anything.''

steel tool company into an international business, died Thursday of 
cancer. She was 56.

<P>
	SANIBEL ISLAND, Fla. (AP) -- Clifton Fadiman, a writer, book  
editor, radio and television entertainer, died Sunday. He was 95. 
</P>
<P>
	Fadiman most recently served as general editor on several  
publications, including ``World Poetry'' and the fourth edition of 
one of his own works, ``The Lifetime Reading Plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He penned more than 65 introductions to a wide range of editions

Children's Literature,'' Britannica Junior Encyclopedia, the Young 
Children's Encyclopedia and other works, winning the Dorothy C. 
McKenzie Award for contribution to children's literature. 
</P>
<P>
	But for many who knew him, Fadiman probably will be best  
remembered for his mostly anonymous role as senior judge for the 
Book-of-the-Month Club. It's a relationship he fostered for more 
than half a century, starting in the early '40s. Despite losing his 
sight, he continued to make selections, listening to audio versions 
well into his 90s.

of books, poems and screenplays, died Saturday. He was 92. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Soldati directed some 30 films from 1931 to 1960, his  
strongest talent was considered his narrative style of writing. He

<HEADLINE> New Trade Center Bomb Trial Nixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A judge has rejected a bid for a new trial by  
the first four men convicted in the World Trade Center bombing, 
rejecting claims that new evidence had surfaced and saying the men 
were well represented. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 165-page ruling released Monday, U.S. District Judge Kevin  
Duffy turned aside every argument raised by lawyers handling the 
appeals of Mohammad Salameh, Nidal Ayyad, Mahmoud Abouhalima and 
Ahmad Ajaj. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court had denied the men's appeals last year,  
saying they got a fair trail. Earlier this year, the four were back 
in court, claiming new evidence had surfaced to warrant a new trial 
and that the lawyers who represented them were incompetent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am convinced that the defendants received an extraordinarily  
fair trial and were convicted on the basis of overwhelming evidence 
of their guilt,'' Duffy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is clear not only that the defendants have failed to come  
forward with any newly discovered evidence to support their 
motions, but also that they have failed to show that they were 
denied the effective assistance of counsel,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-month trial that ended in 1994 resulted in the  
conviction of all four men on conspiracy charges in the Feb. 26, 
1993, attack that killed six people and injured more than 1,000 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	The terrorist attack was meant to force the United States to  
curb its support for Israel and to stay out of the Middle East. 
Instead, it resulted in a heightening of security at public 
buildings across the country and increased attention given to the 
threat of terrorism throughout the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
	All four defendants were sent to prison for life by Duffy, who  
later presided over a second trial that resulted in the conviction 
of the bombing's mastermind, Ramzi Yousef, and another accomplice, 
Eyad Ismoil. Those two men also received life sentences.

<HEADLINE> Colder Climate May Stifle Volcanoes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Do ice ages suppress volcanoes?  
</P>
<P>
	Scientists have long known that the gases blasted into the air  
by volcanoes can cool the climate. Now, it appears, this may be a 
two-way street. 
</P>
<P>
	A study of volcanoes in eastern California indicates that, over  
millions of years, eruptions occurred in between cycles of colder 
climate, prompting researchers to speculate that glacial conditions 
may have suppressed the volcanoes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The correlation between volcanic outbursts and climate  
suggests that the two are linked,'' a team of researchers says in a 
paper appearing in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. 
</P>
<P>
	And California isn't the only place that a similar correlation  
occurs, lead researcher Allen F. Glazner said in a telephone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was kind of crazy until I went to the library''  
and found similar patterns reported by other researchers, said 
Glazner, a University of North Carolina geology professor. 
</P>
<P>
	Volcanic suppression could have occurred in several ways, he  
said, including changes in the stress on the earth's crust caused 
by the weight of ice or lake water, and changes in the amount and 
location of water underground in the area where magma is building 
volcanoes. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of those things is going to suppress a volcano forever,  
but they might delay it'' for thousands of years, Glazner said. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, he said, if a volcano is near eruption ``and you  
put the weight of 300 to 400 meters (975 to 1,300 feet) of ice on 
it, it might be enough confining stress to keep it from erupting 
another 10,000 years or so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, he noted that glacial times had a lot more rainfall and  
snowfall so ``there might be a cooling of the crust by water flux 
through it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In at least one area studied, there are many stone deposits that  
indicate early hot springs, he said, showing that water seeping 
through the earth was heated and rose to the surface, which could 
have provided an efficient heat transfer to cool volcanic magma. 
</P>
<P>
	The team of researchers -- who studied California's Long Valley,  
Big Pine and Coso volcanic fields -- found peaks of volcanic 
activity 10 million, 100 million, 185 million, 320 million and 690 
million years ago, alternating with periods of glacial climate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although the short-term effect of volcanism on climate is  
clear, it is unlikely that the correlation ... is a result of 
volcanically induced climate change,'' the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The climate impact of volcanoes has long been a topic of  
speculation, going back at least to Benjamin Franklin. The eruption 
of the Indonesian volcano Tambora was blamed for a worldwide 
cooling in 1816 -- the ``year without a summer'' when snow fell in 
New England in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The effect was also observed recently. The year after the 1991  
eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, the average global 
climate cooled a degree or two because dust in the atmosphere 
blocked the sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
	But such effects tend to last only briefly, and researchers say  
they are unlikely to lead to anything as severe as a major glacial 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the paper concludes, ``It appears that climate has  
affected the timing of volcanism in eastern California.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the coldest periods, glaciers averaged more than 300  
yards thick over the Sierra Nevada, increasing to 1,500 yards in 
some deep canyons.

<HEADLINE> National Homeownership Soars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Fueled by the lowest mortgage interest  
and unemployment rates since the 1960s, national homeownership 
soared in 1998 and probably will continue increasing for the next 
decade, according to a new study. 
</P>
<P>
	``The state of housing in America is very, very good,'' said  
Nicolas Retsinas, director of Harvard University's Joint Center for 
Housing Studies, which was releasing the study today. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found that about 1.8 million homes have been built  
each year since 1996, and that the national homeownership rate 
reached 66.3 percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the growth has occurred outside of cities and in the  
South and the West. 
</P>
<P>
	The report says that increases in immigration and in the number  
of young or newly formed households will fuel a continued increase 
in the housing market for the next decade. At the same time, baby 
boomers becoming senior citizens are expected to help sustain the 
home remodeling market as they revamp their homes, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, however, the housing boom hasn't done much for  
minorities and the working poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Although more minorities are buying homes because of low  
interest rates and specially tailored mortgage loan programs, the 
gap between white and nonwhite home ownership widened from 1994 to 
1998, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
	Education is a factor in that gap. For minorities, the  
likelihood of becoming a homeowner increases dramatically with the 
completion of a bachelor's degree, Retsinas said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the report says, the brisk housing market has also  
driven rent prices upward, causing problems for the working poor 
and those newly off of welfare. 
</P>
<P>
	Some property owners are dropping out of federal affordable  
housing subsidy programs in which low-income people pay about 30 
percent of their income as rent. 
</P>
<P>
	``For no state in the nation could a household with one person  
making $7 per hour working 52 weeks a year be able to pay for a 
two-bedroom apartment without exceeding the 
30-percent-of-their-income standard,'' Retsinas said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Housing policy has been predicated on the premise that if you  
work, you will be able to afford housing,'' he added. ``The whole 
housing policy is brought into question.''

<HEADLINE> 'Tarzan,' 'Austin' Rule Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Two swingers -- one human, one cartoon --  
dominated the weekend box office as ``Tarzan'' opened at No. 1 with 
$34.1 million and the Austin Powers sequel scored $31.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The military thriller ``The General's Daughter'' with John  
Travolta was third with a better-than-expected $22.3 million, while 
``The Phantom Menace'' had $17.8 million for fourth, crossing the 
$300 million mark and overtaking ``The Lion King'' as the No. 6 
movie of all time. 
</P>
<P>
	Studio executives were impressed with the weekend numbers. They  
said it was the first time they could recall that three movies 
grossed more than $20 million on the same weekend. Receipts for the 
top films totaled $123 million, up 21 percent from the same weekend 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This says that when people make good movies, no matter how  
many, there's room in the marketplace,'' said Disney distribution 
head Chuck Viane. ``The marketplace will expand to meet as much 
demand as it needs to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The box office was led by the animated ``Tarzan,'' featuring the  
voices of Minnie Driver, Rosie O'Donnell and Tony Goldwyn, and 
songs by Phil Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	It was best opening weekend for a Disney animated film since  
``The Lion King,'' which debuted with $41 million in June 1994 on 
its way to a domestic gross of $313 million. 
</P>
<P>
	If the weekend estimates that were released Sunday hold up,  
``Tarzan's'' debut also will have topped that of ``A Bug's Life,'' 
with $33.3 million last November. 
</P>
<P>
	Close behind was ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,''  
returning Mike Myers as both the international man of mystery and 
Austin's bumbling nemesis Dr. Evil. 
</P>
<P>
	``Austin 2'' dropped a steep 42 percent in the second week but  
still collected an impressive take of nearly $32 million to bring 
its total to $116.7 million. It crossed the $100 million mark on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Proving the star power of Travolta, ``The General's Daughter'' --  
which had appeared doomed to be lost in the hype over ``Tarzan,'' 
``Austin Powers'' and ``The Phantom Menace'' -- delivered a strong 
opening weekend, the best for a Travolta film since ``Face/Off'' in 
June 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``Star Wars: Episode 1 -- The Phantom Menace'' remained strong,  
losing just 31 percent of its business in the fifth week, to bring 
its total to $327 million for sixth on the all-time list. 
</P>
<P>
	In the next few weeks, it will easily pass No. 5 ``Forrest  
Gump'' ($330 million) and No. 4 ``Jurassic Park'' ($357 million) as 
it seeks to challenge the original ``Star Wars'' ($461 million) for 
second all-time behind ``Titanic'' ($600 million). 
</P>
<P>
	Also at the box office, the romance ``Notting Hill'' with Julia  
Roberts finished fifth with $7 million, but ``Instinct,'' Disney's 
other man-lives-with-gorillas movie, proved to be a disappointment, 
plunging 55 percent in its third week. The Anthony Hopkins-starring 
film finished sixth with $3.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Mummy'' was seventh with $3 million, ``The Matrix'' eighth  
with $1.3 million, ``Entrapment'' ninth with $1.2 million and ``Tea 
With Mussolini'' 10th with $635,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Sunday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final figures 
are to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Tarzan,'' $34.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' $31.9 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``The General's Daughter,'' $22.3 million.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Plans To Sell Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Ten months ago, Hong Kong propped up the stock  
market with a controversial $15.1 billion share purchase. Now that 
the market seems to be okay, the government wants to sell off its 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	After the government announced its sell-off plan today,  
investors showed no immediate fears that the market would be 
flooded with stock. The Hang Seng Index closed up 585.96 points at 
13,994.23 -- a 20-month high. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has long hinted that it would eventually sell its  
shares, and investors have feared that too hasty a sell-off would 
depress demand for stock, undercut prices and disrupt the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The government bought heavily in August during the height of the  
Asian financial crisis, saying it wanted to drive speculators out 
of Hong Kong to rescue shares and the Hong Kong dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the market has nearly doubled from the Hang Seng's  
lows below 7,000 points before government buying began. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials today sought to assure investors any negative impact  
on the market from the sell-off would be minimal. 
</P>
<P>
	Ti-liang Yang, chairman of Exchange Fund Investment Ltd., which  
was set up to manage the government's shareholdings, said the 
stocks would be sold as unit trusts, or mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The mutual funds will closely track the Hang Seng, making their  
dealings ``market neutral,'' unlike massive dealings in individual 
company shares, Yang said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It offers the prospect of the least disruption to the market  
of the alternatives we have considered,'' Yang said. 
</P>
<P>
	The paperwork will take four to five months to complete, so the  
earliest possible sale could come late this year, Yang told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The funds will be sold in packages small enough to let  
individual investors take part but also of interest to big 
institutional investors who want to bet on Hong Kong blue chips, 
Yang said, without saying what the minimum investment would be. 
</P>
<P>
	The government stock purchase raised criticisms that markets  
would not remain free in Hong Kong if authorities were willing to 
intervene to boost prices.

<HEADLINE> Mickelson One Shot Short at US Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- Sometime this month, Phil Mickelson  
expects to be called Dad. He'll have to wait longer to be known as 
U.S. Open champion. 
</P>
<P>
	With a melancholy grin on his face, Mickelson stood by  
helplessly Sunday while Payne Stewart rolled in a 15-foot par putt 
on the final hole, claiming the championship by one stroke at famed 
Pinehurst No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson was clearly disappointed after failing to win his  
first major title, but he'll get over it quickly. Back home in 
Scottsdale, Ariz., his wife, Amy, is awaiting the birth of their 
first child. 
</P>
<P>
	The big event is only weeks away -- maybe even days.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would have made a cool story for my daughter to  
read about as she got older,'' said Mickelson, who led the 
tournament with three holes to go but couldn't hold on. ``This is 
still something special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a beeper in hand, the 29-year-old Mickelson was prepared to  
drop his clubs and return home as soon as his wife went into labor 
-- even if he was leading the Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Amy Mickelson isn't scheduled to deliver until June 30, but a  
few rocky moments early in the pregnancy made the expectant father 
a little skittish about being so far from home. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not worth the tournament,'' Mickelson said a few days  
ago. ``As important as the U.S. Open is to me and every other 
player in the field, this is the birth of my first child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson was one shot behind Stewart when they teed off  
together in the final round. Never separated by more than two 
shots, they waged a stirring battle of one-upmanship through the 
North Carolina pines on a cool, misty day. 
</P>
<P>
	At No. 15, Mickelson nearly made a 40-footer for birdie, the  
ball spinning all the way around the cup before popping out. He 
tapped in for par and took the lead for the second time when 
Stewart missed from 5 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Going into the last three holes, I felt I had it under  
control,'' Mickelson said. ``All I needed was pars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As it turned out, his math was correct. But he couldn't execute  
the game plan, missing a 6-footer at No. 16 for his first bogey of 
the round. Stewart, meanwhile, made a 25-footer for par to reclaim 
a share of the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	At 17, Stewart put his tee shot within 4 feet of the cup, then  
Mickelson nearly matched him with a sterling drive that settled 7 
feet away. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson missed. Stewart didn't.  
</P>
<P>
	Going to the final hole down by a stroke, a playoff seemed  
likely when Stewart's tee shot disappeared into the tall grass off 
the right side of the fairway. Mickelson's drive was straight down 
the middle and he put his second shot 25 feet from the flag. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart laid up from the rough and chipped onto the green,  
leaving an uphill putt to save par. Mickelson was a little further 
away, with a difficult left-to-right slope to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
	The left-hander's birdie putt slid just by the hole, leaving an  
even-par round of 70 and an even-par tournament of 280. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson moved to the edge of the green and sensed he had lost  
the tournament, even while Stewart was still studying his putt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought there was a good chance he would make it,''  
Mickelson said. ``His putt was straight uphill and he could be 
aggressive with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the ball disappeared into the cup, he walked out to shake  
Stewart's hand. The new champion put both hands around his dejected 
foe and tried to find the words that would ease Mickelson's pain of 
once again failing to win a major despite his eighth top-10 finish. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing like being a father,'' Stewart told Mickelson.  
</P>
<P>
	On the course, Stewart couldn't afford to show any sympathy to a  
player whose best years are ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wasn't going to hand the trophy over to him,'' Stewart,  
42, said. ``Phil is going to have an opportunity to win again. I 
might be on the short list.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson walked off the course and immediately called his wife,  
who was suffering just as much as he was. But little Amanda -- the 
name they have picked out for their child -- should help ease the 
pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a disappointing day,'' Mickelson said. ``But in the  
next couple of days we're expecting our first child, so that evens 
it out.''

<HEADLINE> Wheat Mixed; Corn, Soybeans Lower / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat futures finished mixed Monday on the  
Chicago Board of Trade, while corn and soybeans retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures were supported by rains that once again delayed  
harvesting of the winter wheat crop. Agronomist say the longer 
harvesting is delay, the greater the chance of crop loss to pests 
and weather problems. Prices were pressured in some months by 
weakness in the corn and soybean markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans gave up some of their gains from late last  
week amid moderating forecasts for Midwest growing regions. 
Meteorologists said a high pressure ridge moving into parts of Iowa 
and other growing states would not be as severe as originally 
thought. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures were expected to remain moderate in the Midwest  
over the next few days, with plenty of relieving rains that should 
prove beneficial to crop development. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery was unchanged at $2.54 3/4 a bushel; July  
corn fell 1 1/2 cents to $2.19 1/4 a bushel; July oats fell 2 1/4 cents to 
$1.15 1/4 a bushel; July soybeans fell 3 1/4 cents to $4.71 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while  
pork futures finished mostly lower. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle fell .35 cent to 63.52 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle fell .22 cent to 76.90 cents a pound; July lean hogs 
rose .23 cent to 51 cents a pound; July pork bellies rose .60 cent 
to 43.80 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Court Gives Special School Reprieve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today temporarily blocked  
the dismantling of a special public school district for disabled 
children in a New York community of ultra-Orthodox Jews. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices, granting an emergency request by state officials,  
postponed the effect of a ruling in which New York's highest court 
said creation of the school district violated the constitutionally 
required separation of government and religion. 
</P>
<P>
	The court had been told its help was ``the only apparent means  
of preventing nearly 220 handicapped students served by the Kiryas 
Joel Union Free School District from being locked out of their 
school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The school district will be allowed to continue operations until  
the justices say whether they will grant full review to the state's 
still-pending appeal of the New York court's ruling. That word may 
not come for months. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiryas Joel, about 45 miles northwest of New York City in Orange  
County, has about 12,000 residents -- virtually all of them members 
of the Satmar Hasidic sect, which maintains an insular community 
where people wear special clothing, follow a strict schedule of 
prayer and religious study and usually speak Yiddish. 
</P>
<P>
	Children who are not disabled attend private religious schools  
in the village, where girls and boys are educated separately. At 
the public school, fulltime and part-time students are educated in 
mixed classes of boys and girls. 
</P>
<P>
	In the late 1980s, the community's leaders first asked the state  
Legislature to create a special school district so the village's 
disabled children could be educated at their own schools rather 
than in the local school district. It was said they could fare 
better in a Hasidic setting. 
</P>
<P>
	Two previous attempts to create the special school district were  
struck down by the New York Court of Appeals. One of those rulings 
was upheld by a 6-3 vote in 1994 by the nation's highest court. 
</P>
<P>
	In that ruling, the Supreme Court said creation of the special  
school district was unlawful because it ``singles out a particular 
religious sect for special treatment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case acted on today was sparked by the Legislature's third  
attempt to fashion a constitutionally acceptable special district. 
The state Court of Appeals ruled, 4-3, last May that the 
Legislature had failed. 
</P>
<P>
	Louis Grumet, executive director of the New York School Boards  
Association had challenged the third attempt, just as his group had 
challenged its two predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the state earlier this month asked Justice Ruth  
Bader Ginsburg, who hears emergency cases from New York for the 
Supreme Court, to save the school district by temporarily blocking 
the effect of the Court of Appeals ruling. She referred the request 
to the full court. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Pataki vs. Grumet, A-1023.

<HEADLINE> Marlins' Floyd Out 1 Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Florida Marlins outfielder Cliff Floyd will miss at  
least four weeks after being diagnosed Monday with a small tear in 
his right Achilles' tendon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marlins placed Floyd on the 15-day disabled list and planned  
to activate reliever Archie Corbin from the DL in time for 
Tuesday's start of a three-game series at the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd flew back to South Florida on Sunday from Denver, where  
the Marlins were in the midst of a two-week road trip. An 
examination Monday revealed a small tear in the bottom part of the 
Achilles' tendon. 
</P>
<P>
	The 26-year-old outfielder will wear an immobilizing boot for  
about two weeks before beginning rehabilitation, Marlins general 
manager Dave Dombrowski said. He is expected to miss 4-8 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	It is Floyd's second trip to the disabled list this season. He  
missed the first three weeks after undergoing arthroscopic surgery 
on his right knee. He is batting .275 this year with seven home 
runs and 33 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Corbin, 31, is 0-1 with an 8.49 ERA in 10 appearances this  
season. He went on the disabled list June 2 with a pulled rib 
muscle.

<HEADLINE> Sentences in Point-Shaving Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- A former Arizona State player and four other men  
who admitted involvement in a college basketball point-shaving 
scandal were sentenced to federal prison or probation Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal caused harm to the university, the students, the  
fans and to the coach, U.S. District Judge Robert C. Broomfield 
said. ``This scandal leads to cynicism about what college sports is 
all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to sentencing, former Arizona State guard Isaac Burton Jr.  
apologized to his coaches, ``all ASU fans, classmates and 
whoever,'' saying he didn't realize what he was getting involved 
in. ``Hopefully you guys can forgive me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burton, Vincent Basso, Joseph Gagliano, Joseph Mangiamele,  
Dominic Mangiamele, admitted they were involved in a point-shaving 
scheme allegedly masterminded by former Arizona State student Benny 
Silman during the 1993-94 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Silman, 28, is serving a 46-month prison sentence for getting  
Stevin ``Hedake'' Smith and Burton to shave points in games so the 
team wouldn't beat the point spread. 
</P>
<P>
	``At no time did (Burton) do anything intentionally that would  
cause the game to be affected in any way,'' his lawyer, James 
Logan, said before sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling Burton's apology heartfelt and saying he gained little  
and lost a lot by his involvement, Broomfield sentenced Burton to 
two months in jail, six months of home detention and three years' 
probation. Burton also was fined $8,000 and will have to complete 
200 hours of community service. He could have faced up to 1 1/2 years 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Broomfield said Burton's jail sentence need not be continuous  
and he did not rule out the possibility that Burton might be able 
to travel outside the country during his probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton played professionally last year in Cyprus.  
</P>
<P>
	Five Arizona State games were bet on in Las Vegas between  
December 1993 and May 1994 and four were fixed successfully, 
prosecutors said. The bettors lost all their money in the last game 
of the scheme -- against Washington -- when Arizona State beat the 
point spread. 
</P>
<P>
	Gagliano was sentenced to 15 months in prison, three years  
parole, 100 hours of community service and fined $6,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Mangiamele was sentenced to three months in jail, eight  
months of home detention and four years' probation. He will also 
have to pay a $5,000 fine and complete 100 hours of community 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominic Mangiamele, Joseph's father, a former Chicago trucking  
executive, was sentenced to three months' probation, which includes 
four months of home detention, a $5,000 fines, and 100 hours of 
community service. 
</P>
<P>
	Basso, of Buffalo Grove, Ill., was sentenced to 1 1/2 years in  
prison, $27,000 in fines -- the amount he profited from betting on a 
game between Arizona State and Southern California -- and three 
years' parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, the third-leading scorer in Arizona State history,  
pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit sports bribery in 1997 and 
is scheduled to be sentenced Sept. 20.

<HEADLINE> P. Bowes Denies Cornering Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Pitney Bowes denied Monday that it is  
trying to corner the Internet postage market, but confirmed that 
antitrust regulators are reviewing recent patent infringement 
lawsuits it filed against competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Wednesday, the U.S. Justice Department's antitrust division  
asked the company for various documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitney Bowes is clearly the dominant player in the postage-meter  
business -- holding about 85 percent of the market -- but is 
scrambling to match smaller competitors in delivering postage over 
the Internet that can be printed out on regular computer printers. 
</P>
<P>
	Company spokesman Sheryl Battles said the investigation appears  
to focus on its attempts to protect its patents for Internet 
postage technology. 
</P>
<P>
	On June 9, Pitney Bowes filed a lawsuit against E-Stamp Corp. of  
San Mateo, Calif. The lawsuit claims E-Stamp used patented Pitney 
Bowes technology to develop its online postage product. 
</P>
<P>
	A week later, Pitney Bowes filed a similar lawsuit against  
Stamps.com Inc. of Santa Monica, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	That same day, the Justice Department served Pitney Bowes with  
its demand for documents. Both E-Stamp and Stamps.com have been 
served with similar demands. 
</P>
<P>
	Stamps.com officials said Monday that the Justice Department  
said it was investigating possible conduct ``aimed at interfering 
with the entry of potential competitors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Battles said Pitney Bowes has been the subject of similar  
investigations over the past 20 years, but each concluded without 
further action by the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``We very strongly believe we've complied with all of the  
antitrust laws and are confident that this inquiry is going to be 
resolved successfully,'' Battles said. 
</P>
<P>
	E-Stamp officials denied the patent infringement claims. They  
said Pitney Bowes was trying to quash competition in a market where 
E-Stamp holds 20 patents of its own. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think (Pitney Bowes) may see the writing on the wall and is  
competing in the only manner it knows how -- to sue its 
competitors,'' said Ed Malysz, E-Stamp's general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement released Monday, Stamps.com also denied Pitney  
Bowes' claims of patent infringement and said it would cooperate 
with the demand for documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, E-Stamp became the first company to get approval from  
the U.S. Postal Service to test its online postage product. The 
company said it plans to roll out its full service sometime this 
summer, once it completes testing in California and Washington, 
D.C.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 37.36; Nasdaq Up 30.50 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were mixed today as blue-chips fell  
and technology shares rallied to recover a chunk of their recent 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 37.36 at 10,818.20 after giving back an early 24-point gain. 
On Friday, the Dow rose about 14 points to finish the week with a 
gain of 365 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed today. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was down 0.92 at 1,341.92, but the technology-dominated 
Nasdaq composite index was up 30.50 at 2,593.94. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks have been hit hard in recent weeks amid fears  
the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to slow the economy 
and contain inflation. But with investors now expecting the Fed to 
implement only a small increase, the discounted prices in the 
technology group are looking more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM was up 2 5/8 at 123 3/8 to cushion the Dow, which was weighed down  
by Chevron, down 2 5/16 at 90 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues barely outnumbered advancers on the New York  
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 209.92 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 1.55 at 635.00, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 4.25 at 764.42.

Advancers on the New York Stock Exchange hold a 7-5 lead over 
decliners.

<P>
	The Nasdaq Composite Index is up 14 points and the S&AMP;P 500 Index

	Wall Street begins the week with little in the way of  
market-moving news.

	The top item from overseas markets has been the continued  
support of the U.S. dollar by the Tokyo government. 
</P>

	The Bank of Japan intervened today for the fourth time in ten  
sessions to prevent the yen from gaining too much strength. 
</P>
<P>
	While the dollar remains higher in New York, bond prices have  
turned lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow is on something of a hot streak. It's gained ground in

<HEADLINE> Buffalo Still Steaming Over Goal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- The Buffalo Sabres are still steaming and  
insist the NHL botched its review of the final goal of the Stanley 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I just want to crawl in a cave,'' Sabres coach  
Lindy Ruff said Monday. ``Every time somebody mentions the goal I 
get too wound up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brett Hull scored in the third overtime of Game 6 early Sunday,  
giving the Dallas Stars a 2-1 victory and the title. The Sabres 
contend the goal violated the man-in-the-crease rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Immediately after the 5 1/2-hour game, Ruff demanded to know why  
the league hadn't made an exhaustive review of the play, as had 
been the case with similar goals during the regular season and 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The league said it indeed reviewed the goal. It insisted that  
even though Hull was in the crease, he maintained possession of the 
puck. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL did not follow the same procedure in reviewing the goal  
as with other similarly questionable scores. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the team wanted to see was the same procedure we had gone  
through in the regular year,'' Ruff said. ``They wanted to hear the 
horn sound. They wanted to hear the announcer say `This goal is 
under review.' They wanted somebody to say, two or three minutes 
later, after reviewing it that the goal stands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo players simmered as they cleaned out their lockers  
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just thinking about how they wouldn't review it,''  
defenseman Jay McKee said. ``Usually when a goal like that is 
scored it takes a couple of minutes for the ref to be on the phone 
with the review judge and there was none of that. They didn't even 
speak.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres ended their season much like the 1998 Buffalo Bills,  
who were burned by questionable calls in a regular-season loss in 
New England and a playoff loss in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	The dubious calls against the Bills influenced the NFL owners'  
decision in March to bring back instant replay. 
</P>
<P>
	It was no consolation to the Sabres that their plight might  
affect future games. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can debate about the rule forever, and I'm sure it will be  
debated forever,'' Buffalo center Brian Holzinger said. ``There's a 
lot of instances that I've seen that are very similar to this 
situation that were called back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most Sabres agree that the rule is bad and that Hull's goal was  
good. They just wish the league had been more consistent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate to say it, but his foot being in the crease was a  
nonfactor,'' Sabres defenseman James Patrick said. ``My feeling was 
they scored on us. But even if it was good, there was no review 
process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff contends the league lost its nerve once the goal was scored  
and the Dallas Stars starting pouring onto the ice along with 
sticks, gloves and debris. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stop the chaos that happened within 15 seconds there,'' Ruff  
said. ``Have one referee keep the doors closed, another one keep 
the players on the bench and say `We're going to review this 
thing.' If we win the game in that fashion, or we score that goal, 
it would be reviewed because there's no celebration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rule was intended to reduce career-threatening injuries near  
the goal. One Sabres player would like to see the rule remain 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rule is pretty clear and safe,'' goaltender Dominik Hasek  
said. ``In the second half of the season, the players knew they 
could not go to the crease, and they were very careful. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were not too many goals disallowed because of somebody  
standing in the crease. I don't want to change anything. The rule 
is right.''

<HEADLINE> NHL Changes Video Replay Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Less than two days after the Stanley Cup finals  
ended in controversy, the NHL said it will no longer use videotape 
replays to decide disputed goals when a player is in the crease. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Gary Bettman said Monday's rule change had nothing  
to do with the goal scored by Brett Hull that won the Stanley Cup 
for Dallas against Buffalo in triple overtime early Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres, who lost the game 2-1, said a replay showed that  
Hull's goal should have been disallowed because his skate preceded 
the puck into the crease before he shot it past Dominik Hasek. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettman said the league was more concerned the game would lose  
some of its spontaneity when play is stopped for a video review of 
a goal. He said the video replay situation had been discussed by 
the league's Board of Governors about a week before the 
controversial Game 6. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're relying too much on replay'' for goal decisions, Bettman  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettman said the man-in-the-crease rule will stay in place, but  
on-ice officials will decide whether goals count -- without using 
replays. The rule usually disallows a goal if an offensive player 
has any part of his body in the goal crease. 
</P>
<P>
	Videotape replay will remain in use for all other existing  
circumstances, such as if the puck has crossed the goal line, if it 
is in the net prior to the goal frame being dislodged, or if it is 
in the net before time has expired. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than saying ``the absolute right call'' was made on Hull's  
goal, Bettman would not address the Game 6 controversy. He left 
that up to Colin Campbell, director of hockey operations, and Bryan 
Lewis, the NHL's supervisor of officials, who planned to discuss 
the issue at a news conference Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rule (on Hull's goal) was absolutely, correctly applied,''  
Bettman said. ``Everyone understands it was the right call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff said after the game that to reverse a  
goal that decided the title would be a ``nightmare'' for the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettman said he was unaware of any official protest by the  
Sabres. 
</P>
<P>
	The official response from the league after the goal was that it  
didn't matter that Hull had his skate in the crease, but that he 
had full control of the puck. Lewis said officials looked at the 
play probably six or eight times. 
</P>
<P>
	The rule, which was drawn up to protect goaltenders from injury,  
has been disliked by many skaters. Many goals have been disallowed 
even by infractions that are purely incidental to the play, such as 
a teammate's skate in the crease away from the action. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell ``is going to work on the interpretation over the  
summer,'' Bettman said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other action, the board approved a change in regular-season  
overtime in hopes of having a better chance to decide games that go 
past regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	When teams are tied after regulation, they will each receive a  
point in the standings. Then a five-minute overtime period will be 
held, with each team using four skaters instead of five. A winning 
team would receive another point. 
</P>
<P>
	The format was used by the American Hockey League this season on  
an experimental basis, and the league was satisfied with the 
results: Of the 44 games that went into overtime, 27 (or 61 
percent) had the ties broken. 
</P>
<P>
	The board also approved an increase in the number of games  
officiated under the two-referee system to 700 from last season's 
270, 
</P>
<P>
	The governors also approved the expected transfer of ownership  
of the Washington Capitals to a group composed of Ted Leonsis, Jon 
Ledecky and Richard Patrick from Abe Pollin.

<HEADLINE> Intel Opens Plant in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIRYAT GAT, Israel (AP) -- Intel Corp. inaugurated its newest  
microprocessor plant Monday in the southern town of Kiryat Gat. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel President Craig Barrett said he expects the factory to  
produce $1 billion worth of components a year beginning in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant will make the world's thinnest microchips for  
processors and Internet applications, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel will employ 1,500 full-time workers at the plant. That  
could double in time, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Production is scheduled to begin in August, with the first  
microchips coming off the assembly line in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction of the factory began in 1996. Intel invested $1  
billion, and the Israeli government put up some $600 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's agreement to finance so much of the plant's  
construction generated controversy in Israel. Critics said the 
Ministry of Industry and Trade grant money should have gone to 
companies with less money than Intel has. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel also has a research and development center in Haifa and a  
smaller production center in Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Feds Issue Money Laundering Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Treasury Department warned U.S. companies  
on Monday of a crackdown on a widespread drug money-laundering 
scheme involving purchases of American products for export to 
Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there are those that are out there willingly facilitating  
this criminal system, they should know that we will be vigilant,'' 
said Treasury Under Secretary for Enforcement James E. Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``black-market peso exchange system'' launders an estimated  
$5 billion a year in drug profits, Johnson told members of the 
Senate's informal Caucus on International Narcotics Control. 
</P>
<P>
	Another witness, hooded to protect his identity, told lawmakers  
how as a broker in the black-market exchange he helped launder drug 
money through purchases of products from major corporations, 
including Sony, Whirlpool, Kodak and General Electric. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone in this black market business knows that the U.S.  
dollars they are dealing in are from drug sales in the U.S.A.,'' 
said the anonymous witness. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said household appliances and cigarettes are among the  
products most commonly involved in the illegal trade schemes, and 
that U.S. companies, which often export indirectly through 
distributors, may be unwitting participants. 
</P>
<P>
	The black-market exchange has developed as a way for money  
launderers to skirt intense scrutiny on large financial 
transactions by U.S. banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombian peso brokers, who act as middlemen in the  
money-laundering scheme, give Colombian importers IOUs in exchange 
for pesos. The pesos are then used to buy U.S. dollars from drug 
cartels, providing the cartels with clean, usable currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, the brokers use the dollars to purchase goods and smuggle  
them into Colombia on behalf of the importers, who thereby avoid 
high government tariffs and taxes on foreign currency exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooperative efforts by U.S. and Colombian law enforcement  
agencies over the past eight years have resulted in the seizure of 
more than $800 million in assets and 2,100 arrests related to the 
black-market peso exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Some American companies, including Whirlpool and General  
Electric, already are taking steps to help combat the problem, such 
as cutting off sales through independent distributors in Colombia, 
said Bonni G. Tischler, assistant commissioner of the U.S. Customs 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's existence, however, has not been highly publicized or  
well understood,'' Tischler said. 
</P>
<P>
	To try to raise awareness, Customs is launching a campaign to  
educate exporters, including using pamphlets describing ``red 
flags'' to watch for. Among telltale signs that money launderers 
may be at work is when payments for goods are made with checks, 
money orders or bank drafts not drawn on the account of the 
purchaser, but of a third, apparently unrelated party.

<HEADLINE> Stephen King To Undergo More Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEWISTON, Maine (AP) -- His body is broken after being struck by  
a van. But the mind that created best sellers like ``Carrie,'' 
``The Shining,'' and ``Pet Sematary'' is intact, Stephen King's 
office said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	King, who was undergoing surgery on his injured leg and hip  
Monday night, faces another operation Wednesday and major 
rehabilitation over the next year. In addition to fractures of his 
right leg, King suffered a broken hip, a collapsed lung and a cut 
on his scalp. 
</P>
<P>
	His office took care to note that his serious injuries were from  
the shoulders down. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. King's mental state is great,'' his office said in a  
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	King, 51, was thrown 14 feet when he was hit from behind  
Saturday afternoon by a minivan as he walked along the shoulder of 
a road in rural Lovell, where he owns a summer home. 
</P>
<P>
	The best-selling horror writer remained in serious condition at  
Central Maine Medical Center, where he will likely remain for two 
or three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have nothing bad to report. Things are going very well  
indeed,'' said Dr. Larry Hopperstead, director of trauma surgery at 
the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Hopperstead said King will be able to walk with assistance in a  
few weeks, and estimated it will be about nine months before he can 
walk normally. 
</P>
<P>
	Another surgeon, Dr. Maria Ikossi, said King is ``a remarkable  
man. He has a sense of humor and asks appropriate questions. He is 
not frantic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The driver who hit King, Bryan Smith, lost control after being  
distracted by his dog, which was loose inside the minivan. Smith, 
41, was not speeding and stopped immediately, sheriff's Deputy Matt 
Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing to charge him with,'' Baker said. ``He wasn't  
being reckless. He was just distracted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baker said he doesn't know of any state law requiring pets to be  
secured in a moving vehicle. However, he noted that King, 
technically, was violating the law by walking in the same direction 
as traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital has been deluged with calls and e-mail messages  
from King's fans all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Several jokingly gave thanks that King was not found by Annie  
Wilkes, a character in his book ``Misery.'' She finds, kidnaps and 
tortures her favorite author after he gets into an auto wreck.

<HEADLINE> Aetna-Prudential Merger Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Treating a Justice Department plan as a  
promising first step, the American Medical Association is gearing 
up for an offensive against an insurance merger that is about to 
produce the largest HMO in the country and reduce competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision Monday by the Justice Department to make some  
modifications but otherwise give the go-ahead for Aetna's $1 
billion acquisition of Prudential Insurance's health care ``leaves 
an awful lot of markets badly out of whack,'' said AMA President 
Dr. Nancy Dickey. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department and the Texas attorney general's office  
filed a civil antitrust lawsuit to block the merger. At the same 
time, they filed a proposed consent decree allowing the purchase to 
go forward as long as Aetna sells its NYLCare health maintenance 
organization business in Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth. 
</P>
<P>
	But David Vanderpool, a Dallas surgeon who hasn't read the  
decree himself, said, ``I don't think that's enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A massive conglomerate of insurance companies like that can  
roll over patients, doctors and just about anyone else,'' 
Vanderpool said from the AMA's convention in Chicago. He added that 
with control over an estimated 40 percent of the market in the 
Dallas-Fort Worth area, the combined company would wield ``too much 
control over people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA asked the Justice Department last year to block the  
acquisition, arguing that it would harm patient care. Aetna 
provides health care benefits to more than 15 million plan members 
nationwide, while Prudential provides care to 5 million plan 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Joel Klein, the assistant attorney general in charge of the  
Justice Department's antitrust division, said Aetna's divestiture 
of the Texas operations will halt the company's ability to ``unduly 
depress physician reimbursement rates and thereby impair the 
quantity and quality of physician services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Dickey said New Jersey has a ``potentially worse''  
anti-competitive situation than Texas. She identified New York and 
Georgia as other states that would be adversely affected by the 
merger, as well as Florida, despite the fact that its large 
population of Medicare patients protects it to some extent. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas is ``a big win, but it's a first step,'' Dickey said. ``We  
clearly will have to work with other states.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The merger is ``a harbinger of bad things to come for New Jersey  
with regard to our patients,'' said Dr. Irving P. Ratner, president 
of the Medical Society of New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	``Together they will have a monopolistic organization which will  
control upwards of 35 or 36 percent of all of the patient care in 
the state of New Jersey if the merger goes through,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ratner said physicians want to manage the care for patients.  
</P>
<P>
	``This merger will diminish our ability to do that,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Mathis Becker, president-elect of the Florida Medical  
Association, said the organization would review the merger between 
Aetna and Prudential, which has a large market penetration in his 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our first reaction would be that we were pleased to see that  
the attorney general has recognized a potential problem for 
patients in Texas, but we'll be taking a closer look and pursue 
appropriate remedies if necessary,'' said Becker. ``We have been 
part of objecting to these mega-mergers. It disenfranchises more 
and more patients from choices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of the merger have 60 days to file objections. A federal  
judge in Dallas could then approve or disapprove the decree. 
</P>
<P>
	Klein said the proposed settlement underscores the department's  
efforts to preserve competition. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a statement, Aetna U.S. Healthcare said it did not share  
the Justice Department's ``view regarding the potential effect of 
the acquisition on competition and physician reimbursements in 
Texas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Health care consumers are demanding more choice -- in products  
and in physicians. It simply wouldn't make good business sense for 
us to take actions that would be contrary to this, including 
economic actions that could significantly reduce the number of 
physicians in our networks,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard L. Huber, Aetna's chairman and chief executive officer,  
said the divestiture in Texas ``was the most expeditious way'' to 
close out the Justice Department review process. Aetna expects to 
complete its divestiture by the end of the year and close its deal 
with Prudential in July.

<HEADLINE> Boston Chicken, Heinz Accord OK'd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- A licensing agreement that will allow H.J.  
Heinz Co. to sell packaged food products under the Boston Market 
name has been approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston Chicken officials said today it would license its Boston  
Market trademarks to Heinz for the worldwide manufacture and sale 
of packaged food products to retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement is separate and independent of Boston Chicken's  
restaurant business. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies announced the licensing agreement April 23,  
pending approval by the bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston Chicken, which operates and franchises restaurants under  
the Boston Market brand name, filed a voluntary petition for 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Oct. 5, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement Heinz will pay Boston Chicken an undisclosed  
royalty fee based on sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston Chicken said it anticipates the national exposure  
provided by Heinz' placement of Boston Market-branded food products 
in grocery stores would have a positive impact on Boston Chicken's 
business operations.

<HEADLINE> Court To Rule on TV Sex Channels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court agreed Monday to decide  
whether a federal anti-smut law went too far in trying to keep 
families who do not subscribe to cable TV channels like Playboy 
Television from getting glimpses and earfuls of the raunchy stuff. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration is trying to revive the 1996 law,  
struck down by a federal judge on grounds it swept too broadly in 
trying to keep children from seeing sex-oriented programs on 
networks only partly scrambled for non-subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	Society has an interest ``in seeing to it that children are not  
exposed to sexually explicit materials,'' the government's appeal 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Playboy Television lawyer Robert Corn-Revere said in a telephone  
interview that the law, which limited such programming to nighttime 
hours even for paying subscribers, was ``unnecessary overkill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The court set the stage for its latest word on cable television,  
expected sometime in 2000, as it neared the end of its 1998-99 
term. The justices planned to announce more decisions Tuesday, and 
they could release all remaining decisions and begin the summer 
recess later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The anti-smut law was enacted as part of the 1996 Communications  
Decency Act after complaints arose that even though sex-oriented 
channels are scrambled for non-subscribers, the picture and sound 
sometimes get through. 
</P>
<P>
	A Florida woman said she found her 7- and 8-year-old children  
and a playmate one afternoon watching the Spice channel, with 
scenes of a couple seemingly having sex with the ``groans and 
epithets that go along,'' according to the government's brief. 
</P>
<P>
	The law required cable operators that don't fully scramble or  
block sex-oriented networks for non-subscribers to show those 
``indecent'' programs only between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Playboy challenged the law in 1996 as a violation of the  
Constitution's First Amendment, which protects freedom of speech. 
Unlike obscene material, indecent material is constitutionally 
protected. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge in Delaware struck down the law last December,  
saying its provisions were too broad. 
</P>
<P>
	Another section of the law already requires cable operators to  
completely block any channel, free of charge, once a customer 
requests such action. The trial judge said giving customers 
adequate notice of that alternative would be a less-restrictive 
alternative to barring all daytime adult-oriented programming. 
</P>
<P>
	There are several types of technology for scrambling and  
unscrambling cable TV signals, and the effectiveness often varies 
depending on the weather, the quality of the equipment, its 
installation and maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
	An increasing number of cable television systems use digital  
technology, which easily scrambles signals fully for those who do 
not subscribe to a particular station. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration's appeal asked the justices to give  
the government broader leeway to regulate indecency on cable 
television, much as it regulates broadcast radio and television. 
</P>
<P>
	The invalidated law ``imposes a very limited restriction on  
speech and is a very effective approach to the substantial evil it 
addresses,'' government lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers said there was no proof the  
individual-blocking alternative would be practical because the cost 
would add up if many customers requested it. 
</P>
<P>
	Playboy's lawyers said it was ``far from obvious'' that  
adult-oriented channels were more harmful than other premium 
channels that show movies with profane content. The film ``Another 
48 Hours,'' shown on HBO, averaged a profanity every 30 seconds, 
Playboy lawyers' brief said. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn-Revere, the Playboy network's lawyer, said the law requires  
``turning off Playboy Television for two-thirds of the day'' even 
though two-thirds of American households don't have children. Many 
televisions these days have technology allowing the owner to lock 
out a particular channel, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	``Voluntary solutions are far more effective to block unwanted  
programming,'' the network's brief said.

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The license of Monica Lewinsky psychologist  
Irene Kassorla, once described as ``shrink to the stars,'' has been 
placed on probation. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Department of Consumer Affairs on Monday cited  
``repeated negligent acts'' that included failing to keep notes on 
therapy sessions. Kassorla also admitted to referring a patient to 
her husband for a business consultation. 
</P>
<P>
	No further details of the charges were disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	Kassorla agreed to a settlement that calls for an immediate  
three-year license probation. Kassorla must complete an ethics 
course and repay the state $6,000 in costs. A receptionist said she 
was on vacation in Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	Kassorla, who counseled Ms. Lewinsky from 1992 through 1997, was  
told by Ms. Lewinsky about her sexual relationship with Clinton. 
She testified that Ms. Lewinsky suffered from depression and low

	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- British peacekeepers said they are  
investigating the cause of today's blast at a Kosovo school that 
killed two Nepalese soldiers and two civilians. The soldiers from 
the 69th Gurkha Field Squadron, who were attached to the British 
peacekeeping force, were helping clear ammunition in the village of 
Negrovce, 20 miles west of Pristina, when a mine or booby trap went 
off, NATO said. The deaths were the first allied fatalities since

Monday to ``reject the murderous rule'' of the Yugoslav leader and 
follow Slovenia into democracy. ``I can't wait for the day,'' 
Clinton said, when a democratic leader replaces Milosevic, accused 
of war crimes for the killings and terror in Kosovo. The president 
pledged there would be no U.S. money -- ``not a bit, not a penny'' -- 
to help Milosevic rebuild bridges and roads destroyed in Yugoslavia

<HEADLINE> P. Bowes Denies Cornering Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Pitney Bowes says two competitors have  
infringed on its patents for Internet postage products. The 
competitors say Pitney Bowes is trying to corner the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the U.S. Justice Department's antitrust division has  
started an investigation into possible anti-competitive practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitney Bowes is clearly the dominant player in the postage-meter  
business -- holding about 85 percent of the market -- but is 
scrambling to match smaller competitors in offering ``on-line 
postage,'' which is delivered over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Wednesday, the Justice Department asked Pitney Bowes for  
various documents. Company spokesman Sheryl Battles said the 
investigation appears to focus on its attempts to protect its 
patents for Internet postage technology. 
</P>
<P>
	On June 9, Pitney Bowes filed a lawsuit against E-Stamp Corp. of  
San Mateo, Calif. The lawsuit claims E-Stamp used patented Pitney 
Bowes technology to develop its on-line postage product. 
</P>
<P>
	A week later, Pitney Bowes filed a similar lawsuit against  
Stamps.com Inc. of Santa Monica, Calif. That same day, the Justice 
Dept. served Pitney Bowes with its demand for documents. Both 
E-Stamp and Stamps.com have been served with similar demands. 
</P>
<P>
	Stamps.com officials said Monday that the Justice Department  
said it was investigating possible conduct ``aimed at interfering 
with the entry of potential competitors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Battles said Pitney Bowes has been the subject of similar  
investigations over the past 20 years, but each concluded without 
further action by the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``We very strongly believe we've complied with all of the  
antitrust laws and are confident that this inquiry is going to be 
resolved successfully,'' Battles said. 
</P>
<P>
	E-Stamp officials denied the patent infringement claims. They  
said Pitney Bowes was trying to quash competition in a market where 
E-Stamp holds 20 patents of its own. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think (Pitney Bowes) may see the writing on the wall and is  
competing in the only manner it knows how -- to sue its 
competitors,'' said Ed Malysz, E-Stamp's general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement released Monday, Stamps.com also denied Pitney  
Bowes' claims of patent infringement and said it would cooperate 
with the demand for documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, E-Stamp became the first company to get approval from  
the U.S. Postal Service to test its online postage product. The 
company said it plans to roll out its full service sometime this 
summer, once it completes testing in California and Washington, 
D.C.

<HEADLINE> Dell Shakes Up Computer Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Shell Oil Co. used to shop around for its  
desktop computers. Then Dell Computer Corp. offered a tailor-made 
Web site for Shell employees to conveniently order PCs, 
attractively priced and customized to their needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, Shell has bought $50 million worth of Dell  
machines and isn't looking back. 
</P>
<P>
	It's hardly alone. Dell's strategy of selling computers directly  
to users -- eliminating wholesalers and retailers -- has lured 
legions of loyal customers, fueled powerful profits and prompted 
its largest competitors to become copycats. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell's model of sales efficiency, in short, is helping to  
trigger an historic industry effort to cut out the middleman. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell, the No. 2 seller of PCs behind Compaq Computer Corp., says  
it sells about $18 million a day in computers over the Internet. 
That's a stunning $6.4 billion a year, about 30 percent of its 
total sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which still sells most of its computers through its  
1,200 salespeople, recognized early on that tech-savvy buyers often 
know what they want -- and prefer not to haggle with distributors. 
Cutting out the middleman, moreover, often means a better price. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to blunt the Dell threat, archrivals IBM, Compaq, and  
Hewlett-Packard Corp. are trying to emulate the more efficient 
model, but they're moving tentatively for fear of alienating the 
wholesalers and retailers that have helped made them among the 
world's top computer makers. 
</P>
<P>
	This go-it-slow strategy has its costs. Compaq warned last week  
it will report a big loss this quarter and lay off thousands of 
employees as a result of sluggish sales and price wars, woes that 
already led it to oust its chief executive in April. 
Hewlett-Packard and IBM also are smarting, though less than Compaq, 
analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq's days as the PC sales leader may be numbered. Last  
quarter, its share of U.S. PC sales slipped 2.1 percentage points 
to 15.7 percent, compared with a year earlier, reports researcher 
Dataquest Corp. Dell's market share rose 2.9 points to 14.3 
percent. Hewlett-Packard, IBM and Gateway, which sells home PCs 
directly to consumers, posted smaller increases. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dell's use of the Internet is really years ahead of where  
Compaq, HP and IBM are right now,'' said Matt Sargent, an analyst 
with the ZD InfoBeads research firm. 
</P>
<P>
	In just two years, Dell has developed 22,000 customized  
``Premier Pages,'' Web links that allow businesses to conveniently 
order computers directly from the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell builds machines as customers order them so it doesn't have  
to stockpile inventory. The company buys parts like disk drives and 
memory chips as they are needed, which saves money since component 
prices have consistently dropped.Dell often splits the savings with 
its customers. 
</P>
<P>
	While customers who prefer dealing with a Dell salesperson can  
still do so, they can save more money by ordering through the Web. 
In many instances, those orders go directly to Dell's factories in 
Austin, Texas, resulting in deliveries in just days. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of our larger customers have gone completely paperless,''  
said Joe Marengi, Dell's senior vice president of corporate sales. 
In addition, ``the orders that come through in this fashion are 
much more accurate than the orders that come in via fax.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, Hewlett-Packard has created only 800 specialized  
Web sites for its business customers. This month it unveiled a 
strategy to broaden direct sales. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM plans this year to set up 350 Web sites to sell business  
machines, and aims to have 1,000 within two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies hope to gradually shift more sales directly to  
customers, while preserving a chunk for traditional distributors. 
</P>
<P>
	But walking the fine line can be treacherous. Analysts say  
Compaq's effort to increase sales directly to customers has led 
some dealers, who are annoyed at being circumvented, to refer 
buyers to other PC makers. 
</P>
<P>
	The behind-the-scenes battle for customers may not be readily  
apparent to many users of home PCs, most of whom still buy 
computers the old-fashioned way -- at big retail chains like CompUSA 
and Circuit City. 
</P>
<P>
	To be sure, the kick-the-tire crowd will be out in force this  
week at the PC Expo trade show that opens here on Tuesday. But some 
observers say the surge of interest in selling computers over the 
Internet may eventually make shows like PC Expo irrelevant because 
sophisticated buyers increasingly make their purchases without 
seeing or touching the machines.

<HEADLINE> AOL Invests in Satellite TV Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- America Online Inc. will invest $1.5 billion  
in DirecTV creator Hughes Electronics Corp. in an agreement that 
gives AOL a new high-speed option and deepens ties between the 
world's largest Internet provider and the leading U.S. satellite TV 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced Monday seeks to combine AOL's Internet  
services with Hughes' digital television system. Company executives 
said the deal would help increase DirecTV's subscriber base while 
boosting the market for AOL's planned interactive TV and high-speed 
Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement also advances AOL's campaign to acquire the  
broadband platforms necessary to offer customers faster, more 
diverse services. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the satellite deal, AOL is not limiting its alliances,  
said Steve Case, AOL's chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think this precludes in any way, shape or form our  
ability to work with telephone companies or cable companies or 
anyone who can provide any piece of the puzzle of this broadband 
tapestry,'' Case said in a conference call with reporters. ``We 
want to provide the best set of choices to the widest audience 
possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts consider access to cable -- with its wide reach into  
American households -- crucial to AOL's campaign to convert to 
high-speed Internet delivery. Cable companies have resisted calls 
for them to allow open access to AOL and other Internet service 
providers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can't not have a cable deal. Not having that would be a  
difficulty for them,'' said Sajai Krishnan, an analyst with Booz 
Allen &AMP; Hamilton. ``Cable is going to be a strong play in the 
consumer market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AOL has also made several deals with phone companies such as  
Bell Atlantic Corp. and SBC Communications Inc. to provide 
high-speed services over phone lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, AOL and Hughes agreed to jointly develop a set-top  
receiver that would allow DirecTV customers to subscribe to AOL TV, 
an interactive service that would combine Internet access with 
Hughes' entertainment programs. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, television viewers would be able to communicate  
with other AOL users while watching a program 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new deal, the two companies also plan to develop  
content and additional interactive services to be offered through 
DirecTV and AOL TV. For example, viewers would be able to execute 
an online stock purchase while watching a financial program, or buy 
a video cassette of a movie they are watching. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL still needs to cut a deal with cable operators to provide  
its customers with true broadband service, said Josh Bernoff, an 
analyst with Cambridge, Mass.-based Forrester Research. For now, 
satellite technology provides high-speed connection in one 
direction only -- from the satellite to the user's computer. 
Information uploaded from the computer moves via a telephone line, 
usually at a much lower speed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Satellite has a pretty significant problem in that you can't  
deliver high speed data in both directions from a satellite,'' said 
Bernoff. ``To call this broadband is perhaps not completely 
appropriate. I would call this simulated broadband.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes is developing a new satellite system, known as Spaceway,  
that could solve the problem by offering two-way broadband 
connections. Hughes plans to have the system in operation by 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, AOL will invest $1.5 billion in an equity  
security of General Motors Co., parent of El Segundo, Calif.-based 
Hughes. The equity carries a 6 1/4 percent coupon rate that is 
automatically convertible into GM Class H common stock in three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Dulles, Va.-based AOL is the world's largest Internet provider  
with more than 16 million subscribers to AOL and its CompuServe 
subsidiary. Hughes currently has more than 7 million DirectTV 
subscribers 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of AOL rose $3.68 3/4 to $115.18 1/4 in trading on the New York  
Stock Exchange. Hughes, which trades as the GM Class H stock, rose 
$3.18 3/4 to $56.62 1/2, also on the NYSE.

<HEADLINE> Banks Warned About Money Laundering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Treasury Department planned to issue new  
warnings today to banks and exporters in the United States about a 
money laundering scheme involving exports to Colombia, The Wall 
Street Journal reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called black market peso exchange system launders up to  
$5 billion a year in drug profits, the Journal said. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombian businesses buy narcotics dollars at a steep discount  
and use them to fund imports from the United States and elsewhere, 
the newspaper said. The kitchen appliances, cigarettes, shoes and 
other goods are smuggled into Colombia, bypassing government 
tariffs and hurting legitimate businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury plans to launch a campaign to educate exporters  
about the problem. Companies will be encouraged to watch for signs 
that a customer might be using illegal funds, such as paying for an 
order with checks or bank drafts issued by a third party unrelated 
to the transaction.

<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Virginia's Republican Party leadership has  
voted to hold a presidential primary, a decision party leaders say 
will give the state more national clout. 
</P>
<P>
	On a voice vote Saturday, the Republican's Party's State Central  
Committee passed a resolution to hold a primary on Feb. 29, 2000. 
The vast majority of committee members voted in favor of the 
resolution. 
</P>
<P>
	``This opens it up to Republicans around the state and will  
expand the base of the party,'' said Chris LaCivita, executive 
director of the state GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Virginia GOP's old process, some delegates to the  
national Republican convention were chosen at congressional 
district conventions in May. The remainder were elected at-large at 
a state party convention in June, usually well after the nominee 
had been decided. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, a February primary transforms Virginia into one of  
the first five states to endorse a candidate for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters said the primary will make Virginia far more  
influential. ``While Virginia may be the mother of all presidents 
we are the selector of none,'' said David Hummel of Virginia Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents said a primary could hurt the party because under  
Virginia's open registration system, Democrats can vote in the 
Republican primary, thus influencing the choice of the other 
party's nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't going to be helpful to us and it might be harmful  
for us,'' said Morton Blackwell of Arlington. ``This is the system 
that is easiest for Democrats to invade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the new primary system, registered voters will be able to  
vote for the nominee of their choice. State Republicans will 
continue to select delegates to the national convention, but 
delegates will have to vote for the candidate that wins the 
Virginia primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia Democrats still nominate delegates at a convention.  
They have shown no interest in changing their system. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia is one of several states that have established  
primaries or moved the dates of primaries in an attempt to have 
more say in national elections. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina Republicans recently decided move their primary  
to Feb. 19, and Louisiana's Republican leaders decided earlier this 
month to hold a 2000 presidential caucus one week ahead of Iowa's 
traditional first-in-the-nation caucus. That decision must be 
approved by the Republican National Committee.

<HEADLINE> Women's World Cup Soccer Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP)- The media is embracing this year's Women's World  
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Accreditations for the tournament are up to 1,975, a number that  
far exceeds any other women's soccer event. 
</P>
<P>
	Of those accreditations, 900 went to reporters, 400 to  
photographers and 600 to representatives from radio and television 
stations. Of these journalists, 500 come from outside the United 
States, with China and Nigeria making up the largest overseas 
contingents. 
</P>
<P>
	For the opening game, the United States vs. Denmark in Giants  
Stadium on Saturday, 416 reporters, 124 photographers and 17 radio 
and television stations were accredited. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest in the U.S. team has increased dramatically since it  
won the 1991 Women's World Cup in China. On their return to the 
United States in '91, only one reporter met the players at the 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Another difference is the number of matches that will be  
televised. In 1995, only the six U.S. games were broadcast. This 
year, all the games will be televised. Seventy-four countries will 
broadcast the matches, with a possible television audience of 1 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SYDNEY 2000:* The Women's World Cup is not just an event in  
itself, it is also the qualifying tournament for the Sydney 
Olympics in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament is especially significant to Australia, hoping to  
make a strong showing before the Olympics. As the host country, the 
Australian team automatically gets one of the eight spots, but the 
team wants to win a place on its own merits. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight quarterfinalists of the Women's World Cup will  
automatically advance to the Sidney Games if Australia is among 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Should the Australian team fail to make the quarterfinals, the  
four winning quarterfinalists and only the best of the three losing 
quarterfinalists get a spot in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NICKNAMES:* The Black Queens tied the Waltzing Mathilda's, the  
Super Falcons beat North Korea and the Samba Queens waltzed over 
Mexico in ``the group of death.'' This may sound like a video game 
score, but all these titles are nicknames in the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nigerian team is called the Super Falcons, while its men's  
team is known as the Super Eagles. The Black Queens are from Ghana 
and the Waltzing Mathilda's were named after the Australian song. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil has no official nickname, but the media calls the  
Brazilians the Samba Queens, because they play the ``samba soccer'' 
that Brazil is famous for. 
</P>
<P>
	Group B, featuring Germany, Brazil, Italy and Mexico, was  
nicknamed ``the group of death'' because of the high quality teams 
in the draw. It would have been even more impressive had those four 
nations been together in the men's event. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SWEET SIXTEEN:* Nigerian midfielder Ifeanyichukwu Chiejene, who  
played in Sunday's win over North Korea, is the youngest player in 
the Women's World Cup. Chiejene turned 16 a little over a month 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Super Falcons have another 16-year-old in the ranks,  
Florence Iweta, who turned 16 in March. Mexico also sports a sweet 
16, Moni Vergara, who celebrated her birthday in May. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament's oldest player is Norway's team captain Linda  
Medalen. The veteran of the 1991 and 1995 Women's World Cup turned 
34 last Thursday, June

<HEADLINE> AOL Invests in Satellite TV Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- America Online Inc. is connecting to the  
largest U.S. digital satellite TV service with a $1.5 billion 
investment in DirecTV creator Hughes Electronics Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal gives AOL a new high-speed Internet option and is  
expected to boost AOL TV, the company's interactive television 
product. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives also hope the agreement will help increase the  
subscriber base of DirecTV, the largest U.S. satellite TV service, 
and provide a boost to its DirecPC satellite-based Internet 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	``It benefits American Online across all fronts and puts more  
pieces in place for the next wave of interactive services,'' said 
Steve Case, AOL's chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the satellite deal, AOL is not limiting its alliances,  
Case said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think this precludes in any way, shape or form our  
ability to work with telephone companies or cable companies or 
anyone who can provide any piece of the puzzle of this broadband 
tapestry,'' Case said in a conference call with reporters. ``We 
want to provide the best set of choices to the widest audience 
possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts consider access to cable -- with its wide reach into  
American households -- crucial to AOL's campaign to convert to 
high-speed Internet delivery. Cable companies have resisted calls 
for them to allow open access to AOL and other Internet service 
providers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can't not have a cable deal. Not having that would be a  
difficulty for them,'' said Sajai Krishnan, an analyst with Booz 
Allen &AMP; Hamilton. ``Cable is going to be a strong play in the 
consumer market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AOL has also made several deals with phone companies such as  
Bell Atlantic Corp. and SBC Communications Inc. to provide 
high-speed services over phone lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, AOL and Hughes agreed to jointly develop a set-top  
receiver that would allow DirecTV customers to subscribe to AOL TV, 
an interactive service that would combine Internet access with 
Hughes' entertainment programs. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL TV already is available to DirecTV subscribers. Under the  
new deal, interactivity would expand to include new content and 
features. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, viewers would be able to execute an online stock  
purchase while watching a financial program, or buy a video 
cassette of a movie they are watching. 
</P>
<P>
	By cross-branding with AOL, DirecTV will be in a better position  
to compete with cable operators, said Krishnan. 
</P>
<P>
	``This goes a long way in helping from a marketing perspective  
and bundling perspective, to make this total package more 
attractive. They're competing with cable companies that are going 
to be offering digital cable, Internet and even telephony in some 
parts of the country,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL still needs to cut a deal with cable operators to provide  
its customers with true broadband service, said Josh Bernoff, an 
analyst with Cambridge, Mass.-based Forrester Research. For now, 
satellite technology provides high-speed connection in one 
direction only -- from the satellite to the user's computer. 
Information uploaded from the computer moves via a telephone line, 
usually at a much lower speed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Satellite has a pretty significant problem in that you can't  
deliver high speed data in both directions from a satellite,'' 
Bernoff said. ``To call this broadband is perhaps not completely 
appropriate. I would call this simulated broadband.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Satellites also have a problem handling high volume traffic. The  
satellite becomes, in effect, a bottleneck that slows data 
transmission when too many people try to use the system, analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes is developing a new satellite system, known as Spaceway,  
that could solve the one-way transmission problem by offering 
two-way broadband connections. Hughes plans to have the system in 
operation by 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, AOL will invest $1.5 billion in an equity  
security of General Motors Co., parent of El Segundo, Calif.-based 
Hughes. The equity carries a 6 1/4 percent coupon rate that is 
automatically convertible into GM Class H common stock in three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Dulles, Va.-based AOL is the world's largest Internet provider  
with more than 16 million subscribers to AOL and its CompuServe 
subsidiary. Hughes currently has more than 7 million DirectTV 
subscribers

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Leaders Hail Serb Pullout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLOGNE, Germany (AP) -- President Clinton and other world  
leaders hailed the Serb military pullout from Kosovo and pledged to 
act more quickly to prevent fresh outbreaks of ethnic slaughter of 
the kind now being uncovered by NATO troops in the province. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will stand up for the innocents in the face of evil,''  
Clinton said in a speech Sunday after the close of the three-day 
summit of the Group of Eight -- the seven leading world economic 
powers and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	``(We) begin a new century and a new millennium with a hopeful  
affirmation of human rights and human dignity,'' Clinton told an 
American audience in Bonn just down the Rhine from the summit 
venue. 
</P>
<P>
	In Bonn today, Clinton and leaders of the European Union built  
on the work of the G-8, agreeing to organize a conference in 
Sarajevo in July to determine what investments need to be made 
immediately in Kosovo. The region's long-term redevelopment will be 
the focus of another meeting in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are interested in bringing this reconstruction to life,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, with the rest of the G-8 behind him, Clinton vowed to  
move swiftly to prevent future religious and ethnic conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we have the power to stop it, we should stop it. We ought  
to stop genocide and ethnic cleansing,'' he said in a CNN 
interview. ``It took too long to stop it in Bosnia. We are doing it 
now in Kosovo. That's what we failed to do in Rwanda, where so many 
died so quickly. And what I hope we will do in Africa, if it ever 
happens again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The G-8 summit saw an easing of tensions between Russia and the  
Western powers after months of acrimony over NATO's bombing 
campaign against the Serbs and Russia's role in the Kosovo 
peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian President Boris Yeltsin arrived at the talks promising  
to ``mend ties after a fight'' and Western leaders responded 
warmly, praising the deal that will bring Russian troops into the 
NATO-led force in Kosovo. ``I am among my friends now,'' Yeltsin 
declared. 
</P>
<P>
	``Russia and the allies are together on the ground, hand in hand  
with the same mission and the same objectives,'' said French 
President Jacques Chirac. 
</P>
<P>
	In a private meeting, Clinton and Yeltsin agreed to hold  
U.S.-Russian talks in the fall on deeper cuts in nuclear arms and 
on possibly reopening the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, White 
House national security adviser Sandy Berger said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is very significant because for the first time the  
Russians have agreed to discuss changes in the ABM treaty that may 
be necessitated by a national missile defense system, were we to 
decide to deploy one,'' Berger said. Congress is pressing Clinton 
to deploy a shield against limited ballistic missile attack. 
Critics say that would require changing the ABM treaty -- something 
Moscow has opposed fiercely. 
</P>
<P>
	Western leaders said Yeltsin seemed to be in relatively robust  
health on his first foreign visit in five months. ``His behavior 
was neither erratic or shaky today ... We actually had quite a good 
meeting. We got a lot done,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The G-8 leaders outlined plans to pump money into the rebuilding  
of Kosovo and called a special summit for November with Balkan 
leaders to plan long-term economic and political development of the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	Western leaders insisted Serbia would be excluded from such  
plans as long as Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic remains in 
power. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot start giving money to a regime that has perpetrated  
brutality and barbarism and the Serbian people must understand 
that,'' said British Prime Minister Tony Blair. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the evidence of atrocities NATO troops are finding  
as they fan out through Kosovo was ``even worse than we imagined,'' 
and he expressed confidence Milosevic would be brought to book for 
the misdeeds of his troops. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as he remains at large, there is no statute of  
limitations, and if I were in his position, I wouldn't take too 
much comfort from that,'' Clinton told CNN. 
</P>
<P>
	G-8 leaders were upbeat on latest news from Kosovo as NATO  
declared all Serb forces had withdrawn ahead of schedule and the 
ethnic Albanian rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army agreed to hand 
over their heavy weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very good about where we're going with this now,''  
Clinton said. ``I'm leaving here with real confidence that we are 
going to succeed in achieving all of our objectives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He acknowledged small groups of ``disgruntled'' Serbs or  
Albanians could pose a threat to troops in the international force, 
but said he did not expect deadly attacks like those against 
American peacekeepers in Somalia or Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't tell the American people there will not be any violent  
incident that no American will ever be harmed or killed. But I can 
say that we have learned the lessons of the last several years,'' 
the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	The G-8 leaders also looked at world economic issues, issuing a  
statement backing Russia's efforts to get relief from its burden of 
$69 billion in Soviet-era debt.

<HEADLINE> Kings Land Proven Scorer in Palffy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Ziggy Palffy knew the New York Islanders were  
slashing their budget, so it was only a matter of where, not when, 
the right wing would go. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Kings were only too happy to acquire Palffy, a  
proven scorer and star player they hope will attract fans next 
season when the team moves into the new downtown Staples Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really happy now and I can't wait to go play hockey  
again,'' Palffy said Monday in a conference call from New York. 
``They try to build a good team and I want to be part of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The six-player deal completed Sunday sends Palffy, center Bryan  
Smolinski, goaltender Marcel Cousineau and a 1999 fourth-round 
draft choice from the Islanders to Los Angeles in exchange for 
forwards Olli Jokinen and Josh Green, defenseman Mathieu Biron and 
the Kings' first round choice in this month's entry draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ziggy's a marquee player who generates excitement each time he  
touches the puck,'' Kings general manager Dave Taylor said. ``Ziggy 
Palffy is a proven NHL scorer and a true gamebreaker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings increased their payroll by $6 million to sign Palffy,  
and Taylor said it was no problem convincing the owners to approve 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	That wasn't the case in New York.  
</P>
<P>
	Palffy, the Islanders' leading scorer last season with 22 goals  
and 28 assists in 50 games, has four more years and $24 million to 
be paid on a contract he signed last December. He missed 32 games 
because of a contract dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard because everything is about money,'' he said.  
``Owners don't want to spend any money on the hockey, so they're 
going to trade players who make $1 million. I was ready for 
anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palffy, 27, was a two-time All Star and had three 40-goal  
seasons, but never made the playoffs in five seasons with the 
Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade reunites Palffy with Kings center Jozef Stumpel, a  
fellow Slovak who played youth hockey with Palffy and remains his 
close friend. The duo could end up on the same line, along with Luc 
Robitaille, under new coach Andy Murray. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to play offense and score goals and make a play for  
other guys,'' Palffy said. ``Hockey is two ways, so I'm playing 
anything what the coach wants to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now that his future is secure, Palffy's biggest dilemma is  
selling the New York house he moved into three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you can find somebody who can buy it from me, I'd  
appreciate it,'' he joked.

<HEADLINE> Court Upholds Texas Death Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Jurors choosing between life and death for  
convicted murderers do not have to be told what happens if they 
cannot agree, the Supreme Court ruled Monday as it upheld a Texas 
killer's federal death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	By a 5-4 vote, the justices ruled that Louis Jones' death  
sentence for a 1995 murder at an Air Force base is valid. Jones 
became the first person in the nation condemned under a 1994 
federal death penalty law, and Monday's ruling marked the first 
time the Supreme Court studied that law. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the federal death penalty law was at issue, but the  
decision means the 38 states with capital punishment laws also have 
no constitutional duty to tell jurors the consequences of their 
failure to reach a unanimous decision on punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a capital sentencing proceeding, the government has a  
strong interest in having the jury express the conscience of the 
community on the ultimate question of life or death,'' Justice 
Clarence Thomas wrote for the court. ``A charge to the jury of the 
sort proposed by (Jones) might well have the effect of undermining 
this strong governmental interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones had argued that jurors should have been told he would be  
sentenced to life in prison without chance of parole, as provided 
for in the 1994 law, if they could not reach unanimous agreement on 
his punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	The court also rejected Jones' arguments that the trial judge's  
sentencing instructions to the jury were so confusing they violated 
his 8th Amendment protection against cruel and unusual punishment 
and his due-process rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones failed as well in his attempt to convince the court that  
some of the aggravating factors the sentencing jury considered were 
too broad and too vague to be valid. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if they were, Thomas said, ``the error was harmless.''  
</P>
<P>
	He was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices  
Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter  
and Stephen G. Breyer dissented. ``The misinformation rendered the 
jury's death verdict unreliable,'' Ginsburg wrote for the four. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones killed Tracie Joy McBride, a 19-year-old Army private at  
Goodfellow Air Force Base in San Angelo, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who had retired from the Army in 1993 after a 22-year  
career, confessed to abducting McBride from an on-base laundry room 
and taking her to his home. He said he later took her to an 
isolated area about 20 miles from the city and beat her to death 
with a tire iron. 
</P>
<P>
	He led police to McBride's body.

<HEADLINE> Galarraga Says Cancer Almost Beaten </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Atlanta Braves first baseman Andres  
Galarraga said Monday he's almost won his battle with cancer and he 
expects to start working out by September. 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga, 38, said radiation treatments have destroyed 98  
percent of the tumor, which had been pressing against his spine's 
third vertebra. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very good,'' Galarraga said during a news conference.  
``It was very difficult, but thank God I am here in Venezuela.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said his radiation treatments will be over in July and he  
should be training with the Braves as early as late August. He 
probably won't play in games until next season 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga's face was puffy and his hair was short and thin. He  
said his bones, weakened by radiation, will not be ready for 
intense weight training for several months. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doctors have recommended that I don't take any batting  
practice so that I can avoid breaking a bone,'' Galarraga said. 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga had back pain throughout last season, which caused him  
to miss several games, including the All-Star game. He was the 
Braves' top hitter last season with a .305 average, 44 homers and 
121 RBIs.

<HEADLINE> Agassi Bids for Back-to-Back Titles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Despite what Andre Agassi once claimed  
in a commercial, his image is no longer everything. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent results support Agassi's reputation as one of the game's  
most talented players. At the French Open two weeks ago, he became 
just the fifth man to complete a career Grand Slam. 
</P>
<P>
	Now comes Wimbledon, where Agassi plays his opening match  
Tuesday. He'll try to become the first man since Bjorn Borg in 1980 
to win the French Open and Wimbledon in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can happen,'' said Agassi, seeded fourth. ``I've stopped  
telling myself things can't be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This could be Agassi's best shot at Wimbledon since he won the  
tournament for his first major title in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously he'd like to join Borg,'' said Agassi's coach, Brad  
Gilbert. ``That's incredible company. Hopefully, his performance in 
Paris will inspire him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the tournament scheduled to begin today, London oddsmakers  
listed Agassi as a 16-1 choice. Those with lower odds included 
five-time Wimbledon champion Pete Sampras, Richard Krajicek, 
Patrick Rafter and two Brits, Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the women, top-ranked Martina Hingis was the 6-4 favorite,  
followed by Steffi Graf, Venus Williams, Lindsay Davenport, Monica 
Seles and defending champion Jana Novotna. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi's opening match will be against Andrei Pavel, a Romanian  
ranked 66th. Other potential obstacles: 
</P>
<P>
	--A fourth-round rematch against Tommy Haas, who upset Agassi at  
Wimbledon last year; 
</P>
<P>
	--1996 champion Krajicek in the quarterfinals;  
</P>
<P>
	--Rafter or three-time runner-up Goran Ivanisevic in the  
semifinals; 
</P>
<P>
	--Sampras, Henman or Rusedski in the final.  
</P>
<P>
	Since winning Wimbledon seven years ago, Agassi's career has  
been like a series of topspin lobs: up and down. 
</P>
<P>
	He was an unseeded U.S. Open champion in 1994, rose to the No. 1  
ranking and then fell to No. 141. He failed to reach a Grand Slam 
quarterfinal for 2 1/2 years before winning the French, where he 
rallied past Andrei Medvedev in the dramatic final. 
</P>
<P>
	``People lost faith in what I could do, and understandably so,''  
Agassi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, at 29, he claims to be playing the best tennis of his life.  
And he said this career comeback will be his last. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no more energy to go down and come back up again,'' he  
said. ``I'm going to ride this one as long as I can. I know I won't 
have many more years to enjoy this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Early in his career, Agassi refused to play Wimbledon because of  
an aversion to grass courts. He has won only one match at the All 
England Club since 1995, but nonetheless appreciates the unique 
challenge the tournament presents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a different appreciation for it now, no question,'' he  
said. ``You're part of something that seems bigger than the 
sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Curiously, Agassi's recent resurgence coincides with the breakup  
of his marriage to actress Brooke Shields. The couple remains 
friends and spoke by telephone daily during the French Open. 
Gilbert suggests that personal turmoil contributed to Agassi's 
renewed focus on tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have some things going on in your life, it's nice to  
come back to something that's been good to you,'' Gilbert said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Andre has always had the game. The problem has been his brain.  
As long as he's hungry and has the passion, he's going to play 
well.''

<HEADLINE> Jeter Leads in All-Star Voting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Derek Jeter's lead over Nomar Garciaparra in  
balloting to start at shortstop for the American League in next 
month's All-Star game was cut to less than 8,000 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter, the leading hitter on the World Series champion New York  
Yankees with a .377 average, had 378,587 votes in totals released 
Monday by the commissioner's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra, hitting .339 for the Boston Red Sox, had 370,656  
votes and trailed by 7,931. Last week, Jeter led by 14,964. 
</P>
<P>
	Voting continues through Sunday, with AL starters to be  
announced July 5. The All-Star game is scheduled for Fenway Park on 
July 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore's Cal Ripken still leads at third base (486,344) and  
is on track for his 17th consecutive All-Star appearance and 16th 
straight start. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, who led balloting in 1992 and '95, would tie Rod Carew  
as the only players elected to start 15 times -- in 1988 Alan 
Trammell was elected but got hurt and Ripken started in his place. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle's Ken Griffey Jr. remained the overall leader in voting,  
topping outfielders at 1,224,553. He was followed by three 
Cleveland Indians: Manny Ramirez (707,330), Kenny Lofton (623,540) 
and David Justice (480,696). 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey was the AL's leading vote-getter in 1991 and 1993 and  
led all players in 1994, 1996, 1997 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other Indians maintained leads at their positions: first  
baseman Jim Thome (442,083) and second baseman Roberto Alomar 
(1,082,221). 
</P>
<P>
	Ivan Rodriguez of Texas (785,979) leads at catcher, and Jose  
Canseco of Tampa Bay (648,741), who began the day leading the major 
leagues with 27 home runs, topped designated hitters. 
</P>
<P>
	An update on NL voting will be released Tuesday, and NL starters  
will be announced July 6.

<HEADLINE>  Stephen King Alert After Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEWISTON, Maine (AP) -- Stephen King was conscious, alert and  
even cracking jokes following an operation to treat a shattered leg 
other injuries he suffered when he was struck by a van. But he will 
probably be in rehabilitation for months, his office said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The prolific, best-selling horror author remained in serious but  
stable condition today at Central Maine Medical Center, hospital 
officials said. King, 51, faced additional surgery this afternoon 
on his leg and hip, with more surgery tentatively scheduled for 
later in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been alert and he's in pretty good spirits,'' Chuck Gill,  
the hospital's vice president, said earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital spokesman Laird Covey said King had been talking with  
his wife, Tabitha, adding, ``I know that he has been cracking some 
jokes to the staff about his condition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A statement released by King's office in Bangor said he will  
remain at the Lewiston hospital for two or three weeks and require 
``major rehabilitation'' over the next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. King's mental state is great -- the accident has not  
affected him mentally,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said King was thrown 14 feet when he was hit Saturday  
by a Dodge Caravan in rural Lovell, where he owns a summer home. 
Lovell is about 115 miles southwest of Bangor. 
</P>
<P>
	King was walking south on the shoulder of the road at about 4:30  
p.m. when a motorist approaching from behind lost control of his 
vehicle after his dog got loose inside the van, Oxford County 
Sheriff's deputy Matt Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver stopped immediately after striking King, according to  
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was hurting, but he was able to communicate,'' said Baker,  
who responded to the accident. ``He was talking to me. He gave me 
phone numbers of where to call his family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He was in a lot of pain,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Gill said King suffered a collapsed lung and multiple fractures  
of the right leg and hip. He was also treated during surgery for a 
scalp laceration. 
</P>
<P>
	According to witnesses, the driver, Bryan Smith, 41, did not  
appear to be speeding, Matt Baker said. He said no charges will be 
filed against Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	King, who lives in Bangor, may have been on one of his daily  
long walks at his summer home when he was struck, Covey said. 
</P>
<P>
	King has written more than two dozen novels, including ``The  
Shining,'' ``Carrie,'' and ``Pet Sematary.'' His story ``Misery'' 
is about a writer laid up in a car accident. His ``The Girl Who 
Loved Tom Gordon'' was on several best seller lists this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital has been deluged with calls wishing King well.  
</P>
<P>
	``We heard from the Times of London,'' Gill said. ``We've had  
people wanting to know where to send flowers and cards. We've had 
calls from all over the world from both his fans and the media.''

<HEADLINE> NATO, KLA Agree on Demilitarization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Kosovo Albanian rebels signed a  
demilitarization pact with NATO today, allowing the peacekeeping 
force to tighten its control over the province and try to prevent a 
backlash of ethnic violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The pact aims to neutralize the Kosovo Liberation Army as a  
military force. It was signed just after midnight, hours after the 
last of some 40,000 Serb forces left the Yugoslav province. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a new epoch beginning for the people of Kosovo,''  
said the KLA's political leader, Hashim Thaci, who signed the 
agreement in a tent at the field headquarters of British Lt. Gen. 
Mike Jackson, commander of allied forces in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The role of the KLA has become a critical issue in postwar  
Kosovo. About 50,000 Serbs have fled the province over the past 
week, fearing the guerrillas would exact revenge for Serb killings 
and atrocities as well as the mass expulsions of some 860,000 
ethnic Albanians since March. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to take a lot of leadership and a lot of  
self-discipline for the folks who come home not to retaliate, but 
they should not do it,'' President Clinton said today at a summit 
in Cologne, Germany. ``It won't, in the end, satisfy anyone. It 
will only compound the horror.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, effective immediately, calls for the KLA to leave  
its checkpoints, halt military and security activities and put 
their weapons in storage sites verified by NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels also agreed not to use explosives and to clear  
minefields and boobytraps within seven days. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson brushed aside concerns that the KLA leadership wouldn't  
be able to make its fighters comply. He said negotiators took pains 
to make sure all commanders were on board. 
</P>
<P>
	The general told ABC's ``Good Morning America'': ``The KLA know  
what they have undertaken to do and I have powers to make sure they 
do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if NATO and the 20,000 or so forces it now has in Kosovo  
are in control: ``We are everywhere in Kosovo. I have the sole 
authority for military force. ... What I can't do is offer a 
perfection. That is impossible in this relatively volatile 
situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thaci said the rebels understood the agreement meant giving up  
their fight for Kosovo's independence. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we started our resistance, we started our fight for  
independence,'' he said. ``However, in Rambouillet we signed an 
agreement, and we will respect that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement the KLA signed last March in Rambouillet, France,  
would have granted Kosovo's 2.1 million populace autonomy for at 
least three years but kept it within Yugoslavia's dominant republic 
of Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Only hours before signing the KLA demilitarization agreement,  
Jackson received confirmation that all Yugoslav forces had 
withdrawn from Kosovo. That allowed NATO to officially end its air 
campaign, which began March 24 and was suspended June 10 pending 
total withdrawal of Serb forces. 
</P>
<P>
	As Yugoslav troops were withdrawing, the KLA became increasingly  
bold, setting up headquarters in Pristina, the Kosovo capital; 
establishing a self-appointed police force in Prizren, Kosovo's 
second-largest city; and making armed members visible throughout 
the province. 
</P>
<P>
	The ensuing flight of Serbs has been a visible sign of defeat  
for President Slobodan Milosevic, and his government has pressured 
them to return to Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the government organized convoys that the official  
Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said brought 2,000 Serbs back to 
Kosovo. State-run RTS television repeatedly broadcast government 
statements insisting it was safe for Serbs to return and that the 
allied forces would protect them. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, a convoy of 150 people headed back into Kosovo from the  
Serb city of Kragujevac and 50 vehicles left from Krusevac, 
Belgrade news media reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Local police in the small Yugoslav republic of Montenegro said  
70 people were heading back toward Kosovo in 15 cars and a truck. 
However, the private news agency Beta reported that 800 Serb 
refugees in the city of Mladenovac near Belgrade refused Sunday to 
go back to Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 200 Serbs who had just arrived from Kosovo staged a brief  
demonstration in Belgrade on Sunday. They were jeered by onlookers. 
``Why did you have to flee? Slobo said you can stay!'' an elderly 
woman shouted at demonstrators, using Milosevic's nickname. 
</P>
<P>
	Police tried to break up a similar demonstration of several  
hundred people in Belgrade today, telling them the protest was 
banned and ordering them to disperse. 
</P>
<P>
	Pristina showed its tensions Sunday. One person was killed in a  
10-minute gun battle in a suburb, according to Beta, and the city 
center was rocked in when an explosive device detonated in a 
Pristina University courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
	So were other parts of Kosovo. In the northern city of  
Mitrovica, French paratroopers held back an angry crowd of ethnic 
Albanians trying to get into an apartment complex where Serb 
families still live. 
</P>
<P>
	``They burned our houses. They broke my ribs!'' shouted Fehmi  
Sahiti. ``Why should they live here in comfort?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators for the international war crimes tribunal were  
inspecting sites of alleged atrocities. British officials have 
estimated at least 10,000 ethnic Albanians were killed in Serb 
massacres, and that 90 mass graves dot Kosovo's forests. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic Albanians, meanwhile, continued filtered back into towns  
where Serb forces rampaged in past weeks. The U.N. refugee agency 
said today that 137,000 refugees -- half of whom fled to Albania and 
a significant number to Macedonia as well -- are now back home.

<HEADLINE>  Asian Stock Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets closed higher Monday,  
with the key index in Hong Kong surging more than 4 percent after 
the government announced that it will sell stocks it bought 10 
months ago to prop up the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hong Kong market's Hang Seng Index rose 585.96 points, or  
4.4 percent, closing at 13,994.23, its highest level since Oct. 13, 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hong Kong government said it plans to put the U.S. $15.1  
billion blue-chip stocks it bought in August into mutual funds and 
sell them. 
</P>
<P>
	Ti-liang Yang, chairman of Exchange Fund Investment Ltd., which  
was set up to manage the government's shareholdings, said the sale 
of the mutual funds, called unit trusts, would be carried out ``in 
an orderly manner without disrupting the market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The news eased fears that those shares, now valued at more than  
U.S. $26 billion, will be dumped onto the market directly. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in Tokyo soared to their highest level since  
October 1997 amid strong buying from overseas financial 
institutions, on hopes that the Japanese economy is finally picking 
up steam. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 307.59 points,  
or 1.76 percent, ending the day at 17,738.85. On Friday, the 
average fell 39.19 points, or 0.22 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	During a three-day meeting of the Group of Seven major  
industrialized nations, which ended Sunday in Cologne, Germany, 
other leaders urged Japan to do more to ensure it is on a 
domestic-led growth path. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said that the Japanese government  
will take every measure available to ensure stable growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar rose sharply against the yen  
following what traders believed was dollar-buying intervention by 
the Bank of Japan to push down the Japanese currency. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 122.34 yen in the late afternoon, up  
3.02 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late Friday 
level in New York of 120.44 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In Seoul, the key index rose 3.7 percent as concerns eased over  
a possible increase in U.S. interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 31.27 points to close  
at 869.00, its highest level since June 19, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Thai shares also soared on buying from local speculative  
investors, who were in a buoyant mood given the strong performance 
across the region's bourses and declining interest rates at home. 
The SET index rose 19.55 points, or 3.8 percent, to 538.36. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Shares closed sharply higher, boosted by  
better-than-expected May trade data. The benchmark Straits Times 
Index rose 2.4 percent, or 49.75 points, to close at 2,120.38. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed higher on heavy buying of select  
electronics issues. The market's key Weighted Stock Price Index 
rose 139.12 points, or 1.7 percent, to 8,413.48. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed slightly lower. The  
benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index slipped 1.91 points, or 0.09 
percent, to 2,089.90. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed higher, boosted by the latest  
rate cuts by the central bank. The Philippine Stock Exchange index 
of 30 selected companies rose 18.98 points, or 0.7 percent, to 
2,448.62. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: The Australian stock market closed slightly lower  
following a late bout of profit-taking. The All Ordinaries Index 
fell 3.3 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,981.7. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares closed higher on continued blue-chip  
buying. The Composite Index rose 1.2 percent, or 8.576 points, to 
716.460 points. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed slightly lower. The  
Composite Index slipped 0.6 points to 786.02.

<HEADLINE> Cisneros Seeks To Quash Tapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorneys for former Housing Secretary Henry  
Cisneros pressed their case in court today to thwart prosecutors' 
use of 88 tapes of telephone conversations secretly recorded by his 
ex-mistress. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros lawyer Barry Simon, at a pretrial hearing today, said  
the government's special prosecutors are ``not entitled to put on 
tampered, inauthentic evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The tapes shouldn't come in,'' Simon said.  
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Mark Jackowski acknowledged that Linda Jones had  
deleted portions of some taped conversations that included threats 
to Cisneros, mentioned other people or discussed aspects of their 
sex life. 
</P>
<P>
	``She just edited out these offensive passages or what she  
believed to be offensive passages,'' Jackowski said, adding that 
she destroyed the originals after copies were made. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said only five of the 33 tapes the government intends to  
use at Cisneros' September trial were altered. The government wants 
to use the tapes to corroborate witness testimony that the former 
Cabinet officer conspired with his one-time lover to conceal his 
``hush money'' payments to her, which exceeded $264,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors summoned Ms. Jones to the stand today to explain her  
relationship with Cisneros, how the payments began and when she 
initiated the taping. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying she was ``devastated'' when word of their extramarital  
affair appeared in the media, Ms. Jones said Cisneros agreed to pay 
her $3,000 monthly, later raised to $4,000, after her marriage and 
career foundered amid the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knew all of the press stories were his fault,'' said a  
poised Ms. Jones, who was transferred from the prison facility 
where she is incarcerated to testify. Her appearance came on her 
50th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros was not in court.  
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros' lawyers also are pressing for a defense psychiatric  
examination of Ms. Jones. She has acknowledged a years-long bout 
with depression, addiction to antidepressant medication and a 
suicide attempt.

	Ms. Jones is serving a 3 1/2-year prison sentence at a federal  
medical facility in Fort Worth, Texas. She pleaded guilty last year 
to 28 counts involving fraud, conspiracy, money laundering and 
obstruction after becoming a target herself of Independent Counsel 
David Barrett. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros, a former San Antonio mayor who served as housing and  
urban development secretary from 1993 to 1996, was indicted in 
December 1997 on 18 felony counts of conspiracy, obstructing 
justice and making false statements to the FBI about the payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he acknowledged providing financial support for Ms.  
Jones, prosecutors have said Cisneros falsely told the FBI during 
his Cabinet background check that he never paid her more than 
$2,500 at one time or more than $10,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment alleges that he paid her more than $264,000  
between 1990 and 1993, in installments as high as $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros has pleaded innocent, as have his co-defendants, former  
aides Sylvia Arce-Garcia and John Rosales. The two, who accompanied 
Cisneros from San Antonio to Washington, are charged with 
conspiring with their boss to conceal the payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros is the second former Clinton administration Cabinet  
member to be indicted on criminal charges. Former Agriculture 
Secretary Mike Espy was acquitted in December of all 30 counts 
involving gifts he accepted from a California agricultural 
cooperative and others.

<HEADLINE> McKesson Fires Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- McKesson HBOC fired its chairman today and  
accepted the resignations of its chief executive and chief 
financial officer less than two months after accounting problems 
forced it to restate earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Its share price skidded 4.3 percent by midday, dropping $1.56 1/4  
to $34.50 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	McKesson HBOC is the largest pharmaceutical supply management  
and health care information technology company in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	McKesson acquired software maker HBOC in January in a deal  
widely criticized by analysts who follow the drug distributor. HBO 
sells computer software to help health care providers manage their 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings restatements reflected improperly recorded software  
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	McKesson's board said it fired chairman Charles W. McCall and  
said Mark A. Pulido, president and chief executive, and Richard H. 
Hawkins, its chief financial officer, have resigned effective July 
15. 
</P>
<P>
	John H. Hammergren, president of the company's supply management  
unit, and David L. Mahoney, president of pharmaceutical services, 
were appointed co-chief executive officers and named to the board. 
Controller Heidi E. Yodowitz was named acting chief financial 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``These changes reflect our need to move the company forward as  
quickly as possible,'' board member Alan Seelenfreund said in a 
statement. ``Under the circumstances, strong leadership is 
essential to this effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On April 28, the health care company said it would be forced to  
revise its fourth-quarter and 1998 earnings reports because it had 
improperly recorded software sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said transactions of $26.2 million in the company's  
fourth quarter ended March 31, and $16 million in prior quarters, 
were improperly counted because they were subject to contingencies. 
</P>
<P>
	A week earlier, McKesson HBOC had reported a net loss of $60.4  
million, or 22 cents per share, for the quarter ended March 31, and 
had net income of $237.1 million, or 84 cents per share, for the 
full year. 
</P>
<P>
	But after the April 28 restatement, the company said it lost 27  
per cents for the quarter and reduced full-year earnings to 75 
cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	McKesson's shares plummeted nearly 50 percent to $34.50 after  
the restatement. The stock's 52-week high had been $89.75. 
</P>
<P>
	In late May, McKesson HBOC said it would revise its fiscal 1999  
earnings downward after discovering more accounting problems at 
HBO. 
</P>
<P>
	McKesson did not offer specific revisions, other than to say the  
restatement may also affect previous years' earnings reports. 
</P>
<P>
	At least four law firms have been retained by investors to  
consider a class-action suit alleging that false statements 
artificially inflated the profits of McKesson HBOC.

<HEADLINE> McKesson Ousts Top Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- McKesson HBOC Inc. ousted its top  
management on Monday, trying to contain damage from accounting 
problems that have eroded the value of its stock by nearly 50 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The board fired chairman Charles W. McCall, who was chairman of  
HBO &AMP; Co. before McKesson, a major wholesaler of drugs and medical 
supplies, bought the medical software company in January. His 
ouster removes the person seen as most responsible for earnings 
reports that had improperly recorded software sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The top executives from McKesson got slightly gentler treatment:  
Mark A. Pulido, president and chief executive of the merged 
company, and chief financial officer Richard H. Hawkins were 
allowed to resign, effective July 15. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a positive step because they really needed to clean  
house. Somebody needed to take the blame,'' said Mike Krensavage, a 
Brown Brothers Harriman &AMP; Co. analyst. ``It's a step in the 
direction the company needs to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of McKesson HBOC fell nearly 50 percent when it announced  
on April 28 it would have to restate some of its earnings reports. 
</P>
<P>
	McKesson has been unable to recover from that blow. On Monday,  
shares of the San Francisco-based company fell $2.31 1/4 to $33.75 in 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, well off their 52-week high 
of $89.75. 
</P>
<P>
	The company still can't report bona fide numbers, despite an  
exhaustive audit. McKesson said Monday it will miss a June 30 
deadline for submitting its annual report. Previously, it said it 
will have to revise earnings reports for 1999, 1998 and possibly 
previous years as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Under the circumstances, strong leadership is essential,''  
said board member Alan Seelenfreund, who was named non-executive 
chairman. ``These changes reflect our need to move the company 
forward as quickly as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several of Pulido's lieutenants were promoted to top jobs. John  
H. Hammergren, president of the company's supply management unit, 
and David L. Mahoney, president of pharmaceutical services, were 
appointed co-chief executive officers and named to the board. 
Controller Heidi E. Yodowitz was named acting chief financial 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors are still considering class-action lawsuits alleging  
that HBOC, now McKesson's Information Technology Business unit, 
artificially inflated its profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The problems stem from side letters that told customers not to  
pay the total purchase price for business-management software 
unless HBO met a series of contingencies. Despite these letters, 
HBO apparently claimed the total price had been paid, thereby 
inflating its earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Seelenfreund said Monday that the existence of the contingencies  
and side letters had been improperly concealed from McKesson's due 
diligence teams before the $12 billion merger was consummated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would even term that fraudulent,'' said Joseph Chiarelli, an  
analyst with J.P. Morgan. He said the side deals ``would not be the 
easiest thing in the world to find.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chiarelli said J.P. Morgan's own questioning of HBO's customers  
did determine the sales had taken place, although the purchase 
prices may have been claimed prematurely. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Andersen was HBOC's accountant before the merger, though  
the merged company now uses Deloitte &AMP; Touche. Andersen, which last 
audited HBOC on Dec. 31, 1997, is cooperating with McKesson's 
effort to restate the earnings, spokeswoman Jane Ostrander said. 
</P>
<P>
	Accounting standards for the software industry changed in 1998,  
restricting firms from claiming profits more than a year before 
getting paid in full, said Larry Marsh, who follows the company for 
Lehman Brothers. ``I think that there were very loose standards 
used in a lot of this industry,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The real issue is whether McKesson HBOC can deliver its products  
on time, Chiarelli said. Despite all the financial questions, he 
said he's seen no evidence that the company can't produce what it 
promises. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they're able to do that,'' he said, ``much of these  
issues will get resolved.''

<HEADLINE>  Asian Stock Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets closed higher Monday,  
with the key index in Hong Kong surging more than 4 percent after 
the government announced that it will sell stocks it bought 10 
months ago to prop up the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hong Kong market's Hang Seng Index rose 585.96 points, or  
4.4 percent, closing at 13,994.23, its highest level since Oct. 13, 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hong Kong government said it plans to put the U.S. $15.1  
billion blue-chip stocks it bought in August into mutual funds and 
sell them. 
</P>
<P>
	Ti-liang Yang, chairman of Exchange Fund Investment Ltd., which  
was set up to manage the government's shareholdings, said the sale 
of the mutual funds, called unit trusts, would be carried out ``in 
an orderly manner without disrupting the market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The news eased fears that those shares, now valued at more than  
U.S. $26 billion, will be dumped onto the market directly. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in Tokyo soared to their highest level since  
October 1997 amid strong buying from overseas financial 
institutions, on hopes that the Japanese economy is finally picking 
up steam. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 307.59 points,  
or 1.76 percent, ending the day at 17,738.85. On Friday, the 
average fell 39.19 points, or 0.22 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	During a three-day meeting of the Group of Seven major  
industrialized nations, which ended Sunday in Cologne, Germany, 
other leaders urged Japan to do more to ensure it is on a 
domestic-led growth path. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said that the Japanese government  
will take every measure available to ensure stable growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar rose sharply against the yen  
following what traders believed was dollar-buying intervention by 
the Bank of Japan to push down the Japanese currency. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 122.34 yen in the late afternoon, up  
3.02 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late Friday 
level in New York of 120.44 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In Seoul, the key index rose 3.7 percent as concerns eased over  
a possible increase in U.S. interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 31.27 points to close  
at 869.00, its highest level since June 19, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Thai shares also soared on buying from local speculative  
investors, who were in a buoyant mood given the strong performance 
across the region's bourses and declining interest rates at home. 
The SET index rose 19.55 points, or 3.8 percent, to 538.36. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Shares closed sharply higher, boosted by  
better-than-expected May trade data. The benchmark Straits Times 
Index rose 2.4 percent, or 49.75 points, to close at 2,120.38. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed higher on heavy buying of select  
electronics issues. The market's key Weighted Stock Price Index 
rose 139.12 points, or 1.7 percent, to 8,413.48. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed slightly lower. The  
benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index slipped 1.91 points, or 0.09 
percent, to 2,089.90. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed higher, boosted by the latest  
rate cuts by the central bank. The Philippine Stock Exchange index 
of 30 selected companies rose 18.98 points, or 0.7 percent, to 
2,448.62. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: The Australian stock market closed slightly lower  
following a late bout of profit-taking. The All Ordinaries Index 
fell 3.3 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,981.7. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares closed higher on continued blue-chip  
buying. The Composite Index rose 1.2 percent, or 8.576 points, to 
716.460 points.

<HEADLINE> Allergy Drug Hismanal Withdrawn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hismanal, a prescription antihistamine whose  
sales have steadily dropped in wake of warnings about serious side 
effects, is being pulled off the market, the manufacturer announced 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Janssen Pharmaceutica said the decision to stop selling Hismanal  
was a voluntary business decision, calling the allergy marketplace 
too crowded. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision is not a recall -- Hismanal supplies left on store  
shelves will continue to sell until supplies are gone, said 
spokesman Greg Panico. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would advise patients who currently are taking Hismanal to  
consult their physicians about treatment alternatives,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hismanal sales have dropped in recent years, in wake of repeated  
warnings from the Food and Drug Administration that the hay fever 
and hives medicine can cause potentially deadly side effects when 
taken together with other drugs -- and even when taken with 
grapefruit juice. 
</P>
<P>
	Early last year, when the FDA issued strong new warnings about  
Hismanal's risks, the drug accounted for just 3 percent of the 
antihistamine market. Still, that accounted for some 1 million 
prescriptions. Janssen did not release updated figures today, but 
experts say sales have continued to drop. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA did continue to receive scattered reports of side  
effects suffered by people who either had not heard the warnings or 
not heeded them. Some critics had wondered why Hismanal continued 
to sell when the competing antihistamine Seldane was pulled off the 
market last year for similar side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Seldane case, the FDA had approved a safer substitute --  
the exact same chemical but revamped to be safer. There was no 
safer substitute for Hismanal, said FDA's Dr. John Jenkins. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, ``we clearly were continuing to evaluate the safety of  
Hismanal and continued to have concerns,'' Jenkins added. ``We 
certainly support Janssen's voluntary decision to stop marketing.''

<HEADLINE> Chess Champion Plays an Online Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- World chess champion Garry Kasparov took on the  
whole world Monday, making the first move in an online match 
against anyone who has access to the Internet and understands the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where else but on the Internet can you play the world  
champion?'' the 36-year-old Russian grandmaster said. 
</P>
<P>
	The interactive chess tournament is called ``Kasparov vs. the  
World.'' Before each move is actually played, Internet enthusiasts 
will vote via computer to decide what move the ``World Team'' will 
make. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasparov, who is based in Moscow, struck a deal with Microsoft  
Corp. to play the match at www.msn.com. Terms of the deal were not 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	In front of an audience of young chess fans in Bryant Park,  
Kasparov simulated his online opening move, king pawn to E4, on a 
giant board. The Web site immediately began fielding countermoves 
from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors to the site have 24 hours to vote for their side's  
move. Kasparov will then reply within another 24 hours, and so on, 
until the conclusion of the match, expected to take most of the 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament is being guided by five young chess experts who  
are suggesting their own possible moves and tactics against 
Kasparov. 
</P>
<P>
	``This match will be fun for everyone, from grandmasters to  
casual players,'' Kasparov said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, Kasparov, billed as the greatest chess player  
ever, lost to an IBM computer. He said this cutting-edge encounter 
``is a more pleasant event for the human race.''

<HEADLINE> Confusion in Medicaid Fraud Probes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Medicaid managed care plans are subject to the  
same types of fraud and abuse that threaten traditional Medicaid 
programs, along with confusion over who is responsible for 
detecting and referring cases, government auditors reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Health and Human Services Department's inspector general  
found that in a study of 10 states using managed care for 
recipients of Medicaid, the health program for the poor, most state 
agencies reported limited oversight and fraud identification 
efforts and few said they reviewed the efforts by managed care 
organizations to check for fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although requirements exist for detection and investigation of  
claims related fraud cases occurring in traditional Medicaid 
programs, there have been few requirements developed to 
specifically address fraud detection and referral in the managed 
care setting,'' the auditors concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	The report called on the Health Care Financing Administration to  
establish guidelines that spell out the specific roles of state 
agencies, managed care plans and fraud control units in detecting 
abuse and fraud. The report also recommended that states monitor 
managed care organizations to make sure they are complying with the 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	``As managed care plans provide medical services for more and  
more individuals who are on Medicaid, we must work closely with the 
managed care organizations and state agencies to ensure that they 
are fully equipped to deal with emerging fraud and abuse 
problems,'' House Commerce Committee Chairman Tom Bliley, R-Va., 
said in response to the report's findings. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the report, many of the same types of fraud found  
in traditional Medicaid programs -- kickbacks, billing for services 
not rendered and duplicate billing -- exist in managed care plans as 
well. In addition, it said, Medicaid managed care plans are open to 
such abuses as enrollment fraud or failing to provide necessary 
covered medical care to recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Medicaid's traditional fee-for-service method of paying  
doctor and hospital bills, state agencies must have a unit that 
conducts post-payment reviews of claims to look for any aberrations 
or potential fraud. But for states with special waivers that enable 
them to place Medicaid recipients in managed care plans, there are 
few guidelines that spell out which party is responsible, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Medicaid state agencies indicated that they do not believe  
it is their responsibility to detect and refer cases of fraud, and 
some said they did not want to duplicate efforts with managed care 
organizations. But some of the managed care plans said they 
believed that it was the state's role -- and not theirs -- to detect 
potential fraud and abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of all those surveyed, including state agencies,  
fraud units and managed care organizations, say they do not have 
appropriate guidelines on how to detect potential fraud or abuse 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The report highlighted the efforts of Tennessee and Arizona for  
their proactive efforts to detect fraud in Medicaid managed care 
plans. Those states conduct training for managed care plans and 
meet with the organizations regularly to discuss potential fraud 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Arizona and Tennessee, the states studied were Delaware,  
Hawaii, Minnesota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island and 
Vermont.

<HEADLINE> Stewart: I Thought About My Father  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- Payne Stewart stood in front of the  
television and cried his eyes out. Ahead lay the crucible of 
another U.S. Open. What made tears flow, though, was something lost 
in his past. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before I came to the course today, NBC ran a piece about  
myself and my father,'' Stewart said. ``I just stood there and 
bawled. I thought a lot about my father. I probably got a lot of 
strength from that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Stewart was a furniture salesman who went out the door  
some mornings wearing a canary yellow sport coat on the theory that 
it was better to have a customer remember you for something than 
not at all. 
</P>
<P>
	But he never had to impress more than a half-dozen people at  
once. And when his oldest son stood over a 15-foot par putt on the 
last green Sunday at Pinehurst No. 2, the audience was several 
million times that. 
</P>
<P>
	But this time, it wasn't so much about inviting attention as  
proving he was worthy of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that I learned a lot from last year,'' he said. ``If  
you can learn from defeat, I think it makes you a much stronger 
player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Failure, it turns out, changed Payne Stewart more than all his  
past success ever could. A year ago, on a shimmering Sunday at the 
Olympic Club near San Francisco, he began the final round four 
strokes clear of the field, then missed a birdie putt from that 
same 15 feet at the last hole to let the championship escape his 
grasp. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic is nicknamed the Graveyard of Champions because the same  
thing had happened to Ben Hogan in 1955, Arnold Palmer in 1966 and 
Tom Watson in 1987. And in the way that a curse hounds its victims 
through the years, none of the three ever got hold of another major 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	When Stewart walked away from that disappointment, he vowed it  
wouldn't bury him. As a steady drizzle ranked the Carolina 
sandhills, he made good on that promise. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I wanted to do,'' he said, ``was give myself a chance. I  
never gave up. I kept plugging and I kept playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Stewart, a two-time Missouri State Amateur champion,  
wouldn't have settled for anything less. When Payne was younger, 
his father had him stand on his shoes and then waltzed around the 
room teaching him to dance. William died in 1985, but he willed his 
son more than good footwork, a golf game and a taste for outlandish 
clothes. Resolve was a quality that topped the list. 
</P>
<P>
	When Stewart won his first major championship, the 1989 PGA, it  
was cast as much the result of fortune than fortitude. Everybody 
remembered Mike Reid slumped over his putter after dropping three 
strokes to par over the last two holes -- not Stewart tearing up 
Kemper Lakes' back nine in 31 and closing with a flurry of birdies. 
</P>
<P>
	Even his first U.S. Open win, at Hazeltine in 1991, had the feel  
of a man in the right place at the right time. Twice, eventual 
loser Scott Simpson let Stewart climb out of a two-stroke ditch 
over the final three holes -- first to earn a shot at the playoff on 
Sunday, then again to win the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	But there were no questions left by the end of this one.  
</P>
<P>
	Stewart began the day at 1 under par, one stroke ahead of Phil  
Mickelson and two ahead of Tiger Woods. Another stroke back was 
David Duval and Vijay Singh. Stewart knew one or two of them might 
flinch over the course of the afternoon on a layout as tough as 
this one. But he also knew he was going to have beat one or all of 
them himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, it was Mickelson, about to become a father himself,  
who pushed Stewart the hardest. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice on the back nine, the left-hander wrested the lead away.  
But he gave it back the final time at the 191-yard, par-3 17th. 
There, Mickelson hit his tee shot to 8 feet and Stewart to about 
half that distance. Mickelson missed his birdie try and Stewart 
made his, setting up the final act. 
</P>
<P>
	On 18, Stewart dumped his drive into the right rough, hacked it  
out with a 9-iron and then hit a lob wedge to 15 feet. Mickelson 
took the more conventional Open route -- hit the fairway, hit the 
green -- to 25 feet. Again, this time much more improbably, he 
missed and Stewart made. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have made a cool story for my daughter to read  
about,'' Mickelson said, ``but it's still something special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exactly how special Mickelson may not realize until he's  
actually raised a family of his own. 
</P>
<P>
	But Stewart had no problem remembering the feeling when someone  
asked him whether this victory would supplant his first win out on 
Tour -- the 1982 Quad Cities Open -- as his most cherished memory. 
</P>
<P>
	``That will never change,'' Stewart said, ``because my dad was  
there to see it.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Expected To OK UN Dues Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly $1 billion in delinquent U.S. payments  
to the United Nations would be authorized under a bill nearing 
Senate approval. But there's a string attached: a cut in future 
U.S. contributions to the world organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, expected to win Senate approval today, calls for a  
reduction in the U.S. share of the regular U.N. budget from the 
present 25 percent to 20 percent; and a drop in the share of 
peacekeeping operations from 31 percent to 25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange, the United Nations would get the long-delayed  
payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations has warned the United States that it will  
lose its General Assembly voting rights if at least $250 million of 
the back dues isn't paid by December. The United States has been 
late on its payments for the past 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
	By U.N. calculations, that leaves the United States $1.69  
billion in arrears, nearly 60 percent of the total debt owed to the 
185-nation organization. U.N. officials have complained that makes 
it hard for the United Nations to pay its own bills. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States disputes some of the arrears, but concedes  
owing at least $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The demands for a reduction in the U.S. share supporting the  
United Nations were the result of a compromise between Secretary of 
State Madeleine Albright and Senate leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright agreed to support the proposed cut in the U.S. share  
and, in exchange, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse 
Helms, R-N.C., agreed to back away from more ambitious demands for 
changes at the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Rod Grams, R-Minn., chairman of the Senate Foreign  
Relations subcommittee on international operations, on Monday 
called the United Nations ``a bloated bureaucracy'' and said that, 
without housekeeping reforms, ``the U.N. will collapse under its 
own weight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before voting on the overall bill, legislation authorizing a  
variety of State Department programs for fiscal 2000, the Senate 
was first expected to vote on an amendment by Sen. Paul Sarbanes, 
D-Md., to keep the U.S. share of the U.N. budget at its current 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not expected to pass.  
</P>
<P>
	The compromise bill would allow payments of $819 million in U.S.  
debts to the United Nations over three years and forgive $107 
million that the United Nations owes the United States; for a total 
of $916 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also calls for spending $3 billion over the next five  
years to beef up security at U.S. embassies around the world -- the 
same amount requested by the administration in the aftermath of 
last year's attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
	Veteran diplomat Richard Holbrooke, President Clinton's nominee  
to be U.N. ambassador, has voiced support for the lower U.S. share 
of the United Nations budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms' committee was holding a hearing with Holbrooke on Tuesday  
dealing with the U.N. payments issue. His long-delayed nomination 
is expected to be approved by the full Senate within a few weeks, 
both Republican and Democratic leaders predict. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss of a vote in the General Assembly would be an  
embarrassment, but it would not affect Washington's veto power in 
the Security Council, the most powerful decision-making body at the 
United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress authorized legislation last year that would have paid  
off much of the arrears. 
</P>
<P>
	But President Clinton vetoed the bill because it contained  
unrelated abortion restrictions.

<HEADLINE> Stern Wants To Deter Underclassmen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If David Stern gets his way, no one under a  
certain age, perhaps 20, will be allowed to play in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	The commissioner on Monday urged the players' union to agree on  
a minimum age or some other remedy to deter high school players and 
college freshmen and sophomores from entering the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``A rule that relates to the entry level status of a player, if  
fairly done, might encourage certain kids, whose lives are 
literally ruined because they get and follow bad advice, from 
making bad decisions,'' Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
	When the owners and players negotiated their collective  
bargaining agreement in January, they included a side letter 
calling for further talks on young players declaring themselves 
eligible for the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from an absolute age limit, the sides are considering  
adding additional years to the rookie wage scale for players 
younger than a certain age. 
</P>
<P>
	The union would like to see a year taken off the four-year scale  
for any player completing four years of college. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got an open mind on the subject,'' union director Billy  
Hunter said. ``It's obviously something we have to look at, along 
with the various ramifications and consequences it would produce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the past several years, more and more underclassmen and high  
school players have entered the draft, in part to complete their 
years under the rookie wage scale so they can land a lucrative 
contract after their first one expires. 
</P>
<P>
	``We understand what the lure of dollars are to talented people  
who can earn a lot of money, but we don't want our system to be 
viewed as providing an incentive for players to leave school 
early,'' Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the June 30 draft, there will be 39 players who had college  
eligibility remaining, including 11 sophomores, five freshmen, two 
high schoolers and nine foreign players 20 years old or younger. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke, which had never lost a player to the NBA before his  
eligibility was finished, is losing three players -- sophomores 
Elton Brand and William Avery and freshman Corey Maggette. 
</P>
<P>
	Many in the NBA think the quality of play has suffered because  
so many players are coming into the league unprepared for 
basketball at such a high level. 
</P>
<P>
	``So many believe they can play in the NBA, but so few actually  
do,'' Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern and deputy commissioner Russ Granik are awaiting word from  
an NCAA task force on a proposal to grant low interest loans of up 
to $20,000 to students likely to be drafted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got an open mind on the subject,'' union director Billy  
Hunter said. ``It's obviously something we have to look at, along 
with the various ramifications and consequences it would produce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is no timetable for reaching an agreement on some kind of  
age limit or restriction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Exactly how it works itself out, I can't say,'' Stern said.

<HEADLINE> Parade Honors Stanley Cup Champs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The Dallas Stars' bandwagon rolled through  
downtown today as thousands of fans gathered for a parade to honor 
the Stanley Cup champions. 
</P>
<P>
	Captain Derian Hatcher hoisted the silver NHL championship cup  
and forward Mike Modano chomped on a cigar while riding on a float. 
</P>
<P>
	The parade started at City Hall and snaked through downtown  
toward a victory party at Reunion Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Forward Dave Reid waved to fans while wearing a black cowboy  
hat. On another float, team owner Tom Hicks sported new cowboy 
boots emblazoned with an image of the cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans along the route waved green flags and cheered their  
champions, who won the cup with a triple-overtime victory over 
Buffalo that ended early Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've lost a lot of sleep but it's been thrilling,'' said one  
fan, who had green and white ribbons pinned to her shoulders. 
``It's so great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vendors along the parade route found booming business. A booth  
selling $25 T-shirts and $10 golf caps was crowded with buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	For the better part of this spring, the Stars managed to capture  
the imagination of a city that usually reserves its excitement for 
Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	Flags flew from automobiles, power plays were discussed at water  
coolers and more attention was given to Modano's bum wrist than to 
Deion Sanders' bad toe. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stanley Cup victory sparked celebrations that began in  
sports bars and spilled into downtown streets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The city is appreciative of what the Stars have done,'' said  
Tom Burke of Dallas, who was one of hundreds waiting Sunday at a 
grocery store for tickets to the victory rally. ``The city has 
embraced the Stars. We feel like we know the players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 fans were waiting for the Stars when they arrived at  
the airport at 6:45 a.m. Sunday, and 16,000 tickets for today's 
rally were quickly snapped up. 
</P>
<P>
	The hysteria surrounding the first Stanley Cup's first trip to  
Texas hasn't been lost on the Stars themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've come from the point where people didn't know what a goal  
was or any of the rules to everybody being crazy about the sport -- 
it's gone 180 degrees,'' said Craig Ludwig, one of three former 
Minnesota North Stars still on the roster. ``It's incredible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before this weekend, no professional team from the Dallas area  
had ever won a championship in a major sport other than football. 
The Cowboys have won five Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas Rangers have been in Dallas since 1972, but have won  
just one playoff game. The Dallas Mavericks arrived in 1980 and 
haven't been in the playoffs since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's brought the whole city together,'' Rob Parker of Dallas  
said. ``There are no barriers, racial or otherwise, when you talk 
about the Stars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first title in the franchise's 32-year history came six  
years after previous owner Norm Green moved the team from 
Minneapolis because of small crowds. 
</P>
<P>
	When the club arrived in Texas, the Dallas fans certainly  
weren't the most knowledgeable, but Hicks saw enough interest to 
buy the team in December 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Hicks had deep pockets but there was also the front-office savvy  
of general manager Bob Gainey and the steadiness of coach Ken 
Hitchcock. 
</P>
<P>
	As the wins started to multiply, so did the fans. The Stars had  
the NHL's best regular-season record in each of the past two years, 
and seats at Reunion Arena gradually became some of the hottest 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	And now, with the Cup theirs and the celebration still at a  
fever pitch, fans say they are just starting to realize how much 
progress the game has made in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a real struggle to attain a championship and  
respectability for the fans,'' Cliff Steward of Dallas said. ``The 
Stars have had to fight for any visibility.''

<HEADLINE> Forbes: Billionaires Club Booms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Newly created Internet wealth and a rising stock  
market have expanded the world's billionaires club to 465 and 
pushed the collective net worth of the richest 200 working people 
beyond $1 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
	Fittingly, the man whose software runs the majority of the  
world's personal computers not only tops Forbes magazine's latest 
ranking of the world's billionaires, but he is nearly three times 
ahead of No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft co-founder and chairman Bill Gates, with $90 billion  
to his name, far outstrips the man in second place -- investor 
Warren Buffet, with $36 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The rankings, released Sunday, appear in the July 5 issue, the  
13th annual World's Billionaires list. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine said the collective wealth of the Top 200 working  
rich is more than double the $463 billion that the top 200 
billionaires had 10 years ago. Gates alone has as much money as the 
top 9 on the list 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates' net worth nearly doubled from $51 billion last year,  
briefly touching $100 billion in April before the stock market 
retrenched somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft also claimed two other spots among the top five.  
Co-founder Paul Allen was third, with a $30 billion net worth. 
Microsoft president Steven Ballmer fourth, with $19.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In fifth place were the Oeri, Hoffman and Sacher families of  
Switzerland with $17 billion from the Roche pharmaceuticals 
conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
	Tied for sixth place with a net worth of $16.5 billion were oil,  
rail and telecommunications magnate Philip Anschutz and Dell 
Computer Corp. chairman Michael Dell, who at 34 was the youngest 
among the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The top 10 list is actually a top 11, because the next four  
spots, eight through 11, are held by members of the Walton family, 
heirs of the late Sam Walton, founder of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. 
Forbes estimated their wealth at $16 billion each. 
</P>
<P>
	Dot-com billionaires from around the globe also were catapulted  
onto this year's list. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Walker, founder of Priceline.com, and Pierre Omidyar,  
founder of eBay, went from nowhere into the Top 50. Walker was No. 
25 with a net worth of $10.2 billion, while Omidyar was 36th with 
$10.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes has a separate list for what it calls the ``World's  
Working Rich,'' those who made their own wealth or are working with 
their inheritance. 
</P>
<P>
	In another list, Forbes ranked the estimated net worths of what  
it called the world's ``Kings, Queens and Dictators.'' Leading that 
category were the Sultan of Brunei, with $30 billion in wealth, 
Saudi Arabia's King Fahd with $28 billion, Iraq's President Saddam 
Hussein with $6 billion, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands with $5.2 
billion and Syria's President Hafez Al-Assad with $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's Queen Elizabeth II has either $450 million or $16  
billion, depending on whether you count the Royal Collection, which 
includes the crown jewels and is held by the Queen in trust for the 
nation.

	U.S. Planes To Return From Balkans  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States will begin bringing home  
planes and pilots dispatched to Europe during the NATO bombing of 
Yugoslavia. More than 350 military planes, representing about half 
the number of U.S. aircraft that flew during the bombing campaign, 
will begin the return trip as soon as tomorrow. NATO troops who 
have moved into Kosovo have turned their attention to the 
peacekeeping duties of establishing security and laying the 
groundwork for democratic elections. Two Nepalese soldiers attached 
to the British force were killed today while clearing booby traps 
and land mines from a school near Pristina. They were the first 
allied fatalities since NATO entered the province on June 12.

President Clinton today on the first visit by an American president 
to this small nation that broke away from Yugoslavia and Slobodan 
Milosevic in 1991. Clinton's visit was intended to draw attention 
to a prosperous Slovenia as a success story for Balkan nations, in 
contrast to the grim hardships Yugoslavia faces as it struggles to 
recover from NATO attacks.

	Energy Dept. Plans Polygraph Tests

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Energy Department plans to give lie  
detector tests to as many as 5,000 nuclear weapons scientists and 
other employees in sensitive jobs with wholesale testing to begin 
later this summer, senior department officials said. It will be the 
first time any agency outside of the Central Intelligence Agency 
and the National Security Agency will engage in widespread use of 
polygraph tests on workers. The FBI uses the devices to screen 
prospective employees. There is concern about the reliability of 
the polygraph, known informally as a lie detector. Polygraph 
results are not admissible in court because of questions over their 
reliability.

eight the number of slayings the fugitive is linked to. Rafael 
Resendez-Ramirez was also put on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list. 
Authorities believe Resendez-Ramirez has been riding the rails, 
finding victims along the way. All eight slayings took place on or 
near railroad tracks.

	No Implants-Illness Link Found

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Silicone breast implants do not cause major  
illnesses, yet they frequently break open and leak, which can cause 
pain, disfigurement and repeat surgery, concludes a long-awaited 
report sought by Congress. The report by the Institute of Medicine 
is unlikely to end a decade-long controversy over implants, which 
thousands of women blame for severe illnesses from cancer to 
rheumatoid arthritis. Up to 1.8 million American women have 
received silicone breast implants since 1962 -- a time before the 
FDA required proof that all medical devices were safe and 
effective.

which will allow them to talk on the phone, send a fax and check 
e-mail at the same time. Sprint's new ION -- Integrated On-Demand 
Network -- promises delivery of local and long-distance phone 
service and high-speed Internet access through a single connection. 
The nation's third-largest long-distance company has chosen Kansas 
City, Mo., Denver and Seattle to launch the service this fall. 
Sprint proposes charging a flat monthly rate, likely between $100 
to $150.

<HEADLINE> 'Austin Powers' Faces Censors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Imagine hearing Austin Powers, the  
International Man of Mystery, as he purrs: ``Shall we shiok now or 
shall we shiok later?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shiok? It's gotta be dirty, right?  
</P>
<P>
	Actually, it's Singaporean English for ``treat nicely.''  
</P>
<P>
	That's the tamer translation censors in that country wanted for  
the hipster's trademark term ``shag,'' which is a British obscenity 
for sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Objections from foreign censors have complicated the  
international release of ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' 
which is packed with graphic sex jokes, double-entendres and, of 
course, the S-H-A-G word. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore officials wanted to change the title to ``The Spy Who  
Shioked Me,'' even though ``shagged'' means ``tired'' in local 
lingo. Malaysian censors aren't happy either, said Rolf Mittweg, 
head of international marketing at New Line Cinema, which released 
the comedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaysian censors ``decided we are not allowed to use the word  
'shag,' and want to change the title to 'The Spy Who Dot-Dot-Dot 
Me,''' Mittweg said from his Los Angeles office. 
</P>
<P>
	Even after censoring, Malaysian officials say they expect to  
rate the sequel ``18-SX,'' which grants access only to adults. 
</P>
<P>
	The filmmakers are trying to come up with various replacements  
for ``shag'' because state censors in Indonesia, Egypt and South 
Korea are also sharpening their scissors, Mittweg said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want the movie to sound too vulgar, but also it can't  
be too soft,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Britain, where the term originated, The Sun tabloid reported  
Thursday that theater owners plan to remove the subtitle from 
marquees when the movie opens here in July and plan to just call it 
``Austin Powers II.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be wrong to put something like that up in cinemas  
where children are coming in,'' Barry Jenkins, chief executive of 
the ABC Cinema chain, told The Sun tabloid newspaper in London. 
</P>
<P>
	American filmmakers and foreign censors have repeatedly clashed  
over the difference between funny and taboo in recent years as the 
international market for films expands into countries with strict 
obscenity regulations. Blockbuster U.S. films often make more 
abroad than they do in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is always the fear now that some sort of government  
censorship will step in and ruin the intent of a movie. That's more 
of a fear than foreign audiences not getting the jokes,'' said Paul 
Dergarabedian, a film industry analyst with Exhibitor Relations Co. 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	When the gross-out comedy ``There's Something About Mary''  
opened around the world last year, 20th Century Fox also struggled 
with foreign censors who balked at scenes of a dog being 
electrocuted and a teen-ager accidentally snarling his genitals in 
a zipper. 
</P>
<P>
	Mittweg added that New Line ran into similar trouble with  
``Boogie Nights,'' a graphic 1997 film about a group of 1970s-era 
pornographers. 
</P>
<P>
	However, some fans steadfastly oppose sacrificing any part of  
Mike Myers' amorous, snaggletoothed superspy. The censors in 
Singapore lifted their ban on the title after local newspapers were 
flooded with letters objecting to the ``shiok'' substitute. 
</P>
<P>
	Mittweg said the makers of ``Austin Powers'' have issued a  
booklet explaining the jokes to translators, such as when the spy 
tries to seduce a go-go dancer by growling, ``I put the 'grrrr' in 
swinger, baby!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without the lexicon, for instance, ``shag'' could be translated  
in French as ``tapis a longs poils,'' which means ``carpet with 
long hairs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dergarabedian predicted most of the humor in the film would  
tickle rather than offend international audiences because the sex 
jokes are largely innuendo. 
</P>
<P>
	Austin Powers is certainly naked as he prances through an  
upscale hotel in the film's opening sequence, but the spy's private 
parts are perpetually obscured by foreground props such as a 
child's pinwheel, cooked ham and, as a last resort, the film's 
credits. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the joke,'' Dergarabedian said. ``Who has the dirty  
mind? Is it the filmmaker or the audience?''

<HEADLINE> Russian Trade Surplus Soars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's trade surplus soared in the first four  
months of the year and domestic production posted modest growth, 
officials said today. The trend was apparently caused by a drop in 
imports forced by the fall of the ruble. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's foreign trade surplus rose to $9.1 billion in the first  
four months of 1999 from $100 million in January-April of last 
year, the Russian Statistics Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fall of the ruble -- from six to the dollar before the onset  
of an economic crisis in August to around 25 to the dollar -- has 
made imported goods too expensive for many Russians. But it also 
helped Russian manufacturers by boosting sales of cheaper domestic 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports in the first four months of 1999 shrank 47 percent  
compared to the same time last year, to $13 billion. Exports fell 
by 10 percent, to $22 billion, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's overall foreign trade was down 29 percent to $35  
billion, the statistics agency said. The slide slowed in April, 
when foreign trade totaled $10 billion, down 18 percent on the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia also enjoyed a $2.9 billion trade surplus in April,  
compared with a deficit of $100 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's industrial output in the first five months of the year  
was up 1.5 percent from the corresponding period in 1998, and 
totaled 1.02 trillion rubles ($42 billion), the statistics agency 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials hope Russia's economy will reverse its fall  
and the gross domestic product will grow 1.5 percent to 3 percent 
growth next year. But many experts doubt that will occur. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's GDP has fallen about 40 percent since the collapse of  
the Soviet Union in 1991. The GDP has only posted an increase in 
one year since then, rising a modest .8 percent in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Real Soccer Moms Leave Their Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	As Joy Fawcett wandered the hallways at the U.S. national team's  
hotel, she ran into Carla Overbeck. The two standout defenders 
looked at each other and laughed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a lot of time on my hands and I spend it looking for  
things to do,'' Fawcett said. ``If someone tells me to sit down and 
relax, I have a hard time with not doing something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It comes with the job of being a soccer mom. Except that  
Fawcett, who has two daughters, and Overbeck, who has a son, have 
taken the concept to an extreme. 
</P>
<P>
	Both players took a leave of absence from the team to have  
children. And both came back despite the physical and emotional 
demands parenthood can have on a full-time elite athlete. Now 
they're playing in the Women's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get a lot of help,'' said Fawcett, whose older daughter,  
Katelyn, is 5, and younger daughter Carli is 2. ``My mom and dad 
are around, my husband Walter is great and very supportive, but it 
can be hard. If the girls are with me for training, they are away 
from their father. Or I am away from my family. But we are 
committed to doing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Talk about commitments. Look what Fawcett had on her plate in  
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	She coached the UCLA women, who made the NCAA quarterfinals, and  
a youth team, while also playing for the national squad and 
handling motherhood. She resigned from UCLA at the end of '97, but 
said she'll consider a return to coaching after she retires as a 
player. 
</P>
<P>
	The hardest part for the 31-year-old player/mother was not  
finding enough hours for everything. Fawcett struggled most with 
getting fit enough to recapture her place on the national team. 
</P>
<P>
	``The toughest thing was the speed,'' she said. ``When you get  
pregnant and gain that weight, you get a little slower. I don't 
know if it is age or the childbirth, but there are a few players on 
the team who are faster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's only one who can sympathize with Fawcett's family  
situation, though. Overbeck, the team captain, gave birth to son 
Jackson in August 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't realize the time commitment it requires to have a  
child,'' said Overbeck, also 31. ``Every second of the day is 
devoted to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it puts things in a greater perspective. No matter how  
tough a day you have at practice or how tough a game you have, he's 
there to cheer you up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's an added benefit of being a mom on the national team.  
</P>
<P>
	``Any time we've needed someone to watch the kids, well, I've  
got 19 built-in baby sitters,'' Overbeck said. ``I never was short 
on volunteers. We're all a bunch of kids on this team, anyhow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Orlando, Fla., Fawcett had a live-in nanny, Nicki Richards,  
who also traveled with the team. So both daughters accompanied 
Fawcett. 
</P>
<P>
	Overbeck did not have a nanny, but Richards would take care of  
Jackson whenever mom was training or playing soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's harder when we're not in residency, trying to find time  
to work out,'' Overbeck said.'' I had to change my lifting schedule 
to fit a better schedule for Jackson.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both players had doubts about the decision to have children and  
continue playing. 
</P>
<P>
	``You always wonder if you are jeopardizing your career,''  
Fawcett said. ``But it's what I wanted to do and we said we'd go 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a recurring thought: How will I make it back? It helped  
to hear from my teammates and to know they wanted me back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Overbeck, ``You're sitting there pregnant and you're  
wondering if you can ever be in that kind of shape again. But, 
somehow, you do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Motherhood has brought the two defenders even closer on a team  
known for his togetherness. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, yeah,'' Fawcett said, chuckling. ``We have war stories and  
we help each other out. Many a time I've yelled over to Carla, `I 
need a diaper.'''

<HEADLINE> Court Settles Prison Awards Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New limits on attorney-fee awards to inmates  
who sue over prison conditions apply only to legal work performed 
after the law took effect in 1996, the Supreme Court ruled today. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling in a Michigan case said the legal-fee provisions of  
the Prison Litigation Reform Act, enacted by Congress to rein in 
prisoner lawsuits, do not affect legal work performed on inmates' 
behalf before the law was enacted. 
</P>
<P>
	``To impose the new standards now, for work performed before the  
PLRA became effective, would upset the reasonable expectations of 
the parties,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for the court. 
</P>
<P>
	The prison-litigation law, which took effect on April 26, 1996,  
aims to discourage frivolous lawsuits. It imposes a cap on 
attorneys' fees that can be awarded to inmates who successfully sue 
on a claim that prison conditions violate their civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
	All nine justices agreed the fee limits could not be applied to  
legal work performed before the law's effective date. 
</P>
<P>
	Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and John Paul Stevens voted to go  
further and decide the fee limit would apply only to cases filed 
after the law took effect. They said the fee limit should not apply 
to cases filed before April 1996, even if the legal work was 
performed after the law's effective date. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower courts had split on whether the fee limit applied to cases  
pending in April 1996. In today's case, a federal appeals court had 
ruled that the limit did not apply to two lawsuits filed by 
Michigan inmates. 
</P>
<P>
	Female inmates sued in 1977 over programming and access to the  
courts, and male inmates sued in 1980 over prison conditions 
including sanitation, health care, overcrowding and protection from 
harm. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge ruled for the female inmates after a trial, and  
the male inmates' lawsuit was resolved in a 1985 agreement with the 
state. In each case, the inmates were awarded $150 an hour in 
lawyers' fees for monitoring of the court's order. 
</P>
<P>
	After the prisoner litigation measure took effect, Michigan  
officials argued that the limits should be applied to reduce the 
fee to $112.50 an hour for all fees awarded after April 1996, no 
matter when the work was performed. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge ruled partly for the state, saying the fee limit  
applied to legal work performed after the law took effect, but not 
to work performed before then. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the fee limit did  
not apply to pending cases at all, no matter when the work was 
performed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court decided the main issue was not when the case  
was filed, but when the legal work was performed. 
</P>
<P>
	``In other words, as applied to work performed after the  
effective date of the PLRA, the PLRA has future effect on future 
work; this does not raise retroactivity concerns,'' O'Connor wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Martin vs. Hadix, 98-262.

<HEADLINE> Net Marketing Firm a Pyramid Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Barbara Edelman saw International Heritage  
Inc. as liberation from a job delivering newspapers in the middle 
of the night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had visions of driving a Cadillac,'' said the 62-year-old  
from Crowley, La. 
</P>
<P>
	Randall Peter, 44, a Pearland, Texas, electrical engineer, also  
envisioned riches. International Heritage's showy catalog with 
Coach leather bags and expensive crystal overcame his suspicion of 
get-rick-quick schemes. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Waterford crystal is going to let us sell their products,  
we must be legitimate,'' Peters remembers thinking. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Securities and Exchange Commission says International  
Heritage was nothing more than a huge pyramid scheme. And luxury 
goods makers such as Callaway Golf and Bosca claim International 
Heritage was reselling their merchandise without their knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years after it was started in Raleigh, International  
Heritage is bankrupt and being liquidated and its three founders 
face federal civil penalties. More than 150,000 distributors in the 
United States and Canada may have lost their investments, and 
12,600 creditors have filed claims against International Heritage 
totaling more than $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, a federal bankruptcy trustee unveiled a tentative  
settlement that would force Stanley Van Etten, the company's 
charismatic president, to surrender a $3.5 million bond he had 
posted and to pay the Securities and Exchange Commission another 
$150,000. The settlement contains no admission of guilt on Van 
Etten's part. 
</P>
<P>
	Pyramid schemes are marketing plans in which investors or  
distributors make their money back primarily from fees paid by 
newer investors. A scheme cannot survive, and its distributors 
cannot make money, without a steady stream of new participants. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission warns against pyramid schemes in  
its Web site (www.ftc.gov), noting that most states outlaw the 
plans. ``When a plan collapses, most people -- except perhaps those 
at the very top of the pyramid -- lose their money,'' the FTC says. 
</P>
<P>
	An SEC complaint filed in March 1998 in Atlanta alleged  
International Heritage defrauded investors and generated more than 
$150 million in revenue by promoting merchandise with snob appeal, 
but said it profited mostly from new distributors and collecting 
their sign-up fees. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency quotes International Heritage's sales kit as actually  
discouraging representatives from recruiting a person with a retail 
sales background because, ``odds are that he will do that (sell the 
products) at the expense of neglecting to build a sales 
organization beneath himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Etten disputes the SEC's charges, and its characterization  
of his marketing company. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the money came from product purchases from new sales  
reps to the company,'' he said. ``I would offer in response, that's 
the same for the whole network marketing industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really an unfair situation,'' Van Etten said. ``Network  
marketing has a problem with perception. People think it's illegal 
to begin with. Then, to complicate it, a regulator can just allege 
it's a pyramid with no judicial process, and we're virtually forced 
out of business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	International Heritage distributors paid $250 each to start up  
to seven marketing networks plus $100 for training materials. 
Investing the maximum $1,850 could return up to $15,400 a week in 
revenue, the SEC quoted the company's sales pitch as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Randall Peter paid $250 for the right to sell the merchandise.  
He also paid $750 to sponsor three family members in Iowa and 
hundreds of dollars more for training materials for them. Barbara 
Edelman said she figures she and her son are owed about $400 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Etten, 37, marketed International Heritage by sounding  
themes such as personal freedom and spirituality at meetings in 
churches and halls across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	He estimates he made ``a couple million dollars'' last year and  
about $5 million in 1997 from all his business ventures. He now 
runs a venture capital and consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	International Heritage filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which  
leads to liquidation, in November. The SEC then filed a civil 
complaint alleging Van Etten and co-founders Claude Savage and 
Larry G. Smith were responsible for fraud, filing false reports and 
illegal sale of unregistered securities. The FBI is also 
investigating Van Etten and International Heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week's tentative settlement must be approved by the SEC  
commissioners, a bankruptcy court judge and the Atlanta federal 
judge overseeing the SEC's complaint.

<HEADLINE> New San Diego Padres Park Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The start of construction on the San Diego  
Padres' new downtown ballpark will be delayed until after a study 
on its impact on the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge Judith McConnell ruled Monday that the city  
of San Diego and the team broke state law by going forward with the 
project before the completion of an environmental impact report, 
expected in September. 
</P>
<P>
	``This does not dissuade us in the slightest from building the  
ballpark,'' Padres owner John Moores said. ``We're going to keep 
pace with the voters. They approved the project and by God we're 
going to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge's ruling came in response to a lawsuit by the  
Coalition Advocating Redevelopment Excellence, comprised of 
residents in communities surrounding the project site who want the 
stadium moved a few blocks east to save historic buildings from 
demolition. 
</P>
<P>
	The city has argued it was working from a 1992 master  
environmental impact study prepared for the nearby Horton Plaza 
shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
	The 42,000-seat stadium, approved by voters in November, would  
serve as the anchor for a 26-block development that includes 
offices, hotels, retail outlets and homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The project will cost an estimated $1 billion; the ballpark, a  
joint city-Padres effort, is estimated at $411 million, including 
$296 million from public financing.

<HEADLINE> Cubs' Gonzalez To Have Arm Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago Cubs right-hander Jeremi Gonzalez will  
have additional surgery on his right elbow, yet another blow to the 
team's pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez, 24, had ulnar nerve surgery last August on his  
pitching elbow. He has been experiencing continuing discomfort in 
his elbow, and an MRI showed abnormalities. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgery will be performed as soon as possible to determine the  
severity of the injury, the Cubs said. 
</P>
<P>
	As a rookie in 1997, Gonzalez was the club's winningest pitcher  
despite spending the first two months of the season at Triple-A 
Iowa. In a four-start span early last year, he went 3-1 with a 
shutout and a 1.86 ERA. He was 7-7 with a 5.32 ERA when his season 
ended because of the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight Cubs pitchers have been on the disabled list this season,  
including Gonzalez and two other 1998 starters: Kerry Wood and 
Kevin Tapani. Wood is missing the entire season following ligament 
replacement surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Cubs closer Rod Beck is sidelined following arthroscopic surgery  
on his right elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago also activated outfielder Robin Jennings, who had been  
on an injury rehabilitation assignment. Jennings will rejoin the 
Cubs on Tuesday in Denver, taking the roster spot of reliever Doug 
Creek, who was optioned to Iowa.

<HEADLINE> Russia Still Mired in Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- The terrified depositors massed outside closed  
bank doors have melted away. Shelves emptied of imported meats, 
milk and canned vegetables are filled again, this time mostly with 
cheaper Russian-produced food. 
</P>
<P>
	The panic has subsided. But it's due to resignation, not to  
hope. 
</P>
<P>
	The economic crisis that began in Asia two years ago caught up  
with Russia last August, sending the ruble plunging, virtually 
shutting down the nation's largest commercial banks and forcing the 
state to default since then on most of its debts. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike some Asian governments that have scrambled to dig  
themselves out of the hole, Russia has done little to address the 
fundamental faults that destined its markets to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	``Russia stands today in a place not all that different from  
where it stood nine months ago,'' said Charles Blitzer, chief 
international economist at the U.S. investment firm Donaldson 
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. 
</P>
<P>
	``The economy is bouncing along the bottom; it's taken virtually  
no actions on the structural side, be they to restructure banks, 
improve corporate governance, build more effective institutions, or 
redefine the expenditure pattern of the government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, political leaders and commentators across the spectrum  
tried to assign blame -- usually pointing the finger at Western 
organizations like the International Monetary Fund and at Russia's 
own post-Soviet market reformers, who tried to blame the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Yevgeny Primakov, who was named prime minister in September, had  
two broad economic aims: establishing stability and, in spite of 
Russian sniping at the IMF, unlocking a loan from the agency to 
help service the country's foreign debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF froze a loan package worth $22.5 billion after the  
August financial collapse. It has made a new $4.5 billion loan 
contingent on parliamentary approval of a package of laws intended 
to increase government revenue, combat corruption and restructure 
the commercial banking system. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside for pushing for approval of that legislation, Primakov's  
government could claim some marginal economic improvements. Tax 
collection and foreign currency reserves increased, while inflation 
slowed. Industrial production increased. Barter payments fell. The 
government paid off back wages for state workers and military 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Primakov's successor, Sergei Stepashin, vowed to uphold the  
stability and to continue working intensively to clinch the IMF 
loan. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a country that experienced a major financial crash ... the  
country is in surprisingly good shape from the economic, political 
and social point of view,'' said Russian economist Leonid 
Grigoryev. ``We don't have ... a populist government or a major 
danger of inflation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, about one-third of Russians live below the official  
subsistence level, and 14.4 percent of the work force is unemployed 
-- and that figure doesn't include the millions who are 
underemployed or who work for little or no pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia also faces $17.5 billion in foreign debt payments this  
year, but can pay only half that amount at most. About $1 billion 
is being smuggled out of Russia each month. 
</P>
<P>
	President Boris Yeltsin has pledged repeatedly to turn Russia  
into a capitalist economy, but has never formulated or adopted a 
coherent, pro-market strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	With Russia's revolving-door governments, a Communist-dominated  
legislature averse to market reforms and a population weary of the 
post-Soviet economic slide, it's hard to imagine who would lead the 
campaign to correct deep-seated structural flaws. That would 
include shutting down inefficient industries, cutting back social 
subsidies and ending the sweetheart deals between the state and 
tycoons close to the government. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a question of political will and of national consensus.  
Russia doesn't have a clear idea of what kind of country it wants 
to be, much less how to get there,'' Blitzer said. 
</P>
<P>
	With parliamentary elections coming in December and a  
presidential election due by next June, the prospects of any 
meaningful reform become ever dimmer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the course of the year, we've seen a shift away from any  
real attention to economic reform to attention to the handover of 
power, playing out the end game of elections,'' said Rani Kronick, 
senior consultant at Control Risks Group Ltd. in London.

<HEADLINE> EU Still Split on Chocolate Purity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUXEMBOURG (AP) -- The European Union governments today failed to  
find an answer to a question that has divided them for years: How 
much vegetable fat -- other than cocoa butter -- can you put in 
chocolate and still call it chocolate? 
</P>
<P>
	The EU interior ministers were close to an answer until Belgium  
rejected a compromise proposal, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU's chocolate debate pits eight purist nations against  
seven that take a relaxed view of chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgium, France, Italy, Spain, Luxembourg, Germany, Greece and  
the Netherlands ban cocoa-butter substitutes in chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
	The others -- Britain, Ireland, Denmark, Portugal, Austria,  
Finland and Sweden -- don't mind chocolate containing milk and 
non-cocoa fats and object to their chocolate being banned from sale 
in the purist countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany, which currently holds the EU presidency, put forward a  
compromise Monday allowing up to 5 percent vegetable fats other 
than cocoa butter in chocolate provided the packaging clearly said 
that. The compromise listed six non-cocoa vegetable fats that could 
be used in chocolate making. 
</P>
<P>
	But Belgium -- a country with a sector devoted to making  
chocolates from 100 percent cocoa butter -- refused to go along, 
effectively scuttling the compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	The chocolate debate dates back to 1992 when EU governments  
agreed to clean up laws, such as the ones on the content and sale 
conditions of chocolate, that prevent the EU from being a truly 
single market. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Commission proposed changes in 1996. On Oct. 23,  
1997, the European Parliament agreed to allow non-cocoa vegetable 
fats into chocolate, though that is unlikely to occur soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Countries wanting to stick to a 100 percent cocoa butter rule  
said they feared that diluting chocolate with palm oil and other 
fats would destabilize the economies of cocoa-exporting countries 
and undermine consumer confidence in chocolate.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Lawyer Turns Victims' Advocate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Nina Salarno was strolling along a  
beach one recent sunny day, her fiance at her side, when she burst 
into tears of grief. 
</P>
<P>
	It had been 20 years, yet time hadn't blocked images of her  
sister on the same beach in Mexico shortly before she returned home 
to California and was murdered by an estranged boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	Salarno, 33, hasn't hidden from the tragedy.  
</P>
<P>
	She became a deputy district attorney, prosecuting sexual  
predators and spouse abusers. She became a victims' rights 
activist. And now, she's been appointed to run the new crime 
victims' aid office for the state attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those memories of my sister come back. That doesn't happen a  
lot but sometimes it does,'' Salarno said. ``But sometimes it's 
that hurt, too, that makes you go on and makes you even stronger. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sit here at my job now and think, 'I know what it's like.'  
If I can try to make it a little bit better for someone else, then 
my sister's death hasn't gone in vain and I've gained from that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Bill Lockyer chose Salarno in April. California  
must be as determined to aid crime victims as it's been to punish 
criminals, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I looked around for someone with energy, commitment to the  
task and appropriate life experience that would help them do a good 
job,'' Lockyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Salarno acknowledged an irony in her appointment by Lockyer.  
Like her mother, with whom she founded Crime Victims United, she 
became a Republican activist pushing for crime victims' rights. 
</P>
<P>
	That movement opposed Lockyer, a Democrat who led the Senate for  
four years, instead backing GOP lawmakers who wanted tougher 
criminal penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockyer said he doesn't care about Salarno's party affiliation.  
And Salarno, while remaining a Republican, said she will take a 
bipartisan approach in her new job. 
</P>
<P>
	The path to that job started in 1979.  
</P>
<P>
	Her sister Catina tried to end her relationship with her  
boyfriend, but he didn't want to break up. During one of their many 
quarrels, Nina Salarno, then 12, watched in the family's San 
Francisco home as he told her 18-year-old sister, ``I'm going to 
kill you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A week later, on Sept. 3, 1979, he did.  
</P>
<P>
	Steven Burns shot and killed Catina Salarno on her first day at  
Stockton's University of the Pacific. Burns was sentenced to 17 
years to life in prison and remains behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
	Then age 13, Nina Salarno was called to testify but was left on  
the stand waiting, next to a big picture of her sister's body and 
her sister's purse, covered in dried blood. After 15 long minutes, 
she fled the courtroom in tears. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is what made me become a deputy district attorney,'' she  
said. ``I didn't want people to go through what I went through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salarno received a law degree in 1992 and worked as a prosecutor  
for Tulare, Placer and Sacramento counties. She worked her way up 
from drunken driving cases to prosecuting felonies such as sexual 
assaults and domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Sacramento County Judge James Long calls Salarno a ``tough but  
fair prosecutor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salarno, with a startup staff of two, advises the attorney  
general on victims issues and will work to improve and coordinate 
aid, which includes counseling, emergency assistance such as 
shelter and medical care, and legal advice. 
</P>
<P>
	Joan Irving, whose 17-year-old son was wounded in 1994 by a gang  
member, said she had trouble finding a prosecutor who would 
aggressively pursue the attempted-murder case. 
</P>
<P>
	Salarno got a conviction.  
</P>
<P>
	``She took into account my thoughts and considerations,'' Irving  
said. ``She understood my pain.''

<HEADLINE> Some Sprint Customers Go Digital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Residential customers in three cities  
will get a first shot at Sprint Corp.'s new digital-age phone 
service, which will allow them to talk on the phone, send a fax and 
check e-mail -- all at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint's new ION -- Integrated On-Demand Network -- promises  
delivery of local and long-distance phone service and high-speed 
Internet access all through a single connection to home. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint estimates consumers now are paying a total of $150 to  
$200 a month for such services and have to deal with three or four 
companies. It proposes a flat monthly rate, likely between $100 to 
$150, plus installation and equipment costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's third-largest long-distance company announced  
Monday it has chosen Kansas City, Mo., Denver and Seattle to launch 
the service this fall. Service in other large cities, including 
Miami, Los Angeles, and Boston, is planned for the first half of 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Monday, U S West Inc. announced a three-city technical  
trial of its new service. U S West will integrate customers' 
telephone and Internet service with existing TV programming -- all 
on a customer's home television screen. 
</P>
<P>
	The developments bring the long-awaited development of one-stop  
shopping for communications services a step closer to widespread 
availability. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's leading edge. Nobody else has done it, although AT&AMP;T will  
be in a position to do it as they roll out their cable service,'' 
said communications analyst Bert Heath of Z.D. Market Intelligence 
in La Jolla, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint has been testing the service for the past two years at  
employees' homes in suburban Gardner, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	Trials have also been conducted since January at large  
corporations in the Kansas City metropolitan area, including the 
Hallmark greeting cards business and Yellow Freight trucking. 
</P>
<P>
	The basic package includes four multiple, simultaneous voice  
lines, high-speed Internet access and unlimited local calls. The 
monthly rate also will cover long-distance calls, with what Sprint 
said would be a generous allotment of minutes before extra charges 
kick in. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can have two faxes and two people talking at the same time  
while you download a big chunk of data from the Internet,'' said 
Joan Jarrett, director of emerging markets for Sprint consumer 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	The service is designed for people with home offices and for  
families and singles who enjoy rather than fear technology. Sprint 
estimates their ranks at 40 percent of U.S. households. 
</P>
<P>
	Every line has advanced features such as Caller ID and call  
forwarding. With a click of a computer key, consumers can control 
or change features on demand, such as adding a separate line for a 
teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
	While the concept is attractive, the issue for Sprint is whether  
it can make money, said Heath. That's because of the cost of the 
final connection to a home, known in the industry as the ``final 
mile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They'll have to lease lines from competitors to attach to the  
customer,'' Heath said. ``They're not going to rewire the 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett said Sprint has two plans for connecting to customers'  
homes. 
</P>
<P>
	One method will involve leasing copper phone lines from local  
phone companies and enhancing them. 
</P>
<P>
	The second way is by harnessing the high-speed broadband  
services of several wireless cable television companies, which 
Sprint has spent $1 billion acquiring in recent months. A home 
would receive the signals with a small satellite dish. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint's acquired broadband lines cover 30 million households in  
65 cities, or a quarter of the homes in the country, Jarrett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Heath said AT&AMP;T will upgrade its vast cable network to offer an  
equivalent type of service. ``They're probably working on it as we 
speak,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mel Marten, a telecommunications analyst with Edward Jones in  
St. Louis, said Sprint would offer the service on a neighborhood by 
neighborhood basis and will be constrained by how quickly each 
phone company works with it. 
</P>
<P>
	While the functions and scope of the ION service are pretty  
revolutionary, the idea of offering bundle packages is not, Marten 
said. Most phone companies are working to offer the basics of local 
and long-distance service coupled with high-speed Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he expects the Baby Bells to roll out souped-up copper  
line service in limited markets this year. The so-called DSL or 
digital subscriber lines permit high-speed Internet access while 
you talk on the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint stock rose 2.7 percent, climbing $1.43 3/4 to $54 a share on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where AT&AMP;T gained 87 1/2 cents to $56.50 
and U S West was up 31 1/4 cents to $58.31 1/4.

<HEADLINE> Bank of France Urges Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- The Bank of France said Monday that the three banks  
involved in a protracted takeover battle should meet to resolve 
their differences. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of France Governor Jean-Claude Trichet said in a statement  
that he would invite the three parties involved -- Societe Generale, 
Paribas and Banque Nationale de Paris -- to participate in a working 
meeting to find a solution ``as soon as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The request came as investors await several key rulings on the  
takeover battle that has roiled the French banking world for close 
to four months. 
</P>
<P>
	BNP made an unsolicited $37 billion bid for both Societe  
Generale and Paribas March 10, a month after the two banks had 
themselves announced a friendly merger to create SG Paribas. 
</P>
<P>
	The two banks have been fighting off the bid. Should BNP  
succeed, it would create the world's first $1 trillion bank in 
terms of assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Societe Generale sweetened its bid for Paribas  
shares, a move that will further delay the outstanding offers, most 
likely until the end of July or even August. 
</P>
<P>
	Conseil des Marches Financiers, a market regulator, was  
scheduled to rule late Monday on whether to clear Societe 
Generale's new bid for Paribas, but may not make the decision 
public until Tuesday. The stock market watchdog Commission des 
Operations de Bourse must also rule on the bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of France said it would delay its own recommendation on  
Societe Generale's counter-bid for Paribas shares until it receives 
more information on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of France officials declined to announce a date for the  
final decision, saying only that it would be made as soon as 
possible.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mostly Higher; Dow Up 21.84 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened mostly higher today as technology  
shares rallied sharply, outpacing blue-chip stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 21.84 at 10,877.40. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mostly higher. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was up 5.57 at 1,348.41, and the Nasdaq composite 
index was up 31.03 at 2,594.47. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks were recovering after being hit hard in recent  
weeks amid fears of an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve. 
But investors, now expecting the Fed to implement only a small 
increase, were lured today by the tech stocks' more affordable 
prices. IBM, up 3 1/16 at 123 13/16, led the Dow components. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokerage stocks were mostly higher as Wall Street anticipates  
robust earnings reports from several major firms this week. Morgan 
Stanley Dean Witter gained 2 3/8 to 98 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 13.93 to close  
at 10855.56, ending a week in which the blue chips rose 365 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin today  
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 86.1 million 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 1.60 at 638.15, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was down 0.95 at 767.62. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.76 percent after  
the Bank of Japan bought dollars to hold the yen lower. In 
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.61 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.17 percent, and France's CAC-40 was 
up 0.68 percent.

<HEADLINE> Royal Newlyweds Begin Honeymoon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Honeymoon plans for royal newlyweds Prince Edward  
and Sophie Rhys-Jones remained officially a mystery today, but 
British newspapers contended the couple would take only four days 
off at the queen's Scottish retreat before returning to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Too busy for a proper honeymoon,'' read the headline in the  
Daily Mail, which said the couple chose to spend their brief 
honeymoon on the royal Balmoral estate partly to deter the 
paparazzi. 
</P>
<P>
	They reportedly spent the first night at Birkhall Lodge, a house  
on the estate usually used by Edward's grandmother, the Queen 
Mother Elizabeth. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Earl and Countess of Wessex, married Saturday evening at  
St. George's Chapel in Windsor Castle, flew by helicopter to 
Balmoral Castle on Sunday afternoon after hosting a family lunch at 
Bagshot Park, the estate near Windsor where they will live. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspapers also reported details of the wedding reception,  
saying that Prince Edward had toasted the queen as ``the best 
mother in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several newspapers reported that the Band of the Royal Marines  
played hits by the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and the Monkees, 
before dressing as the Blues Brothers and bringing out the 
saxophones. Guests reportedly danced to 1970s hits such as 
``YMCA,'' and ``American Pie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opinions on the wedding and the new title bestowed upon the  
newlyweds also filled Monday's newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours before the wedding, the queen revived an ancient defunct  
title and made Prince Edward the Earl of Wessex and Viscount 
Severn. His bride, who has the status of princess, will be Her 
Royal Highness the Countess of Wessex. 
</P>
<P>
	``If royal advisers imagine that a mere earldom -- instead of a  
much grander dukedom -- demonstrates that the palace is becoming 
just a little more informal and low-key, then they misjudge the 
national mood,'' wrote the Daily Mail. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper contended that no title was necessary for the modern  
couple and that treating them as ordinary people would have been a 
significant symbol of a new approach. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, wax figures of the couple took their place in Madame  
Tussaud's waxworks museum in London on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The museum said designers and dressers worked through the night  
to ensure that the depiction of the countess was ready. Standing 
among wax figures of other members of the royal family, she wears 
an exact replica of her wedding dress. 
</P>
<P>
	When they return from their honeymoon, the couple have said they  
will return to their careers -- he as a television producer and she 
as a public relations executive. 
</P>
<P>
	The countess set up her own company with a partner, and her  
public-relations experience is seen as a valuable asset in coping 
with the aggressive British press. 
</P>
<P>
	The prince has long sought a life outside royal circles.  
</P>
<P>
	He remarked during a recent television interview with the  
British Broadcasting Corp. that ``the most precious thing that 
anybody possesses is their anonymity.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Fall in Midday Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks slipped Tuesday as investors took  
profits on recent gains, while the dollar fell against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 36.72 points,  
or 0.21 percent, closing the morning session at 17,702.13. On 
Monday, the average closed up 307.59 points, or 1.76 percent, at 
17,738.85 -- its highest closing level since October 6, 1997, when 
the Nikkei closed at 17,824.78. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.98 yen, down 0.36 yen from late Monday in  
Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 122.42 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo share prices started higher as investors bought  
high-technology shares and shares of blue-chip exporters, but fell 
as the day went on. 
</P>
<P>
	``Profit-taking was natural as the pace of recent gains was  
fast,'' said Shigeharu Shiraishi, managing director at SG Yamaichi 
Asset Management Co. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar slipped as players nudged the  
U.S. currency down to see how low the Bank of Japan will let it go, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the Bank of Japan intervened several times to buy  
dollars and sell yen in an attempt to stem the Japanese currency's 
rise. Monday's intervention was the fourth action by Japan's 
central bank in 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	``The recent fast rise in the yen is due to excessive hopes for  
a Japanese economic recovery. I think the rise is disruptive to the 
market, and the purpose of recent interventions was to preempt such 
moves,'' Japan's Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said at a regular 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts say the market is far from bullish on the dollar.  
The Bank of Japan is virtually the only buyer in the market, while 
many others are lined up to sell the currency at current levels and 
higher, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although recent government data indicate there are some signs of  
improvement in Japan's economy, the nation is still struggling to 
overcome its worst recession since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank's repeated interventions are seen by analysts  
as an attempt to make sure that the nascent recovery is not 
torpedoed by a sudden surge in the value of the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 126.18 yen, down  
from 126.66 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.7600 percent from Monday's finish of 1.7500 percent, driving 
its price down to 96.94 yen from 97.02 yen.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Prices Slip as Yields Jump / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices fell Monday, as investors sold  
Treasury securities ahead of several upcoming corporate bond 
offerings. The drop pushed yields back over 6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, fell 5/8 point,  
or $6.25 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction, rose to 6.02 percent from 5.97 percent late 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated $10 billion in new corporate debt is set to hit the  
market this week as issuers take advantage of a lull in economic 
data that could influence interest rates. This week's offerings are 
expected to include a mammoth offering from Ford Motor Credit Co., 
which could be worth $6 billion or more. 
</P>
<P>
	The outlook for corporate bonds has improved since Federal  
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan hinted last week that the central 
bank will raise rates only modestly over the next few months and 
some investors sold Treasurys to make room for the new issues. 
Corporate bonds usually pay higher rates than government bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader bond market, prices of short-term Treasury  
securities were up 1/16 point to 3/32 point and intermediate 
maturities were up between 7/32 point and 15/32 point, reported 
Bridge Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.71 percent, as the  
discount rose 0.06 percentage point to 4.59 percent. Six-month 
yields were 5.02 percent, as the discount rose 0.06 percentage 
point to 4.83 percent. One-year yields were 4.99 percent as the 
discount rose 0.03 percentage point from late Friday to 4.75 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 4.75 percent from 4.69 late Friday.

<HEADLINE> New Blood Sugar Monitor Is Painless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's one of the most annoying parts of life for  
diabetics -- pricking your finger several times a day to check your 
blood sugar. Now, a new wristwatch-like device that eliminates most 
of the painful skin pricks has been shown to work as well as 
traditional tests. 
</P>
<P>
	A study of 39 diabetics conducted at the University of Colorado  
in Denver found GlucoWatch provided glucose values that were nearly 
identical to those obtained using traditional monitors. The 
findings were being presented Tuesday at an American Diabetes 
Association meeting in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	GlucoWatch, the first largely noninvasive glucose monitor that  
is awaiting federal approval, automatically checks users' blood 
glucose every 20 minutes and sounds an alert if the reading is too 
high or too low. If approved, the device could be on the market in 
the next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks very promising,'' said Richard Kahn, the  
association's chief scientific and medical officer. ``This will 
have value for a lot of people, and set in motion a whole new 
generation of testing methods.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diabetes afflicts 16 million Americans whose bodies cannot  
properly regulate glucose, also known as blood sugar. Many rely on 
insulin shots, while others require different medications and 
special diets. About 5 million diabetics, both those with juvenile 
and adult-onset diabetes, regularly test their blood glucose. 
</P>
<P>
	Maintaining tight control of glucose is vital for preventing  
blindness, heart disease and other complications of diabetes. In 
order to do this, diabetics must test their glucose levels several 
times a day, pricking their fingers to obtain blood, which is then 
tested by a small machine. 
</P>
<P>
	Health experts say an easier, more convenient testing method  
would motivate more diabetics to test themselves more often. 
</P>
<P>
	GlucoWatch, made by Cygnus of Redwood City, Calif., sends tiny  
electric currents into the skin, opening the pores and extracting a 
minute amount of glucose fluid. A sensor underneath the watch 
absorbs the fluid, then sends a reading, which appears digitally on 
the watch. 
</P>
<P>
	``This can be one of the most revolutionary changes in diabetes  
management,'' said Neil Ackerman, Cygnus' senior vice president of 
research. 
</P>
<P>
	The device, powered by a small AAA battery, is expected to sell  
for about $300, or three times as much as standard monitors. The 
sensors which are changed everyday cost about $4, or twice as much 
as test strips used in traditional monitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The GlucoWatch is intended to be worn continuously by the  
patient. The device takes glucose readings every 20 minutes for 12 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Once a day, a patient has to calibrate the device by performing  
a traditional finger-stick procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients may experience moderate tingling sensation when the  
device is first put on and some skin irritation. 
</P>
<P>
	Cygnus, which lost $39.4 million on $11.6 million in sales in  
1998, is looking for a marketing partner to help sell GlucoWatch in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Food and Drug Administration approved an  
implantable device that measures glucose levels continually for 
three days. MiniMed Inc.'s ``continuous glucose monitoring system'' 
is for doctors to use occasionally to customize patients' diabetes 
treatment.

<HEADLINE> Stewart Misses Put One Day Later  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEBANE, N.C. (AP) -- This time, the putt on 18 was only about 10  
feet. But this time, Payne Stewart missed it. 
</P>
<P>
	A day later, it hardly mattered.  
</P>
<P>
	The newly crowned U.S. Open champion joined Paul Azinger, Fred  
Couples and Hal Sutton in a charity event Monday at Mill Creek Golf 
Club. More than 2,000 fans showed up to catch a glimpse of Stewart, 
who sank a 15-foot putt on the 72nd hole at Pinehurst No. 2 on 
Sunday to win his third major championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``It still feels good,'' Stewart said. ``I expect this to feel  
good for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart arrived in Mebane, which is about 70 miles due north of  
Pinehurst, around midnight Sunday. He celebrated with friends at 
the house of his caddie, Mike Hicks, until early Monday morning. 
Hicks helped organize Monday's event, which raised money for the 
University of North Carolina Children's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, we drank a little champagne out of the (championship  
cup),'' Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
	He managed to stay awake through 18 holes at the Tar Heel Skins  
Challenge, signing autographs and joking with his fellow players. 
Each player was wired with a microphone Monday, so fans were 
treated to plenty of teasing and comic relief mixed in with the 
golf shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Azinger swung the flagstick above Stewart's head as he was about  
to putt on the 18th green. After stepping away and re-addressing 
the ball, Stewart pushed the putt to the right. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never had a chance at that,'' Stewart said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Players May Have To Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Former major leaguers who claimed they were  
cheated out of baseball card royalties may wind up owing money to 
owners because of the meager success of their lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury found last year that the ex-players had been underpaid  
but rejected a claim of fraud and awarded only $75,000 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial judge reduced the award to about $25,000 -- an average  
of $65 for each of the 384 players -- and granted a new trial on the 
dispute over the other $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge's decision was upheld by the state's 1st District  
Court of Appeal in a 3-0 ruling made public Monday. The damage 
award is less than the $47,000 they were offered in a pretrial 
settlement, said Martin Glick, a lawyer for Major League Baseball 
Properties Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Under California law, plaintiffs whose damages are less than  
they were offered before trial must reimburse the other side for 
court expenses incurred after the settlement offer. The payment, if 
any, would come only from the five ex-players who filed the suit 
and not from all 384 covered by the class action, Glick said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his client's costs after the settlement offer were about  
$84,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald Katz, lawyer for the former players, could not be reached  
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit was filed by a group of retirees led by Pete Coscarart,  
86, an infielder for the Brooklyn Dodgers and Pittsburgh Pirates in 
the 1930s and 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
	The other lead plaintiffs are longtime New York Yankees player  
and coach Frank Crosetti, former outfielders Bernie Carbo and Ken 
Landreaux and former piitcher Milt Pappas. 
</P>
<P>
	They challenged the operation of a program established by MLBP  
and a charitable organization in 1990 to license ex-players' names 
and likenesses on baseball cards and other products, such as 
decorative pins. 
</P>
<P>
	Royalties from products that used the name or picture of any  
ex-player among the 384 who joined the program were pooled and 
shared with all the players. Hall of Famers, the most in demand, 
got shares five times as large as those of other players. 
</P>
<P>
	The program paid $1 million in royalties before it was shut down  
at the end of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The ex-players lost their chance for substantial damages when an  
Alameda County Superior Court jury found that MLBP had 
miscalculated some of their royalty payments but hadn't 
deliberately cheated them. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court agreed with Superior Court Judge Demetrios  
Agretelis that the program didn't cover royalties from films and 
videos showing the ex-players, or from products created and sold by 
MLBP itself rather than by third-party licensees. 
</P>
<P>
	The opinion by Presiding Justice Barbara Jones also agreed with  
Agretelis' decision to order a new trial on disputed royalties from 
a baseball card series by Hi-Pro. Agretelis said the jury's 
decision that the program covered those royalties -- a majority of 
the total damages -- was not supported by the evidence.

<HEADLINE> Biologists Creating Beefier Tomato </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- Three Ohio researchers are using  
gene-splicing technology to try to grow a beefier tomato they hope 
will save the makers of ketchup, tomato paste and soup millions of 
dollars in processing costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``A beefier tomato will have higher solids,'' Jerome Servaites,  
research biologist at the University of Dayton who is part of a 
three-member team, said Monday. ``In making ketchup and tomato 
paste, you have to remove more than half the water, and that's very 
expensive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tomatoes grown for the processing market are usually about 95  
percent water. If that figure could be reduced by 5 percent or 6 
percent, the researchers say, it could save the makers of ketchup, 
tomato paste and other processed tomato products $75 million a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Servaites and fellow researchers Richard Sayre, an associate  
professor of plant biology at Ohio State University, and Candance 
Lowell, associate professor of biology at Central State University, 
want to amplify the activity of one gene and depress the activity 
of another to boost the production of starch in the tomato and 
reduce a natural loss of starch that occurs as tomato plants 
mature. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientists expect to confirm the genetic alterations in  
starter plants later this year and transplant them into soil. The 
plants are being kept inside a greenhouse at Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
	Margaret Mellon, director of the Union of Concerned Scientists'  
agriculture and biotechnology program, questioned the benefit to 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	She said crops that are genetically engineered could pose risks  
and should first be checked for safety before being put on the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, she said, changing a food through genetic  
engineering might cause allergic reactions in people who are 
normally not allergic to that food. 
</P>
<P>
	``The disturbing thing to me is there is no requirement that  
folks producing a tomato like this go to the FDA (Food and Drug 
Administration) and have it reviewed for safety,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Margulis, a genetics engineer campaigner for the  
environmental group Greenpeace, echoed Mellon's concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's likely to be problems,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	But Servaitis said he is confident in the safety of the tomato.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see any problems with this kind of thing,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The researchers' $44,000 project is funded by a grant from the  
Ohio Board of Regents. Similar work has been done at the University 
of Illinois.

<HEADLINE> Is Your Head in the Clouds? / Commentary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Achieving your financial goals may depend on how  
near to being correct you are on a seemingly simple question: Does 
reality lie with history or in the expectations of today? 
</P>
<P>
	Or, to be more specific, is the real world to be found in the  
period 1926-1998, when investors in stocks earned an average of 11 
percent a year? Or now, when day traders seek to make that in a 
day? 
</P>
<P>
	Simple to ask, hard to answer. And whether you're a small  
individual investor or the manager of a large portfolio, the answer 
becomes all the tougher after you've experienced triple-digit 
gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Stated differently: Could times really have changed so much that  
investors should routinely seek to double their money in months, 
when on average it took nearly seven years to do this in the past? 
</P>
<P>
	It's hard to believe that the record of history no longer  
applies. It's just as hard to disbelieve when you've quintupled 
your money in less than a year, as owners of Broadcom Corp. or 
Qualcomm Inc. have. 
</P>
<P>
	Has progress speeded up that much? Has time shrunk?  
</P>
<P>
	Nobody can offer proof positive, and reliance on so-called  
experts provides no assurance one way or another. You can take your 
pick of advice; they range from warnings that history will soon 
reassert itself to declarations that the best is yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
	Your choice, a tough one considering the consequences, which  
might include the affordability of tuition payments, early vs. late 
retirement, and general financial comfort as opposed to stress. 
</P>
<P>
	A bit of advice you can rely on: Given time, you can be a rather  
conservative investor and still have your big gains. Compounding 
makes it possible; given time, compounding works miracles. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts at Standard &AMP; Poor's not long ago worked up a startling  
illustration of that miracle, to wit, an investment totaling just 
$16,000 that provides the investor with $531,188. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, it takes time -- 40 years, in fact. But assuming a  
$2,000-a-year contribution for eight years, and a compounding rate 
of 10 percent a year, you would have that sum in retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Contrast that with the investor who waited eight years before  
making the same $2,000-a-year contributions. This person could 
contribute $2,000 a year for the next 32 years -- and have only 
$442,496. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what time does, but the power of time is often lost sight  
of in an age of impatience. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald Perritt, statistician, believer in history's relevance  
and founder of the ``Mutual Fund Letter,'' reminds us of a sobering 
statistical concept called ``gravitation toward the mean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In short, those long-term averages have a tendency to prove  
themselves again and again. It suggests, he suggests, that high 
equity returns could be headed lower than their long-term averages. 
</P>
<P>
	He can offer a basketful of evidence that prices are too high,  
but just one example illustrates: 
</P>
<P>
	Stock prices, measured by the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, a  
relatively conservative indicator, have grown at a 24.5 percent 
annual rate since 1995. But corporate earnings, upon which prices 
are based in the long run, have grown by only 1.9 percent a year. 
</P>
<P>
	With statistical gravitation in mind, he warns, ``Don't be  
fooled into extrapolating recent returns when setting your 
investment objectives.'' To do so, he says, is to have your head in 
the clouds. 
</P>
<P>
	But you can find plenty of advisers who take the opposite view.  
They emphasize that the market's recent gains are real, tangible, 
usable. ``Don't bury your head in the sand,'' they say.

<HEADLINE> Doctors Decry Claims by Dietary Aids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A delegation of doctors Monday asked the American  
Medical Association to seek a stronger federal law on dietary 
supplements that promise everything from banishing cellulite to 
boosting brain power. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're seeing doctors continuing to be frustrated by this,''  
said Dr. Ronald M. Davis, a member of the AMA's Council on 
Scientific Affairs, after speaking at the organization's annual 
policymaking convention. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patients are asking about these products,'' he said.  
``Patients are using these products and not telling the doctor 
about them. They have unclear, unproven efficacy; no government 
regulation; and now big pharmaceutical companies are getting into 
the act, and there's massive advertising.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA enacted such a policy six months ago at its winter  
meeting, but doctors on Monday said the AMA needs to put teeth into 
the policy. A vote on the issue could come this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current law, dietary supplements -- often used for  
medicinal purposes such as garlic for heart benefits and St. John's 
wort to relieve depression -- are allowed to be marketed without the 
prior approval required of drugs. But they are prohibited from 
making health claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're putting out a lot of medications out there that have no  
standards,'' said Dr. Richard A. Beach of Pensacola, Fla., a board 
member of the American Society of Addictions Medicine. He was 
referring to dietary supplements. 
</P>
<P>
	``St. John's wort has been shown to be very effective for  
depression,'' he said in an interview after addressing the group. 
But he recalled a study in Florida of 13 large pharmacies showing 
that their brand names of St. John's wort contained anywhere from 5 
percent to 250 percent of the amount of active ingredient claimed 
on the label. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Judy Linger, a child and adolescent psychiatrist in  
Lexington, Ky., testified about a woman she saw who had a seizure 
as a result of taking St. John's wort along with a prescription 
antidepressant. The woman was taking three prescription drugs and 
about 25 over-the-counter dietary supplements, mostly to lose 
weight, Linger said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to see the AMA work with the federal government  
to create accountability in the companies that are producing these 
products, and with the FDA, to have them regulate them as real 
drugs, because so many of them do contain active ingredients,'' 
Linger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis singled out Cellasene, which is marketed for reducing  
cellulite. He displayed a full-page newspaper ad that touted the 
product as ``the safe, clinically studied dietary supplement with 
natural herbal extracts that helps reduce cellulite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, he pointed to a footnote on the ad that said the  
statements had not been evaluated by the FDA and the product is not 
meant to treat, cure or prevent disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``To make a health claim in the headline, and then to say we're  
not really making a health claim is disingenuous, at best, and 
outrageous and needful of immediate remedy by the federal 
government and the FDA,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The day after the ad ran, the Italian manufacturer of Cellasene,  
Medestea Internazional, released studies it said backed the 
assertions about the supplement's effectiveness. It claimed Italian 
studies, using several dozen women, demonstrated that women could 
reduce their hip and thigh circumference within eight weeks of 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives at Rexall Sundown Inc., the U.S. distributor of  
Cellasene, were not available for comment, said company spokeswoman 
Lisa Givens.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up, Tokyo Stocks Advance / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The U.S. dollar was still sharply higher against  
the yen at midday Monday, boosted by talk that the Bank of Japan 
bought dollars to stem the Japanese currency's rise. Tokyo stocks 
advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.94 yen at midafternoon, up 2.62 yen from  
late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late Friday level in New 
York of 120.44 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 307.59 points,  
or 1.76 percent, ending the day at 17,738.85. On Friday, the 
average fell 39.19 points, or 0.22 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealing, traders believed the Bank of Japan bought  
dollars and sold yen Monday morning, although it was not 
immediately known at what level the bank stepped in. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders believe the apparent intervention came shortly after the  
Finance Ministry announced that Japan's trade surplus shrank by a 
greater-then-expected 31.5 percent in May. 
</P>
<P>
	``If in fact the BOJ did intervene above the 120.00 yen level,  
it shows their resolve to push the dollar up even further,'' said 
Shuji Takano, assistant manager of foreign exchange at ABN AMRO 
Bank in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	If the intervention did occur, it would mark the fourth time in  
less than two weeks that Japan's central bank has done so. On 
Friday, at the BOJ's bequest, the European Central Bank bought 
euros for yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 126.66 yen, up from  
122.73 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices started higher as foreign investors  
continued to buy stocks in hope that Japan's tenuous economic 
recovery may finally be picking up steam. 
</P>
<P>
	During a three-day meeting of the Group of Seven major  
industrialized nations, which ended Sunday in Cologne, Germany, 
other leaders maintained pressure on Japan to do more to ensure it 
is on a domestic-led growth path. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said that the Japanese government  
will take every measure available to ensure stable growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was up 22.76 points, or 
1.63 percent, to 1,419.05. The TOPIX lost 2.88 points, or 0.21 
percent, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.7800 percent from Friday's finish of 1.7300 percent, 
driving its price down to 96.77 yen from 97.18 yen.

<HEADLINE> Aetna-Prudential Merger Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prompting immediate objections, the Justice  
Department announced Monday that it will permit Aetna Inc.'s 
proposed acquisition of Prudential Insurance's health care business 
if Aetna sells its health maintenance organization business in two 
Texas metropolitan areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department and the Texas attorney general's office  
filed a civil antitrust lawsuit to block the merger, simultaneously 
filing a proposed consent decree allowing the purchase to go 
forward providing that NYLCare in Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth is 
sold. 
</P>
<P>
	This ``leaves an awful lot of markets as badly out of whack'' as  
the ones in Texas would be if they were included in the merger, 
said Dr. Nancy Dickey, president of the American Medical 
Association. She said New Jersey has a ``potentially worse'' 
anti-competitive situation than Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA asked the Justice Department last year to block the  
acquisition, arguing that Aetna's $1 billion bid to become the 
largest HMO in the country would harm patient care. 
</P>
<P>
	Dickey identified New York and Georgia as other states that  
would be adversely affected by the merger, as well as Florida, 
despite the fact that its large population of Medicare patients 
protects it ``to some degree.'' She said other states would be 
harmed as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas is ``a big win, but it's a first step,'' said Dickey. ``We  
clearly will have to work with other states.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Irving P. Ratner, president of the Medical Society of New  
Jersey, called the merger ``a harbinger of bad things to come for 
New Jersey with regard to our patients.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Together they will have a monopolistic organization which will  
control upwards of 35 or 36 percent of all of the patient care in 
the state of New Jersey if the merger goes through,'' said Ratner. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of the merger have 60 days to file objections. A federal  
judge in Dallas could then approve or disapprove the decree. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, Joel  
Klein, said the proposed settlement ``demonstrates the department's 
commitment to preserve competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna U.S. Healthcare responded in a statement, ``We do not in  
any way share (the Justice Department's) view regarding the 
potential effect of the acquisition on competition and physician 
reimbursements in Texas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Health care consumers are demanding more choice -- in products  
and in physicians -- it simply wouldn't make good business sense for 
us to take actions that would be contrary to this, including 
economic actions that could significantly reduce the number of 
physicians in our networks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richard L. Huber, Aetna's chairman and chief executive officer,  
said the divestiture in Texas ``was the most expeditious way'' to 
close out the Justice Department review process. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit said Aetna would have become the dominant provider  
of HMO and HMO-based point-of-service plans in Houston and Dallas, 
with 63 percent and 42 percent of enrollees in those areas. 
</P>
<P>
	A combination of Aetna, NYLCare and Prudential would have  
enabled Aetna to depress physicians' reimbursement rates in Houston 
and Dallas, said the department. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Attorney General John Cornyn said patients ``will benefit  
both from the lower health plan prices that competition ensures and 
the preservation of quality health care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna provides health care benefits to over 15 million plan  
members nationwide, while Prudential provides care to 5 million 
plan members.

<HEADLINE> Miami Wins Title With Team Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- This time, the ball stayed in the park.  
Finally, Miami coach Jim Morris had a new topic for the civic 
luncheon circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	With two big swings from Kevin Brown and a tricky curveball by  
Michael Neu, the Hurricanes at last delivered a national title to 
Morris, the only coach to reach the College World Series each of 
his first six years. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown homered in the second inning and hit a three-run double in  
Miami's five-run fifth, leading the Hurricanes to a 6-5 victory 
over Florida State in the national championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to win for coach Morris,'' Brown said. ``He has  
been here so many times. He definitely deserved to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neu threw the last two innings Saturday for his 16th save,  
retiring the side in the ninth and striking out Kevin Cash to end 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was trying to make the right pitch and focus,'' Neu said.  
``We were one pitch away from the national championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At that point, Morris couldn't help thinking about what happened  
in Omaha three years ago. Miami was one out from the title when 
LSU's Warren Morris homered in the Tigers' 9-8 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``It did cross my mind,'' the Miami coach said. ``I sure wasn't  
designing a ring in the dugout. I did remember what happened. I had 
a flashback.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neu made sure the ball stayed in the park. Cash missed on a big  
cut and the Hurricanes swarmed Neu with an infield pileup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike made a tremendous pitch, a great curveball that was  
impossible to take but impossible to hit,'' Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since losing the title on a dramatic hit by a player who shares  
his last name, coach Morris has repeatedly been asked about it -- by 
reporters, by fans, by diners at civic luncheons in South Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to admit it,'' he said. ``Sometimes, I had a very,  
very difficult time answering. I don't think people can understand 
how traumatic that was to our team and our coaches. It was 
crushing, just crushing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hurricanes erased those memories by beating Florida State  
for the sixth time in seven games between the intrastate rivals 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles got a gritty performance from right-hander Blair  
Varnes, a freshman making his first appearance in Omaha after 
tearing a knee ligament during the pileup when Florida State won 
its super regional. 
</P>
<P>
	Varnes will have surgery later this week, but he wore a bulky  
knee brace under his uniform against Miami. He couldn't extend his 
plant foot and he hobbled when he ran to field the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to be old and gray and regret that I didn't  
pitch for the national championship,'' Varnes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State coach Mike Martin had few options besides Varnes  
after using seven pitchers in a 13-inning victory over Stanford to 
reach the final. Varnes threw into the seventh, leaving with his 
team trailing 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
	``Boy, was he gutty,'' Martin said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles pulled within 6-4 in the seventh and 6-5 in the  
eighth after Ryan Barthelemy hit a leadoff triple over the head of 
center fielder Brian Seever and scored on John-Ford Griffin's 
sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, Marshall McDougall, who hit two home runs against Stanford  
and had an NCAA-record six in a victory at Maryland last month, 
flied out deep to left, with Mike Rodriguez making the catch on the 
warning track. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just put it up there in the wind,'' McDougall said. ``I got  
excited when I saw the guy at the wall, but it didn't go out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The victory capped a season of challenges for the Hurricanes,  
who won their last 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Catcher Russ Jacobson, a third-round pick by the Philadelphia  
Phillies, was lost to a forearm injury in May. Four pitchers, 
including staff ace Alex Santos, sat out with injuries at various 
times this season. So did Rodriguez, third baseman Lale Esquivel 
and outfielder Manny Crespo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way this team is, we knew we had to get good pitching and  
play good defense, and we made the plays when it counted,'' Morris 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hurricanes' victory ended a four-week tournament almost as  
the NCAA selection committee scripted. With the brackets expanded 
to 64 teams, seven of the eight top-seeded schools advanced to 
Omaha and the top two teams met in the final. 
</P>
<P>
	It also concluded a season in which teams played with modified  
aluminum bats. They were scaled down last year by the NCAA amid 
concerns for player safety and the game's integrity following USC's 
21-14 championship victory. 
</P>
<P>
	At this year's CWS, an NCAA panel continued its momentum on the  
issue by recommending that manufacturers make the metal bats 
perform as much as possible like wooden bats. A decision is 
expected this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Another announcement was warmly received by fans, coaches, and  
players. The NCAA and city officials have a preliminary agreement 
to keep the tournament in Omaha through 2005, with a five-year 
option after that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't imagine the College World Series being anywhere other  
than Omaha,'' Morris said. ``No one in the whole nation could do 
what they do here.''

<HEADLINE> Governor: Wife 'Feels Horrible' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Gov. Jeb Bush said Monday that his wife  
``feels horrible'' about failing to declare $19,000 worth of 
clothing and jewelry she bought in Paris, but did it so he wouldn't 
find out how much she spent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a lot of money. But look, that's between her and me,''  
said Bush, adding that his wife was embarrassed. 
</P>
<P>
	Columba Bush paid $4,100 in duty and fines to the Customs  
Service for failing to declare the merchandise upon her arrival in 
Atlanta last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor, who did not accompany his wife on the trip, was  
asked about the fine Monday before he signed a sweeping education 
reform package into law. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can assure you it was a difficult weekend at our house,'' he  
said. ``She knew that what she did was wrong and made a mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	International travelers do not have to pay duties on foreign  
purchases that total less than $400. Mrs. Bush declared only $500 
worth of merchandise.

<HEADLINE>  McGwire: No Postseason Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire knows two things for certain: He  
won't match his 70-homer season and the St. Louis Cardinals won't 
make it to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with 22 homers after connecting in his third straight game  
Monday night, McGwire is a month off his 1998 pace. And with the 
Cardinals 8 1/2 games out of first going into Monday night's game 
against division-leading Houston, he thinks it will be difficult to 
make up the gap. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to play too perfect,'' McGwire said. ``We can't afford  
to make mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire said the Cardinals must do more than acquiring a pitcher  
such as Curt Schilling or Kevin Appier. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just one player,'' he said. ``If it was two or three  
players coming into the mix and jelling, I think that might make a 
difference, yeah. But one player is not going to make a huge 
difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire thought the Cardinals would contend, but that was before  
season-ending injuries to starters Matt Morris and Donovan Osborne 
and before rookie J.D. Drew hurt his quadriceps in early May. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to sit here and say, yeah, we're going to roll off  
seven in a row,'' McGwire said. ``Knowing you have to play perfect, 
it's hard to do over a period of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis came off a four-game series against the New York Mets  
in which they lost three. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at what the Mets did all weekend, they capitalized on our  
mistakes,'' McGwire said. ``We just can't do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Going into the Astros series, McGwire was hitting .254 with 21  
homers and 54 RBIs. He hit his 22nd in the third off Sean Bergman, 
a drive to the second tier of the upper deck measured at 473 feet -- 
topped this season only by the 484-foot drive he hit out of Dodger 
Stadium on May 23. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not giving him anything to hit,'' batting coach Mike  
Easler said before the game. ``It's right on the corner, right on 
the black, or way the hell in. They're pitching him nasty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Tony La Russa pointed out even though McGwire hasn't  
recreated his 1998 magic, he's only two homers behind Sammy Sosa, 
the NL leader. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's right there with anybody in the league,'' La Russa said.  
``I think he's been pretty hot. I'll take what he's been doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So will McGwire.  
</P>
<P>
	``There won't be another year like last year, I just want to  
have a normal year,'' McGwire said. ``I don't know if I ever want 
to go through what I went through last year. I'd retire if I had to 
do that again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He doesn't want to hear that his projected home run total would  
make him the major leaguer to hit 50 or more in four straight 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pace,'' he scoffed. ``I don't know why people even talk about  
paces anymore. There's no pace for anything.''

<HEADLINE> Abbott Labs To Acquire Alza Corp. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORTH CHICAGO, Ill. (AP) -- Abbott Laboratories announced Monday  
it has agreed to acquire the Alza Corp., research-based 
pharmaceutical company located in Palo Alto, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the agreement, Alza shareholders would receive  
1.2 shares of Abbott stock for each share of Alza held in a deal 
worth an estimated $7.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our acquisition of Alza is an excellent strategic fit and an  
important step that builds our pharmaceutical business and 
accelerates Abbott's long-term growth,'' Abbott chairman and chief 
executive officer Miles D. White said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was announced after financial markets had closed.  
Shares of Abbott closed down 50 cents to $44.18 3/4 in trading on the 
New York Stock Exchange. Shares of Alza rose 25 cents to $46.25, 
also on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, expected to close by year's end, requires  
approval by Alza shareholders and regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Alza is a 30-year-old firm that until recently concentrated on  
developing drug-delivery technologies such as the nicotine patch 
and subsisted on royalties from the companies that sold the actual 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, however, Alza has begun developing its own  
pharmaceuticals, specializing in urology and oncology. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, it started selling Ditropan XL, a new one-a-day  
formula to control weak bladders. Ditropan XL is in direct 
competition with Detrol, an incontinence remedy released last 
spring by Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Alza, which employs 2,000 people, reported net earnings of  
$108.3 million in 1998 on sales of $646.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	North Chicago-based Abbott is a global, diversified health care  
company that develops, manufactures and markets pharmaceutical, 
diagnostic, nutritional and hospital products. Its brands include 
Similac infant formula and Ensure nutrition supplement. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott employs 56,000 people and sells its products in 130  
nations. It had net earnings of $2.3 billion in 1998 on sales of 
$12.5 billion.

<HEADLINE> Ramon Martinez Makes Rehab Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOWELL, Mass. (AP) -- As his family watched from a private box,  
Ramon Martinez walked off the field with a smile on his face after 
his first game appearance in nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez, who had rotator cuff surgery last June 30 after a 7-3  
start for Los Angeles, pitched two hitless innings for Class-A 
Lowell against New Jersey in a New York-Penn League game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very happy because now I'm back again,'' said Martinez,  
who struck out three and walked none. ``It was pretty good. I felt 
that I had very good control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although he was expected to throw about 50 pitches, Martinez  
decided to take himself out of the game after 33 pitches -- 
including 21 strikes -- and seven batters. Martinez said he ``didn't 
want to try and force it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't say that I'd be 100 percent, but I was good enough to  
get people out,'' said Martinez, who may joined the Red Sox after 
the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez was 123-77 with a 3.45 ERA in 11 seasons with the  
Dodgers, winning 20 games in 1990 and pitching a no-hitter against 
the Florida Marlins in July 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez said he wasn't nervous until he saw fans holding their  
``K'' signs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pedro throws the strikes,'' said Martinez, referring to the  
Red Sox ace, his 27-year-old brother. 
</P>
<P>
	Pedro and his parents watched Ramon's performance.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's the person I trust, who knows how I pitch,'' Pedro said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ramon signed with the Red Sox in March and received a $1.5  
million signing bonus as part of a two-year contract with a team 
option for 2001, a deal that could bring him about $24 million for 
three years.

<HEADLINE> Former Cub Santo Has Heart Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Former Chicago Cubs third baseman Ron Santo had a  
mild heart attack Monday and was hospitalized in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Santo, 59, a color commentator for Cubs' broadcasts on WGN  
radio, was stricken early Monday at a hotel in Denver, where the 
Cubs are to start a three-game series with the Colorado Rockies on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ron has spoken with members of the Cubs organization, and they  
say he is in good spirits,'' Cubs spokesman Benjamin De La Fuente 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's comfortable, alert and resting,'' hospital spokesman Jeff  
Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-time Gold Glove winner played for the Cubs from 1960-73  
and for the Chicago White Sox in 1974. Santo is in his 10th year as 
a color commentator for the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are all very concerned,'' said Steve Stone, who announces  
Cubs games for WGN-TV. ``The best news is that it is termed a mild 
heart attack. Many people don't get a warning, and I think he's 
fortunate for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Santo, a nine-time All-Star, had a .277 career batting average  
with 342 homers and 1,331 RBIs. Santo ranks in the top 10 among 
Cubs in games played, at bats, runs scored, hits, doubles, RBIs and 
extra-base hits. He led the NL in triples in his second season.

<HEADLINE>  Japanese Develop Tiny Robot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese electronics companies have developed a  
micro-machine the size of an ant that can crawl around thin pipes, 
inspect and even fix problems at power plants, officials said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The box-shaped robot is only 5 millimeters (0.2 inch) long, 9  
millimeters (0.36 inch) wide and 6.5 millimeters (0.26 inch) high. 
</P>
<P>
	It has a pair of round connectors on both sides that can be  
linked up with other robots for more extensive assignments. 
</P>
<P>
	With a weight of only 0.42 grams (0.0147 ounces), the robot can  
lift objects twice as heavy as itself and can move at a speed of 2 
millimeters (0.1 inch) per second, said Koji Hirose, spokesman for 
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi Electric Corp., Sumitomo Electric Industries Ltd. and  
Matsushita Research Institute Tokyo, Inc. developed the machine 
under the government's 25 billion yen ($206 million) ``micro 
machine'' project that began in 1989, Hirose said. 
</P>
<P>
	The robots are one of three types of machines designed for use  
in different environments, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The robots, which can crawl into the tiniest gaps around bundles  
of pipes, are expected to speed up inspection and repairs at 
electric and nuclear power plants because they can be sent in while 
the plants keep running. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists are working to add new functions to them so the  
robots can climb up and down a pipe while connected to other 
machines. They also plan to develop robots with motors and 
problem-detecting sensors.

	It has a pair of round connectors on both sides that can be  
linked up with other robots for more extensive assignments. 
</P>
<P>
	With a weight of only 0.42 grams (0.0147 ounces), the robot can  
lift objects twice as heavy as itself and can move at a speed of 2 
millimeters (0.1 inch) per second, said Koji Hirose, spokesman for 
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi Electric Corp., Sumitomo Electric Industries Ltd. and  
Matsushita Research Institute Tokyo, Inc. developed the machine 
under the government's 25 billion yen ($206 million) ``micro 
machine'' project that began in 1989, Hirose said. 
</P>
<P>
	The robots are one of three types of machines designed for use  
in different environments, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The robots, which can crawl into the tiniest gaps around bundles  
of pipes, are expected to speed up inspection and repairs at 
electric and nuclear power plants because they can be sent in while 
the plants keep running. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists are working to add new functions to them so the  
robots can climb up and down a pipe while connected to other 
machines. They also plan to develop robots with motors and 
problem-detecting sensors.

<HEADLINE>  Stephen King Alert After Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEWISTON, Maine (AP) -- Stephen King was conscious, alert and  
even cracking jokes following an operation to treat his shattered 
leg and collapsed lung sustained after being struck by a van. 
</P>
<P>
	The prolific, best-selling horror author remained in serious but  
stable condition, hospital officials said Sunday. King faces 
additional surgery this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been alert and he's in pretty good spirits,'' said Chuck  
Gill, vice president of Central Maine Medical Center, where King is 
recovering. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital spokesman Laird Covey said King had been talking with  
his wife, Tabitha, adding, ``I know that he has been cracking some 
jokes to the staff about his condition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said King was thrown 14 feet when he was hit Saturday  
by a Dodge Caravan in rural Lovell, where he owns a summer home. 
Lovell is about 115 miles southwest of Bangor. 
</P>
<P>
	King was walking south on the shoulder of the road at about 4:30  
p.m. when a motorist approaching from behind lost control of his 
vehicle after his dog got loose inside the van, Oxford County 
Sheriff's deputy Matt Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver stopped immediately after striking King, according to  
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was hurting, but he was able to communicate,'' said Baker,  
who responded to the accident. ``He was talking to me. He gave me 
phone numbers of where to call his family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He was in a lot of pain,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Gill said King suffered a collapsed lung and multiple fractures  
of the right leg and hip. He was also treated during surgery for a 
scalp laceration. 
</P>
<P>
	According to witnesses, the driver, Bryan Smith, 41, did not  
appear to be speeding, Matt Baker said. He said no charges will be 
filed against Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	King, who lives in Bangor, may have been on one of his daily  
long walks at his summer home when he was struck, Covey said. 
</P>
<P>
	King has written more than two dozen novels, including ``The  
Shining,'' ``Carrie'' and ``Pet Sematary.'' King's ``The Girl Who 
Loved Tom Gordon'' is on several best seller lists this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital has been deluged with calls wishing King well.  
</P>
<P>
	``We heard from the Times of London,'' said Gill. ``We've had  
people wanting to know where to send flowers and cards. We've had 
calls from all over the world from both his fans and the media.''

<HEADLINE> Qwest Lobbies U S West and Frontier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- U S West Inc., the Denver-based Baby Bell at the  
heart of a takeover battle, decided late Monday to proceed with its 
$32.2 billion merger with Global Crossing Ltd., spurning a slightly 
higher rival bid from Qwest Communications International Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest must now decide whether to raise its offer, take the  
proposal directly to U S West shareholders, or simply walk away. 
Joseph P. Nacchio, chairman and chief executive of Qwest, has said 
in recent days that he intends to win, but has no plans to up the 
ante. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Qwest and Global Crossing have ambitious plans to build  
global fiber optic cable networks to provide high-speed Internet 
access and other telecom services. The two companies both made 
offers to U S West and Frontier Corp., a Rochester, N.Y., 
long-distance and Internet company. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Frontier's board also decided to go forward with  
Global Crossing in a $11.5 billion merger. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Nacchio sent letters to the heads of Frontier and U  
S West, saying, ``We are confident that your board will determine 
that our proposal is financially, structurally and strategically 
superior to Global Crossing's offer and in the best interests of 
your shareholders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U S West, however, issued a statement hours later saying, ``At  
this time, the Board continues to believe its strategic merger with 
Global Crossing announced May 17 provides significant value to U S 
West's shareholders and will ensure that the strategic vision of U 
S West will be implemented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A call to Qwest on Monday night was not immediately returned.  
</P>
<P>
	The vision all of these companies share is how to reshape their  
operations to meet the Internet age. As telephones, computers, 
televisions and radios become one, companies like Qwest and Global 
Crossing are racing to provide the wires that will carry enormous 
amounts of video, audio and data traffic to homes and businesses 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest, based in Denver, launched a $55 billion unsolicited offer  
for both U S West and Frontier on June 13. But the appeal of the 
deal faded on the first day of trading as investors pounded Qwest's 
stock price. Qwest's shares have regained some ground, but are 
still off 19 percent from their pre-bid trading. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of trading Monday, Qwest's offer was worth about  
$44.1 billion, while Global Crossing's was worth about $43.6 
billion. The gap disappears, however, when including the break up 
fee U S West and Frontier would have had to pay to back out of 
their agreements with Global Crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing, a Bermuda-based company that is building an  
undersea cable network, was quick to claim victory Monday night, 
and is now hoping to avoid a drawn-out battle with Qwest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We remain focused on completing both transactions as quickly  
as possible,'' Robert Annunziata, chief executive of Global 
Crossing, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West's decision is also expected to be well received by the  
company's union workers, who were worried about an acquisition by 
Qwest which would lead to job cuts. The head of the Communications 
Workers of America warned the governors of the 14 states served by 
U S West that the proposed takeover would drain jobs and investment 
from the region and further imperil already-declining service 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West's stock rose 31 1/4 cents to $58.31 1/4 on the New York Stock  
Exchange, where Frontier's shares dipped 50 cents to $57.81 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest's shares fell $1.43 3/4 to $36.50 on the Nasdaq Stock Market,  
where shares of Global Crossing dropped $2.62 1/2 to $47.12 1/2.

	U.S., Europeans Pledge Cooperation  
</P>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- President Clinton and European leaders  
pledged greater cooperation today to ensure that minor disputes 
between economic giants don't mushroom into full-blown conflicts. 
Officials said the new conflict resolution would have been helpful 
in defusing two simmering fights involving European bans on bananas 
sold by American companies and U.S. beef raised with growth 
hormones. Clinton and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder announced 
that the leaders of the countries that will contribute the bulk of 
the money to rebuild Kosovo will meet with Balkan leaders at a 
summit next month in Sarajevo.

	Explosion Rocks Kosovo School  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- An explosion triggered by a land  
mine or a booby trap ripped through a school west of Pristina 
today, killing two Nepalese soldiers serving in the British army 
and two civilians, NATO officials said. The two soldiers were the 
first fatalities among the NATO peacekeepers since they entered 
Kosovo on June 12 to enforce the Kosovo peace agreement. One 
civilian was also injured, NATO said. The troops were clearing 
ammunition from a school in the village of Negrovce when a mine or 
a booby trap exploded, NATO said.

	Clinton Praises Slovenia  
</P>
<P>
	LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) -- President Clinton today praised  
Slovenia as an example of what a democratic Balkans could become 
and urged Serbia to ``reject the murderous rule'' of President 
Slobodan Milosevic. Clinton is the first president to visit 
Slovenia, the first Yugoslav republic to break with Milosevic. 
Clinton called on ``all the people of every part of Europe'' to 
choose democracy and respect for human rights over the politics of 
ethnic hatred. ``We want Serbia to be a part of the new Europe,'' 
Clinton said. ``But Serbia must reject the murderous rule of Mr. 
Milosevic and choose the path that Slovenia has chosen.''

	Court Upholds Texas Death Sentence  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today upheld the death  
sentence of a Texas killer who became the first person in the 
nation condemned under a 1994 federal death penalty law. The court 
ruled that Louis Jones' death sentence for a 1995 murder at an Air 
Force base is valid despite the less-than-clear instructions jurors 
received before voting for the death penalty. The court said jurors 
in death penalty cases do not have to be told about the 
consequences of their failing to agree on whether life or death is 
the appropriate sentence.

	Columbine Memorial Ideas Pour In  
</P>
<P>
	LAKEWOOD, Colo. (AP) -- More than 100 ideas for memorials to the  
massacre at Columbine High School have been submitted to a Colorado 
parks commission. The proposals arrived from as near as Littleton 
and as far away as Washington state. Ideas range from a brief note 
to an elaborate floor plan for a memorial resembling a Greek 
temple, with a cafe, theater and library. Two students went on a 
shooting rampage at Columbine in April, killing 12 students and a 
teacher before killing themselves.

	Evacuation Escalates to Near Riot  
</P>
<P>
	MONROE, Va. (AP) -- Students evacuated from their job training  
center after a bomb threat clashed with police because they were 
angry at being cooped up in stuffy buses, authorities said. 
Students spat on officers and threw cigarette lighters and 
balled-up T-shirts at them during the confrontation yesterday at 
the Old Dominion Job Corps Center. No one was injured, police and 
school officials said. About 40 police officers squared off against 
the students. The center was evacuated after authorities received 
two bomb threats telephoned from inside the campus. No bomb was 
found.

	New Ford Excursion SUV Price Set  
</P>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford's Excursion, which will be the  
biggest sport utility vehicle on the road when it debuts in 
September, will be priced starting at $34,135 for the base model. 
Suggested retail prices will range as high as $41,915 for a fully 
loaded 2000 Excursion Limited with four-wheel-drive and a V10 
engine, the automaker said. Ford has been criticized by 
environmental groups because the Excursion is so big and its fuel 
mileage is so low -- as little as 10 miles a gallon with the 
optional V10 engine.

<HEADLINE>  Frank Layden Quits As Starzz Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Frank Layden resigned as coach of the  
WNBA's Utah Starzz today because he is feeling old and wants to 
enjoy life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm at the stage in my life that ... when you buy a pair of  
socks you know they're going to last the rest of your life,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Layden, the 67-year-old president and former coach and general  
manager of the Utah Jazz, quit less than a year after taking the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 2-2 with the WNBA club this season and will be replaced  
by assistant Fred Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Layden will remain the Utah Jazz president and will do  
commentary on Jazz and Starzz broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was getting tired. Time is a precious commodity right now,''  
Layden said. ``I think this is all I can do. I've given it all I've 
got.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Layden had never coached women's basketball when he took over  
the team July 27, 1998, replacing Denise Taylor. He won only two of 
11 games last season. This year, the team was revamped and beat 
Sacramento in its last game on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' first game as head coach is Thursday when the Starzz  
again play the Monarchs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a dream for me. I didn't think it would come so soon,''  
said Williams, 42, who has been with the Starzz since the 1998 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	He compiled a 20-9 record as head coach of the women's team at  
Southern California between 1995 to 1997, advancing to the second 
round of the NCAA tournament in 1997. He was also an assistant at 
USC for 10 years, including the Trojans' 1984 NCAA championship 
squad.

<HEADLINE> Major Findings on Breast Implants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Major findings by the Institute of Medicine study on silicone  
breast implants: 
</P>
<P>
	--There is no evidence that the silicone used in implants is  
toxic to humans. Women who have breast implants are no more likely 
than the general population to get cancer, lupus, rheumatoid 
arthritis or other diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	--There is no established link between implants and a unique  
disease syndrome or harmful effects on the immune system. 
</P>
<P>
	--There is no evidence that mothers with implants pass silicone  
to infants when breast-feeding. Much higher levels of silicon -- the 
element on which the silicone family of organic compounds is based 
-- have been found in cows' milk and infant formula than in the milk 
of implant recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	--In developed countries, people are commonly exposed to the  
materials used in implants through foods, cosmetics, lubricants for 
machinery, hypodermic syringes, insulators and other products. 
About 10 million Americans have some type of medical implant, such 
as an artificial joint or pacemaker, and many are made at least in 
part from silicone. 

</P>
<P>
	But there are risks of complications within the breast itself:  
</P>
<P>
	--The implants can frequently break and leak. That risk varies  
according to the model of implant. Newer implants or those filled 
with saline instead of silicone gel may be less prone to leaks 
although more study is needed to know. 
</P>
<P>
	--Scar tissue can form around implants, just as the body often  
forms scar tissue around any foreign object. This can be painful 
and disfiguring. 
</P>
<P>
	--Implants may block a clear mammogram, so special imaging  
procedures may be required. However, women with submuscular 
implants seem to have less problem.

<HEADLINE> Five Life Terms for Gays' Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A man who said he killed five gays to stop  
the spread of AIDS was sentenced Monday to life in prison without 
parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Juan Chavez, 35, got five consecutive life sentences for the  
1986 and 1989 killings. He avoided a possible death sentence in 
March pleading guilty during his trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Mike Duarte said Chavez used the promise of sex to  
lure the men to their homes. Then, he forced them to disclose their 
ATM access codes, strangled them and stole their vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Duarte said the sentence was appropriate given inconsistencies  
between Chavez's confession and the details of the killings. He 
also said prosecutors believe Chavez may have killed other gay men. 
</P>

have done,'' Duarte said. ``We think he's probably the one that did 
it.''

<HEADLINE> New Blood Sugar Monitor Is Painless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An experimental blood glucose monitor that  
largely eliminates diabetic's need for painful finger-prick blood 
tests works as well as standard devices, according to a study being 
presented today. 
</P>
<P>
	A study of 39 diabetics conducted at the University of Colorado  
in Denver found GlucoWatch provided glucose values that were nearly 
identical to those obtained using traditional monitors. The 
findings were being presented at an American Diabetes Association 
meeting in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	GlucoWatch, the first largely noninvasive glucose monitor that  
is awaiting federal approval, automatically checks users' blood 
glucose every 20 minutes and sounds an alert if the reading is too 
high or too low. If approved, the device could be on the market in 
the next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The device, made by Cygnus of Redwood City, Calif., sends tiny  
electric currents into the skin, opening the pores and extracting a 
minute amount of glucose fluid. A sensor underneath the watch 
absorbs the fluid, then sends a reading, which appears digitally on 
the watch. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks very promising,'' said Richard Kahn, the  
association's chief scientific and medical officer. ``This will 
have value for a lot of people, and set in motion a whole new 
generation of testing methods.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diabetes afflicts 16 million Americans whose bodies cannot  
properly regulate glucose, also known as blood sugar. Many rely on 
insulin shots, while others require different medications and 
special diets. About 5 million diabetics, both those with juvenile 
and adult-onset diabetes, regularly test their blood glucose. 
</P>
<P>
	Maintaining tight control of glucose is vital for preventing  
blindness, heart disease and other complications of diabetes. In 
order to do this, diabetics must test their glucose levels several 
times a day, pricking their fingers to obtain blood, which is then 
tested by a small machine. 
</P>
<P>
	Health experts say an easier, more convenient testing method  
would motivate more diabetics to test themselves more often. 
</P>
<P>
	``This can be one of the most revolutionary changes in diabetes  
management,'' said Neil Ackerman, Cygnus' senior vice president of 
research. 
</P>
<P>
	The device, powered by a small AAA battery, is expected to sell  
for about $300, or three times as much as standard monitors. The 
sensors which are changed everyday cost about $4, or twice as much 
as test strips used in traditional monitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The GlucoWatch is intended to be worn continuously by the  
patient. The device takes glucose readings every 20 minutes for 12 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Once a day, a patient has to calibrate the device by performing  
a traditional finger-stick procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients may experience moderate tingling sensation when the  
device is first put on and some skin irritation.

<HEADLINE>  Real Soccer Moms Leave Their Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	As Joy Fawcett wandered the hallways at the U.S. national team's  
hotel, she ran into Carla Overbeck. The two standout defenders 
looked at each other and laughed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a lot of time on my hands and I spend it looking for  
things to do,'' Fawcett said. ``If someone tells me to sit down and 
relax, I have a hard time with not doing something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It comes with the job of being a soccer mom. Except that  
Fawcett, who has two daughters, and Overbeck, who has a son, have 
taken the concept to an extreme. 
</P>
<P>
	Both players took a leave of absence from the team to have  
children. And both came back despite the physical and emotional 
demands parenthood can have on a full-time elite athlete. Now 
they're playing in the Women's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get a lot of help,'' said Fawcett, whose older daughter,  
Katelyn, is 5, and younger daughter Carli is 2. ``My mom and dad 
are around, my husband Walter is great and very supportive, but it 
can be hard. If the girls are with me for training, they are away 
from their father. Or I am away from my family. But we are 
committed to doing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Talk about commitments. Look what Fawcett had on her plate in  
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	She coached the UCLA women, who made the NCAA quarterfinals, and  
a youth team, while also playing for the national squad and 
handling motherhood. She resigned from UCLA at the end of '97, but 
said she'll consider a return to coaching after she retires as a 
player. 
</P>
<P>
	The hardest part for the 31-year-old player/mother was not  
finding enough hours for everything. Fawcett struggled most with 
getting fit enough to recapture her place on the national team. 
</P>
<P>
	``The toughest thing was the speed,'' she said. ``When you get  
pregnant and gain that weight, you get a little slower. I don't 
know if it is age or the childbirth, but there are a few players on 
the team who are faster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's only one who can sympathize with Fawcett's family  
situation, though. Overbeck, the team captain, gave birth to son 
Jackson in August 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't realize the time commitment it requires to have a  
child,'' said Overbeck, also 31. ``Every second of the day is 
devoted to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it puts things in a greater perspective. No matter how  
tough a day you have at practice or how tough a game you have, he's 
there to cheer you up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's an added benefit of being a mom on the national team.  
</P>
<P>
	``Any time we've needed someone to watch the kids, well, I've  
got 19 built-in baby sitters,'' Overbeck said. ``I never was short 
on volunteers. We're all a bunch of kids on this team, anyhow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Orlando, Fla., Fawcett had a live-in nanny, Nicki Richards,  
who also traveled with the team. So both daughters accompanied 
Fawcett. 
</P>
<P>
	Overbeck did not have a nanny, but Richards would take care of  
Jackson whenever mom was training or playing soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's harder when we're not in residency, trying to find time  
to work out,'' Overbeck said.'' I had to change my lifting schedule 
to fit a better schedule for Jackson.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both players had doubts about the decision to have children and  
continue playing. 
</P>
<P>
	``You always wonder if you are jeopardizing your career,''  
Fawcett said. ``But it's what I wanted to do and we said we'd go 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a recurring thought: How will I make it back? It helped  
to hear from my teammates and to know they wanted me back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Overbeck, ``You're sitting there pregnant and you're  
wondering if you can ever be in that kind of shape again. But, 
somehow, you do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Motherhood has brought the two defenders even closer on a team  
known for his togetherness. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, yeah,'' Fawcett said, chuckling. ``We have war stories and  
we help each other out. Many a time I've yelled over to Carla, `I 
need a diaper.'''

<HEADLINE> Court Upholds Texas Death Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today upheld the death  
sentence of a Texas killer who became the first person in the 
nation condemned under a 1994 federal death penalty law. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, by a 5-4 vote, ruled that Louis Jones' death sentence  
for a 1995 murder at an Air Force base is valid despite the 
less-than-clear instructions jurors received before voting for the 
death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Most notably for all other capital-punishment prosecutions, the  
court said jurors in death penalty cases do not have to be told 
about the consequences of their failing to agree on whether life or 
death is the appropriate sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' lawyers argued that judges should be required to tell  
jurors that such failures will result, as spelled out in the 
Federal Death Penalty Act of 1994, in a defendant being sentenced 
to life in prison without chance of parole. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a capital sentencing proceeding, the government has a  
strong interest in having the jury express the conscience of the 
community on the ultimate question of life or death,'' Justice 
Clarence Thomas wrote for the court. ``A charge to the jury of the 
sort proposed by ... (Jones) might well have the effect of 
undermining this strong governmental interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones killed Tracie Joy McBride, a 19-year-old Army private at  
Goodfellow Air Force Base in San Angelo, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who had retired from the Army in 1993 after a 22-year  
career, confessed to abducting McBride from an on-base laundry room 
and taking her to his home in San Angelo. He said he later took her 
to an isolated area about 20 miles from the city and beat her to 
death with a tire iron. 
</P>
<P>
	He led police to McBride's body.  
</P>
<P>
	Convicted, Jones was sentenced by a federal jury to the ultimate  
punishment provided by the 1994 federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the jurors began considering the appropriate punishment,  
the presiding judge initially told them that they must reach a 
unanimous decision on one of three options: death, life 
imprisonment without possibility of release or ``some other lesser 
sentence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But later in the same instructions the judge mentioned only  
death and life in prison when discussing the 1994 law's requirement 
that the jury recommendation be unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors also were given four somewhat-confusing verdict forms,  
and the judge rejected Jones' request for instructions aimed at 
clarifying the jury's choices. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Jones' sentence,  
rejecting his argument that the instructions may have spurred some 
jurors who had been leaning toward a life prison sentence to vote 
for the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said jurors might have been worried that a deadlocked vote  
would result in a court-imposed sentence of less than life without 
release, and changed their vote to death so that would not happen. 
</P>
<P>
	In support of that theory, Jones' lawyers submitted affidavits  
from two of the sentencing jurors who confirmed that they and other 
jurors had been confused over the ramifications of a deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones contended that such confusion led to a violation of his  
8th Amendment protection against cruel and unusual punishment and 
his due-process rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's decision said the 5th Circuit court was right, and Jones  
was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no reasonable likelihood that the jury applied the  
instruction incorrectly,'' Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones also had argued that his trial judge erred in letting the  
sentencing jurors consider some aggravating factors that were 
unconstitutionally too vague or too broad. Thomas said they were 
not. Even if they were, he said, ``The error was harmless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and  
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. 
Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter  
and Stephen G. Breyer dissented, voting to set aside Jones' death 
sentence and order a new sentencing trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Jones vs. U.S., 97-9361.

<HEADLINE> Surgeons Transplant Cadaver's Bone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) -- Surgeons used a bone from a cadaver to  
save the cancerous right arm of a 6-year-old boy in a pioneering 
transplant that will enable the limb to grow as he does. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine months after the surgery, little Adam Johnson used the arm  
to toss around a baseball during a news conference Monday at Joe 
DiMaggio Children's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in September, doctors removed most of Adam's humerus, the  
upper arm bone, because of a tumor the size of a grapefruit. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctors then replaced it by taking the humerus from a dead  
child and fusing it with a piece of Adam's own fibula, the thin 
bone that runs from the knee to the ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	Cadaver bones are commonly used in transplant surgery. But  
surgeons said this is the first time a live bone with its blood 
supply intact was combined with a cadaver bone so that the 
transplant would grow along with the patient. 
</P>
<P>
	Adam will have a full-size arm when he grows up, surgeons said.  
If he had received only a cadaver bone, he would forever have the 
arm of a little boy. 
</P>
<P>
	Adam, who lives with his family in Nassau, Bahamas, hopes to  
become a professional basketball player. His father said he is 
overjoyed his son has a chance to lead a normal life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to thank the almighty God and the staff of the  
hospital,'' Anthony Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	In extremely rare circumstances, surgeons have successfully  
transplanted part of a patient's fibula to another part of the 
body, fusing it to whatever healthy tissue is left in the 
cancer-ravaged bone. The procedure was developed in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the fibula can fracture because of its narrow diameter.  
</P>
<P>
	In Adam's case, the surgeons decided to form a composite: They  
used part of Adam's fibula, with its blood supply and growth 
cartilage intact, and a cadaver bone to add strength and stability. 
The leg bone and cadaver bone are held together with a titanium 
plate. 
</P>
<P>
	The new procedure is ``a spinoff of the techniques used in  
Italy. It's not anything necessarily new and different, but it's 
really a new twist on old ideas. The combination is really the 
key,'' said Dr. Mark Thomas Scarborough, a member of the surgical 
team and chief orthopedic oncologist at Shands Hospital in 
Gainesville. 
</P>
<P>
	Adam is the second sibling in the Johnson family to be diagnosed  
with this rare form of bone cancer, known as osteosarcoma. His 
sister LaToya Johnson, now 11, had her arm amputated in 1996 and 
replaced with an artificial limb. 
</P>
<P>
	Five months before Adam's surgery, the boy underwent  
chemotherapy to shrink the tumor. He lost his hair but never 
complained, doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Adam did extremely well, in no small part due to his  
indomitable spirit and the support of his family,'' Dr. Michael 
Jofe, who led the 11-member surgical team.

<HEADLINE> Stewart: I Thought About My Father  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- Payne Stewart stood in front of the  
television and cried his eyes out. Ahead lay the crucible of 
another U.S. Open. What made tears flow, though, was something lost 
in his past. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before I came to the course today, NBC ran a piece about  
myself and my father,'' Stewart said. ``I just stood there and 
bawled. I thought a lot about my father. I probably got a lot of 
strength from that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Stewart was a furniture salesman who went out the door  
some mornings wearing a canary yellow sport coat on the theory that 
it was better to have a customer remember you for something than 
not at all. 
</P>
<P>
	But he never had to impress more than a half-dozen people at  
once. And when his oldest son stood over a 15-foot par putt on the 
last green Sunday at Pinehurst No. 2, the audience was several 
million times that. 
</P>
<P>
	But this time, it wasn't so much about inviting attention as  
proving he was worthy of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that I learned a lot from last year,'' he said. ``If  
you can learn from defeat, I think it makes you a much stronger 
player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Failure, it turns out, changed Payne Stewart more than all his  
past success ever could. A year ago, on a shimmering Sunday at the 
Olympic Club near San Francisco, he began the final round four 
strokes clear of the field, then missed a birdie putt from that 
same 15 feet at the last hole to let the championship escape his 
grasp. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic is nicknamed the Graveyard of Champions because the same  
thing had happened to Ben Hogan in 1955, Arnold Palmer in 1966 and 
Tom Watson in 1987. And in the way that a curse hounds its victims 
through the years, none of the three ever got hold of another major 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	When Stewart walked away from that disappointment, he vowed it  
wouldn't bury him. As a steady drizzle ranked the Carolina 
sandhills, he made good on that promise. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I wanted to do,'' he said, ``was give myself a chance. I  
never gave up. I kept plugging and I kept playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Stewart, a two-time Missouri State Amateur champion,  
wouldn't have settled for anything less. When Payne was younger, 
his father had him stand on his shoes and then waltzed around the 
room teaching him to dance. William died in 1985, but he willed his 
son more than good footwork, a golf game and a taste for outlandish 
clothes. Resolve was a quality that topped the list. 
</P>
<P>
	When Stewart won his first major championship, the 1989 PGA, it  
was cast as much the result of fortune than fortitude. Everybody 
remembered Mike Reid slumped over his putter after dropping three 
strokes to par over the last two holes -- not Stewart tearing up 
Kemper Lakes' back nine in 31 and closing with a flurry of birdies. 
</P>
<P>
	Even his first U.S. Open win, at Hazeltine in 1991, had the feel  
of a man in the right place at the right time. Twice, eventual 
loser Scott Simpson let Stewart climb out of a two-stroke ditch 
over the final three holes -- first to earn a shot at the playoff on 
Sunday, then again to win the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	But there were no questions left by the end of this one.  
</P>
<P>
	Stewart began the day at 1 under par, one stroke ahead of Phil  
Mickelson and two ahead of Tiger Woods. Another stroke back was 
David Duval and Vijay Singh. Stewart knew one or two of them might 
flinch over the course of the afternoon on a layout as tough as 
this one. But he also knew he was going to have beat one or all of 
them himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, it was Mickelson, about to become a father himself,  
who pushed Stewart the hardest. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice on the back nine, the left-hander wrested the lead away.  
But he gave it back the final time at the 191-yard, par-3 17th. 
There, Mickelson hit his tee shot to 8 feet and Stewart to about 
half that distance. Mickelson missed his birdie try and Stewart 
made his, setting up the final act. 
</P>
<P>
	On 18, Stewart dumped his drive into the right rough, hacked it  
out with a 9-iron and then hit a lob wedge to 15 feet. Mickelson 
took the more conventional Open route -- hit the fairway, hit the 
green -- to 25 feet. Again, this time much more improbably, he 
missed and Stewart made. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have made a cool story for my daughter to read  
about,'' Mickelson said, ``but it's still something special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exactly how special Mickelson may not realize until he's  
actually raised a family of his own. 
</P>
<P>
	But Stewart had no problem remembering the feeling when someone  
asked him whether this victory would supplant his first win out on 
Tour -- the 1982 Quad Cities Open -- as his most cherished memory. 
</P>
<P>
	``That will never change,'' Stewart said, ``because my dad was  
there to see it.''

<HEADLINE> Crate &AMP; Barrel Recalls Kids' Tables </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Home furnishings company Crate &AMP; Barrel is  
recalling about 4,300 children's tables that have six-inch holes in 
the center, because children's heads can become stuck in the holes, 
the Consumer Product Safety Commission said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Crate &AMP; Barrel, of Northbrook, Ill., said it has received four  
reports of children becoming trapped in the table openings, and 
that two children required emergency help to free them. 
</P>
<P>
	The tables in question were sold at the company's stores around  
the country and through a holiday catalog for about $75 alone or 
for $135 as a set with chairs. The tables, 27 inches by 27 inches, 
have a red canvas bag hanging in the hole. 
</P>
<P>
	Crate &AMP; Barrel will provide a free repair part that will  
permanently close the hole. Consumers should call the company at 
800-897-5919 between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. EDT.

<HEADLINE> Boston Facing Month Without Rain / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Not a drop of rain has fallen this month on farmer  
Bob Connors' corn, forcing him to pour 5 million gallons of water a 
week on his fields in a 24-hour irrigation effort. 
</P>
<P>
	But the crop still shows withering as it enters a critical,  
late-June growing stage. The weather reports have refused to bring 
good news, so Connors has stopped watching them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of scary,'' he said Monday. ``We're talking about  
losing hundreds of thousands of dollars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of rain promises problems for everyone, from Danver  
farmers like Connors to homeowners hoping for green lawns. 
</P>
<P>
	Some communities have already enacted mandatory or voluntary  
water bans. But meteorologists say it's too early to label the dry 
spell a drought -- the summer's end could bring enough rain to 
counter the dryness. 
</P>
<P>
	This month Boston has had less than one-hundredth of an inch of  
rainfall, compared to normal precipitation of 2.10 inches from the 
beginning of the month through June 20. Among other New England 
cities, Portland, Maine, has had 0.17 inches, compared to a normal 
2.32 inches; Providence, R.I., has seen a scant 0.015 inches, when 
it's used to getting 2.25 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of June rain follows an unusually arid April, tempered  
slightly by moderate May precipitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Simpson, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in  
Taunton, calls the recent weather pattern ``drought-like 
conditions,'' but said the dry weather would have to continue 
through the summer to be considered an actual drought. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson said the region is caught in a transitional phase as  
temperatures in the Pacific raise to normal levels after the La 
Nina pattern. Storm systems are being directed around New England, 
and preventing the low pressure systems off the coast that bring 
rain. 
</P>
<P>
	But predictions call for a 30 to 40 percent increase in the  
number of tropical storm systems large enough to be named this year 
in the Atlantic, Simpson said. That doesn't necessarily mean more 
major storms in New England, but it could bring regional summer 
rainfall levels up, though they'll probably finish below normal. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
	LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) -- Cars washed into lakes by torrential rain  
waters. Stranded motorists perched atop their vehicles waiting for 
rescue. In West Texas? 
</P>
<P>
	What began as a good sign for the farming season has turned into  
a problem for farmers who say too much rain can be as damaging as 
too little. In many areas, annual rainfall already has doubled that 
of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	To date, Lubbock has received just under 13 inches of rain this  
year. Last year, during the drought, Lubbock had .94 inches during 
the same period. Normal rain to this point is 4.21 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is that your crop has to dry out sometime,'' said  
Joe Richards, a cotton farmer near Slaton. ``If it didn't rain 
again for the rest of the year I'd be okay, but the crop needs to 
dry out or it's ruined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even more troubling for farmers are predictions by forecasters  
that the rains will continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect rain for at least a few more weeks and it's possible  
the pattern will hold up for a while,'' said Marty Mullen, a 
meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Lubbock. ``At the 
least it will probably rain for the next week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Tech soil expert Cary Green said the heavy rains already  
are taking a toll on crops. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime the amount of rain you get exceeds what the soil can  
hold you're going to have problems,'' Green said. ``It begins 
carrying off top soil and, in extreme cases, it can even wash away 
plants.''

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Pledges To Challenge Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Pat Buchanan pledged an intense  
grass-roots campaign in Iowa this summer, saying a strong showing 
in an August straw poll will derail the ``coronation'' planned by 
Republican Party leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening a five-day trip to Iowa, Buchanan said Monday that the  
same Republican establishment jumping on the bandwagon of Texas 
Gov. George W. Bush has led the party to defeat in the last two 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now the establishment is telling us who we must nominate  
again, and they had a coronation set up with George Bush,'' 
Buchanan said. ``We're going to tell the people of Iowa `take back 
your caucus from the Republican establishment.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush leads public opinion polls, though he's only campaigned  
once in the key early states of Iowa and New Hampshire. A first 
test of strength for the candidates will come Aug. 14 in a straw 
poll that Republicans expect to draw 12,000 activists. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan finished second in Iowa's caucuses in the last election  
cycle and he pledged a grueling schedule of grass-roots 
campaigning, stumping through 15 cities during his current trip. He 
has two more five-day trips scheduled before the straw poll is 
held. 
</P>
<P>
	``I intend to have a very strong showing,'' he said. ``Clearly  
Bush is the front-runner; he is the one to beat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan is telling activists that they shouldn't allow outside  
forces to dilute their treasured first-in-the-nation status. 
</P>
<P>
	With Bush leading among Republicans and Vice President Al Gore  
leading among Democrats, both have sounded general election themes 
in hopes of courting moderate voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan said Bush was making ``a mistake'' by looking past the  
GOP primary season. As a result, he said, GOP activists are more 
likely to be swayed by the hard-line conservatism of candidates 
like himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't find a better foil,'' he said. ``I really think  
it's time we nominate someone from the heart and soul of the 
party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From trade to foreign policy to economic issues, Buchanan said  
there's almost no difference between Bush and Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``He agrees with Clinton and Gore on all these issues,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan opened his Iowa trip at a treatment facility for women  
and children affected by drug and alcohol abuse and family 
violence. He said the explosion in drug traffic is more evidence 
that his tough line on trade is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, you've got to look at trade policies that allow  
trucks to come almost uninspected into the United States,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Holocaust Victims Compensated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The German government has agreed to provide  
235 American survivors of World War II concentration camps with 
about $18 million in compensation for their suffering, a State 
Department official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The compensation averages about $76,000 per victim, but the  
amount each will receive depends on the length of confinement. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany sent the $18 million to the U.S. Treasury Department  
June 9 for distribution to the survivors without announcing it 
publicly, said the official, asking not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald Bettauer, who led the negotiations for the State  
Department, said Monday the claimants have received the paperwork 
on the rewards. ``The claimants who've gotten back to us seem to be 
quite happy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The reparations grew out of a 1995 settlement of a 40-year-old  
court fight by concentration camp survivor Hugo Princz. The New 
Jersey man and 10 other Americans split $2.1 million from the 
German government in that case, which prompted a fresh U.S. review. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno asked the Justice Department's  
Foreign Claims Settlement Commission to try to determine how many 
other Americans might be eligible for German compensation. More 
than 1,360 claims were filed, but the U.S. government sought 
reparations only for those who were held in recognized 
concentration camps. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, hundreds of Americans, including U.S. soldiers who  
were prisoners of war and U.S. citizens who worked in slave labor 
camps, were turned away, according to attorneys representing those 
claimants. The settlement does not involve people who became 
American citizens after having survived concentration camps. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the German government approved the $18 million, Frank  
Barwacz of Chicago called the prospective settlement ``better late 
than never.'' He was liberated from Bergen-Belsen on April 15, 
1945, by British troops. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pain is still with me,'' Barwacz said. ``I have many  
nightmares. I'm crying at night in my sleep, especially seeing 
those Jewish children going to the gas chamber.'' Barwacz could not 
be reached for comment Monday.

<HEADLINE> Kournikova Tries To Focus on Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- No, she's not dating Brazilian soccer  
star Ronaldo. No, she doesn't have a boyfriend. And no, she doesn't 
mind the attention that has made her Wimbledon's cover girl. 
</P>
<P>
	Anna Kournikova dodged a dangerous first-round opponent Monday,  
beating Barbara Schwartz 7-6 (7-2), 4-6, 6-2. Then she shrugged off 
questions about her life off the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just concentrate on my tennis,'' she said. ``I'm here to  
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But for London tabloids and a swarm of photographers, the tennis  
is incidental. Kournikova, 18, is an international celebrity even 
though she has yet to win a tournament, much less a Grand Slam 
event. 
</P>
<P>
	And so at her postmatch news conference, the main line of  
inquiry was about her boyfriend. When Ronaldo was mentioned, 
Kournikova ruled out any romantic link with a polite smile. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last time I saw him was the only time I saw him, at the  
French Open last year,'' Kournikova said. 
</P>
<P>
	She was seen Sunday at the All England Club with her frequent  
companion, NHL star Sergei Federov, but said: ``I don't have any 
boyfriend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Has she split up with Federov?  
</P>
<P>
	``No comment to that,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Does she want a boyfriend?  
</P>
<P>
	``I have no comment,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Kournikova would rather talk about tennis, and she looked  
impressive against Schwartz, a hard-hitting left-hander who upset 
Venus Williams at the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a tough match,'' Kournikova said. ``I'm happy that I  
went through the first round. That's the most important one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She is paired for a quarterfinal showdown against seven-time  
champion Steffi Graf. 
</P>
<P>
	Kournikova says grass is her favorite surface, and she reached  
the semifinals in her only previous Wimbledon appearance two years 
ago. She missed last year's tournament with a thumb injury.

<HEADLINE> Report: Top 3 IDC Execs To Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The three top executives of Japanese phone carrier  
International Digital Communications Inc. will resign from their 
posts Tuesday following a takeover by Britain's Cable &AMP; Wireless 
PLC, according to a local news report. 
</P>
<P>
	The three are President Taketo Furuhata, 69, Chairman Gentaro  
Tsuji, 78, and Vice President Toshio Horiuchi, 65, Kyodo News 
agency reported Monday, citing sources close to IDC. 
</P>
<P>
	The most likely successor to Furuhata is Cable &AMP; Wireless Japan  
Ltd. Chairman Simon Cunningham, 39, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	An official at IDC would not confirm the report Tuesday morning,  
saying that the announcement of any personnel changes would be made 
following a stockholders' meeting scheduled for later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable and Wireless announced earlier this month that it would  
take a 97.69 percent stake in the Japanese carrier, beating out 
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. in a five-week bidding war. 
</P>
<P>
	The takeover -- the first to give a foreign firm a controlling  
stake in a Japanese phone company -- will cost Cable &AMP; Wireless 
$450.8 million in cash to buy the 82 percent of IDC that it does 
not already own.

<HEADLINE> Forbes: Billionaires Club Booms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Newly created Internet wealth and a rising stock  
market have expanded the world's billionaires club to 465 and 
pushed the collective net worth of the richest 200 working people 
beyond $1 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
	Fittingly, the man whose software runs the majority of the  
world's personal computers not only tops Forbes magazine's latest 
ranking of the world's billionaires, but he is nearly three times 
ahead of No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft co-founder and chairman Bill Gates, with $90 billion  
to his name, far outstrips the man in second place -- investor 
Warren Buffet, with $36 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The rankings, released Sunday, appear in the July 5 issue, the  
13th annual World's Billionaires list. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine said the collective wealth of the Top 200 working  
rich is more than double the $463 billion that the top 200 
billionaires had 10 years ago. Gates alone has as much money as the 
top 9 on the list 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates' net worth nearly doubled from $51 billion last year,  
briefly touching $100 billion in April before the stock market 
retrenched somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft also claimed two other spots among the top five.  
Co-founder Paul Allen was third, with a $30 billion net worth. 
Microsoft president Steven Ballmer fourth, with $19.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In fifth place were the Oeri, Hoffman and Sacher families of  
Switzerland with $17 billion from the Roche pharmaceuticals 
conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
	Tied for sixth place with a net worth of $16.5 billion were oil,  
rail and telecommunications magnate Philip Anschutz and Dell 
Computer Corp. chairman Michael Dell, who at 34 was the youngest 
among the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The top 10 list is actually a top 11, because the next four  
spots, eight through 11, are held by members of the Walton family, 
heirs of the late Sam Walton, founder of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. 
Forbes estimated their wealth at $16 billion each. 
</P>
<P>
	Dot-com billionaires from around the globe also were catapulted  
onto this year's list. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Walker, founder of Priceline.com, and Pierre Omidyar,  
founder of eBay, went from nowhere into the Top 50. Walker was No. 
25 with a net worth of $10.2 billion, while Omidyar was 36th with 
$10.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes has a separate list for what it calls the ``World's  
Working Rich,'' those who made their own wealth or are working with 
their inheritance. 
</P>
<P>
	In another list, Forbes ranked the estimated net worths of what  
it called the world's ``Kings, Queens and Dictators.'' Leading that 
category were the Sultan of Brunei, with $30 billion in wealth, 
Saudi Arabia's King Fahd with $28 billion, Iraq's President Saddam 
Hussein with $6 billion, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands with $5.2 
billion and Syria's President Hafez Al-Assad with $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's Queen Elizabeth II has either $450 million or $16  
billion, depending on whether you count the Royal Collection, which 
includes the crown jewels and is held by the Queen in trust for the 
nation.

<HEADLINE> Swiss College Football Idea Refuted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- The coordinator for the current Bowl  
Championship Series said he's not interested in a Swiss marketing 
firm's plan for a 16-team college football playoff to begin in 
2003. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not here to say there will never be a college football  
playoff,'' said Roy Kramer, BCS coordinator and commissioner of the 
Southeastern Conference. ``But I don't believe it will be run by 
someone in Switzerland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ISL, a Swiss-based marketing and licensing firm, first  
introduced its plan to Kramer last December. The firm has since met 
with many other conferences in hopes of drawing support for the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	ISL's $2.4 billion plan calls for a 16-team playoff that would  
begin in early December, with first-round and quarterfinal games 
played at the site of the higher ranked team. 
</P>
<P>
	The semifinals and title game would use three of the four BCS  
bowls, with the title game set for the weekend before the NFL's 
Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	While Kramer doesn't think the ISL's plan will work, he is aware  
of the push for a college football playoff. To counter it, the BCS 
plans a promotional campaign this fall for all bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer has a slew of reasons why he thinks the plan won't work,  
starting with the fact that the BCS plan runs three more years, 
then the Big 10 and Pacific 10 have a contract with the Rose Bowl 
for three years after that. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a six-year window that it can't happen,'' Kramer told  
The Birmingham News. ``You've got to have Ohio State and Michigan 
in the mix. You can't go sell it without them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer also said the timing of the proposed playoffs won't work  
because the first-round games would be played on college campuses 
during weekends in which the NFL season is still continuing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've done my share of TV negotiating, and we're talking about  
going head-to-head with (the NFL)?'' Kramer said. ``That's enormous 
television dollars. That's a tough nut to crack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer also said a playoff system could hurt the integrity of  
college football's regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	``College football is built on the regular season,'' Kramer  
said. ``Tennessee-Alabama, Georgia Florida, Florida-Florida State, 
USC-Notre Dame, Michigan-Ohio State -- that's the guts of college 
football, the backbone. If you put your eggs in the playoff basket, 
we deflate this,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer likened it to college basketball's regular season, which  
he said is second fiddle to the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NCAA tournament is everything to college basketball,'' he  
said. ``People don't care in January and December.''

<HEADLINE> Suspected Serial Killer Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MURPHYSBORO, Ill. (AP) -- Authorities today charged a  
railroad-riding drifter with the slayings of a father and daughter 
last week in Gorham, bringing to eight the number of slayings 
linked to the suspected serial killer. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities found fingerprint evidence directly tying Rafael  
Resendez-Ramirez to the Illinois killings, Jackson County States 
Attorney Mike Wepseic said. Resendez-Ramirez is wanted for 
questioning in five killings in Texas and one in Kentucky since 
August 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	An FBI task force of local, state and federal officers has been  
hunting for Resendez-Ramirez since authorities began connecting the 
killings earlier this month. All eight slayings took place on or 
near railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies of George Morber, 80, and his 52-year-old daughter,  
Carolyn Frederick, were found Tuesday in his home in the southern 
Illinois town of Gorham. The house is only 100 yards from railroad 
tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Resendez-Ramirez was charged in Illinois with first-degree  
murder and home invasion, authorities said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Resendez-Ramirez is accused of shooting Morber in the head with  
a shotgun and beating Frederick in the head with the shotgun. State 
and federal authorities declined to reveal any other details about 
the crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Morber's truck was recovered Wednesday from a school parking lot  
in Cairo, about 60 miles south of Gorham. Authorities said today 
that fingerprints found on it matched the suspect's. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson County Sheriff Bill Kilquist said authorities believe  
Resendez-Ramirez has fled the area. 
</P>

	In Houston today, FBI spokesman Rolando Moss said  
Resendez-Ramirez also has been charged with federal unlawful flight

<HEADLINE> Columbine Memorial Ideas Pour In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKEWOOD, Colo. (AP) -- Stained-glass artist Barb Fowler was  
1,100 miles away in her hometown of Dayton, Ohio, when she learned 
of the massacre at Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fowler expressed her anguish through her art, designing a  
memorial of 13 stained-glass steppingstones engraved with the names 
of the 12 students and teacher killed April 20 by two Columbine 
teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
	Her design is one of more than 100 ideas for memorials submitted  
to to the Foothills Parks and Recreation District. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Easton, district executive director, is coordinating the  
project, along with school, parks and county officials, who are in 
the initial stages of reviewing designs, picking a site and lining 
up the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Although no budget has been set, three funds established by the  
parks district, school district and Jefferson County have set aside 
$25,000. About 28 offers of in-kind services have been made by 
contractors, landscapers and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever design is chosen, ``the real key is a high level of  
involvement by the high school students, the parents, victims and 
families,'' Easton said. ``We want to be sure it accurately 
reflects their desires.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The site has not been chosen, although public sentiment seems to  
favor Clement Park, where a makeshift memorial sprang up next to 
the high school soon after the shootings in Littleton. 
</P>
<P>
	Easton expects a committee of 20 to 25 people, including local  
officials, victims and other members of the public, to make the 
final decision. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no talk of remembering the gunmen, Dylan Klebold and  
Eric Harris, who ended their rampage of bombs and bullets by 
killing themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals stacked on Easton's desk arrived from as near as  
Littleton and as far away as Washington state. Many were created by 
artists, but just as many were not. Some people have children at 
Columbine or are alumni; others have no connection other than their 
sorrow. 
</P>
<P>
	The ideas range from a brief note asking that any design include  
the columbine -- the bell-shaped state flower -- to an elaborate 
floor plan for a memorial resembling a Greek temple, with a cafe, 
theater and library. 
</P>
<P>
	One artist sees a pair of 7-foot bronze hands cupping a  
columbine. Another proposes a sobbing angel in a field of 
columbines, her body draped over a tombstone inscribed with the 
victims' names. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver graphic artist Art Zohn, whose daughter will be a senior  
at Columbine this fall, envisions 13 marble benches, a waterfall 
and a stained-glass window looking out on the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many of the people who submitted proposals, Zohn said he  
``had to do it to get it out of my system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sculptor Randy Rau, a 1979 graduate of Columbine, has suggested  
a large bronze bell that would ring 13 times each year on the 
anniversary of the shootings. Thirteen concrete pillars intertwined 
by a bronze ribbon held up by 13 doves would surround the bell. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Rohrbough, the father of victim 15-year-old Dan Rohrbough,  
said he would like to see the memorial in Clement Park, ``but 
that's not as big a concern to me as that, overall, every family 
has the opportunity to be involved if they would like to and every 
family has the right of refusal if there's something they object to 
or something that's not in it that they want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fowler said whichever design is chosen, it is important for  
a memorial to be built ``so that nobody forgets. That would be the 
worst tragedy of all.''

<HEADLINE> Frank Layden Quits As Starzz Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Frank Layden resigned as coach of the  
WNBA's Utah Starzz today because he is feeling old and wants to 
enjoy life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm at the stage in my life that ... when you buy a pair of  
socks you know they're going to last the rest of your life,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Layden, the 67-year-old president and former coach and general  
manager of the Utah Jazz, quit less than a year after taking the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 2-2 with the WNBA club this season and will be replaced  
by assistant Fred Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Layden will remain the Utah Jazz president and will do  
commentary on Jazz and Starzz broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was getting tired. Time is a precious commodity right now,''  
Layden said. ``I think this is all I can do. I've given it all I've 
got.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Layden had never coached women's basketball when he took over  
the team July 27, 1998, replacing Denise Taylor. He won only two of 
11 games last season. This year, the team was revamped and beat 
Sacramento in its last game on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' first game as head coach is Thursday when the Starzz  
again play the Monarchs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a dream for me. I didn't think it would come so soon,''  
said Williams, 42, who has been with the Starzz since the 1998 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	He compiled a 20-9 record as head coach of the women's team at  
Southern California between 1995 to 1997, advancing to the second 
round of the NCAA tournament in 1997. He was also an assistant at 
USC for 10 years, including the Trojans' 1984 NCAA championship 
squad. 
</P>
<P>
	The Starzz feature Natalie Williams, the former Most Valuable  
Player of the defunct ABL, who is averaging nearly 18 points and 12 
rebounds a game this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel great about Fred,'' Starzz general manager Fred Howells  
said. ``Fred has been with the organization long enough to 
understand the things that we stand for. His coaching credentials 
are impressive and I think this is a great transition for the 
franchise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Layden came to Utah as the general manager of the Jazz in 1979,  
a month after the franchise announced plans to relocate from New 
Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	He began coaching the team during the 1981-82 season and had a  
277-294 record in eight seasons. In his third season, Layden earned 
the NBA Coach of the Year award.

<HEADLINE> China Oil Co. Wants Listing on NYSE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- As part of a sweeping overhaul, China's  
biggest oil company wants to list its shares on the New York Stock 
Exchange as early as this year, a company official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	State-owned China National Petroleum Corp. is under government  
pressure to reassess its assets, slash its work force and increase 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans to sell stock abroad could delay a widely anticipated  
listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange by another state firm, 
China National Offshore Oil Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government wants CNPC to become China's first state oil  
company to get listed,'' the official told Dow Jones Newswires. He 
spoke on customary condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The official said some foreign investors have expressed concern  
about the value of CNPC assets. 
</P>
<P>
	CNPC plans to divide its operations among five holding  
companies, focusing on oil exploration, sales, refining and other 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	CNPC is expected to retain only 300,000 of its 1.54 million  
employees. The rest are to be reorganized into companies that sell 
CNPC services on a contract basis.

<HEADLINE> Study: National Homeownership Soars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- The lowest mortgage interest and  
unemployment rates since the 1960s sent national homeownership 
rates soaring in 1998, and will probably continue to do so for the 
next decade, according to a study released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The state of housing in America is very, very good,'' said  
Nicolas Retsinas, director of Harvard University's Joint Center for 
Housing Studies. ``We continue to set records in a variety of 
different areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report, ``The State of the Nation's Housing: 1999,'' found  
the national homeownership rate reached 66.3 percent last year. 
Additionally, about 1.8 million homes have been built each year 
since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the growth has occurred outside of cities and in the  
South and the West. 
</P>
<P>
	The report says that increases in immigration and in the number  
of young or newly formed households will fuel a continued increase 
in the housing market for the next 10 years. Meanwhile, as baby 
boomers become senior citizens, they are expected to help sustain 
the home remodeling market as they revamp their homes, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But while the housing boom has created prosperity for some, it  
hasn't done much for others -- especially minorities and the working 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are Dickensian times, almost,'' Retsinas said. ``You  
know -- it's the best of times and the worst of times. The irony is, 
this prosperity exacerbates some problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although more minorities are buying homes because of low  
interest rates and specially tailored mortgage loan programs, the 
gap between white and nonwhite home ownership widened between 1994 
and 1998, the report found. 
</P>
<P>
	Education is a major factor in that gap. For minorities, the  
likelihood of becoming a homeowner increases dramatically with the 
completion of a bachelor's degree, Retsinas said. 
</P>
<P>
	The brisk housing market has also driven rent prices upward, and  
the report warns that this is causing problems for the working poor 
and those newly off welfare. 
</P>
<P>
	Some property owners are dropping out of federal affordable  
housing subsidy programs in which landlords agree to rent their 
properties to low-income people, who then pay about 30 percent of 
their income as rent. 
</P>
<P>
	``For no state in the nation could a household with one person  
making $7 per hour working 52 weeks a year be able to pay for a 
two-bedroom apartment without exceeding the 30 percent of their 
income standard,'' Retsinas said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Housing policy has been predicated on the premise that if you  
work, you will be able to afford housing,'' he added. ``The whole 
housing policy is brought into question.''

<HEADLINE> New Ford Excursion SUV Price Set </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co.'s Excursion, which will be  
the biggest sport utility vehicle on the road when it debuts in 
September, will be priced starting at $34,135 for the base model. 
</P>
<P>
	Suggested retail prices will range as high as $41,915 for a  
fully loaded 2000 Excursion Limited with four-wheel-drive and a V10 
engine, the automaker said Monday. The base price of $34,135 is for 
an XLT version with standard two-wheel drive. The prices include a 
$675 destination charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The list prices are lower than what many analysts expected.  
</P>
<P>
	George Peterson, an analyst with AutoPacific Inc., said the  
prices were ``pretty reasonable'' and will make the Excursion 
competitive with the most popular versions of its General Motors 
Corp. rivals, the Chevrolet and GMC Suburbans. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices for the '99 Chevrolet Suburban range from $26,640 for the  
base 1500 model with two-wheel drive to $39,640 for a 2500 model 
with four-wheel-drive, V8 engine and the LT option package. 
</P>
<P>
	GM is preparing for the new competition by redesigning the  
Suburbans for the 2000 model year; the GMC version will be renamed 
the Yukon XL. Prices for the new models have not yet been 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford has been criticized by environmental groups because the  
Excursion is so big and its fuel mileage is so low -- as little as 
10 miles a gallon with the optional V10 engine. Ford notes all 
three engines available on the Excursion will meet California's 
low-emission standard for light trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Excursion will come with a choice of either a 5.4-liter V8,  
a 6.8-liter V10 or a 7.3-liter diesel V8. The truck, to be built on 
Ford's Super Duty pickup truck chassis in Louisville, Ky., seats up 
to nine people in three rows. It measures nearly 19 feet long and 
just under 7 feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
	The Excursion will be available Sept. 30, but its dealers  
already are taking orders, Ford said.

<P>
	GARY, Ind. (AP) -- Henry Bennett, a civil rights leader who  
fought for the rights of blacks, teachers and blind people, died 
Tuesday. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett headed the Gary chapter of the National Association for  
the Advancement of Colored People for 12 years until 1992, building 
its membership to the largest in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	When he lost his vision in 1993, he championed for rights for

<P>
	SANIBEL ISLAND, Fla. (AP) -- Clifton Fadiman, a writer, book  
editor, radio and television entertainer, died Sunday. He was 95. 
</P>
<P>
	He penned more than 65 introductions to a wide range of editions  
including ``War and Peace,'' ``The Martian Chronicles'' and ``Six 
by Seuss.'' He was awarded the National Book Award for 
Distinguished Contribution to American Letters in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1985, he was named editor for ``A World Treasury of  
Children's Literature,'' Britannica Junior Encyclopedia, the Young 
Children's Encyclopedia and other works, winning the Dorothy C. 
McKenzie Award for contribution to children's literature. 
</P>
<P>
	Fadiman probably will be best remembered for his mostly  
anonymous role as senior judge for the Book-of-the-Month Club. It's 
a relationship he fostered for more than half a century, starting 
in the early '40s. Despite losing his sight, he continued to make 
selections, listening to audio versions well into his 90s. 
</P>
<P>
	Fadiman became an associate editor and then editor-in-chief at  
Simon &AMP; Schuster. He also wrote articles and became book editor for 
The New Yorker, a position he held from 1933 to 1943. 
</P>
<P>
	Fadiman tried his hand at radio, serving as master of ceremonies  
for the top-10 hit ``Information Please,'' which ran for a decade 
starting in 1938. That was followed by the television program 
``This is Show Business,'' and another stint on radio as the host 
of ``Conversation'' from 1954-57.

<HEADLINE> Bush Faces Criticism From Democrats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush sounds broad  
themes on the presidential campaign trail, but when he signs state 
legislation he has sketched in the details of his stands on such 
hot-button issues as limiting cities' lawsuits against gun 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	Filling in the blanks may leave him vulnerable to criticism,  
analysts say, but his actions may also appeal to conservatives and 
help address criticism that the perceived Republican presidential 
front-runner doesn't have the experience needed to lead the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Already, the Democrats are attacking him as insufficiently  
experienced to be president,'' said Larry J. Sabato, director of 
the Center for Governmental Studies at the University of Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	``His counterargument is well-served by these bills -- that is,  
being governor of a nation-state for six years means that 
inevitably you deal with the wide range of subjects that a 
president deals with, at least domestically,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Goldford, political scientist at Drake University in Des  
Moines, Iowa, said Bush isn't known as a national figure with his 
own agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything like this that might give an indication of where he  
stands on issues of national importance is certainly helpful,'' 
Golford said. ``At the same time, I think he's got some wiggle 
room. ... He can always say being governor of Texas is different 
from being president of the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Bush can wiggle only so far before being accused of  
flip-flopping, Goldford added. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of bills he signed into law may particularly please  
conservative Republicans as they choose their presidential nominee, 
said political consultant Bill Miller, who has represented 
Republicans and Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	With Bush-backed measures to notify parents when their minor  
daughters seek abortions, deregulate the electric utility market 
and cut taxes, ``you've got something for everybody right of center 
in the Republican Party,'' Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Bush said that if elected president, he would  
increase the federal government's role in encouraging sexual 
abstinence by teen-agers to prevent sexually transmitted disease 
and unwanted pregnancies. 
</P>
<P>
	When Bush signed legislation limiting Texas cities' ability to  
sue gun sellers and manufacturers -- a move his office said was 
meant to discourage frivolous lawsuits -- he immediately drew fire 
from Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some want to pass new protections for gun manufacturers to  
protect the gun manufacturers against lawsuits from cities who want 
to protect their citizens,'' the vice president said. ``I will 
fight for new protections for families, to get guns off the 
streets, out of the schools, and away from criminals and away from 
the hands of children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Buchanan, political scientist at the University of Texas  
at Austin, said the gun-control issue could be Bush's ``biggest 
weakness right now, as to something that might generate a public 
reaction.'' So far, he said, there's been none. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has other accomplishments he can point to.  
</P>
<P>
	A school funding measure will give teachers a $3,000  
across-the-board pay raise and provide $1.35 billion in property 
tax relief. It also includes a Bush proposal to curb social 
promotion, the practice of passing students from grade to grade 
even when they're not academically ready. 
</P>
<P>
	Sabato said the products of this year's Texas legislative  
session have particularly strengthened Bush with the GOP 
constituency he needs to get the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think education is one of the central issues that will win  
over suburban moderates, but in other areas, such as abortion and 
guns, Texas is to the right of the American mainstream,'' Sabato 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's signing of close to 1,600 bills put political researchers  
to work hoping to find a misstep, said political consultant Chuck 
McDonald, who worked for former Democratic Texas Gov. Ann Richards. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have people who are being paid to find fault with anything  
that has George W. Bush's name on it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Graf Frets on Doubles With McEnroe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- She's won 22 Grand Slams singles  
titles, rejuvenated her career two weeks ago by winning the French 
Open and has run up $21 million in tennis earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	So what makes Steffi Graf nervous?  
</P>
<P>
	It certainly wasn't her easy opening match Monday at Wimbledon,  
a 6-1, 6-4 decision over Ludmila Cervanova. She showed hardly a 
hint of her serve-and-volley game in beginning her bid for an 
eighth Wimbledon singles title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm keeping that for a more important time,'' said the  
second-seeded Graf. 
</P>
<P>
	What worries her is teaming with John McEnroe in mixed doubles.  
The other day he described her as a ``tennis goddess.'' Now that's 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never had that (comparison), ever. I appreciate it,''  
said Graf, cracking a slight smile. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what to say, but I hope it doesn't make me more  
nervous playing with him. I admire his talents so much. That's the 
one player I've always enjoyed the most watching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her second-round match with Mariaan De Swardt also has her  
concerned. Four years ago at Brighton, England, De Swardt beat Graf 
in three sets. At the time, Graf said that was ``the best a woman 
ever played against me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De Swardt defeated Jolene Watanabe of the United States 6-1, 6-4  
on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to be an easy second round,'' Graf said.  
</P>
<P>
	Graf, who turned 30 just a few days ago, is two short of Martina  
Navratilova's record nine Wimbledon singles titles -- and also two 
shy of Margaret Court's record of 24 Grand Slam singles crowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Her startling announcement after the French Open that she  
wouldn't return has prompted British newspapers to suggest that if 
she wins again this will also be her last Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know,'' she said. ``I really don't. It's nothing that  
I think about right now. It (the French) is something that came in 
a moment after the finals -- and it's nothing that I thought about 
any earlier than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graf said winning the French hadn't changed a thing. Well, not  
much. 
</P>

	``It's not that I feel I need to do anything different after  
Paris,'' she said. ``It took something away -- not pressure -- but it 
made it easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Against Cervanova, Graf dipped low to slice her backhands, and  
hit her famous forehand with off-and-on authority. There was no 
sign of knee surgery and back problems that kept her out of four 
Grand Slams until she returned to Wimbledon a year ago, only to 
lose in the third round. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the last few weeks I've been able to train more than I'd  
been able to before Paris,'' she said. ``I felt that in Paris I 
wasn't serving as well as I could and I know that's going to be 
important for here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But is her speed -- her most important weapon -- what it used to  
be? 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope it's still a big asset,'' she said. ``I feel pretty  
good out there for my age.''

<HEADLINE> NAACP Receives Million-Dollar Gift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- After an injury ended his athletic career,  
Reginald Lewis went on to Wall Street and, as owner of TLC Beatrice 
International Holdings Inc., became the first black entrepreneur to 
control a billion-dollar company. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation he established gave the NAACP on Monday $1  
million to fund training for budding black business leaders who 
might someday become like him. 
</P>
<P>
	The money will allow the National Association for the  
Advancement of Colored People to continue funding a summer business 
program, called the NAACP Reginald F. Lewis Youth Entrepreneurial 
Institute, for the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
	NAACP President Kweisi Mfume joined Loida Nicolas Lewis, who  
became chairman of TLC Beatrice after her husband's death, at a 
news conference to announce the grant. The announcement was made at 
Morgan State University, a historically black college. 
</P>
<P>
	This summer, 120 high school students will take the four-week  
NAACP business course, which includes classes on finance, team 
building and etiquette. The program, first started in 1994, will be 
offered this year in Baltimore; Atlanta; Austin, Tex.; Charlotte, 
N.C.; Columbia, S.C.; Fort Lauderdale, Fla; Gary, Ind.; and 
Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Mfume said the program is needed to bolster the number of black  
entrepreneurs in America, something that is ``simply not going to 
happen in a vacuum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a talent pool we're creating here,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Lewis formed TLC Beatrice in a $985 million buyout funded partly  
by junk bond mastermind Michael Milken in 1987. Forbes magazine 
listed Lewis among the 400 richest Americans in 1992, when his net 
worth was an estimated $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1987, when TLC Beatrice reported revenue of $1.8 billion, it  
became the first black-owned company to record more than $1 billion 
in annual sales. The company then began its reign at the top of 
Black Enterprise magazine's annual list of the country's 100 
biggest black-owned companies. 
</P>
<P>
	But the largely European food conglomerate will be liquidated in  
the coming months, Mrs. Lewis said in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis died of brain cancer in 1993 at age 50. His widow had not  
originally intended to liquidate the company but management 
convinced her it was the best course for investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Lewis called the decision to team up with the NAACP to  
endow the institute a ``no-brainer.'' She said her husband, who 
attended Dunbar High School in Baltimore and eventually went on to 
graduate from Harvard Law School, ``believed in education.''

<HEADLINE> Treasury Bills' Interest Rates Fall / T-Bills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury  
securities declined in Monday's auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department sold $7.51 billion in three-month bills  
at a discount rate of 4.610 percent, down from 4.620 percent last 
week. An additional $7.51 billion was sold in six-month bills at a 
rate of 4.850 percent, down from 4.855 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-month rate was the lowest since June 7, when the bills  
sold for 4.510 percent. The six-month rate was also the lowest 
since June 7, when the rate was 4.760. 
</P>
<P>
	The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors  
-- 4.741 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,883.50 and 5.055 percent for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,754.80. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the  
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index

<HEADLINE> Dolphins Sign Ex-Vikings LB Edwards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Linebacker Dixon Edwards signed a one-year  
contract with the Miami Dolphins on Monday, three weeks after he 
was released by Minnesota in a cost-cutting move. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deal were not released, but published reports said  
the deal was worth more than the NFL minimum of $400,000 but less 
than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards, 31, won three Super Bowls in Dallas under current  
Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson. The eight-year veteran is expected to 
challenge starter Derrick Rodgers at weak-side linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards signed a four-year, $10 million contract with Minnesota  
in 1996 and started 43 games over three seasons. His first year 
with the Vikings was his best, when he recorded 122 tackles. 
</P>
<P>
	But his productivity decreased each year and the Vikings opted  
not to keep him for the final year of the contract. By the end of 
last season, Edwards was forced to play on an injured right 
hamstring.

<HEADLINE> Miami Wins Title With Team Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- This time, the ball stayed in the park.  
Finally, Miami coach Jim Morris had a new topic for the civic 
luncheon circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	With two big swings from Kevin Brown and a tricky curveball by  
Michael Neu, the Hurricanes at last delivered a national title to 
Morris, the only coach to reach the College World Series each of 
his first six years. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown homered in the second inning and hit a three-run double in  
Miami's five-run fifth, leading the Hurricanes to a 6-5 victory 
over Florida State in the national championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to win for coach Morris,'' Brown said. ``He has  
been here so many times. He definitely deserved to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neu threw the last two innings Saturday for his 16th save,  
retiring the side in the ninth and striking out Kevin Cash to end 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was trying to make the right pitch and focus,'' Neu said.  
``We were one pitch away from the national championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At that point, Morris couldn't help thinking about what happened  
in Omaha three years ago. Miami was one out from the title when 
LSU's Warren Morris homered in the Tigers' 9-8 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``It did cross my mind,'' the Miami coach said. ``I sure wasn't  
designing a ring in the dugout. I did remember what happened. I had 
a flashback.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neu made sure the ball stayed in the park. Cash missed on a big  
cut and the Hurricanes swarmed Neu with an infield pileup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike made a tremendous pitch, a great curveball that was  
impossible to take but impossible to hit,'' Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since losing the title on a dramatic hit by a player who shares  
his last name, coach Morris has repeatedly been asked about it -- by 
reporters, by fans, by diners at civic luncheons in South Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to admit it,'' he said. ``Sometimes, I had a very,  
very difficult time answering. I don't think people can understand 
how traumatic that was to our team and our coaches. It was 
crushing, just crushing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hurricanes erased those memories by beating Florida State  
for the sixth time in seven games between the intrastate rivals 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles got a gritty performance from right-hander Blair  
Varnes, a freshman making his first appearance in Omaha after 
tearing a knee ligament during the pileup when Florida State won 
its super regional. 
</P>
<P>
	Varnes will have surgery later this week, but he wore a bulky  
knee brace under his uniform against Miami. He couldn't extend his 
plant foot and he hobbled when he ran to field the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to be old and gray and regret that I didn't  
pitch for the national championship,'' Varnes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State coach Mike Martin had few options besides Varnes  
after using seven pitchers in a 13-inning victory over Stanford to 
reach the final. Varnes threw into the seventh, leaving with his 
team trailing 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
	``Boy, was he gutty,'' Martin said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles pulled within 6-4 in the seventh and 6-5 in the  
eighth after Ryan Barthelemy hit a leadoff triple over the head of 
center fielder Brian Seever and scored on John-Ford Griffin's 
sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, Marshall McDougall, who hit two home runs against Stanford  
and had an NCAA-record six in a victory at Maryland last month, 
flied out deep to left, with Mike Rodriguez making the catch on the 
warning track. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just put it up there in the wind,'' McDougall said. ``I got  
excited when I saw the guy at the wall, but it didn't go out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The victory capped a season of challenges for the Hurricanes,  
who won their last 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Catcher Russ Jacobson, a third-round pick by the Philadelphia  
Phillies, was lost to a forearm injury in May. Four pitchers, 
including staff ace Alex Santos, sat out with injuries at various 
times this season. So did Rodriguez, third baseman Lale Esquivel 
and outfielder Manny Crespo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way this team is, we knew we had to get good pitching and  
play good defense, and we made the plays when it counted,'' Morris 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hurricanes' victory ended a four-week tournament almost as  
the NCAA selection committee scripted. With the brackets expanded 
to 64 teams, seven of the eight top-seeded schools advanced to 
Omaha and the top two teams met in the final. 
</P>
<P>
	It also concluded a season in which teams played with modified  
aluminum bats. They were scaled down last year by the NCAA amid 
concerns for player safety and the game's integrity following USC's 
21-14 championship victory. 
</P>
<P>
	At this year's CWS, an NCAA panel continued its momentum on the  
issue by recommending that manufacturers make the metal bats 
perform as much as possible like wooden bats. A decision is 
expected this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Another announcement was warmly received by fans, coaches, and  
players. The NCAA and city officials have a preliminary agreement 
to keep the tournament in Omaha through 2005, with a five-year 
option after that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't imagine the College World Series being anywhere other  
than Omaha,'' Morris said. ``No one in the whole nation could do 
what they do here.''

<HEADLINE> Hoops Recruitment Bid 21 Yrs. Late </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *AP Photo    	
</P>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ga. (AP) -- Mark Upshaw probably would have signed with  
Rhode Island anyway. Still, the former Columbus High School 
basketball standout is pleased to know Stanford coaches were 
interested -- even if their recruitment letter arrived 21 years 
late. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter, signed by then-Cardinal coach Dick DiBiaso, was  
dated May 5, 1978, but didn't arrive at Columbus High until this 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	DiBiaso, who has been out of coaching for 17 years, doesn't  
remember sending it. But he said Stanford did recruit nationally 
because its tough academic requirements made it difficult to find 
enough players in California. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-paragraph letter, mostly a sales pitch for Stanford,  
included a questionnaire and stamped return envelope. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I need to send that in and they'll give me a  
scholarship,'' laughed Upshaw, now a 38-year-old father of two who 
runs his own business in the Atlanta area. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter's envelope has a Stanford, Calif., postmark dated May  
5, 1978, overlaid with one from San Francisco, also dated May 1978. 
A third postmark, from Columbus, is dated April 26, 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	David McQuinn, consumer affairs clerk for the U.S. Postal  
Service in Columbus, said he has no idea where the letter was all 
those years. But because of its age, he said it most likely was 
stuck in a cloth pouch used to store mail. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just guessing, it appears it stayed in San Francisco,'' he  
said. ``Probably, no human ever looked at that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter was addressed to Upshaw in care of Larry Oswalt, then  
the Columbus basketball coach, who was killed in a car accident 
several years ago. An office worker at the school gave it to Murphy 
Jenkins, a coach who has stayed in touch with Upshaw. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just stunned when I saw the postmark,'' said Jenkins.  
``I thought somebody was playing a joke. Then I realized, no, this 
is real. I decided I would open the letter and see what it said.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jenkins contacted Upshaw's wife, Debra, who relayed the message  
to her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	``She said something about a letter from a college,'' Upshaw  
said. ``I said, 'A letter from a college? I know I don't owe any 
tuition or anything.' I just found it kind of funny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Upshaw, who now lives in Conyers and owns Global Diagnostic  
Services Inc., originally signed with Georgia but changed his mind 
and went to Rhode Island, where his cousin, Claude English, was an 
assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
	He made the All-Atlantic 10 Conference team in 1981-82 after  
averaging 16.9 points per game as a junior. A knee injury kept him 
out the next season, but he played again in 1983-84, averaging 11.7 
points per game. 
</P>
<P>
	Would he have considered Stanford if the letter had arrived on  
time? 
</P>
<P>
	``You never know,'' he said. ``Probably not. I think going to  
Rhode Island was the right decision for me.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Expected To Pass UN Dues Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation to pay nearly $1 billion of the  
country's debt to the United Nations advanced in the Senate on 
Monday, eased along by a compromise with the Clinton administration 
on reducing future U.S. payments to the world organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, expected to win Senate approval on Tuesday, calls for  
a reduction in the U.S. share of the regular U.N. budget from the 
present 25 percent to 20 percent; and a drop in the share of 
peacekeeping operations from 31 percent to 25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Rod Grams, R-Minn., chairman of the Senate Foreign  
Relations subcommittee on international operations, called the 
United Nations ``a bloated bureaucracy'' and said that, without 
housekeeping reforms, ``the U.N. will collapse under its own 
weight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, part of legislation authorizing a variety of State  
Department programs for fiscal 2000, would allow payments of $819 
million in U.S. debts to the United Nations over three years and 
forgive $107 million that the United Nations owes the United 
States; or a total of $916 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also calls for spending $3 billion over the next five  
years to beef up security at U.S. embassies around the world -- the 
same amount requested by the administration in the aftermath of 
last year's attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
	By U.N. calculations, the United States is $1.69 billion in  
arrears, nearly 60 percent of the total debt owed to the 185-nation 
organization. U.N. officials have complained that makes it hard for 
the United Nations to pay its own bills. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States disputes some of the arrears, but concedes  
owing at least $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless a substantial portion is repaid this year, the United  
States will lose its vote in the General Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation is a result of a compromise among Secretary of  
State Madeleine Albright, committee Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C., 
and senior Democratic member, Joseph Biden of Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
	Veteran diplomat Richard Holbrooke, President Clinton's nominee  
to be U.N. ambassador, has promised to try to persuade other U.N. 
nations to go along with the reduction in the U.S. share if 
confirmed, Helms told the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms' committee, in fact, was to hold a hearing with Holbrooke  
on Tuesday dealing with the U.N. payments issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss of a vote in the General Assembly would be an  
embarrassment, but it would not affect Washington's veto power in 
the Security Council, the most powerful decision-making body at the 
United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress authorized legislation last year that would have paid  
off much of the arrears. 
</P>
<P>
	But President Clinton vetoed the bill because it contained  
unrelated abortion restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate debated the bill Monday, but put off a final vote  
until Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> NBA Finals TV Ratings Falling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Other than the night O.J. Simpson's freeway  
chase distracted viewers from basketball, last week's Game 2 got 
the lowest prime-time rating for the NBA Finals since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's coverage of Friday night's game between the San Antonio  
Spurs and the New York Knicks posted a 9.6 rating and a 19 share. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the lowest rating since June 17, 1994, when the  
Knicks-Rockets Game 5 drew a 8.0 -- the same night the nation was 
riveted by the police chase of Simpson in Southern California 
before his arrest in the killings of his wife and her friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than that, no game rated lower since the opener of the  
1985 Finals between the Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Lakers, 
which wasn't in prime time and got an 8.9. 
</P>
<P>
	The Finals hadn't received this low a rating in prime time since  
1978, when Game 2 between Seattle and Washington got a 9.2 rating 
and a 16 share. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's Game 2 fell 42 percent from last season's  
record-setting second game of the Chicago Bulls-Utah Jazz contest, 
which posted a 16.6/31. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the first two games, NBC is averaging a 10.6/20, down 39  
percent from the two games average of 17.3 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Numerous reasons have contributed to the tumbling ratings,  
including the departure of Michael Jordan, sloppy play, 
noncompetitive games and the fact that San Antonio is the smallest 
market in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Six of the eight highest-rated finals involved Jordan's Bulls.  
</P>
<P>
	The 1994 final (12.4 rating), the last season to be played  
entirely without Jordan, was NBC's lowest-rated in its eight years 
of showing the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	The rating is the percentage of TV households in the United  
States tuned to a program, and each point represents 994,000 homes. 
The share is the percentage tuned to a program among televisions in 
use on at the time.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- America Online Inc. will invest $1.5 billion  
in DirecTV creator Hughes Electronics Corp. in an agreement that 
gives AOL a new high-speed option and deepens ties between the 
world's largest Internet provider and the leading U.S. satellite TV 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced Monday seeks to combine AOL's Internet  
services with Hughes' digital television system. Company executives 
said the deal would help increase DirecTV's subscriber base while 
boosting the market for AOL's planned interactive TV and high-speed 
Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement also advances AOL's campaign to acquire the  
broadband platforms necessary to offer customers faster, more 
diverse services. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the satellite deal, AOL is not limiting its alliances,  
said Steve Case, AOL's chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think this precludes in any way, shape or form our  
ability to work with telephone companies or cable companies or 
anyone who can provide any piece of the puzzle of this broadband 
tapestry,'' Case said in a conference call with reporters. ``We 
want to provide the best set of choices to the widest audience 
possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts consider access to cable -- with its wide reach into  
American households -- crucial to AOL's campaign to convert to 
high-speed Internet delivery. Cable companies have resisted calls 
for them to allow open access to AOL and other Internet service 
providers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can't not have a cable deal. Not having that would be a  
difficulty for them,'' said Sajai Krishnan, an analyst with Booz 
Allen &AMP; Hamilton. ``Cable is going to be a strong play in the 
consumer market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AOL has also made several deals with phone companies such as  
Bell Atlantic Corp. and SBC Communications Inc. to provide 
high-speed services over phone lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, AOL and Hughes agreed to jointly develop a set-top  
receiver that would allow DirecTV customers to subscribe to AOL TV, 
an interactive service that would combine Internet access with 
Hughes' entertainment programs. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, television viewers would be able to communicate  
with other AOL users while watching a program 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new deal, the two companies also plan to develop  
content and additional interactive services to be offered through 
DirecTV and AOL TV. For example, viewers would be able to execute 
an online stock purchase while watching a financial program, or buy 
a video cassette of a movie they are watching. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL still needs to cut a deal with cable operators to provide  
its customers with true broadband service, said Josh Bernoff, an 
analyst with Cambridge, Mass.-based Forrester Research. For now, 
satellite technology provides high-speed connection in one 
direction only -- from the satellite to the user's computer. 
Information uploaded from the computer moves via a telephone line, 
usually at a much lower speed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Satellite has a pretty significant problem in that you can't  
deliver high speed data in both directions from a satellite,'' said 
Bernoff. ``To call this broadband is perhaps not completely 
appropriate. I would call this simulated broadband.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes is developing a new satellite system, known as Spaceway,  
that could solve the problem by offering two-way broadband 
connections. Hughes plans to have the system in operation by 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, AOL will invest $1.5 billion in an equity  
security of General Motors Co., parent of El Segundo, Calif.-based 
Hughes. The equity carries a 6 1/4 percent coupon rate that is 
automatically convertible into GM Class H common stock in three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Dulles, Va.-based AOL is the world's largest Internet provider  
with more than 16 million subscribers to AOL and its CompuServe 
subsidiary. Hughes currently has more than 7 million DirectTV 
subscribers 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of AOL rose $3.68 3/4 to $115.18 1/4 in trading on the New York  
Stock Exchange. Hughes, which trades as the GM Class H stock, rose 
$3.18 3/4 to $56.62 1/2, also on the NYSE.

<HEADLINE> Patrons Turn Out for Gun Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Under a din of banjos and the hum of  
fluorescent lights, the chatter of bartering from a 
larger-than-expected crowd echoed through the region's biggest gun 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	While Congress debates whether to impose more restrictions on  
who can buy a gun -- and when -- rebels and average Joes turned out 
for the weekend show. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to make a stand,'' said Mike Jones, 36, who was  
carrying his 3-month-old daughter, Debbie. ``They think their 
rights are going to be taken away soon, so they're stocking up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers said the crowd was more than twice what they  
expected, but acknowledged that their promotion might have less to 
do with the size of the crowd than the national debate over gun 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one thing to come to the show and look around and buy.  
It's another when people are coming to oppose something,'' said 
promoter Rex Kehrli, who charges $5 a head for admission to the 20 
shows he arranges throughout the South. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather be thought of as a good promoter than someone who  
takes advantage of situations,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun control has become a hot topic amid the increasing death  
toll from school shootings nationwide: among them, three killed in 
West Paducah, Ky., in 1997; five in Jonesboro, Ark., last year; and 
13, plus the two shooters, at Littleton, Colo., in April. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the House rejected a gun control bill that would have  
weakened existing restrictions on gun show sales while requiring 
safety devices to be sold with all handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	The 280-147 vote left President Clinton searching for a way to  
impose new gun laws, especially on shows like these. 
</P>
<P>
	In a line outside the expo center, four men bartered over a  
Ruger handgun. The spacious main hallway opened on both sides to a 
metropolis of armaments that ranged from high-powered hunting 
rifles to semiautomatic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 600 licensed dealers and unlicensed traders shared the  
same space -- all selling their wares for what some buyers consider 
rock-bottom prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealers are required to do a background check of all buyers, but  
unlicensed dealers do not. Instead, they cannot sell long guns to 
those 18 years and younger, sell handguns to people younger than 
21, or sell handguns to out-of-state residents. Patrons also cannot 
be drunk when they purchase a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	``To most people, we're the bad guys,'' said Harold Pauley, a  
collector who uses money from the shows to upgrade his collection. 
He prominently displayed three Browning BPS 200 shotguns at $395 
each. Handguns also were available for less than $200. 
</P>
<P>
	In an adjacent room that housed more than 100 other dealers,  
banjo music played while everything from M-1 rifles -- $505 with a 
bayonet -- to magazine clips were for sale. The most expensive 
weapons included three M-11 9 mm submachine guns priced around 
$1,000. A suppressor could be added for $600. 
</P>
<P>
	On the cheaper side was a Model EA 3 .380-caliber handgun for  
$105. And high-damage hollow-point bullets could be found for as 
little as 10 cents each. 
</P>
<P>
	Many people come for the cheap prices. Others see it as a way to  
discuss what they say is the slow loss of the right to bear arms. 
In one corner of the exposition center, dealer Fred Bush said his 
fellow dealers are frightened to talk about the weapons they own. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't trust the government anymore,'' said Bush, 66.  
``This might be the only place left that they have to talk about 
these things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the dingiest merchants -- in dirty jeans and cutoff  
undershirts and a few days removed from their last shave -- answered 
questions with cursing and an occasional obscene gesture. 
</P>
<P>
	Near the middle of the exposition center, four tables were  
loaded with cases of Nazi medals, pistols and flags. These World 
War II relics are popular among gun show regulars, Kehrli said. At 
another table, a Japanese officer's revolver was available for $95. 
</P>
<P>
	One dealer displayed a bumper sticker that said: ``Racial Purity  
is America's Security.'' Kehrli had a worker take it down. 
</P>
<P>
	The bad reputation gun show patrons get sometimes is deserved,  
said Ben Thomas, who chose not to bring his two sons because of the 
people who hang out at shows. ``It's frustrating when a few people 
come here and think they have to act like they're nuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``You see these Confederate flags all over the place, trying to  
prove this bad-boy image,'' he said. ``Most of us aren't like 
that.''

<HEADLINE> Miami's 'Stiltsville' Homes Survive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A colorful little cluster of homes called  
Stiltsville, built on poles over Biscayne Bay, received a 
five-month reprieve Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Homeowners had faced a July 1 deadline for removal of the seven  
homes, which sit on bay bottom land annexed by the National Park 
Service in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., who had joined homeowners in  
fighting the removal, said the park service's new Dec. 1 deadline 
offers breathing room to work out a solution. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, everybody is pleased,'' said Laura Roberts, an  
organizer of Save Old Stiltsville, an owners group. 
</P>
<P>
	Biscayne National Park Superintendent Dick Frost had argued that  
there is no legal provision to allow the private homes on public 
property. Environmental groups had backed Frost's plans to remove 
the structures. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stiltsville homes are the descendants of a community that  
began in the early 1930s, when structures were built on sunken 
barges. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years other homes were added, mostly on pilings driven  
into the bay bottom. At its height, there were about 25 dwellings, 
used for weekend retreats and parties but seldom as full-time 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
	For many years, they had a colorful reputation as hangouts for  
gamblers, boozers and flashy women. They have appeared repeatedly 
in novels and on television.

<HEADLINE> Gov.'s Daughter Cited for Drinking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- The governor's daughter and four of her  
friends were cited for underage drinking after they inadvertently 
summoned police to the Governor's Mansion. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Tony Knowles and his wife gave permission to their  
19-year-old daughter, Devon, to have eight friends for dinner on 
Friday while they were in Los Angeles, Knowles said in a statement 
Monday. Four planned to spend the night. 
</P>
<P>
	Late in the evening, one of the women picked up a telephone with  
a direct connection to the Juneau Police Department, said Greg 
Wilkinson, a spokesman for the Alaska State Troopers, who provide 
security at the mansion. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the gals apparently picked up the wrong phone to make a  
phone call,'' Wilkinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerned about possible trouble, police headed for the mansion,  
Wilkinson said. Something must have aroused officers' suspicions 
that the women were drinking alcohol and they conducted breath 
tests, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted of the violation, the women face a fine of at least  
$100. 
</P>
<P>
	``This incident is being dealt with by the proper authorities  
and by each of the families involved,'' the governor said, refusing 
to comment further.

<HEADLINE> Remote Desert City Takes the Heat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE HAVASU CITY, Ariz. (AP) -- There really is no reason for  
this city to exist. 
</P>
<P>
	First, foremost and above all, there's the heat. Mind-boggling,  
thermometer-busting, brain-baking, you-must-be-kidding heat. 
Summertime temperatures around 120 degrees. Overnight lows in the 
80s. A relentless, endless dry sauna from May into October. 
</P>
<P>
	``You learn that you sweat in places that you didn't think  
possible,'' says Bonnie Barsness, a tourism promoter who moved here 
from North Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	Secondly, the location is inconvenient. Lake Havasu City lies in  
the middle of nowhere along the Arizona-California line, along the 
desolate line where the Mohave and Sonoran deserts meet. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix lies 205 miles away; Tucson and Los Angeles, 315 miles;  
Las Vegas, 150. And there's no interstate highway or railroad 
through the city, just a commuter airline offering a handful of 
daily flights to Phoenix and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	There simply is no good reason for Lake Havasu City to exist.  
Yet it's thriving 36 years after it was established by Robert P. 
McCulloch, founder of chain saw maker McCulloch Corp., who came 
here looking for a motor testing site. 
</P>
<P>
	The main reason is Lake Havasu itself.  
</P>
<P>
	The name, pronounced HAVE - a - soo, is a Havasupai Indian word  
meaning blue-green water. And it's those deep, clean and inviting 
waters that attract visitors and breathe life into a young city 
that wasn't incorporated until 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as Bugsy Siegel saw gold in the desert that eventually  
became the Las Vegas strip, McCulloch looked out upon wasteland and 
envisioned a retirement community filled with stucco houses rising 
above the river toward the Mohave Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no town when McCulloch landed here in 1963, only an  
abandoned military landing strip and a lake artificially formed by 
the damming of the Colorado River 25 years earlier. But McCulloch 
brought in 100 mobile homes to house his workers, and soon a few 
businesses and houses were built. 
</P>
<P>
	McCulloch hired C.V. Wood, the architect who designed  
Disneyland, to plan a city spread over 26 square miles. Largely as 
a tourism gimmick, he bought London Bridge, which was scheduled for 
demolition, and shipped it in from England block by block. The 
bridge spans a man-made lake channel leading to a small island 
featuring a shopping mall, restaurants and campgrounds. It marked 
its 25th anniversary in Arizona in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The McCulloch Corp. for years was the city's leading employer,  
but the company recently closed its plants and filed for 
bankruptcy, putting 450 out of work. 
</P>
<P>
	It could have been catastrophic. But tourism and the sheer  
livability of Lake Havasu City proved to be its salvation. The area 
attracts 1 million visitors a year, and they contribute $100 
million to the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The city has dozens of small businesses, including eight boat  
manufacturers, said Bob Tippitt, president of the Lake Havasu City 
Partnership for Economic Development. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of small businesses are run by people who wanted to get  
away from city life and live in a small town,'' he said. ``They 
sell all over the United States. They use UPS or FedEx or whatever 
to ship their products. The hot weather doesn't bother them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The overall result: Unemployment is below 2 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	Lake Havasu offers 450 miles of shoreline and open water for  
swimming, angling and sailing. It is the site of international Jet 
Ski championships, power boat competitions and national bass 
fishing contests. 
</P>
<P>
	Long weekends fill the city's 1,600 motel rooms and 3,000  
campsites. Sleek cigar boats with growling inboard motors prowl the 
lake and head for Copper Canyon, a renowned party spot. Bikini tops 
can be optional, particularly during spring break, when college 
students by the thousands rent houseboats and motel rooms, camp out 
and raid store shelves for beer. 
</P>
<P>
	Josh Hernandez, a Phoenix property appraiser, regularly hauls  
his Waverunner to Lake Havasu. He likes to make a four-hour run on 
the water upriver to Laughlin, Nev., to gamble and dine in the 
casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	``We come out here for the openness of the water,'' says  
Hernandez, who races the personal watercraft competitively in 
California. ``The weather in spring and fall is good. Summer is 
just unbearable, like sticking your head in an oven, but the water 
stays cool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lake Havasu City's population has nearly tripled since 1975, to  
43,000. That figure doubles each winter with an invasion of 
retirees. Many are choosing to live here year round, drawn by the 
friendly, small-town atmosphere and ample services. 
</P>
<P>
	Housing prices are affordable, too. A three-bedroom house with  
swimming pool costs about $90,000. Custom-built homes in the $1 
million range offer unobstructed lake views. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Mayor Jim Spezzano can't imagine a better place to live.  
He moved here from Michigan in 1980, after retiring as a Ford Motor 
Co. executive. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're sitting back in the Midwest or Northwest and hear  
them talking on TV about the nation's high being Lake Havasu 
City,'' he said, ``the only thing you can think of is 'I'm glad I 
don't live there.' 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I watch the weather and see blizzards in the Midwest and  
say 'God, I'm glad I don't live there.'''

<HEADLINE> Calif. GOP Primary Plan Gets Setback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A bid to eliminate the state's  
``winner-take-all'' Republican presidential primary received a 
setback Monday that its sponsor predicted would prove fatal to the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Assembly elections committee postponed a hearing on  
the proposal for two days, dimming the prospect it would be signed 
into law by July 1, as required by national GOP rules, said its 
principal proponent, Sen. Ray Haynes. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Haynes' proposal, the state's winner-take-all Republican  
primary next March 7 would be replaced with one that would allow 
multiple candidates to split the state's delegates by congressional 
district. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot see how I can get this thing to the governor by June  
30 with the hearing on Thursday,'' Haynes said by telephone 
immediately after Democratic Assemblyman Edward Vincent delayed the 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The postponement is ``fatal for 2000,'' he said, adding that he  
will pursue it for the 2004 presidential cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Republican Party adopted the change Saturday, and  
Haynes sought to hustle the proposal through the 
Democratic-controlled Legislature before July 1. He acknowledged in 
recent days its prospects were slim. 
</P>
<P>
	Vincent did not immediately respond to a call seeking comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Scrapping ``winner-take-all'' would have energized rank-and-file  
Republicans to get involved in the 2000 campaigns, the state party 
contended. 
</P>
<P>
	Haynes and other proponents said it would make the candidates  
strengthen their California campaigns earlier, producing stronger 
party support for the eventual presidential nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	But the party's move was also seen as a signal to the  
front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, that some want their votes 
to go to more conservative candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed change, candidates would fight for the 156  
California party delegates, district by district. A victory in one 
district would be worth three delegates, with up to two dozen 
at-large delegates probably going to candidates based on their 
proportion of the statewide vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Under current rules, the Republican candidate who draws the  
largest number of votes statewide takes all party delegates to the 
national convention, where the nominee is chosen. California has 
the largest state delegation.

<HEADLINE> Commerce Sec. Wary of Steel Quotas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. farmers and businesses that rely heavily  
on exports to other countries might suffer if the domestic steel 
industry obtains quotas on foreign steel, Commerce Secretary 
William Daley said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The quotas could hurt U.S. steel companies as well if an  
international trade war erupts, cutting off U.S. exports from 
foreign markets, Daley said. He said a fifth of the steel used 
domestically goes into products later sent abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley issued the warning on the eve of a key vote in the Senate  
on a quota measure. The House overwhelmingly passed the bill in 
March, 289-141, despite the threat of a presidential veto. Both 
sides believe Tuesday's Senate vote will be close. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are the world's leading exporter, and steel is a  
significant part of those exports,'' Daley said. ``And it is not 
just the steel industry that stands to suffer. Other industries 
that depend greatly on exports and could pay a steep price include 
pharmaceuticals, high-tech, and above all, agriculture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steelworkers are pushing for quotas as a way to combat  
low-priced foreign shipments that the industry blames for 
bankruptcies at three U.S. companies and for thousands of layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign shipments reached record highs last year in the wake of  
the Asian economic crisis, which reduced demand for steel abroad 
and forced foreign producers to turn to the United States. The U.S. 
industry contends that some of the foreign pricing practices are 
designed to illegally undercut U.S. producers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quota legislation is the only option right now for making  
certain that foreign countries end their illegal trade practices 
and our steelworkers get back on the job,'' said Sen. Jay 
Rockefeller, D-W.Va., chief sponsor of the quota bill. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference, Daley said steel quotas would violate  
international trade agreements and make it difficult for the 
Clinton administration to persuade other countries to open their 
markets to U.S. products. 
</P>
<P>
	But Daley acknowledged that some senators may ``feel somewhat in  
a box,'' wishing to show their sympathy for workers while 
recognizing that quotas are ``not the right way to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Daley has been on the phone with several senators  
since last week to persuade them to reject the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, the United Steelworkers of America arranged to send a  
thousand workers to Washington for a rally before the vote. About 
100 steelworkers on motorcycles stopped in Pittsburgh on Monday on 
their way to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The quota bill would impose monthly quotas on steel shipments  
equal to the average levels in the three years before July 1997. 
The measure also would set up an import notification system to 
better track shipments into the country.

<HEADLINE> Tigers Manager Picks Tri-Captains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Manager Larry Parrish doesn't deny that his  
latest attempt to shake up the foundering Detroit Tigers might be 
something of a reach. 
</P>
<P>
	Parrish, seeking more vocal leadership in the clubhouse, picked  
pitcher Doug Brocail, catcher Brad Ausmus and third baseman Dean 
Palmer as team captains. The move came in the wake of a 2-hour 
meeting between Parrish, his coaches and the three players 
following a 6-5 loss Sunday to the Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	That loss dropped the Tigers (29-40) to a season-low 11 games  
under .500. They had lost five of six heading into Monday night's 
game against the A's. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could say this is a form of grasping,'' Parrish said  
Monday. ``We're not winning, and anything we can do to win, we'll 
try.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parrish wants the tri-captains to exert peer pressure on other  
players, particularly before and after games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted somebody vocal, and that's Brocail,'' Parrish said.  
``We want somebody as a go-between between the pitchers and 
players, and that's Ausmus. Then we wanted a senior player, 
somebody the others respected, and that's Palmer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, who came to Detroit as a free agent after signing a $36  
million, five-year contract last, is not regarded as a vocal 
player. But Palmer, whose 19 home runs and 44 RBIs easily lead the 
Tigers, says he's willing to try anything. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a role that's something I definitely accept,'' Palmer  
said. ``It makes you feel good that the management has that 
confidence in you. I know I'm going to be here a few years and I 
want to help this team any way I can. I want to be involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers were a consensus pick to finish second behind  
Cleveland in the AL Central but entered Monday in third place, 17 1/2 
games behind the division-leading Indians. They've also shown no 
signs of becoming a contender, which was a main goal heading into 
next season's move to their new home at Comerica Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Parrish thinks the team has accepted losing too easily.  
</P>
<P>
	``Anything that gets the club talking baseball will make us a  
better team,'' Parrish said.

<HEADLINE>  India Claims Vital Peak in Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATALIK, India (AP) -- Pounded by Pakistani artillery, Indian  
soldiers dug into newly won positions on a mountain ridge today and 
prepared for an assault on the last pockets of Islamic guerrillas 
in the mountainous Kashmir region. 
</P>
<P>
	As India claimed new military victories, the leaders of the  
world's most industrialized nations and Russia urged a halt to the 
fighting in Kashmir. The divided territory has been the trigger for 
two wars since India and Pakistan won independence from Britain in 
1947. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement by the Group of Eight urged the withdrawal of the  
guerrillas, who had seized mountain posts on the Indian-controlled 
side of the cease-fire line dividing Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
	India saw the statement from the G-8 summit in Cologne, Germany,  
as a clear-cut demand for Pakistan to withdraw the forces it 
allegedly supports. But the statement did not name Pakistan 
directly -- so Islamabad today called it a vindication of its stance 
in the hostilities. 
</P>
<P>
	India accuses Pakistan of backing the guerrillas in an attempt  
to change the 1972 cease-fire line. Pakistan denies it is behind 
the guerrillas, who it says are Muslim fighters seeking Kashmiri 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
	After a week of fighting, Indian troops scaled an almost  
vertical rock face and took Peak 5140, the highest point on a 
Himalayan ridge dominating a strategic highway, the army announced 
Sunday. Heavy fighting continued for Tiger Hill, the last of three 
towering peaks on the ridge. 
</P>
<P>
	A military spokesman said the next objective was to seize three  
ridge lines and keep the pressure on the militants' supply lines. 
</P>
<P>
	In the nearby Mushko valley, Indian troops have pushed back the  
guerrillas to within two miles of the line of control, said an 
officer, Col. Avtar Singh. The intruders had infiltrated up to four 
miles across the cease-fire line. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Delhi, military spokesman Col. Bikaram Singh said 100  
Pakistani soldiers were dislodged from Peak 5140. Three Indian 
soldiers were killed and nine others wounded in the operation to 
wipe out bunkers on the 16,900-foot peak, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The successful operation left ``one or two pockets'' of rebels  
still overlooking the highway, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Singh said the forces on the peak were being hit by heavy  
artillery and mortar shelling from the Pakistani side of the line 
of control, The Indian Express newspaper reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian forces -- using artillery, air strikes and troops -- have  
been battling the guerrillas since early May, when hundreds of them 
were discovered on undefended ridges along the cease-fire line.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Praises Slovenia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) -- Painting a bright portrait of what  
the Balkans could become, President Clinton today celebrated the 
economic success of Slovenia -- the first Yugoslav republic to 
reject President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want the trip to spark the imagination of others, both  
within the Balkans and beyond it, about the kind of future and kind 
of societies we can build in all those countries if we work at 
it,'' Clinton said before departing Bonn for the first visit to 
Slovenia by a U.S. president. 
</P>
<P>
	A relentless rain didn't dampen the enthusiasm of the welcoming  
committee at Ljubljana, where a military band and honor guard were 
on hand as Air Force One touched down and host officials unrolled 
10 lengths of red carpet. 
</P>
<P>
	On the country road into town, lonely clusters of people stood  
in the downpour to wave at the presidential motorcade passing a 
corn field away. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Slovenian President Milan Kucan shared not one -- but  
two -- grinning handshakes for news cameras beneath a crystal 
chandelier in the Presidential Palace before meeting privately. 
</P>
<P>
	In a public address in the capital city of Ljubljana and  
official meetings at the parliament building, Clinton wanted to 
congratulate Slovenia for breaking with Milosevic's government and 
establishing stability in a region riven by ethnic tensions. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no future in Europe for Mr. Milosevic and his policy  
of manipulating normal human differences for inhuman ends,'' 
Clinton declared Sunday in Germany, where today he attended a 
summit with European Union leaders before departing for Ljubljana. 
</P>
<P>
	Kucan said Clinton's visit ``marks the recognition of our young  
country, that in its eight years of existence has managed to change 
its profile, become politically stable, economically successful and 
socially secure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A planned dinner with the democratically elected Kucan at Brdo  
Castle, former residence of the late dictator Josip Broz Tito, 
would dramatize that change. 
</P>
<P>
	Slovenia is a country of 2 million people, smaller than New  
Jersey and squeezed between Austria and Croatia. It won 
independence in 1991 and now wants to join NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	Slovenia was the most developed of the Yugoslav republics when  
it won independence in 1991 and has capitalized on that advantage 
since. With key industries including pharmaceuticals and 
electronics, Slovenia has a per capita income of $11,000, similar 
to Portugal and Greece. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Slovenia is a member of NATO's Partnership for Peace,  
which prepares candidate countries to join the alliance, and an 
associate member of the European Union, many Slovenes were 
disappointed to miss the first wave of NATO expansion, which was 
limited this year to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials clearly held out hope for Slovenia's NATO  
aspirations. ``We fully plan to have a second wave of 
enlargement,'' said White House spokesman Mike Hammer. ``Slovenia 
is definitely on that track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Slovenes also are frustrated by how little the world knows about  
their country, and hope Clinton's visit can change that. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans, and the whole world, will know now where Slovenia  
is,'' said Marko Macur, a 22-year-old student waiting earlier this 
week for a ticket to see Clinton in Congress Square. 
</P>
<P>
	Slovenia made fevered preparations for Clinton, including $1.5  
million for new wiring, plumbing and curtains at the castle outside 
Ljubljana, where Clinton will have a dinner for about 120 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also is meeting Milo Djukanovic, the president of  
Montenegro, the smaller of the two remaining Yugoslav republics. 
</P>
<P>
	The pro-Western Djukanovic has opposed Milosevic's policies, and  
Sandy Berger, the president's national security adviser, said 
Clinton's meeting with the Montenegrin leader will ``demonstrate 
our support for the steadfastness that he has shown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve days after the last NATO bombing raid on Yugoslavia,  
Clinton was also venturing near the front lines of the battle -- won 
by the United States and its allies -- to stop Milosevic's ethnic 
cleansing of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Before heading back to Washington on Tuesday, the president was  
visiting the Stenkovich I refugee camp, temporary home to thousands 
of Kosovar Albanians who fled their homes in terror of Milosevic's 
Serb troops.

<HEADLINE> Stars Celebrate Cup Texas-style </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- With a tug of his pant legs, Dallas Stars owner  
Tom Hicks showed off the perfect symbol of a Texas team winning the 
Stanley Cup: black boots with the shiny silver trophy emblazoned on 
each shin. 
</P>
<P>
	Forward Dave Reid added to image by wearing a black cowboy hat  
throughout a downtown parade on Monday and a Reunion Arena pep 
rally in honor of the NHL champions. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 75,000 people lined the streets for the parade. They  
saw the players ride by on four floats, the final one carrying the 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``For them to see a team other than the Cowboys win something is  
fun,'' forward Guy Carbonneau said. 
</P>
<P>
	Truth is, Dallas fans have loved the Stars ever since they moved  
from Minnesota in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've been here with us for six years,'' captain Derian  
Hatcher, one of three remaining Minnesota North Stars, told the 
Reunion Arena crowd. ``Now we have (the Cup) here and it looks good 
here. Hopefully, we can build a nice little house for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars won the first title in their 32-year history and the  
first for a team in the Sun Belt early Sunday with a 2-1 
triple-overtime victory over the Buffalo Sabres in Game 6. Although 
a controversy is brewing over the Cup-winning goal scored by Brett 
Hull while his left foot was in the goalie's crease, there were no 
references to it Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	After a 45-minute parade from City Hall to Reunion Arena, the  
players were introduced, each walking through a giant star-shaped 
metal structure. 
</P>
<P>
	The last player out was Hatcher, who ushered in the Cup beneath  
a shower of fireworks and a burning, revolving star. He placed the 
trophy on a 5-foot pedestal in the center of the stage. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as we've got one of these, why not go for two?'' coach  
Ken Hitchcock said. ``Aw, hell, let's go for three!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each player got a turn hoisting the Cup and most of them kissed  
the trophy, Mike Modano doing so several times. 
</P>
<P>
	Goaltender Ed Belfour, who was serenaded by cheers of ``Ed-die!  
Ed-die!'' throughout the hourlong show, savored the Cup the 
longest. He circled the stage while Hicks, team president Jim Lites 
and general manager Bob Gainey led a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans goaded Belfour into speaking and, with a voice hoarse from  
36 hours of celebrating, he thanked the crowd for their support. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been an unbelievable year,'' said Belfour, who  
inspired one fan to write ``In Eddie We Trust'' on the back of a 
car. ``This is a great moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The clinching game in Buffalo ended around 12:30 a.m. Sunday --  
after many fans were asleep and too late to make some editions of 
the local newspapers. Only about 200 fans made it to the airport to 
greet the plane at 6:45 a.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Also taking part in the celebration were the Reunion Arena  
Zamboni and the heavy metal band Pantera. 
</P>
<P>
	Band members are fans of the team and friends with several  
players. The group pounded out a song featuring only the words 
``Dallas! Stars!'' 
</P>
<P>
	A full house awaited the team at Reunion Arena, where two 1999  
Stanley Cup champion banners hung from the rafters for the first 
time. It was the 50th straight time the team packed the 17,001-seat 
facility, although with seats on the ice the total attendance was 
closer to 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
	B.J. Thomas, the Grammy-winning singer best known for  
``Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head,'' opened the pep rally by 
singing the national anthem. The Stars were 6-0 this season when he 
sang, including a victory in Game 5 of the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Ron Kirk read a letter from Gov. George W. Bush, then  
Lites and Hicks addressed the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have never, ever for a minute regretted coming here,'' said  
Lites, who joined the organization following the move from 
Minneapolis. ``It's been a great, great, great experience.''

<HEADLINE> Philly Expects Convention Windfall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Next summer's Republican National Convention  
could turn Philadelphia into the City of Brotherly Lucre. 
</P>
<P>
	The elephant invasion will guarantee a large infusion of cash as  
convention delegates, guests, corporate executives and the media 
spend money on hotel rooms, restaurants, cab rides, parties and the 
like. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials conservatively estimate that the festivities will  
generate $125 million in direct economic activity. And they're 
figuring on another $200 million in indirect benefits -- for 
example, money spent at the supermarket by convention workers. 
</P>
<P>
	And those are only the tangible effects.  
</P>
<P>
	The convention, which will be held the week of July 29 to Aug.  
4, 2000, presents a prime opportunity for the city to market itself 
-- to show to an audience of millions that it is a nice place to 
visit or do business in. 
</P>
<P>
	In San Diego, the economic impact of the 1996 Republican  
convention was pegged at $162 million, but the promotional value, 
according to one official, was priceless. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we had to pay for the favorable mentions of San Diego, we  
couldn't even begin to dream about it,'' said Salvatore Giametta, a 
spokesman for the San Diego Convention and Visitors Bureau. 
``Certainly the costs would be in the hundreds of millions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia can expect similar treatment, as reporters from all  
over write about the Liberty Bell, Independence Hall, the art 
museum, the Franklin Institute and other landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
	But Irving J. Rein, a Northwestern University professor who  
specializes in the marketing of places, said the media spotlight 
can be a ``disaster'' if the city doesn't adequately prepare. 
</P>
<P>
	Roads -- especially the road from the airport -- should be  
pothole-free. Trains should run on time. Residents have to be nice 
to convention-goers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has to work well. If it doesn't, you've not only wasted  
your opportunity, you've ruined your image,'' said Rein, author of 
the book ``Marketing Places.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Cohen, co-chairman of Philadelphia 2000, the organizing  
committee, said efforts to teach residents to be courteous to 
visitors have been going on for years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have become pretty sophisticated,'' he said. ``We do all  
sorts of survey work, and one of the great strengths of the city is 
how friendly we are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some San Diego hotels were a bit nervous that the stampeding  
elephants would scare away tourists, said Giametta, the visitor's 
bureau spokesman. The convention was held in mid-August, the height 
of the city's tourist season. 
</P>
<P>
	But Giametta said that whatever dip there was in non-convention  
visitors was more than made up by delegates and corporate bigwigs 
who ``spend a lot more freely than the average vacationer would.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You have some business displaced, but you now have it replaced  
by a convention where folks are paying very nice room rates, 
certainly higher than what you have with folks on a leisure 
vacation,'' Giametta said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Chicago, host of the 1996 Democratic convention, one study  
pegged the direct economic impact at $123 million, with another 
$237 million in secondary benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, conducted jointly by the Federal Reserve Bank of  
Chicago and the University of Illinois, also said about 4,200 jobs 
were created, and those workers received about $133 million in 
salaries and wages. Philadelphia officials based their own 
projections on the findings. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Muldoon, president of the Philadelphia Convention and  
Visitors' Bureau, said the timing of the Philadelphia convention 
couldn't be better. 
</P>
<P>
	The facilities are nearly new, it's the start of a new  
millennium and there is already a perception that Philadelphia is a 
city on the way up, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the weather has to cooperate.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think the stars are lined up right, and if the sun stays out  
for 10 days and the humidity isn't too high, people will say, 'What 
a great place,' Muldoon said. ``If it rains for 10 days, we'll have 
to work a little bit harder.''

<HEADLINE> Camby Starts For Knicks Vs. Spurs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Marcus Camby solution didn't quite work for  
coach Jeff Van Gundy on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Under pressure to find some offense for the struggling New York  
Knicks in the NBA Finals, Van Gundy turned to Camby, starting him 
for the first time all season in Game 3 against San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	But Camby got in fast foul trouble, committing two personals in  
the first six minutes of the game. Then, at the start of the second 
half, he picked up two more quick fouls and headed to the bench 
with no points in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Camby fouled out of Game 2 and finished Game 1 with five  
personals. 
</P>
<P>
	Camby replaced Chris Dudley in the Knicks lineup. Dudley, who  
had been starting at center in place of injured Patrick Ewing, 
failed to score a field goal in the first two losses at San 
Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the shoot-around this morning, Jeff came up to me and said,  
`I might start you,' '' Camby said in the locker room before the 
game Monday night. ``I said, `Fine. Whatever it takes to get the 
win.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Camby provided a huge spark as a reserve in the Knicks' victory  
over Indiana in the Eastern Conference finals, but has struggled 
with foul trouble as New York fell behind San Antonio 2-0 in the 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``To start the game, I can bring my energy and enthusiasm and  
hopefully get us going and get the crowd going,'' Camby said. 
``Then I can go out and get a blow and come out in the second 
quarter and do the same thing in the second half.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It did not work out that way, though.

<HEADLINE> Coca-Cola Remains Off Paris Shelves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Canned Coca-Cola remained off the shelves for a  
sixth day today, with officials still unable to explain why the 
beverage sickened dozens of people. 
</P>
<P>
	The company counterattacked with a full-page ad saying the  
quality of its soft drinks is ``irreproachable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola France provided consumers with a free telephone number  
to check whether their cans of Coke were among the lots implicated 
in the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad appearing in major French dailies said that analyses by  
Coca-Cola and by independent teams show that ``the drink is not in 
question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Its quality is irreproachable,'' the add said.  
</P>
<P>
	Some 50 million cans of Coca-Cola, Coca-Light, Sprite and Fanta  
were withdrawn last Tuesday from the French market, following a 
similar move in Belgium, after dozens of people who drank the 
product complained of stomach aches or nausea. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke said last week that the problem Cokes came from plants in  
Dunkirk, France, and Antwerp, Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coca-Cola plant in Dunkirk announced Wednesday night that it  
was halting manufacture of products destined for markets in France 
and Belgium. Only beverages for the Netherlands were being 
produced. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dunkirk plant can produce 1,600 cans a minute on four  
production lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke said substandard gas used to carbonate drinks at the  
Antwerp plant caused a bad taste, and that a fungicide used on 
crates in Dunkirk was absorbed by the underside of cans and gave 
off an ``offensive odor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, tests have so far failed to detect a problem with the  
drink itself or explain why consumers were sickened, French 
officials have said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Energy Workers Get Lie Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The head of a presidential panel on nuclear  
weapons security, backed by congressional Republicans, says 
security problems within the Department of Energy can't be fixed 
without creating a new semi-independent agency to oversee nuclear 
arms programs. 
</P>
<P>
	But Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, said he is successfully  
confronting the security lapses revealed in investigations of 
suspected Chinese spying at weapons laboratories, and that no new 
agency is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are ready to have a beefed-up security entity within the  
Department of Energy that is stronger,'' Richardson said on ``Fox 
News Sunday.'' ``What I don't want is a new agency that is 
autonomous that does not report to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But former Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., who chaired a panel of  
the president's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board that issued a 
highly critical report of the DOE's counterintelligence efforts 
last week, said the department has failed to carry out two key 
security measures that President Clinton ordered 16 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	It has yet to fully implement polygraph tests for scientists at  
the labs and tighter security checks for foreign visitors, Rudman 
said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' ``The attitude of people within 
that department, in that bureaucracy, is astounding,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post reported today that the federal government  
has begun administering polygraphs on the first of 5,000 nuclear 
weapons scientists and other sensitive employees at DOE. 
</P>
<P>
	It could take four years to complete an initial round of  
examinations on the federal workers and private contractors working 
with highly classified nuclear secrets, said Edward J. Curran, head 
of Energy's counterintelligence office. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, only that office's staff has been given the tests, he  
said. Richardson told the Post some employees and civil liberties 
groups are likely to protest the polygraphs and ``I fully expect 
lawsuits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president of the University of California, Richard C.  
Atkinson, has ordered a review of security at the three nuclear 
laboratories managed by the university to make sure national 
security is not being compromised. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI has investigated allegations that a former employee of  
Los Alamos National Laboratory near Santa Fe, N.M., was a spy for 
China. The university also manages Lawrence Livermore National 
Laboratory and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
	Atkinson has asked his Council on National Laboratories to  
examine whether newly tightened measures are being implemented and 
whether additional measures are needed. He also wants to compare 
the university's security to the protocol used by Lockheed Martin, 
which manages the Sandia National Laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	Rudman, meanwhile, is expected to receive a good reception  
Tuesday when he testifies to Congress on his panel's recommendation 
that the weapons program become semi-autonomous, reporting only to 
the energy secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	``I agree with the Rudman report,'' said Sen. Richard Shelby,  
R-Ala., chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. ``We've said 
all along that the labs are not safe today. They're not safe 
tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson, he said, is trying to ``seal the leaks at the labs.  
He's trying to bring accountability to the labs. But I believe it's 
going to take statutory change to do it. I don't believe ultimately 
he can do it just by himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shelby said Republican Sens. Frank Murkowski of Alaska, Jon Kyl  
of Arizona and Pete Domenici of New Mexico would try to attach 
language on such a separation of powers to an intelligence spending 
bill coming before the Senate soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said there were still problems to resolve but ``we  
have had dramatic improvements.'' He said he ordered a two-day 
stand-down at all the nuclear labs to test security measures, and 
that he plans to dismiss some people responsible for security 
lapses in about three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson last week also named retired Air Force Gen. Eugene  
Habiger, the former commander of all U.S. strategic nuclear forces, 
to head security operations at DOE.

<HEADLINE> China Economic Growth Plan Stalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- The construction workers putting the  
finishing touches on Shanghai's second international airport are 
soldiers in an economic war against recession. 
</P>
<P>
	For months, China has poured money into building airports, roads  
and other large construction projects. It hopes putting extra cash 
in Chinese pockets will fuel a domestic consumer boom, creating new 
sources of growth for its slowing, export-oriented economy. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, that isn't happening. Retail sales, corporate profits  
and housing prices are stuck at lackluster levels as government 
debt grows. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really a challenge for them to jump-start private  
consumption before the money runs out,'' said Dong Tao, chief 
regional economist for Credit Suisse First Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	China's use of capitalist-style deficit spending to perk up an  
economy still dominated by communist state industry highlights the 
unique struggle facing the only big East Asian economy to dodge the 
1997 financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	China is trying to overhaul decrepit state industries, an effort  
that is costing millions of jobs. But it also wants to boost 
consumer spending to prop up slumping prices that threaten to ruin 
Chinese companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall growth looks healthy enough. The government target for  
1999 is 7 percent, down from 7.8 percent last year. The State 
Information Research Center says growth could surpass that in the 
first half of the year, hitting an annualized rate of 8.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But such figures can be deceptive. Compared with other major  
economies, inefficient China wastes state money on dubious building 
projects and production of goods that nobody buys. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my opinion, the economy is not growing at all, or at most  
by no more than 3 percent,'' said Marc Faber, a financial 
consultant in Hong Kong. ``It would be better to get government out 
of spending and focus on private investment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An avalanche of ominous statistics shows the fragility of many  
sections of the economy. Exports fell sharply in the first four 
months of 1999, ranging from a 3.7 percent drop for steel to a 23.7 
fall for textiles. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the government says public-works spending  
should soar by 21 percent in the first half of the year. Projects 
include Pudong International Airport in Shanghai, due to open in 
October at a cost of $1.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite infusions of cash, growth in retail sales has held  
steady for six months at about 6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Housing sales are growing but supply so outstrips demand that  
average prices hit a record low in April of $22 per square foot, 
the official Xinhua News Agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Slack consumer demand has accelerated a steady decline in prices  
that began last year. In April, they were 3.5 percent below the 
same month in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	That has fed fears of a disastrous downward spiral that could  
bankrupt producers. In some industries, the government has imposed 
minimum prices to keep companies from ruining each other with price 
wars. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepping up the private economy is crucial for Chinese leaders  
who need to create new jobs as state companies fire workers in a 
frantic drive to become profitable. Companies that can't do so by 
2002 are threatened with being shut down. 
</P>
<P>
	Word of new layoffs comes almost weekly. The China National  
Petroleum Co. plans to cut 75,000 jobs this year. The government of 
Fujian province in the southeast says it will lay off 240,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The government made a bid in early June for more foreign money  
to pay for reform. Regulators announced that Chinese private and 
joint-venture companies will be allowed for the first time to sell 
stock priced in U.S. dollars to foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, only state companies could issue shares meant for  
foreigners, but many had pulled out of the market because of low 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, China can afford to keep spending to stimulate growth,  
economists say. Its debt is low by world standards, and Chinese 
households save on average 40 percent of their incomes, creating a 
huge pool of money available for loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest danger to an economy still heavily dependent on  
exports lies in the threat of recession in the United States, its 
key market, Faber said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see the prospect of a recession or at least a slowdown in  
the next 18 months,'' he said. ``The impact would be very heavy on 
China.''

<HEADLINE> Coast Guard Cutter Named for Haley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The late author Alex Haley, who won the  
Pulitzer Prize for his novel ``Roots,'' will soon have a 
distinction earned by no other journalist: His name will adorn a 
Coast Guard vessel. 
</P>
<P>
	The Alex Haley, formerly a 283-foot Navy ship named the USS  
Edenton, has received a $20 million overhaul at the Coast Guard's 
shipyard in Baltimore. On July 10, Transportation Secretary Rodney 
Slater, who oversees the Coast Guard, will commission the vessel 
along with Adm. James Loy, commandant of the Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of actors from the TV miniseries ``Roots'' have been  
invited to the ceremony at the shipyard. The story blended fact and 
imagined events in tracing Haley's family back six generations to 
Kunta Kinte, a man kidnapped from Gambia, West Africa, in 1767 and 
shipped to this country as a slave. 
</P>
<P>
	While Haley is best remembered for the novel, he spent 20 years  
in the Coast Guard, rising from ship's steward to become the first 
head of the Guard's public affairs office. 
</P>
<P>
	His shipmates, realizing the quality of his writing, would pay  
Haley 50 cents to ghostwrite love letters to their girlfriends. 
</P>
<P>
	``I became known as the cook who could write,'' recalled Haley,  
who died in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Haley's namesake cutter will be based in Kodiak, Alaska. It will  
be used for fisheries enforcement and search and rescue missions in 
the Bering Sea, Gulf of Alaska and the northern Pacific Ocean.

<HEADLINE> Lukas Suspended For Drug Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- D. Wayne Lukas, trainer of Kentucky Derby  
and Preakness winner Charismatic, has been suspended by Churchill 
Downs for 10 days after one of his horses failed a postrace drug 
test. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspension most likely will be upheld by other state  
commissions, meaning Lukas will not be permitted on the grounds of 
any recognized race track in the country as long as he is 
suspended. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspension is scheduled for July 6-15.  
</P>
<P>
	The stewards made their decision during an informal hearing  
Sunday at Churchill Downs, giving Lukas the minimum sanction for a 
positive test. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2-year-old horse tested positive on May 16 for  
benzenemethanol, which is present in most analgesics and 
antihistamines. Dance Master, a 3-5 favorite in the maiden race, 
finished second. He was disqualified from the purse money. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernie Hettel, the chief state steward and executive director of  
the Kentucky Racing Commission, said Lukas told the stewards that 
he will not appeal. He could not be reached for comment Monday at 
Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Hettel said benzenemethanol is widely used for minor breathing  
problems and skin diseases but it is not permitted in a horse's 
system when it races. 
</P>
<P>
	It is ``a therapeutic medication used on horses with regularity  
and necessity,'' Hettel said, adding the substance is not a 
stimulant. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Larry Bramlage with Rood and Riddle Equine Hospital in  
Lexington said benzenemethanol was not in the list of veterinary 
drugs or controlled substances. He said it was most likely a 
solvent of some kind found in many topical medications such as 
liniment. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas was not in Kentucky for the May 16 race, which came a day  
after Charismatic won the Preakness. But racing regulations say a 
trainer is the ``primary responsible party'' for his horses. 
</P>
<P>
	On June 5, the day after Charismatic lost his Triple Crown bid  
in the Belmont, Dance Master won by four lengths at Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	He is to run in Saturday's Bashford Manor at Churchill Downs.

<HEADLINE> Blues Get Goalie Turek From Stars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Goalie Roman Turek spent less than 24 hours as  
a member of the Stanley Cup champions. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, one day after the Dallas Stars captured the Cup,  
Turek was dealt to the St. Louis Blues in exchange for a 
third-round pick in the Entry Draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The backup to Ed Belfour will be a former member of the Stars  
during today's victory parade. But his new general manager said 
Turek may have the chance to do something in St. Louis he didn't do 
much in Dallas -- start. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe Roman has the ability and character to be a No. 1  
goaltender, and he'll get the chance to prove that,'' Blues general 
manager Larry Pleau said. ``Roman should be an excellent fit for 
our club. 
</P>
<P>
	``His experience playing for a Stanley Cup champion should  
benefit us next season and into the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turek, 29, is expected to challenge 37-year-old Grant Fuhr for  
the starting job. He was 16-3-3 with one shutout and a 2.02 
goals-against average last season for the Stanley Cup champions and 
tied for 10th in the NHL with a .925 save percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuhr likely will be exposed in the expansion draft on Friday.  
Pleau said he'd only protect one goalie when he submitted his list 
Monday, but wouldn't say which one. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuhr, who makes $3 million, said he'd understand the tactic. In  
the middle of last season, he announced plans to retire at the end 
of next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Old, high salary, I'd say I'm pretty safe,'' Fuhr said.  
</P>
<P>
	Whatever happens, Pleau said Fuhr has always carried too much of  
the load in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right from the start, we never expected him to play 50-60-70  
games,'' Pleau said. ``We've been looking for a goaltender to take 
the opportunity and run with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues used five goaltenders last season, with many of them  
receiving auditions when Fuhr was out with a knee injury. Jamie 
McLennan was the backup most of last season and the team also used 
rookie Brent Johnson, Rich Parent and Jim Carey. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a load of goalies right now,'' Pleau said. ``We'll  
see what happens the rest of the summer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Down the line, Pleau believes Johnson, 21, has the ability to be  
the starter. But Johnson likely will play at Worcester, Mass., of 
the American Hockey League next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel he's got a bright future,'' Pleau said. ``We also feel  
it's important to give him that extra development time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turek made his NHL debut in 1996-97 with the Stars, going 3-1  
with a 2.05 goals-against average. The following season he was 
11-10-1 with a 2.22 goals-against and one shutout. 
</P>
<P>
	Turek was a member of the Czech team at the 1996 World Cup. He  
also played on the Czech squad that won the gold medal at the 1996 
world championships, posting a 7-0-1 record.

<HEADLINE> US, Cuba Hold Counter-Narcotics Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amid protests from Cuban-American lawmakers,  
four U.S. officials met Monday in Havana with Cuban officials to 
discuss ways of improving counter-narcotics cooperation, a State 
Department official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meetings between U.S. and Cuban officials on issues other than  
migration are rare but not unprecedented. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a change in U.S. policy,'' said Michael  
Ranneberger, who heads the State Department's office of Cuban 
affairs. He said the meeting was taking place within guidelines for 
law enforcement efforts on counter-narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team consisted of two State Department and two Coast  
Guard officials, none of whom holds a high rank. They were to spend 
only one day in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's meeting was aimed at elevating communications on  
counter-narcotics issues from an existing telex link to a phone 
link and other means, an official said, adding that the U.S. team 
had no plans to offer assistance to Cuba, to share intelligence or 
to discuss joint operations. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. counter-drug specialists have become increasingly concerned  
about South American traffickers' use of Cuban waters and air space 
to transport drugs to the United States, and the law enforcement 
community had requested that a team be sent, said the official, who 
spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., objected strongly to the  
decision, saying it was ridiculous for the administration to give 
Cuban President Fidel Castro credibility on the drug issue. She 
said Castro is notorious for helping drug traffickers. Similar 
objections were voiced by Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart who, like 
Ros-Lehtinen, is a Cuban-born South Florida Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview, Diaz-Balart said a grand jury in U.S.  
District Court in South Florida prepared an indictment against the 
Castro government concerning tons of cocaine that entered the 
United States. The Clinton administration shelved the indictment in 
1993 despite ``massive'' evidence of Cuban involvement with drug 
kingpins, the congressman said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Barry McCaffrey, the White House drug control policy chief,  
said last month that Cuba has shown a willingness to help the 
United States fight international drug trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a small portion of the drugs entering the United States  
come through Cuba, McCaffrey said, adding that the island's 
location and a growing tourist market could make it an opportune 
target for drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey also credited Cuba with acting on intelligence the  
United States provides to Cuban authorities. Cuba lacks the 
resources to counter large drug-trafficking organizations, so drugs 
are routinely flown over Cuba or dumped in Cuban waters without 
effective resistance by local authorities, he said.

<HEADLINE> Stars Shine in Stanley Cup Clincher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- A long game ended too quickly for the  
Buffalo Sabres and the Dallas Stars walked off with the Stanley Cup 
under a cloud of controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	All of a sudden, the troublesome man-in-the crease rule had  
become a major issue in the NHL. The question now over the summer: 
Should it be changed? 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody will remember this as the Stanley Cup that was never  
won in '99,'' said Buffalo's Joe Juneau after the Stars won a 2-1 
triple-overtime thriller on Brett Hull's questionable goal Saturday 
night in Game 6 of the Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Sabres wanted to put an asterisk next to the Stars' name  
in the Stanley Cup record book, you couldn't blame them. They felt 
they had been cheated out of a chance to win the Cup because of a 
bad call by NHL officials. The television replay showed Hull had a 
skate in the crease when he scored the game winner with 5:09 left 
in the third overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Usually the man-in-the-crease rule is a strict interpretation  
with no gray matter: It disallows a goal if an offensive player has 
any part of his body in the goalie crease. Not this time. 
</P>
<P>
	The official response from the league: This one counted because  
the player (Hull) had full control of the puck. 
</P>
<P>
	``The debate here seems to be, did he or did he not have  
possession and control,'' said Bryan Lewis, the NHL's director of 
officiating. ``Our words from upstairs and our view was that, yes, 
he did. He played the puck from his foot to his stick, shot and 
scored.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rule has been the bane of skaters for some time. Many a goal  
has been disallowed even by infractions that are purely incidental 
to the play, such as a teammate's skate in the crease away from the 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, the NHL's general managers met just a few days before  
at the finals to discuss the controversial ruling. Commissioner 
Gary Bettman said the league was worried about the game losing some 
of its spontaneity when play is stopped for a video review of a 
goal. He added the ruling was under review for a possible change. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't have to worry about spontaneity Saturday night.  
</P>
<P>
	As soon as Hull scored, the Stars, wearing Stanley Cup  
championship baseball caps, leaped over the bench onto the ice and 
started hugging each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's got to be the worst nightmare right there,'' Sabres coach  
Lindy Ruff said. ``They knew that they ran the risk of an overtime 
goal meaning a series. Stanley Cup pandemonium sets in and they 
can't go back to review it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said the goal was, in fact, reviewed quite thoroughly.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our immediate reaction is to take a look at it, back up tapes  
from a variety of angles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said officials looked at the play ``probably six, eight  
(times).'' 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy at the end overshadowed a superb contest between  
two evenly matched teams. Every game in the finals was pretty much 
a carbon copy of the next -- low scoring and high tension. There was 
plenty of hard hitting and good goaltending from Dallas' Ed Belfour 
and Buffalo's Dominik Hasek. 
</P>
<P>
	Belfour, shaking off the tag that he couldn't win big games,  
made 53 saves in the clinching Game 6. Hasek pretty much lived up 
to his title as ``World's Greatest Goalie'' with 48. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were such a great team,'' Hull said of the Sabres, who  
came into the finals as underdogs to the top-ranked Stars after 
finishing as the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference. ``They are 
so well coached and worked so hard. I tip my hat to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Playing underdog all the way through, the Sabres knocked off  
Ottawa, Boston and Toronto to make it into the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	In a remarkably close series, the Sabres and the Western  
champion Stars were either tied or just one goal apart for all but 
5:05 of the six-plus games, including two that went into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars were pretty much bucking odds themselves. The last  
team to win both the Presidents' Trophy with the league's best 
record and the Stanley Cup was the New York Rangers in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to redeem themselves after winning the trophy and then  
losing in the playoffs last year, the Stars beat Edmonton, St. 
Louis and Colorado before Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had it in our minds that we were going to do this in  
September,'' said Stars forward Brian Skrudland, ``and we were 
going to win this in any way we could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In some ways, the Sabres felt the Stars had gone too far. Sabres  
captain Michael Peca charged that the Stars were a dirty team. 
</P>
<P>
	They were certainly an injured team. That didn't keep their top  
players off the ice for long, however. Hull was forced to miss one 
game with an injured groin, but came back to play with a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday night, he was at his best while also playing with an  
injured knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Jere Lehtinen scored a first-period goal for Dallas and Stu  
Barnes in the second for Buffalo. That was all the scoring until 
Hull found himself in front of the net late in the third overtime, 
won the battle over several other players for the puck and punched 
the game winner over a prone Hasek. 
</P>
<P>
	The game winner went to Hull and the Conn Smythe Trophy as the  
playoffs' MVP to Joe Nieuwendyk, who had six game-winning playoff 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels incredible,'' said Nieuwendyk, who won the first Cup  
in Calgary in 1989 before winning the first for Dallas. ``It is 
just one battle after another and it makes it all the worthwhile in 
the end. It has been a great ride for us.''

<HEADLINE> China Working on Cloning Panda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Scientists have taken a step toward cloning a  
giant panda by growing an embryo that contains a dead animal's 
genes -- a development China hailed as a possible breakthrough in 
efforts to save the endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists from the government-funded Chinese Academy of  
Sciences grew the embryo by introducing cells from a dead female 
panda into the egg cells of a Japanese white rabbit, the state-run 
Xinhua News Agency said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The embryo was nurtured over 10 months and scientists are now  
trying to implant it in a host animal's uterus. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it works, they will possibly have created the world's first  
cloned panda,'' Xinhua said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although scientists have cloned other large animals, notably the  
sheep Dolly, the cloning has required repeated efforts -- with many 
failed pregnancies. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, China announced plans to try to clone a giant panda  
within three to five years. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chen Dayuan, who leads the government-backed panda cloning  
project, said scientists now believe they will need less time, 
Xinhua reported. 
</P>
<P>
	It hailed the development as a potentially ``critical and  
exciting breakthrough'' for saving the species, which is unique to 
China. 
</P>
<P>
	Only about 1,000 pandas live in the wild, with another 100 in  
zoos. Experts have warned that the animal could become extinct in a 
couple of dozen years.

<HEADLINE> Stewart Gets Advice on Putting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- We learned one thing about U.S. Open  
champion Payne Stewart -- he's not too vain to take some putting 
advice from his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	After watching the third round of the Open on TV, Tracey Stewart  
was waiting for her husband Saturday night to offer some tips on 
his poor putting. 
</P>
<P>
	She told him to hold his head still and see the club hit the  
ball. Stewart, who admitted he had been lifting his head, listened. 
He then proceeded to the practice putting green and stroked some 
putts with his eyes shut. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a routine that would ultimately land him his second  
national golfing title of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard on television before that one of the detriments of  
Payne Stewart's golf game is he's not a good putter. Well, maybe I 
squelched those rumors,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After taking 31 putts to get around Pinehurst No. 2 with a  
2-over 72 in the third round, Stewart needed only 24 putts Sunday 
to put away playing partner Phil Mickelson. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's par-saving 15-footer on the 18th hole won him the  
Open, and proceeded to set off a fist-waving, caddie-hugging, teary 
celebration on one of Donald Ross' turtleback greens. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how high I jumped, but it felt like I was sky  
high,'' Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart is third on the PGA Tour in putting average and sixth in  
putts per round. He finished in a tie for eighth in putting at the 
Open and only Dudley Hart's 23 putts were fewer than Stewart's 24 
on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart did more than nail his clutch putt on No. 18. A  
25-footer on 16 to save par kept Stewart in the tournament. A 
3-footer on the next hole put him ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``The putts Payne made on 16 and 18 showed what a great champion  
he is,'' Mickelson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart ended up with 12 one-putts Sunday -- the mark of a steady  
champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said to myself, `You've always wanted a putt to win the U.S.  
Open,''' Stewart said. ``I can't describe the feeling in my body 
when I looked up and the ball was going in the hole. It was 
unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was quite a difference from last year at the Olympic Club,  
where Stewart missed putts coming down the stretch, including one 
on the 18th that would have given him a tie with Lee Janzen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had something to prove to myself this time,'' Stewart said.  
``I had to get in position and I had to deal with it once I got 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson, who one-putted four of the first six holes for par,  
missed down the stretch when it counted the most. 
</P>
<P>
	He gave himself a chance, but when his 40-footer for birdie on  
15 hit the cup, seemed ready to drop, and then spun out, his luck 
seemingly ran out. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson missed a 7-footer for par on 16 that dropped him into  
a tie with Stewart, then missed a 7-footer for birdie on the next 
hole. Still, even when his 25-footer slid past the cup on 18 he was 
heading toward a Monday playoff if Stewart didn't make his. 
</P>
<P>
	``He waits for players to falter,'' Mickelson said when  
addressing Stewart's strategy and success in recent Opens. ``This 
time, he made something happen in that he ended up playing under 
par the last few holes.''

<HEADLINE> Va. To Hold Presidential Primary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Virginia's Republican Party leadership has  
voted to hold a presidential primary, a decision party leaders say 
will give the state more national clout. 
</P>
<P>
	On a voice vote Saturday, the Republican's Party's State Central  
Committee passed a resolution to hold a primary on Feb. 29, 2000. 
The vast majority of committee members voted in favor of the 
resolution. 
</P>
<P>
	``This opens it up to Republicans around the state and will  
expand the base of the party,'' said Chris LaCivita, executive 
director of the state GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Virginia GOP's old process, some delegates to the  
national Republican convention were chosen at congressional 
district conventions in May. The remainder were elected at-large at 
a state party convention in June, usually well after the nominee 
had been decided. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, a February primary transforms Virginia into one of  
the first five states to endorse a candidate for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters said the primary will make Virginia far more  
influential. ``While Virginia may be the mother of all presidents 
we are the selector of none,'' said David Hummel of Virginia Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents said a primary could hurt the party because under  
Virginia's open registration system, Democrats can vote in the 
Republican primary, thus influencing the choice of the other 
party's nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't going to be helpful to us and it might be harmful  
for us,'' said Morton Blackwell of Arlington. ``This is the system 
that is easiest for Democrats to invade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the new primary system, registered voters will be able to  
vote for the nominee of their choice. State Republicans will 
continue to select delegates to the national convention, but 
delegates will have to vote for the candidate that wins the 
Virginia primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia Democrats still nominate delegates at a convention.  
They have shown no interest in changing their system. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia is one of several states that have established  
primaries or moved the dates of primaries in an attempt to have 
more say in national elections. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina Republicans recently decided move their primary  
to Feb. 19, and Louisiana's Republican leaders decided earlier this 
month to hold a 2000 presidential caucus one week ahead of Iowa's 
traditional first-in-the-nation caucus. That decision must be 
approved by the Republican National Committee.

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Arrest warrants have been issued against  
two top leaders of the leftist rebel group which has kidnapped 
nearly 200 people, prosecutors said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief federal prosecutor, Alfonso Gomez called Antonio Garcia  
and Pablo Beltran of the National Liberation Army, or ELN, the 
``intellectual authors'' of the April 12 hijacking of an Avianca 
domestic flight with 41 passengers and crew aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Gomez said Garcia and the ELN's highest-ranking commander,  
Nicolas Rodriguez, are also under investigation for ordering the 
rebels' May 30 raid on a Catholic Mass. About 140 worshippers were 
trucked into the mountains in the assault in the western city of 
Cali. 
</P>
<P>

as nine people seized June 6 by guerrillas who ambushed a fishing

	SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Chile's president reshuffled five Cabinet  
posts Monday, re-assigning the foreign minister who failed to 
broker the release of ex-dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet from arrest 
in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	President Eduardo Frei, who is poised to announce measures to  
boost Chile's economy, kept his economic team intact. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Miguel Insulza, the foreign minister who failed to win  
Pinochet's release from arrest in Britain, was made chief of staff. 
He was replaced by Juan Gabriel Valdes, an economist. 
</P>
<P>
	Edmundo Perez, currently the ambassador to Argentina, was named  
defense minister, a job he had held three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez's job may prove crucial, as the military has given  
indications for the first time that it may cooperate in efforts to 
find the remains of more than 1,000 dissidents who remain 
unaccounted for after being arrested under Pinochet's 1973-90 
dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet has been under police custody in Britain since last  
October, fighting extradition to Spain where a judge wants to try 
him for human rights violations during his regime.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The body of a U.S. man who apparently drowned  
along with three other Americans has been found on a beach on 
Mexico's southern Pacific coast, local media reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of John Weems, a 19-year-old student at Delta State  
University in Cleveland, Miss., was found Sunday at the Playa Linda 
beach in the Chiapas port city of Puerto Madero, the newspaper 
Reforma reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Weems, of Nacogdoches, Texas, played on the university's tennis  
team, said Fred Singston, Delta State's sports information 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	Weems' body and that of another drowning victim, 9-year-old Joy  
Love Murphy, will be returned to the United States for burial. No 
information on the child's hometown was immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	The four Americans, members of a group of Baptist missionaries,  
drowned when they were pulled into a strong Pacific Ocean current 
at the popular beach spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Lynn Sloan, 37, and his 11-year-old daughter Carla, both of  
Lufkin, Texas, also drowned. Their bodies will be buried in the 
Chiapas city of Tapachula, on the Guatemalan border, as a tribute 
to the missionary work they were carrying out in the region.

<P>
	Horacio and Humberto Paz insisted they would end their strike

<HEADLINE> NAACP Receives Million-Dollar Gift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A foundation established by the late owner of  
the food conglomerate TLC Beatrice gave the NAACP $1 million to 
continue training future budding black business leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	The money will allow the National Association for the  
Advancement of Colored People to continue funding the NAACP 
Reginald F. Lewis Youth Entrepreneurial Institute for five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis formed TLC Beatrice International Holdings Inc. in a $985  
million buyout funded partly by junk bond mastermind Michael Milken 
in 1987. The deal made Lewis the first black executive to control a 
billion-dollar company. 
</P>
<P>
	He died of brain cancer in 1993.  
</P>
<P>
	This summer, 120 high school students will take the four-week  
course that bears his name, which includes classes on finance, team 
building and etiquette. The program, first started in 1994, will be 
offered this year in Baltimore; Atlanta; Austin, Tex.; Charlotte, 
N.C.; Columbia, S.C.; Fort Lauderdale, Fla; Gary, Ind.; and 
Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	NAACP President Kweisi Mfume said the program is needed to  
bolster the number of black entrepreneurs in the United States, 
something that is ``simply not going to happen in a vacuum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a talent pool we're creating here,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Forbes magazine listed Lewis among the 400 richest Americans in  
1992, when his net worth was an estimated $400 million. After his 
death the following year, the company suffered both management and 
shareholder turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis' widow, Loida Nicolas Lewis, took the helm of the company.  
In May, she announced plans to liquidate the largely European food 
conglomerate her husband oversaw. Management convinced her it was 
the best course for investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout its short life, TLC Beatrice has been hailed as a  
success story. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1987, when TLC Beatrice reported revenue of $1.8 billion, it  
became the first black-owned company to have more than $1 billion 
in annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The company then began its reign at the top of Black Enterprise  
magazine's annual list of the country's 100 biggest black-owned 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	TLC Beatrice, which was closely held by the Lewis family and  
associates, hit its peak in 1996 when it had $2.23 billion in 
revenue.

<HEADLINE> Senate Votes on Lobbying Wait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former House Appropriations Committee chairman  
Bob Livingston, who opened his own lobbying firm after leaving 
Congress in February, must wait a year before he can talk to his 
former colleagues about his new clients. 
</P>
<P>
	Under legislation that has passed the Senate, future  
lawmakers-turned-lobbyists would have to wait a second year. 
</P>
<P>
	As under current law, however, they could still sell advice and  
counsel to corporate clients and could immediately set up a 
lobbying shop by hiring underlings to make the formal contacts with 
House and Senate members. They just couldn't call their former 
colleagues on behalf of a client for two years, double the current 
moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
	While the proposal won't affect ex-lawmakers like Livingston, he  
still doesn't like it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's ridiculous,'' the Louisiana Republican said.  
``Once they're outside the jurisdiction of the Congress, to impinge 
on one's right to practice law or to lobby or to speak is a 
violation of the First Amendment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Senate legislation, staff members also would have to  
wait two years before lobbying any member in the house of Congress 
that employed them. Currently, former staffers are under a one-year 
moratorium that only prohibits lobbying the lawmaker or committee 
they worked for. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., added the little-noticed provision  
to the Senate version of a spending bill for congressional 
operations approved last week. The House version of the spending 
bill, passed last month, does not include the provision. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional negotiators will decide whether the tougher  
moratorium will be in the final spending bill. A similar 
Feingold-sponsored provision passed the Senate in 1996 but 
negotiators left it out of the final legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Feingold said the longer ban means that an entire two-year  
session of Congress would end before an ex-lawmaker could lobby 
former colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``It addresses a perception that too often rises to the level of  
reality -- that the interests that hire former members or staffers 
from Congress have special access when they lobby Congress,'' 
Feingold said. 
</P>
<P>
	The American League of Lobbyists opposes special restrictions on  
lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's punitive to former members,'' said organization president  
Kenneth Feltman. ``Simply because someone has been a member of 
Congress should not lead to the presumption that they need two 
years to reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The measure wouldn't affect lawmakers who have already left  
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Livingston has registered to lobby on behalf of several defense  
contractors, including Avondale Industries, Bollinger Shipyards and 
Halter Marine Group. Each is seeking a share of the federal funds 
Livingston helped allocate as chairman of the powerful House 
Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	While in Congress, he received more financial support from the  
defense industry than any other interest, and he helped the 
Pentagon fend off bigger budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Livingston was in line to succeed Newt Gingrich as House  
speaker, but resigned his seat amid the impeachment proceedings 
against President Clinton after admitting to his own extramarital 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Among former lawmakers who did not seek re-election in 1998,  
former House Rules Committee Chairman Gerald B.H. Solomon, R-N.Y., 
set up his own lobbying shop, while ex-Sens. Dan Coats, R-Ind., and 
Wendell Ford, D-Ky., and ex-Reps. Bill Paxon, R-N.Y., and Vic 
Fazio, D-Calif. all joined established firms.

<HEADLINE> 'Austin Powers' Faces Censors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Imagine hearing Austin Powers, the  
International Man of Mystery, as he purrs: ``Shall we shiok now or 
shall we shiok later?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shiok? It's gotta be dirty, right?  
</P>
<P>
	Actually, it's Singaporean English for ``treat nicely.''  
</P>
<P>
	That's the tamer translation censors in that country wanted for  
the hipster's trademark term ``shag,'' which is a British obscenity 
for sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Objections from foreign censors have complicated the  
international release of ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' 
which is packed with graphic sex jokes, double-entendres and, of 
course, the S-H-A-G word. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore officials wanted to change the title to ``The Spy Who  
Shioked Me,'' even though ``shagged'' means ``tired'' in local 
lingo. Malaysian censors aren't happy either, said Rolf Mittweg, 
head of international marketing at New Line Cinema, which released 
the comedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaysian censors ``decided we are not allowed to use the word  
'shag,' and want to change the title to 'The Spy Who Dot-Dot-Dot 
Me,''' Mittweg said from his Los Angeles office. 
</P>
<P>
	Even after censoring, Malaysian officials say they expect to  
rate the sequel ``18-SX,'' which grants access only to adults. 
</P>
<P>
	The filmmakers are trying to come up with various replacements  
for ``shag'' because state censors in Indonesia, Egypt and South 
Korea are also sharpening their scissors, Mittweg said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want the movie to sound too vulgar, but also it can't  
be too soft,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Britain, where the term originated, The Sun tabloid reported  
Thursday that theater owners plan to remove the subtitle from 
marquees when the movie opens here in July and plan to just call it 
``Austin Powers II.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be wrong to put something like that up in cinemas  
where children are coming in,'' Barry Jenkins, chief executive of 
the ABC Cinema chain, told The Sun tabloid newspaper in London. 
</P>
<P>
	American filmmakers and foreign censors have repeatedly clashed  
over the difference between funny and taboo in recent years as the 
international market for films expands into countries with strict 
obscenity regulations. Blockbuster U.S. films often make more 
abroad than they do in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is always the fear now that some sort of government  
censorship will step in and ruin the intent of a movie. That's more 
of a fear than foreign audiences not getting the jokes,'' said Paul 
Dergarabedian, a film industry analyst with Exhibitor Relations Co. 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	When the gross-out comedy ``There's Something About Mary''  
opened around the world last year, 20th Century Fox also struggled 
with foreign censors who balked at scenes of a dog being 
electrocuted and a teen-ager accidentally snarling his genitals in 
a zipper. 
</P>
<P>
	Mittweg added that New Line ran into similar trouble with  
``Boogie Nights,'' a graphic 1997 film about a group of 1970s-era 
pornographers. 
</P>
<P>
	However, some fans steadfastly oppose sacrificing any part of  
Mike Myers' amorous, snaggletoothed superspy. The censors in 
Singapore lifted their ban on the title after local newspapers were 
flooded with letters objecting to the ``shiok'' substitute. 
</P>
<P>
	Mittweg said the makers of ``Austin Powers'' have issued a  
booklet explaining the jokes to translators, such as when the spy 
tries to seduce a go-go dancer by growling, ``I put the 'grrrr' in 
swinger, baby!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without the lexicon, for instance, ``shag'' could be translated  
in French as ``tapis a longs poils,'' which means ``carpet with 
long hairs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dergarabedian predicted most of the humor in the film would  
tickle rather than offend international audiences because the sex 
jokes are largely innuendo. 
</P>
<P>
	Austin Powers is certainly naked as he prances through an  
upscale hotel in the film's opening sequence, but the spy's private 
parts are perpetually obscured by foreground props such as a 
child's pinwheel, cooked ham and, as a last resort, the film's 
credits. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the joke,'' Dergarabedian said. ``Who has the dirty  
mind? Is it the filmmaker or the audience?''

<HEADLINE> Suspected Serial Killer Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MURPHYSBORO, Ill. (AP) -- An alleged serial killer who is  
apparently making his way from town to town by hopping freight 
trains was charged Monday with murdering a father and daughter in 
Illinois, bringing to eight the number of slayings he is linked to. 
</P>
<P>
	Rafael Resendez-Ramirez was also put on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted  
list Monday. He is wanted for questioning in five killings in Texas 
and one in Kentucky since August 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I do know is that if this person is the person we suspect  
in these crimes, it's a very dangerous and violent person,'' said 
Don K. Clark, the agent in charge of FBI's Houston office and 
leader of the nationwide task force searching for the suspect. The 
task force has more than 200 investigators working the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities believe Resendez-Ramirez, 39, has been riding the  
rails, finding victims along the way. All eight slayings took place 
on or near railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	As for a motive, Clark said: ``I wish I could tell you.''  
</P>
<P>
	The task force, assembled earlier this month after authorities  
connected the killings, has stopped and searched freight trains as 
part of its manhunt, and freight railroads have stepped up 
security, watching for drifters hopping trains. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agents also have circulated photographs of Resendez-Ramirez  
in communities along his suspected path. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we've learned about him through profiling, it's just a  
matter of time before he kills again,'' said Mike Cox, spokesman 
for the Texas Department of Public Safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson County, Ill., State's Attorney Mike Wepseic said  
fingerprints found on an abandoned truck connect Resendez-Ramirez 
to the two southern Illinois killings. The bodies of George Morber, 
80, and his 52-year-old daughter, Carolyn Frederick, were found 
June 15 in his home in Gorham, 100 yards from the railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Resendez-Ramirez is accused of shooting Morber in the head with  
a shotgun and using the gun to beat Ms. Frederick in the head. Most 
of the other victims were beaten. 
</P>
<P>
	Morber's truck was found Wednesday in a school parking lot in  
Cairo, about 60 miles south of Gorham. The fingerprints on it 
matched Resendez-Ramirez's, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, an FBI spokesman in Chicago said the agency was  
investigating whether Resendez-Ramirez was involved in the slayings 
of a couple found dead over the weekend in a rural farm house near 
railroad tracks in Apple River, about 335 north of Gorham. 
Authorities did not say how they died. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI also increased a reward for information leading to an  
arrest and conviction from $75,000 to $125,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Numerous sightings of Resendez-Ramirez have been reported  
throughout Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	A tip to police from Donna McHugh helped them connect the Gorham  
killings to Resendez-Ramirez. McHugh identified a photo of him as 
the man she saw Sunday staring at her through the window of a 
laundry in Percy, about 22 miles north of Gorham. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just looked scary,'' McHugh said.  
</P>
<P>
	Resendez-Ramirez was charged in Illinois with murder and home  
invasion. Federal authorities also charged him with unlawful flight 
to avoid prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our community has just been stunned by this senseless act,''  
said Morber's son, Bill Morber. ``Everyone is scared, they're on 
edge, and I think they will be until this Ramirez is caught.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Resendez-Ramirez, a native of Puebla, Mexico,  
has used numerous aliases and changes his appearance by altering 
his hair style and wearing glasses. He has scars on his right ring 
finger, left wrist and forehead, a snake tattoo on his left arm and 
may have a flower tattoo on his left wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	The ex-convict has a criminal record in California, Florida and  
New Mexico on weapons and burglary charges.

<HEADLINE> Phillips Petroleum CEO Retiring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BARTLESVILLE, Okla. (AP) -- The head of Phillips Petroleum Co.  
will step down as chief executive July 1 and retire as chairman in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne W. Allen, who became chairman and chief executive in 1994,  
is leaving the company after reaching age 63 on Oct. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	J.J. Mulva, Phillips' president and chief operating officer,  
will become vice chairman, president and chief executive next 
month, the company said Monday in a news release. Mulva will 
succeed Allen as chairman in October and retain the titles of 
president and CEO. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has no plans to name a new chief operating officer.  
</P>
<P>
	``The company is operating well and has a number of significant  
growth opportunities. It therefore is an opportune time to pass the 
corporation's leadership to Jim Mulva,'' Allen said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are following our succession plan, and the management team  
is in place for continued growth of Phillips,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen was elected president and chief operating officer in 1991  
and took over as the head of the company three years later. 
</P>
<P>
	During the past five years, the company started new offshore oil  
production in China and onshore polyethylene production facilities. 
Under Allen's leadership, Phillips also has new oil prospects in 
Venezuela and has started a major petrochemical project in Qatar. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips recently launched a cost-cutting program to counter a  
tumble in earnings that resulted from low prices at the well and 
pump. 
</P>
<P>
	Mulva, 53, joined Phillips' treasury department in 1973 and has  
served in a variety of domestic and international positions. He was 
named treasurer in 1986 and became chief financial officer in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, he was elected president and chief operating officer.

<HEADLINE> Panel Weighs Internet Tax Options </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILLIAMSBURG, Va. (AP) -- A commission created to recommend  
future tax policy on Internet commerce struggled Monday to resolve 
how to solicit private money to operate and avoid a perception of 
bias. 
</P>
<P>
	When Congress created the 19-member Advisory Commission on  
Electronic Commerce last year, no federal money was provided. 
Instead, lawmakers directed the panel to figure out a way to accept 
private donations and in-kind contributions such as office space. 
</P>
<P>
	But at its inaugural meeting Monday, several members said an  
initial proposal for each member to contribute up to $150,000 each 
could lead to perceptions of bias against state and local 
governments in favor of well-heeled companies represented on the 
panel such as AT&AMP;T, MCI Worldcom and Gateway Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want it to look like people are buying access, buying  
influence,'' said David Pottruck, president of Charles Schwab Corp. 
``It could become a quagmire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congress enacted a three-year moratorium on new e-commerce taxes  
last year when the panel was created. The commission is due to make 
its recommendations to Congress in April 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	A proposed budget of about $1.7 million is envisioned.  
Commission members are not compensated. Virginia provided $150,000 
in startup costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission was delayed for months after organizations  
representing state and local governments filed a federal lawsuit 
claiming the initial appointments were illegally tilted toward 
business. The lawsuit was dropped after Senate Majority Leader 
Trent Lott, R-Miss., replaced Netscape chief James Barksdale with a 
local government official from Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	That conflict and the one over financing demonstrate the  
sensitive nature of the commission's work: How to ensure state and 
local tax collections don't suffer from electronic commerce while 
avoiding a new, heavy tax burden on the companies doing a 
fast-growing business on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal would be to see that whatever solution comes out of  
this strikes the proper balance in a real and credible way,'' said 
Robert Novick, general counsel for U.S. Trade Representative 
Charlene Barshefsky and a commission member. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Michael Leavitt, R-Utah, said the fund raising should be  
publicly disclosed and that it must be done in a way to ensure ``no 
one interest overwhelms the process, so that our product is 
discredited at the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission intends Tuesday to hear several presentations on  
tax issues surrounding the Internet, both domestic and 
international. It will have at least three other meetings -- one 
each in California's Silicon Valley, New York City and Austin, 
Texas.

<HEADLINE> Citizens Purchasing USTrust Corp. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A subsidiary of The Royal Bank Of Scotland  
announced Monday it is acquiring UST Corp. in a deal valued at $1.4 
billion, expanding Citizens' presence in New England. 
</P>
<P>
	Citizens Financial Group will pay $32 for each of UST's  
outstanding shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston-based UST is the parent company of USTrust, which has 87  
banking offices in eastern Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal comes amid major shifts in the New England banking  
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, the Fleet Financial Group Inc. announced it was  
merging with BankBoston. Fleet is the largest bank in New England, 
and BankBoston is the second-largest. 
</P>
<P>
	After that merger, Citizens would rank as the region's  
second-largest bank. And it will expand with the purchase of UST. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to be the pre-eminent bank of choice in this part  
of New England,'' said Lawrence K. Fish, chairman, president and 
CEO of Citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition of UST would increase Citizens' deposits from  
$15.3 billion to $19.5 billion and its loan portfolio from $12.5 
billion to $16.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Citizens will have more than 350 branches throughout New England  
and nearly 800 automated teller machines, the financial group said. 
That will make it the 33rd largest bank in the United States, it 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase will bring new lines of business to Citizens,  
including investment management and insurance brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
	The two institutions have identified a combined 800 positions  
that would be made obsolete by the acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	Fish said the companies also have a combined 500 open positions,  
and efforts will be made to absorb employees into those spots 
rather than lay them off. 
</P>
<P>
	UST currently has about 2,000 employees; Citizens has more than  
5,800. 
</P>
<P>
	Citizens last month announced plans to buy the commercial and  
retail business of another Boston-based bank, State Street Corp., 
for $350 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank officials in Providence, R.I., where Citizens is  
headquartered, said that Neal F. Finnegan, UST's president and CEO, 
will become non-executive chairman of Citizens Bank of 
Massachusetts and a director of Citizens Financial Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Citizens Financial Group operates Citizens Bank in Connecticut,  
Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	UST generated a pretax profit of $90 million in fiscal 1998.  
</P>
<P>
	Pending regulatory approval, the companies hope to close the  
deal by January.

<HEADLINE> Music Ace 2 Offers Basics of Music </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The SPCA (Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Adults) should  
seek laws making it a felony to provide anyone under 10 years of 
age with a violin, but music -- and music education -- is nonetheless 
an important part of learning. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also one of the education areas that hasn't benefited a lot  
from the ubiquity of personal computers. True, there have been 
spates of software and MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) 
keyboards, as well as instrument-specific instruction software. But 
most music basics and theory are still delivered in school or at 
private lessons. 
</P>
<P>
	A Windows-Macintosh product called Music Ace 2 might change  
that. It's from Harmonic Vision, an Evanston, Ill., company. 
</P>
<P>
	Music Ace 2 uses delightful animation in a crisp,  
well-structured learning environment to walk anyone older than 
around eight years old through the world of rhythm, harmony, 
syncopation, standard notation, melody and time signatures -- the 
nuts and bolts of how those dots on lines get turned into music. 
The student's guide throughout is Maestro Max, an animated 
conductor. Appropriate behavior is rewarded by praise and audience 
applause. 
</P>
<P>
	What makes Music Ace 2 stand out is attention to detail.  
</P>
<P>
	When an audio clip is played to illustrate a concept, for  
example, the composer and title appear and the notes are displayed 
as animated heads that sing the appropriate tone at the appropriate 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Singing Notes are cute. But they are also so  
attention-grabbing that students learn, without being told 
directly, to associate notes with tones on both the treble and bass 
clefs of the musical staff (the horizontal lines on which notes are 
positioned.) 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the software contains more than 2,000 music examples  
from 75 composers, used to deliver 24 lessons. The lessons are 
teamed with games that reinforce the content. 
</P>
<P>
	A Music Doodle Pad allows students to drag-and-drop notes to a  
music staff and play and save the resulting compositions, and while 
the software tracks a student's progress. 
</P>
<P>
	Music Ace 2 would be an ideal supplement to one-on-one music  
instruction. Harmonic Vision also offers a classroom or teaching 
studio version. An adult thinking of taking up music as a hobby 
would be well served, as would someone trying to recall music 
basics after a 30-year rest. 
</P>
<P>
	System requirements as listed on the Harmonic Vision Web site  
(http://www.harmonicvision.com): 
</P>
<P>
	--Windows 3.1: 486-66 megahertz CPU or better -- 8 megabytes of  
RAM; 640x480 256-color Super VGA; 24 megabytes hard disk space; 
CD-ROM drive; MPC compatible sound card or General MIDI required; 
no MIDI keyboard required (optional). Additional requirements for 
Windows 95-98, 16 megabytes of RAM. 
</P>
<P>
	--Macintosh: Macintosh 68040 CPU at 33 megahertz or higher;  
System 7.5 or better; 12 megabytes of RAM; 640 x 480 256-color 
monitor; 24 megabytes free hard disk space; CD-ROM drive; no MIDI 
keyboard required (optional). Additional requirements for Mac OS8 
and higher: 24 megabytes of RAM. 
</P>
<P>
	The suggested retail price of Music Ace 2 is $49.95, toward the  
high end these days, but in this case worth it. Harmonic Vision 
says the software is available at retail, but they'll take your 
money directly at (800) 644-4994. A free demo of the original Music 
Ace software is available on the company's Web site.

<HEADLINE> Protesters Gather Outside Fagan Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Paul Keller spent his Father's Day in a  
futile attempt to persuade two women he's never met to reconcile 
with their mother. 
</P>
<P>
	The West Palm Beach man, his wife and daughter were among some  
two dozen people who gathered Sunday in a protest outside the home 
of confessed kidnapper Stephen Fagan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're spending (Father's Day) together as a family and on  
something that's important to us,'' Keller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearby, Keller's daughter Laura held a sign that read in part:  
``Good dads don't lie to their children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fagan, 57, pleaded guilty in Massachusetts last month to  
kidnapping his daughters 20 years ago from their mother, Barbara 
Kurth. He received five years of probation and was ordered to 
perform 2,000 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
	Fagan, who reinvented himself as a Palm Beach socialite named  
Dr. William Martin, could have faced 20 years in prison. He told 
his girls their mother was dead. 
</P>
<P>
	His daughters, 25-year-old Rachael Martin and 22-year-old Lisa  
Martin, have stood firmly behind their father and have not made any 
effort to contact Ms. Kurth. 
</P>
<P>
	Keller was among several protesters who had personal stories  
similar to the Fagan saga. Abducted by his father at age 2, Keller, 
39, said he never was able to truly know his mother, who died 19 
years ago. He's been estranged from his father for seven years, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking for a positive thing, which is to get the girls  
together with Barbara,'' Keller said. ``This is Father's Day. What 
do you think her Mother's Day was like?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fagan and his family appeared to be away for the weekend. The  
oceanfront windows of the two-story Mediterranean house, offered 
for sale last week for $3.5 million, were shuttered as if expecting 
a hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
	Many drivers honked their horns in support as they drove past on  
Sunday, but the protest drew the objections of a cyclist who said 
she was a former dance instructor for Fagan's daughters. She 
declined to give her name. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know Fagan, and only God can judge this. Go home,'' she told  
the protesters.

<HEADLINE> Man Sentenced for Biting Wife's Lip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A man was sentenced to five years probation Monday  
for biting off his wife's lower lip during an argument over a party 
he wanted to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	Cator Lewis-Charles, 36, of Boston, pleaded guilty in Superior  
Court to mayhem. He must complete an anger management course and a 
batterer's program. 
</P>
<P>
	The argument on Jan. 2, 1998, at the couple's home escalated  
into pushing and shoving. Lewis-Charles grabbed his wife and bit 
her lower lip, tearing it from her face, said prosecutors, who 
didn't disclose the wife's name. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Will Camby Start For Knicks? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Marcus Camby's smile and words may have given  
away Jeff Van Gundy's big secret. 
</P>
<P>
	With the way Camby was talking before the game, it looked like  
the New York Knicks were ready to start him over Chris Dudley in 
Game 3 of the NBA Finals against the San Antonio Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the shoot-around this morning, Jeff came up to me and said,  
`I might start you,' '' Camby said in the locker room before the 
game Monday night. ``I said, `Fine. Whatever it takes to get the 
win.' 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to go. I can't wait. I know it's going to be crazy out  
there. I just want to get started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Camby provided a huge spark as a reserve in the Knicks' victory  
over Indiana in the Eastern Conference Finals, but has struggled 
with foul trouble as New York fell behind San Antonio 2-0 in the 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``To start the game, I can bring my energy and enthusiasm and  
hopefully get us going and get the crowd going,'' Camby said. 
``Then I can go out and get a blow and come out in the second 
quarter and do the same thing in the second half.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though Van Gundy refused to officially announce the change, he  
nonetheless laid out the compelling reasons for it. 
</P>
<P>
	``His energy to us is critical, and I think playing him one long  
stretch at a time has left him more fatigued,'' Van Gundy said. 
``If I decide to start him, it's to try to finish the halves better 
and fresher.''

<HEADLINE>  Hoops Recruitment Bid 21 Yrs. Late </HEADLINE>

<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ga. (AP) -- Mark Upshaw probably would have signed with  
Rhode Island anyway. Still, the former Columbus High School 
basketball standout is pleased to know Stanford coaches were 
interested -- even if their recruitment letter arrived 21 years 
late. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter, signed by then-Cardinal coach Dick DiBiaso, was  
dated May 5, 1978, but didn't arrive at Columbus High until this 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	DiBiaso, who has been out of coaching for 17 years, doesn't  
remember sending it. But he said Stanford did recruit nationally 
because its tough academic requirements made it difficult to find 
enough players in California. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-paragraph letter, mostly a sales pitch for Stanford,  
included a questionnaire and stamped return envelope. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I need to send that in and they'll give me a  
scholarship,'' laughed Upshaw, now a 38-year-old father of two who 
runs his own business in the Atlanta area. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter's envelope has a Stanford, Calif., postmark dated May  
5, 1978, overlaid with one from San Francisco, also dated May 1978. 
A third postmark, from Columbus, is dated April 26, 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	David McQuinn, consumer affairs clerk for the U.S. Postal  
Service in Columbus, said he has no idea where the letter was all 
those years. But because of its age, he said it most likely was 
stuck in a cloth pouch used to store mail. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just guessing, it appears it stayed in San Francisco,'' he  
said. ``Probably, no human ever looked at that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter was addressed to Upshaw in care of Larry Oswalt, then  
the Columbus basketball coach, who was killed in a car accident 
several years ago. An office worker at the school gave it to Murphy 
Jenkins, a coach who has stayed in touch with Upshaw. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just stunned when I saw the postmark,'' said Jenkins.  
``I thought somebody was playing a joke. Then I realized, no, this 
is real. I decided I would open the letter and see what it said.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jenkins contacted Upshaw's wife, Debra, who relayed the message  
to her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	``She said something about a letter from a college,'' Upshaw  
said. ``I said, 'A letter from a college? I know I don't owe any 
tuition or anything.' I just found it kind of funny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Upshaw, who now lives in Conyers and owns Global Diagnostic  
Services Inc., originally signed with Georgia but changed his mind 
and went to Rhode Island, where his cousin, Claude English, was an 
assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
	He made the All-Atlantic 10 Conference team in 1981-82 after  
averaging 16.9 points per game as a junior. A knee injury kept him 
out the next season, but he played again in 1983-84, averaging 11.7 
points per game. 
</P>
<P>
	Would he have considered Stanford if the letter had arrived on  
time? 
</P>
<P>
	``You never know,'' he said. ``Probably not. I think going to  
Rhode Island was the right decision for me.''

<HEADLINE> Some Sprint Customers Go Digital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Residential customers in three cities  
will get a first shot at Sprint Corp.'s new digital-age phone 
service, which will allow them to talk on the phone, send a fax and 
check e-mail -- all at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint's new ION -- Integrated On-Demand Network -- promises  
delivery of local and long-distance phone service and high-speed 
Internet access all through a single connection to home. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint estimates consumers now are paying a total of $150 to  
$200 a month for such services and have to deal with three or four 
companies. It proposes a flat monthly rate, likely between $100 to 
$150, plus installation and equipment costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's third-largest long-distance company announced  
Monday it has chosen Kansas City, Mo., Denver and Seattle to launch 
the service this fall. Service in other large cities, including 
Miami, Los Angeles, and Boston, is planned for the first half of 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Monday, U S West Inc. announced a three-city technical  
trial of its new service. U S West will integrate customers' 
telephone and Internet service with existing TV programming -- all 
on a customer's home television screen. 
</P>
<P>
	The developments bring the long-awaited development of one-stop  
shopping for communications services a step closer to widespread 
availability. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's leading edge. Nobody else has done it, although AT&AMP;T will  
be in a position to do it as they roll out their cable service,'' 
said communications analyst Bert Heath of Z.D. Market Intelligence 
in La Jolla, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint has been testing the service for the past two years at  
employees' homes in suburban Gardner, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	Trials have also been conducted since January at large  
corporations in the Kansas City metropolitan area, including the 
Hallmark greeting cards business and Yellow Freight trucking. 
</P>
<P>
	The basic package includes four multiple, simultaneous voice  
lines, high-speed Internet access and virtually unlimited local and 
long-distance calls. The company said thousands of minutes of 
calling time would be covered by the monthly rate. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can have two faxes and two people talking at the same time  
while you download a big chunk of data from the Internet,'' said 
Joan Jarrett, director of emerging markets for Sprint consumer 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	The service is designed for people with home offices and for  
families and singles who enjoy rather than fear technology. Sprint 
estimates their ranks at 40 percent of U.S. households. 
</P>
<P>
	Every line has advanced features such as Caller ID and call  
forwarding. With a click of a computer key, consumers can control 
or change features on demand, such as adding a separate line for a 
teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
	While the concept is attractive, the issue for Sprint is whether  
it can make money, said Heath. That's because of the cost of the 
final connection to a home, known in the industry as the ``final 
mile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They'll have to lease lines from competitors to attach to the  
customer,'' Heath said. ``They're not going to rewire the 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett said Sprint has two plans for connecting to customers'  
homes. 
</P>
<P>
	One method will involve leasing copper phone lines from local  
phone companies and enhancing them. 
</P>
<P>
	The second way is by harnessing the high-speed broadband  
services of several wireless cable television companies, which 
Sprint has spent $1 billion acquiring in recent months. A home 
would receive the signals with a small satellite dish. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint's acquired broadband lines cover 30 million households in  
65 cities, or a quarter of the homes in the country, Jarrett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Heath said AT&AMP;T will upgrade its vast cable network to offer an  
equivalent type of service. ``They're probably working on it as we 
speak,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mel Marten, a telecommunications analyst with Edward Jones in  
St. Louis, said Sprint would offer the service on a neighborhood by 
neighborhood basis and will be constrained by how quickly each 
phone company works with it. 
</P>
<P>
	While the functions and scope of the ION service are pretty  
revolutionary, the idea of offering bundle packages is not, Marten 
said. Most phone companies are working to offer the basics of local 
and long-distance service coupled with high-speed Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he expects the Baby Bells to roll out souped-up copper  
line service in limited markets this year. The so-called DSL or 
digital subscriber lines permit high-speed Internet access while 
you talk on the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint stock rose 2.7 percent, climbing $1.43 3/4 to $54 a share on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where AT&AMP;T gained 87 1/2 cents to $56.50 
and U S West was up 31 1/4 cents to $58.31 1/4.

<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Sprint Corp.'s new digital-age phone  
service sets the stage for a home communications utility that will 
one day encompass everything from phone and Internet service to 
home security monitoring, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Wimbledon Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Jelena Dokic of Australia plays  
Martina Hingis on Tuesday in her opening match at Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	That's one problem. For the WTA Tour, there's another problem:  
her father. 
</P>
<P>
	Damir Dokic was ejected two weeks ago from a tournament in  
Birmingham, England, for shouting abuse at officials during his 
16-year-old daughter's match. 
</P>
<P>
	He ranted and raved outside the club, threw himself on the  
ground in front of traffic and jumped on the hood of a car. He was 
arrested and police said they released after he sobered up. 
</P>
<P>
	The WTA Tour put Damir Dokic on notice, threatening to ban him  
indefinitely if he acts up again in his daughter's next tournament, 
which is Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	Jelena Dokic reached Wimbledon as a qualifier. She was the  
world's No. 1 ranked junior before turning professional in January. 
She beat Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario earlier in the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Jelena has come to her father's defense.  
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely think the English are a bit fussy,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FLU BUG:* Martina Navratilova can't figure out Serena Williams'  
early withdrawal from Wimbledon because of the flu. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't withdraw on a Thursday when you may not have to play  
until Tuesday or Wednesday of the next week,'' said Navratilova, a 
nine-time Wimbledon champ and commentator for HBO. ``Either Serena 
had another injury or didn't want to play against her sister. ... I 
just wish they would tell the truth because flu is not the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Venus said her sister was indeed ill.  
</P>
<P>
	``She wanted to play,'' Venus said. ``She's sick. I guess it's  
the flu. ... Serena always wants to compete, so she's not happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ON THE BALL:* The International Tennis Federation will  
experiment with a slightly larger ball at some minor tournaments 
next year in an attempt to slow the grass-court game. Britain's 
big-serving Greg Rusedski wants none of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``They should leave the game alone,'' he said. ``Somebody is  
always trying to come up with something to change the natural 
development of players and it shouldn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is there are only three or four top grass-court  
tournaments every year and that is when the big servers come into 
their own,'' he added. ``On clay and carpet there are plenty of 
rallies, but I think fans love to see the big servers in their best 
environment from time to time.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ANNA, WELCOME BACK:* Anna Kournikova, the 18-year-old Russian  
with the model looks, was welcomed back to Wimbledon by cheers, 
whistles and hundreds of photographers prying courtside with extra 
long lenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Kournikova missed last year's Wimbledon with an injured thumb.  
</P>
<P>
	She won her first-round match Monday over Barbara Schwartz 7-6  
(7-2), 4-6, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FEWER YANKS:* Thirty-seven countries had players entered on the  
men's side and 38 for the women when play opened Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	There are 12 American men in singles, the most of any country  
followed by Britain and Australia with 11 and Germany with 10. 
However, U.S. dominance in men's tennis is on the wane. Just 15 
years ago, 55 American men competed in singles. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States also leads on the women's side with 21 players  
in singles followed by France with 11 and Britain the Czech 
Republic with eight. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SPEED POSTED:* Tradition-steeped Wimbledon has decided to let  
fans at Centre Court and Court 1 see the speed of the serves. The 
radar gun has been used for years on both courts with the 
information available only to reporters. But now the fans can see 
it, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``We always want people to enjoy their visit to the  
championships and the introduction of speed of service ... should 
help enhance that enjoyment,'' said Chris Gorringe, chief executive 
of the All England club. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Draper must have been unhappy with idea. Warming up with  
defending champion Pete Sampras, Draper drove a practice serve into 
the box displaying the speed, leaving a huge hole in the side. 
Sampras won the match 6-3, 6-4, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *GOLMARD OUT:* France's Jerome Golmard has pulled out of  
Wimbledon with a knee injury. Ranked No. 23, he was to face Spain's 
Francisco Clavet on Tuesday. Golmard was replaced by Germany's 
Michael Kohlman.

<HEADLINE> Leniency Deals Policy Left Intact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to resurrect a  
ruling that shocked federal prosecutors last year by telling them 
it was unlawful to offer leniency in exchange for testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices, without comment, left intact a federal appeals  
court ruling that in January removed any cloud of constitutional 
doubt from such leniency deals. 
</P>
<P>
	Controversy arose immediately after a three-judge panel of the  
Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a Kansas 
case last summer that plea-bargained testimony violates a federal 
law making it a crime to give or offer anything of value in 
exchange for a trial witness' testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-judge panel's unanimous ruling had overturned the  
Kansas cocaine-trafficking conviction of Sonya Singleton. The panel 
said the chief prosecution witness illegally received leniency in 
return for his testimony against others involved in a Wichita drug 
ring. 
</P>
<P>
	The full 10th Circuit court, however, overturned the panel's  
decision last January. 
</P>
<P>
	``In light of the longstanding practice of leniency for  
testimony, we must presume that if Congress had intended that ... 
(the law) overturn this ingrained aspect of American legal culture, 
it would have done so in clear, unmistakable and unarguable 
language,'' the full appeals court said in its 9-3 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The January decision reinstated Ms. Singleton's conviction,  
spurring the appeal that was acted on today. 
</P>
<P>
	In it, her lawyer argued that the three-judge panel merely had  
read the federal law as Congress wrote it. The law states: 
``Whoever directly or indirectly gives, offers or promises anything 
of value to any person for or because of the testimony under oath 
or affirmation given or to be given by such person as a witness 
upon a trial ... before any court ... shall be fined ... or 
imprisoned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The word ``whoever'' should include government prosecutors, Ms.  
Singleton's appeal said, adding, ``The lenient treatment of an 
accused is clearly a valuable thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal said the full 10th Circuit court's ruling, if allowed  
to stand, ``will eat away at the integrity of the judicial system. 
... The government's practice of buying testimony must be 
stopped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyers urged the nation's highest court to  
reject the appeal. ``This claim is contrary to well-settled law and 
does not warrant this court's review,'' they said. ``Federal courts 
of appeals that have considered that claim in the wake of the 
short-lived panel decision in this case have squarely rejected 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Singleton vs. U.S., 98-8758.

<HEADLINE> Phil Mickelson's Wife Gives Birth  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- One day after Phil Mickelson finished  
second in the U.S. Open, he got the prize he was after all along. 
</P>
<P>
	Amy Mickelson gave birth to a healthy daughter Monday at 9:11  
p.m. EDT. Amanda Brynn weighed in at 7 pounds, 4 ounces and was 20 1/2 
inches long. The mother and daughter were doing fine, according to 
Mickelson spokesman Mike Biggs. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson, who already has won 13 times on the PGA Tour but has  
never won a major championship, wasn't even sure he was going to 
play in the U.S. Open until last Tuesday, when doctors estimated 
that his wife would carry their first child for at least another 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he carried a beeper in his bag and vowed he would leave  
the U.S. Open if his wife went into labor -- even in the final round 
or a playoff with a chance to win. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson was leading by one stroke with three holes to play  
Sunday at Pinehurst No. 2 until Payne Stewart rallied to win the 
U.S. Open by making a 15-foot par putt on the 72nd hole. Otherwise, 
he and Mickelson would have had an 18-hole playoff Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Biggs said Mickelson's wife went into labor about 3 p.m. EDT --  
or about the time Stewart and Mickelson would have been making the 
turn.

<HEADLINE> Gore Pushes Family Values in Tenn. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore returned home to  
Tennessee on Monday for an annual conference on family issues to 
call for strict gun laws and repeat the values theme he used to 
launch his presidential campaign last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``First, families need help getting guns off our streets, out of  
our schools and away from children and criminals,'' he told 
educators, law enforcement officials and community leaders at the 
eighth annual Family Re-Union conference at Vanderbilt University. 
``And I say to every family in America: `Let us create a family 
lobby as powerful as the gun lobby.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore announced his candidacy for the Democratic presidential  
nomination in his hometown of Carthage last Wednesday and talked 
about a ``deficit in family life.'' He outlined an agenda that 
includes curbing access to guns, improving community planning, 
providing after-school care for children of working parents and 
cracking down on an entertainment industry that ``glorifies 
aggression and indecency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, he spoke at the conference, which ends today, and  
then participated in a discussion on the economy and 
family-friendly workplaces. He touted a recent study that found 
nearly 1.5 million men acknowledged paternity in 1998, an increase 
of 12 percent from 1997 and three times the 1993 figure. 
</P>
<P>
	``A man acknowledging paternity does not make a father but it is  
a start,'' he said. ``It's the first step toward committing to a 
child the emotional and financial support a father must give to 
merit the name.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He took credit for helping gain passage for the 1993 Family and  
Medical Leave Act that guarantees up to 12 weeks' unpaid leave for 
parents after a baby is born. And he talked about his wife's 
efforts to give parents more information about record lyrics and 
the content of television programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore announced $20 million in self-help housing to assist 2,000  
families nationwide in building homes and a new resource guide for 
citizens who want to build more livable communities. 
</P>
<P>
	He also announced a ``Safe Cities Network'' Internet site to  
link local leaders, community organizations, law enforcement and 
faith-based organizations to reduce gun violence, share information 
about programs that work and provide technical know-how. 
</P>
<P>
	Pamela Johnson, deputy director of the National Partnership for  
Reinventing Government, a group of federal employees working to 
streamline government, said: ``There isn't any problem to which we 
don't have a solution. It's just a matter of getting the solutions 
and the problems in the same place.''

<HEADLINE> Hawkins Is Honored as NBA Sportsman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Before receiving the NBA's sportsmanship award  
on Monday, Hersey Hawkins had a confession for commissioner David 
Stern. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a couple of times in the year where I actually  
tried to get technicals, but they wouldn't give it to me,'' said 
Hawkins, the Seattle SuperSonics guard. ``The refs would just walk 
away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hawkins ended up walking away with the league's fourth  
sportsmanship award, following Joe Dumars, Terrell Brandon and 
Avery Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can still play this game and be supportive of your  
teammates and still accomplish your goals and still put yourself in 
a position where you are considered one of the best players in the 
league,'' Hawkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	He received 70 of 118 votes by a panel of 31 media members. Eric  
Snow of Philadelphia was second with 23 votes, Kevin Garnett of 
Minnesota was third with 18 votes and rookie Vince Carter of 
Toronto received seven votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern praised Hawkins as ``somebody who has conducted himself  
both on and off the court in an exemplary fashion. We are proud to 
have him in the National Basketball Association.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the NBA fined Larry Johnson and the Knicks in the  
wake of the forward's profane tirade directed at a league official 
and reporters who were trying to interview him during a mandatory 
media session. Though Hawkins didn't address Johnson's behavior 
directly, he had a lot to say about the state of sportsmanship in 
the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since I came into the league, oh yeah, definitely it has  
gotten worse,'' Hawkins said. ``It always gets worse when you're 
making a lot more money. That's been the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no idea why it has changed. When you're paying young  
guys all the money that they're making, why do they think they have 
to listen to anybody else or have to be respectful to anybody 
else?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hawkins also addressed the winds of change blowing through  
Seattle, which failed to make the playoffs this season for the 
first time in nine years. Hawkins said he met with Sonics 
executives recently and said he will not opt out of the remaining 
two years on his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	But he is already preparing for the possibility that the deal  
makes him a tradable commodity for a team seeking to make changes. 
Hawkins, 32, is coming off the lowest 3-point shooting percentage 
in his career (31 percent), and his scoring average has dropped 
every season since 1995-96. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm quite sure that the Sonics are going to make some  
changes,'' Hawkins said. ``I don't know if they're going to look at 
trying to package me and try to send me somewhere. I'm sure that's 
something they're going to think about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One reported deal has Hawkins and the Sonics' No. 13 pick going  
to Vancouver for the No. 2 pick in the upcoming draft. It is not a 
deal that intrigues Hawkins. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he does not have any type of no-trade clause in his  
contract, Hawkins said, ``I cannot show up. But I guess they'd have 
to take this award away from me. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would hope that if they did trade me somewhere that they  
would trade me somewhere where I'd have an opportunity to possibly 
win a championship or at least get in the playoffs,'' Hawkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't want them to trade me somewhere where I was in a  
rebuilding process where I'm going to be looking at losing 50-60 
games a year. I don't want that. I would hope that they have enough 
respect for me.''

<HEADLINE> Pianist Brubeck Plays Carnegie Hall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jazz pianist Dave Brubeck, 78, last heard at the  
JVC Jazz Festival five years ago, played a concert of old and new 
music at Carnegie Hall which thoroughly delighted the audience. 
</P>
<P>
	With Brubeck as special guests were James Moody, known for his  
bebop saxophone and his writing and singing of funny, partly 
scatted lyrics to jazz tunes, and his son, trombonist Chris 
Brubeck, who appeared because the concert was on Father's Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of Sunday night's selections started with Brubeck playing  
delicate solo piano then opened up as Bobby Militello, playing 
saxophone and flute, bassist Alec Dankworth and drummer Randy Jones 
joined in. 
</P>
<P>
	Brubeck began with ``Someday My Prince Will Come,'' then played  
some pieces he wrote for the quartet's recent 40th anniversary tour 
of Britain. A live recording will come out June 29. Flashing his 
wide smile, the pianist promised ``tunes that you'll know'' for the 
second half of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	One new piece was ``Marian McPartland,'' which Brubeck composed  
on his way to a benefit concert he did for her ``Piano Jazz'' radio 
show. The rhythm, which becomes quite emphatic, is based on the 
syllables of her name. 
</P>
<P>
	He also played two versions of a piece influenced by Chopin that  
he wrote in Poland during a 12-concert tour there in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
	The second half included a Duke Ellington medley, Moody having  
fun with ``Pennies From Heaven,'' and ``I Got Rhythm'' as an 
encore. 
</P>
<P>
	The JVC Jazz Festival began the previous Monday with  
``Revisiting the Kingdom of Swing'' -- clarinetist Ken Peplowski 
leading a band in the Benny Goodman arrangements, with pianist Dick 
Hyman joining in for ``Tiger Rag.'' Guitar lovers got an enormous 
treat the next night when, at a tribute to Johnny Smith, 15 
guitarists played. 
</P>
<P>
	Pianist Herbie Hancock and trumpeter Wayne Shorter played mainly  
dreamy, contemplative, evocative jazz at Friday night's concert at 
Carnegie Hall. Trumpeter Roy Hargrove's quintet jolted the hall to 
attention with its pulse and drive, using tempo changes and a wide 
range of musical dynamics.

<HEADLINE> Doctors' Bargaining Bill Considered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Doctors across the nation are seeking the right to  
join together in negotiating fees with HMOs, after 
precedent-setting legislation was approved in Texas over the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Gov. George W. Bush signed a bill allowing Texas  
doctors to become the first in the nation to bargain collectively 
with health plans. A congressional committee will take up a similar 
proposal Tuesday, and doctors are pushing the issue in several 
state legislatures. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas law received support from the American Medical  
Association and its Texas affiliate, which cast doctors as 
advocates for patients in a struggle with ruthless insurers and 
health-maintenance organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost a David-and-Goliath situation,'' Dr. Randolph D.  
Smoak, a South Carolina surgeon and the AMA's president-elect, said 
in an interview from the organization's convention in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we attempt to get a test done or get a hospitalization,  
we have a great deal of restrictions placed on us by health 
carriers and HMOs,'' Smoak said. ``We certainly believe Texas has 
taken a great step forward. Many other states will be looking at 
this closely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new Texas law, which takes effect Sept. 1, doctors who  
band together to negotiate with health plans would be exempt from 
federal antitrust laws. The health plans wouldn't be required to 
recognize the doctors' bargaining units, but the Texas AMA said it 
would draw public attention to reluctant HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
	Health insurers, who had expected defeat in Texas, remain  
adamantly opposed to letting independent doctors organize. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be very substantial costs to this,'' said Don  
Young, chief operating officer of the Health Insurance Association 
of America, which represents large health insurers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Say all of the people who do cataract surgery say, 'We want to  
be paid 20 percent more than last year.' What's the plan going to 
do? The doctors are a monopoly,'' Young said. 
</P>
<P>
	The next battleground over doctors' bargaining rights will be  
the U.S. House of Representatives. The House Judiciary Committee is 
scheduled to hold a hearing on a bill by Rep. Tom Campbell, 
R-Calif., to allow health care professionals to temporarily band 
together to negotiate with HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
	One-fourth of the House members have endorsed the bill,  
including a majority on the Judiciary Committee, but health 
insurers and the Clinton administration's Justice Department and 
Federal Trade Commission oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA also is pushing legislatures in Pennsylvania, New  
Jersey, Florida and elsewhere to consider bills similar to the new 
Texas law. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill had been opposed by some lawmakers who said it could  
lead to an increase in medical costs by limiting the ability of 
health insurers to control costs.

<HEADLINE> Hungarians Promoting Aug. Eclipse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SIOFOK, Hungary (AP) -- ``Darkness at noon'' fever is catching  
hold in Hungary, a prime viewing area for the last total solar 
eclipse of the millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	Hungarians are pushing hard to promote the Aug. 11 darkening,  
with local governments and private entrepreneurs alike ready to 
cash in with T-shirts, commemorative stamps and specially made 
eclipse glasses. 
</P>
<P>
	While the eclipse will be visible in several other countries in  
Europe and Asia, Hungarians are touting their country as the place 
to be -- particularly since popular Lake Balaton is in the path of 
the full eclipse. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are hoping to get this day declared a holiday,'' says  
Karoly Herenyi, a Balaton-area member of parliament. ``Nobody will 
be doing much work anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NASA, the U.S. space agency, says the ``instant of greatest  
eclipse'' will occur in the rolling hills of south-central Romania, 
near Rimnicu-Vilcea. Bucharest, Romania's capital, is the only 
capital city in Europe affording a view of the full eclipse. 
</P>
<P>
	But while tens of thousands of eclipse seekers are expected in  
Romania, Hungary is gearing up for a much bigger influx of 
visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	A solar eclipse, not seen in Hungary in 157 years, occurs when  
the moon crosses between the Earth and sun, casting a shadow on 
Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	The shadow of the Aug. 11 eclipse will pass across the center of  
Hungary, from northwest to southeast, in a 70-mile-wide swath. 
</P>
<P>
	The shadow will enter Hungary at 12:47 p.m. local time, and it  
will take the moon about 80 minutes to fully block out the sun. 
After barely two minutes of total darkness, full sunlight will 
return to normal in another 80 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Cloudy day? No problem. Hungarian state television has arranged  
with the air force to have a camera mounted on a MiG-29 fighter jet 
that will follow the eclipse from the Austrian to the Romanian 
borders. The supersonic jet is needed because the shadow moves at 
1,522 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Nowhere are hopes higher for eclipse tourism than in Siofok, a  
town of 23,000 people on the southern shore of Lake Balaton, which 
is the biggest lake in central Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The sky over Siofok will be completely dark for two minutes, 22  
seconds -- a second less than in Romania -- and stars normally seen 
only in the winter will become visible. 
</P>
<P>
	It could be a lucrative 142 seconds.  
</P>
<P>
	All rooms in the area are already booked, and municipal  
officials optimistically predict 200,000 visitors, many of whom 
they say will be out in rental boats. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourists have been wooed with packages that offer zodiac suppers  
-- each dish named after an astrological sign -- wine tastings and 
music festivals, where the U2 hit ``Staring at the Sun'' may be a 
tad overplayed. 
</P>
<P>
	The post office has issued 200,000 commemorative stamps showing  
a map of the country and the path of the eclipse. 
</P>
<P>
	Szombathely, a medieval town on the Austrian border, will set up  
a giant model of the solar system on the main square and hold an 
international astronomy conference. A Japanese orchestra will give 
a concert of music by Verdi and Saint-Saens. 
</P>
<P>
	Hungary's last eclipse, in 1842, has remained memorable for  
Hungarians because the country's most beloved poet, Sandor Petoefi, 
nearly went blind from looking directly at the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sun Hunters company is ready to help with that risk. It is  
selling U.S.-made glasses with special filtered lenses designed for 
safely viewing eclipses. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun Hunters also has put out a book, the inevitable T-shirts and  
caps and a double CD made jointly with the Hungarian Astronomers' 
Association that contains instrumental music and scientific 
information in Hungarian, English and German. 
</P>
<P>
	It won't be all fun and games in the dark.  
</P>
<P>
	Gabor Goesi, director of a wildlife preserve near Szeged in  
southern Hungary, and his staff will be studying the reaction of 
wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
	``Such a full solar eclipse is a rare event, something animals  
have not been conditioned to prepare for in the course of their 
evolution,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting in the Atlantic, the eclipse's path will cross Belgium,  
southern Germany, Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, northern Yugoslavia, 
Romania, Turkey and on to Pakistan and India. 
</P>
<P>
	The next full solar eclipse in Hungary won't be until Oct. 7,  
2135. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans won't have to wait that long -- they'll have a full  
solar eclipse on Aug. 21, 2017, and a partial one on May 20, 2012.

<HEADLINE> Judge Challenges Microsoft Witness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The judge in the Microsoft trial challenged  
the company's final witness Monday, suggesting he may consider 
Microsoft's intentions toward some of its industry rivals when he 
decides whether the software giant violated antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The unusually frank exchange between the witness and the judge  
called renewed attention to incendiary e-mails written by top 
Microsoft executives describing plans to topple competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	At times Monday, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson --  
expected to issue his verdict later this year -- became so involved 
questioning the witness that the trial looked like a debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Economist Richard Schmalensee, who will finish testifying later  
this week, contended that Microsoft's decision to give away its 
Internet software can't be considered ``predatory'' partly because 
there is no evidence that the company planned eventually to begin 
charging for the software. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges in its antitrust case that Microsoft gave  
its software away to undermine sales of a popular rival Web browser 
from Netscape Communications Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	But Schmalensee said that without any evidence showing  
Microsoft's pricing strategy was illegal, the judge shouldn't try 
to interpret the company's intentions. That, he said, would be 
``slippery, difficult and fraught with peril.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult to know what the intent is of a multiperson  
organization,'' Schmalensee said. ``Most economists would not 
attach high importance to intent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what courts do every day,'' Jackson said, interrupting.  
Without another way to know whether Microsoft set its software 
prices illegally low, ``I can see for the court's purposes why 
intent might be relevant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to dilute the impact of the acerbic e-mails by some  
Microsoft executives, Schmalensee testified that even at companies 
competing fairly, ``Somebody will write a document that says, 
'Let's kill them.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's any simpler for the court or for a jury,''  
the judge said. ``(But) juries are called to do this all the 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft lawyer John Warden said outside court that focusing on  
the rallying cries of employees at the height of the infamous 
``browser wars'' carries ``tremendous risks'' and violates 
principles surrounding antitrust verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the closest the company has come during the trial to  
openly criticizing the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is very, very difficult to distinguish between the intent  
to get all the business and the intent to drive all the rivals 
out,'' Warden said. ``The same words can mean both those things.''

<P>
	Earlier Monday, Schmalensee sought to convince the judge that  
federal intervention isn't needed to preserve competition in the 
industry's fight over Internet software. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way to see if a war is over is to see whether the sides  
are still firing, and both sides are still firing,'' said 
Schmalensee, citing Netscape's recent purchase for $10 billion by 
America Online Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmalensee maintained that the government, in more than five  
months in the courtroom, has failed to prove that Microsoft's 
behavior toward software rivals hurt consumers -- the guiding 
principle toward applying antitrust law. 
</P>
<P>
	The government was expected to begin questioning Schmalensee on  
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Court OKs County Fees for Judges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Alabama county can collect an occupational  
fee from two federal judges who work there, the Supreme Court ruled 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	By a 7-2 vote, the justices overturned a federal appeals court  
ruling that had deemed the fee unconstitutional when applied to the 
two judges. 
</P>
<P>
	Imposing such county fees against federal employees is rare, but  
today's decision could encourage other counties across the nation 
to emulate the revenue-raising fees imposed by Jefferson County, 
Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	``The record shows no discrimination,'' Justice Ruth Bader  
Ginsburg wrote for the court. ``between similarly situated federal 
and state employees. ... Should Alabama or Jefferson County 
authorities take to exempting state officials while leaving federal 
officials or a subcategory of them subject to the tax, that would 
indeed present a starkly different case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She added: ``There is no sound reason to deny Alabama counties  
the right to tax with an even hand the compensation of federal, 
state and local officeholders whose services are rendered within 
the county.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jefferson County Commission voted in 1987 to require all  
people who work in the county to pay an occupational license fee of 
0.5 percent of their before-tax income. The ordinance exempts 
people who already pay licensing fees to the state. Doctors, 
contractors, dentists, lawyers, magicians and fortunetellers are 
among the exempt occupations. 
</P>
<P>
	Judges, state and federal, are not exempt.  
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judges William M. Acker Jr. and U.W. Clemon  
refused to pay the fee. The two work primarily out of the Hugo L. 
Black Courthouse in Birmingham. Their $136,700 salaries could 
subject them to an annual fee of a little less than $700. 
</P>
<P>
	County officials sued the two judges as scofflaws in 1992,  
seeking to collect back fees. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit originally was filed in a state court, but the  
judges successfully had the case transferred to a federal court 
where a Georgia judge was specially appointed to preside. 
</P>
<P>
	He struck down the fee as applied to the two federal judges, and  
the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld his ruling by a 9-3 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court set aside those rulings last year and ordered  
the appeals court to reconsider federal court authority over the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson County officials and Clinton administration lawyers  
urged the justices to rule that the Tax Injunction Act precludes 
any federal court authority in the license fee case. The court 
rejected that argument. 
</P>
<P>
	On the constitutionality of the tax, only Justice Stephen G.  
Breyer and Sandra Day O'Connor voted to strike it down. In an 
opinion by Breyer, they said it violates a doctrine barring 
intergovernmental taxation. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Jefferson County vs. Acker, 98-10.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed; Dow Down 81.37 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today, with technology shares  
rallying for a fourth straight session and blue-chip shares giving 
back some of last week's gains. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 81.37 at 10,774.19 after surrendering an early 24-point gain. 
The Dow rose 365 points last week, gaining 14 points on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed today. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was down 1.75 at 1,341.09, but the technology-dominated 
Nasdaq composite index was up 37.59 at 2,601.03. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks have been hit hard in recent weeks amid fears  
the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to slow the economy 
and contain inflation. But with investors now expecting the Fed to 
implement only a small increase, the discounted prices in the 
technology group are looking more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	Among leading Nasdaq technology issues, Dell Computer was up 1  
47/64 at 38 7/16, Microsoft was up 1 53/64 at 86 53/64 and Intel 
was up 1 5/8 at 56 9/16. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM was up 3 at 123 3/4 to cushion the Dow, which was being weighed  
down by Alcoa, off 4 5/8 at 62 15/16, and Chevron, off 2 9/16 at 90 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a small margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled a sluggish 440.64 
million shares, while advancers held a narrow lead in Nasdaq 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 2.52 at 634.03, while the  
American Stock Exchange composite was down 4.95 at 763.62.

<HEADLINE> Qwest Lobbies U S West and Frontier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The leader of the telecommunications company  
Qwest sent letters to the heads of U S West Inc. and Frontier 
Corp., trying to convince them to abandon their merger deals with a 
rival and support his competing bids. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph P. Nacchio, chairman and chief executive of Qwest  
Communications International Inc., send the letters Thursday as 
part of his attempt to trump his takeover rival, Global Crossing 
Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are confident that your board will determine that our  
proposal is financially, structurally and strategically superior to 
Global Crossing's offer and in the best interests of your 
shareholders,'' Nacchio wrote in the letters, copies of which were 
released to the media. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Frontier said it would carry on with its agreement to  
merge with Global Crossing. U S West has yet to announce its 
intentions. 
</P>
<P>
	Naccio has ambitious plans to build a global fiber optic cable  
network to provide high-speed Internet access and other telecom 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	He wants the customer and sales base of U S West, a Denver-based  
regional phone company, and Frontier, a local and long-distance 
company based in Rochester, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest has offered to buy U S West and Frontier in a combined  
$44.1 billion offer. Global Crossing's deals to buy U S West and 
Frontier total $43.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	While U S West's board of directors has yet to be heard from,  
its union workers are showing some resistance to the Qwest bid. The 
head of the Communications Workers of America warned the governors 
of the 14 states served by U S West that the proposed takeover 
would drain jobs and investment from the region and further imperil 
already-declining service quality. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecommunications companies are under pressure to cut costs and  
reshape their operations to meet the Internet age. As telephones, 
computers, televisions and radios become one, companies like Qwest 
and Global Crossing are racing to provide the wires that will carry 
enormous amounts of video, audio and data traffic to homes and 
businesses around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	To that end, Qwest on Monday announced a joint-venture  
partnership with the accounting firm KPMG LLC. The venture, to be 
called Qwest Cyber.Solutions LLC, will help small- and medium-size 
businesses put their operations on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, U S West unveiled a plan Monday to test a new  
service that allows customers to surf the Internet, use e-mail and 
talk on a speaker phone while watching television -- all at the same 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West will test the new service, called WebVision, in Denver,  
Minneapolis and Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West's stock rose 31 1/4 cents to $58.31 1/4 on the New York Stock  
Exchange, where Frontier's shares dipped 50 cents to $57.81 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest's shares fell $1.43 3/4 to $36.50 on the Nasdaq Stock Market,  
where shares of Global Crossing dropped $2.62 1/2 to $47.12 1/2.

<HEADLINE> Philly Expects Convention Windfall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Next summer's Republican National Convention  
could turn Philadelphia into the City of Brotherly Lucre. 
</P>
<P>
	The elephant invasion will guarantee a large infusion of cash as  
convention delegates, guests, corporate executives and the media 
spend money on hotel rooms, restaurants, cab rides, parties and the 
like. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials conservatively estimate that the festivities will  
generate $125 million in direct economic activity. And they're 
figuring on another $200 million in indirect benefits -- for 
example, money spent at the supermarket by convention workers. 
</P>
<P>
	And those are only the tangible effects.  
</P>
<P>
	The convention, which will be held the week of July 29 to Aug.  
4, 2000, presents a prime opportunity for the city to market itself 
-- to show to an audience of millions that it is a nice place to 
visit or do business in. 
</P>
<P>
	In San Diego, the economic impact of the 1996 Republican  
convention was pegged at $162 million, but the promotional value, 
according to one official, was priceless. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we had to pay for the favorable mentions of San Diego, we  
couldn't even begin to dream about it,'' said Salvatore Giametta, a 
spokesman for the San Diego Convention and Visitors Bureau. 
``Certainly the costs would be in the hundreds of millions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia can expect similar treatment, as reporters from all  
over write about the Liberty Bell, Independence Hall, the art 
museum, the Franklin Institute and other landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
	But Irving J. Rein, a Northwestern University professor who  
specializes in the marketing of places, said the media spotlight 
can be a ``disaster'' if the city doesn't adequately prepare. 
</P>
<P>
	Roads -- especially the road from the airport -- should be  
pothole-free. Trains should run on time. Residents have to be nice 
to convention-goers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has to work well. If it doesn't, you've not only wasted  
your opportunity, you've ruined your image,'' said Rein, author of 
the book ``Marketing Places.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Cohen, co-chairman of Philadelphia 2000, the organizing  
committee, said efforts to teach residents to be courteous to 
visitors have been going on for years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have become pretty sophisticated,'' he said. ``We do all  
sorts of survey work, and one of the great strengths of the city is 
how friendly we are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some San Diego hotels were a bit nervous that the stampeding  
elephants would scare away tourists, said Giametta, the visitor's 
bureau spokesman. The convention was held in mid-August, the height 
of the city's tourist season. 
</P>
<P>
	But Giametta said that whatever dip there was in non-convention  
visitors was more than made up by delegates and corporate bigwigs 
who ``spend a lot more freely than the average vacationer would.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You have some business displaced, but you now have it replaced  
by a convention where folks are paying very nice room rates, 
certainly higher than what you have with folks on a leisure 
vacation,'' Giametta said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Chicago, host of the 1996 Democratic convention, one study  
pegged the direct economic impact at $123 million, with another 
$237 million in secondary benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, conducted jointly by the Federal Reserve Bank of  
Chicago and the University of Illinois, also said about 4,200 jobs 
were created, and those workers received about $133 million in 
salaries and wages. Philadelphia officials based their own 
projections on the findings. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Muldoon, president of the Philadelphia Convention and  
Visitors' Bureau, said the timing of the Philadelphia convention 
couldn't be better. 
</P>
<P>
	The facilities are nearly new, it's the start of a new  
millennium and there is already a perception that Philadelphia is a 
city on the way up, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the weather has to cooperate.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think the stars are lined up right, and if the sun stays out  
for 10 days and the humidity isn't too high, people will say, 'What 
a great place,' Muldoon said. ``If it rains for 10 days, we'll have 
to work a little bit harder.''

<HEADLINE> Stars Fans Cheer Departing Goalie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Some of the loudest cheers at the pep rally  
honoring the Stanley Cup champion Dallas Stars were for a guy who 
didn't play a minute in the postseason and who won't be on the team 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Call it a fond farewell to backup goaltender Roman Turek, who  
was traded Sunday to the St. Louis Blues for a third-round draft 
pick. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars had little choice but to deal Turek, who went 16-3-3  
in the regular season, because otherwise he would've been likely 
lost in the upcoming expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The salute began when team play-by-play announcer Ralph Strangis  
asked fans to, ``Say hello and unfortunately say goodbye to 
goaltender Roman Turek.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was the first player introduced because he wore jersey No. 1.  
</P>
<P>
	Team president Jim Lites and coach Ken Hitchcock led a standing  
ovation and the crowd of nearly 20,000 fans obliged. Turek had a 
big smile as he blew kisses to the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock again paid tribute to Turek later in the show,  
prompting a standing ovation from his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Roman Turek is going to go somewhere else to play,'' Hitchcock  
said, ``but he's going to be a Dallas Star for life as far as we're 
concerned.''

<HEADLINE> Man Guilty in Ohio Rape, Kidnap Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- Rejecting an insanity defense, a jury Monday  
convicted a man of abducting a woman, raping her repeatedly and 
holding her captive for a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Caes, 34, of Clarksville, Tenn., was found guilty of 22  
counts of rape, three counts of assault and one count each of 
kidnapping and unlawful possession of a dangerous ordnance. 
</P>
<P>
	Caes faces a possible life term. Sentencing was scheduled for  
July 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Prosecutor David Franceschelli argued that Caes was  
sane and responsible when he kidnapped and repeatedly raped and 
tortured the 25-year-old woman he held captive from July 17, 1997, 
to August 20, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys contended that Caes is a paranoid  
schizophrenic who doesn't know right from wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Dana Martino said his client believed that God  
told him to father the woman's children. Martino said Caes, who was 
twice removed from the courtroom for disrupting the trial, believes 
there is a ``cosmic intelligence agency'' that controls everybody 
and has embedded a microchip in his buttocks to monitor his 
movements.

<HEADLINE> Hamm Asserts Herself in World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Trotting around the Giants Stadium field, saluting the largest  
crowd to see a women's sporting event in this country, the U.S. 
soccer team was missing someone: Mia Hamm. 
</P>
<P>
	No big deal. Having Hamm in the lineup is much more crucial than  
having her around for celebrations like the one that followed a 3-0 
victory over Denmark in the Women's World Cup opener Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamm did wave to the record gathering of 78,972. She clapped her  
hands above her head in tribute. But she also headed quickly to the 
locker room after both her calves cramped late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The subsequent victory lap was one of the few things the  
Americans did well without their star striker, who scored once and 
set up another goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be games where my team needs someone to light a  
fire,'' Hamm said. ``Maybe it will be me, or Kristine (Lilly) or 
Julie (Foudy). That's what is great about this team. I wouldn't be 
the player I am without this team. They are the ones who make 
players like me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps. Lilly and Foudy did score, after all. But they didn't  
set the tone against the Danes. Hamm, the sport's career 
goal-scoring leader, did. 
</P>
<P>
	``Up until the first goal, we really weren't playing our game,''  
said Cindy Parlow, one of the main culprits in not converting her 
opportunities on Saturday. ``We were playing a lot of defense, and 
they were getting in (threatening position). And then we get one 
chance, and Mia puts it away. That's a veteran player for you. 
</P>
<P>
	``She settled everyone down. She scored the important goal. I  
think that did a lot for us. It relaxed us all. It was like, `OK, 
we can do this.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	What they want to do next is beat Nigeria in Chicago on Thursday  
night. That would clinch a spot in the quarterfinals -- and a place 
in the 2000 Olympics, as well. 
</P>
<P>
	First, though, they're entitled to look back at the opener,  
which they hope was a harbinger for the tournament and women's 
soccer in general. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a very, very proud moment for us and for our  
sport,'' Hamm said of playing before the largest crowd for a sports 
event at Giants Stadium ``We still have a long way to go to win the 
Cup, and it's not going to be easy, but what a great first day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Brandi Chastain, whose long pass to Hamm led to the first  
goal: 
</P>
<P>
	``It does something to you inside. Your heart beats a littler  
harder and you stand a little taller, and it lets you know the 
people out there really acknowledge what you do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What Hamm usually does is establish the tone of a game,  
something she did perfectly against Denmark. While most of her 
teammates appeared nervous early on, Hamm was dominant. On her 
second touch of the game, she accepted a long pass from Chastain 
with her right foot. Immediately, Hamm tapped the ball around 
defender Katrine Pedersen and onto her left foot for a blast into 
the top of the net. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a personality player is like what Mia was today,''  
coach Tony DiCicco said. ``She wanted the responsibility. She 
wanted the ball. She wanted the responsibility of feeding the 
players in the best area for a shot, or taking the shot herself. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the quality of player and person Mia is. As a coach,  
you can't measure how important it is for your star player to be 
such a leader and a character person.''

<HEADLINE> AMA Wrestles With Doctors Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Physicians vexed by managed care companies have  
gathered at the American Medical Association's annual meeting to 
debate the merits and risks of forming a labor union. 
</P>
<P>
	``American physicians are angry, frustrated and exhausted over  
the intrusions of third-party payors into the day-to-day practice 
of medicine,'' said Dr. William G. Gamel, a delegate from Austin, 
Texas, and director of that state's Medicaid program. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are looking to us, their representatives at the local,  
state, specialty and national levels, to help them find a way to 
practice their profession as they've been trained,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Gamel spoke Sunday, the opening day of the AMA's convention,  
where hundreds of doctors debated the merits and risks of forming a 
labor union. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey doctors testified that young physicians in their  
state often can't even begin practices because managed-care 
companies set unreasonable fee restrictions. Older doctors are 
retiring early or moving, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 494 delegates representing about 290,000 doctors -- about  
one-third of U.S. physicians -- will meet again today for debates on 
other issues and will convene Tuesday to begin formulating 
policies. The convention ends Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	At their winter meeting in December, the delegates asked AMA  
trustees to investigate collective bargaining, and the trustees 
responded with a 70-page report that served as a starting point for 
debate about what the AMA can do without violating antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``The House of Delegates resolution was `to level the playing  
field.' ... There is no vehicle that will do that totally,'' said 
AMA board president Dr. Randolph D. Smoak Jr., in an interview last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether it's a traditional labor union or what we call a union  
without striking, ... you have to have an employer-employee 
relationship under the National Labor Relations Act. Otherwise you 
are subject to huge antitrust problems,'' he said, adding that only 
one of every seven U.S. physicians is an employee under the federal 
law's definition. 
</P>
<P>
	Some doctors who spoke Sunday said the AMA must take an activist  
role. 
</P>
<P>
	``More testosterone is needed by the AMA,'' said Dr. Michael  
Connair, an orthopedic surgeon in New Haven, Conn. ``I am not 
asking that the AMA establish how a collective bargaining unit 
should be formed; it doesn't have the expertise or wisdom to do so. 
... But it does have the moral authority to establish the 
guidelines,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are now 25 states with private labor unions for  
physicians, and if the AMA does not involve itself now, with those 
that exist and those that will exist, ... then the AMA will lose 
its credibility,'' Connair said. 
</P>
<P>
	The delegates on Sunday elected Smoak, a surgeon from South  
Carolina, to be their new president-elect. He ran unopposed and 
will take over the largely speech-making position next summer, 
after the term of incoming president Dr. Thomas R. Reardon.

<HEADLINE> Women's World Cup TV Ratings Lag </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Women's World Cup may have set an attendance  
record, but it didn't draw well on television. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Open golf coverage on NBC and baseball's game of the week  
on Fox both had higher ratings Saturday than the United States' 
tournament-opening 3-0 win over Denmark on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Cup got a 2.2 overnight rating and a 6 share, while  
the U.S. Open grabbed a 5.3/15 -- up 6 percent from 1998 -- for its 
third-round coverage Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox baseball, with the New York Mets and St. Louis Cardinals in  
25 markets, had a 2.8/8. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the time being, the ratings this past weekend are very  
acceptable and encouraging,'' ABC spokesman Mark Mandel said. ``You 
have a major golf tournament with incredible drama and Tiger 
(Woods) and baseball is our national pastime. It's really unfair to 
compare the World Cup to those events.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The overnight rating represents 64 percent of the country. The  
national rating for the women's opening game will be released 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The women didn't fare nearly as well as the men did during the  
1998 World Cup despite the fact that this year's tournament is 
being played in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Typically, that usually results in a higher interest level and  
better time slots for television. Last year's men's tournament was 
played in France. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's opening men's match in 1998, a scoreless tie between the  
Netherlands and Belgium, had a 2.3 overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The opening-round game between the United States and Germany,  
televised by ABC on a Monday afternoon, had a 4.3 overnight. The 
Americans' second match, a a 2-1 loss to Iran opposite the U.S. 
Open's final round, got a 4.8 overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, when the men's World Cup was held in the United States,  
the first game between the Americans and Switzerland posted a 5.8 
overnight rating and the third game against Romania had a 7.8. 
</P>
<P>
	The rating is the percentage of TV households in the United  
States tuned to a program, and each point represents 994,000 homes. 
The share is the percentage tuned to a program among televisions in 
use on at the time.

<HEADLINE>  Frank Layden Quits As Starzz Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Frank Layden resigned as coach of the  
WNBA's Utah Starzz today because he is feeling old and wants to 
enjoy life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm at the stage in my life that ... when you buy a pair of  
socks you know they're going to last the rest of your life,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Layden, the 67-year-old president and former coach and general  
manager of the Utah Jazz, quit less than a year after taking the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 2-2 with the WNBA club this season and will be replaced  
by assistant Fred Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Layden will remain the Utah Jazz president and will do  
commentary on Jazz and Starzz broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was getting tired. Time is a precious commodity right now,''  
Layden said. ``I think this is all I can do. I've given it all I've 
got.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Layden had never coached women's basketball when he took over  
the team July 27, 1998, replacing Denise Taylor. He won only two of 
11 games last season. This year, the team was revamped and beat 
Sacramento in its last game on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' first game as head coach is Thursday when the Starzz  
again play the Monarchs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a dream for me. I didn't think it would come so soon,''  
said Williams, 42, who has been with the Starzz since the 1998 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	He compiled a 20-9 record as head coach of the women's team at  
Southern California between 1995 to 1997, advancing to the second 
round of the NCAA tournament in 1997. He was also an assistant at 
USC for 10 years, including the Trojans' 1984 NCAA championship 
squad. 
</P>
<P>
	The Starzz feature Natalie Williams, the former Most Valuable  
Player of the defunct ABL, who is averaging nearly 18 points and 12 
rebounds a game this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel great about Fred,'' Starzz general manager Fred Howells  
said. ``Fred has been with the organization long enough to 
understand the things that we stand for. His coaching credentials 
are impressive and I think this is a great transition for the 
franchise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Layden came to Utah as the general manager of the Jazz in 1979,  
a month after the franchise announced plans to relocate from New 
Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	He began coaching the team during the 1981-82 season and had a  
277-294 record in eight seasons. In his third season, Layden earned 
the NBA Coach of the Year award.
