DISHING SALINGER AND FENDING OFF CRITICISM, BUT THE POINT IS, UM
... 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOYCE WADLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Things have been kind of rough for Joyce Maynard in the month
since the world learned she was planning to sell (Tuesday afternoon
at Sotheby's in New York) the love letters J.D. Salinger sent her
when she was 18, and he a wannabe purist of 53.
</P>
<P>
   A story in the National Review called Ms. Maynard, now 45, an
``opportunistic onetime nymphet'' _ not something an author would
want to use as a pull quote on the book of life. Maureen Dowd, in
the pages of this newspaper, called her a ``leech'' woman.
</P>
<P>
   The truth, Ms. Maynard notes more than once _ wound tight, she
tends to say things more than once _ is that she has not devoted
her life to exploiting her relationship with the man who has come
to be called the famously reclusive author. She has written a
half-dozen books and only in her last did she discuss Salinger. She
has spent much of her life as a journalist, most recently in a
refugee camp in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway _ where were we? _ such was the wack to her psyche of the
press attacks that Ms. Maynard, who is notorious for writing about
everything in her life and maintains a Web site
(www.joycemaynard.com), felt she had to make an emergency visit to
her therapist.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a Buddhist,'' Ms. Maynard says, with the amused tone of
an easterner moved to Marin County. ``He said to me, `Where is the
lesson for you in all of this?' I think I know. I was a little
girl, then an older girl, then even a woman who desperately sought
approval. And I believed when I made the decision to write a book
about Salinger, I ceased being the person who needed approval, but
I wasn't. I wanted to be invited into the club instead of being
dismissed as a cheap kiss-and-tell writer. I know I'm not a cheap
kiss-and-tell writer, but I recognized that had I earned this
approval I wanted, I might not still be inviting people onto my Web
site _''
</P>
<P>
   Uh, Joyce, the lesson. You were talking about a lesson?
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson is that I'm a fellow struggler. An essential part
of my work is that things not get too comfortable for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Got two hours for a conversation with Joyce Maynard? That won't
be enough.
</P>
<P>
   A chat in a friend's apartment at the Essex House runs three and
a half hours, with a follow-up call the morning after. That doesn't
mean, however, speaking from the heart is without stress.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Ms. Maynard, who flew to New York with plans to attend the
auction, who designed her gray pantsuit and she'll tug at the label
to tell you, then fret: Migoschka. Hope this isn't going to suggest
that she is a rich person. She's a freelance writer, with a wildly
fluctuating income. This is her one $300 jacket.
</P>
<P>
   As for her life, here are just some of the excruciatingly
painful things Ms. Maynard reported in her memoir, ``At Home in the
World'' (Picador), published last fall:
</P>
<P>
   Her late father, a professor at the University of New Hampshire
in Durham, was an alcoholic. Her late mother was a magazine writer
who wrote frequently about her family.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother also took her into bed to ``cuddle'' as late as
junior high and commented on her daughter's body.
</P>
<P>
   How can one know anything about what the non-Buddhist therapists
call boundaries when one's mother does such a thing?
</P>
<P>
   Meditate on that.
</P>
<P>
   Salinger, anyway, comes into Ms. Maynard's life in the spring of
1972, when, as a freshman at Yale, she publishes a world-weary
article in The New York Times Magazine called ``A Teen-Ager Looks
Back at Life,'' and he writes to her.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, Ms. Maynard drops out of Yale to live an isolated
life with Salinger. He belittles her ambition, is suspicious of the
outside world. After nine months, he tells her to leave. Later, Ms.
Maynard says, she learns he has written to other young women whom
he will also ``discard.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Maynard, who is divorced, has said that she is selling
Salinger's letters, which Sotheby's estimates will bring in $60,000
to $80,000, for her children's college tuition.
</P>
<P>
   But this seems not really to be about money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, the money has a huge amount to do with it,'' Ms.
Maynard says. ``I have maybe $10 right now in my checking account.
I give people apple pie lessons, I charge people $25 to come to my
house and make apple pies. I sold a book to the movies for $300,000
four years ago, but last year I made nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   This still seems to be about rage and payback and coming in for
the auction to have a ringside seat at the hanging.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no _ I know you're wrong,'' Ms. Maynard says. ``I know the
day he dies will be a very sad one for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Why does Ms. Maynard feel she has to be so open?
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in an alcoholic family,'' she says. ``My parents
were the most dazzling, articulate people you could imagine. And
among all this love of words the one thing we could never mention
was my father's drinking. I had this idea that I had to keep this
perfect girl picture and never let anybody find out who I was. I
write my first book when I'm 19. Everybody criticizing me, I don't
want to join in, but I never liked that book. It was supposed to be
the voice of youth, but I never said what the young person was
really doing _ that I'd dropped out of college, was living with
J.D. Salinger, making myself throw up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People can call it narcissistic,'' Ms. Maynard says, ``but I
know absolutely my commitment to telling my story. It's also the
story of many women who don't feel free to tell their stories. I'm
the designated hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Later comes the message that she won't be attending the auction
after all.

GIRL ATHLETES HAVE SUPER ROLE MODEL

<P>
   SANTA CLARITA, Calif. _ Sure, 10-year-old Jessica Woodgrift has
a poster of the U.S. men's soccer team, but there's simply no room
on her bedroom wall _ or in her heart _ for anyone except her hero,
women's soccer superstar Mia Hamm. ``She's big ... all my soccer
team loves her,'' Jessica said Monday as she took a breather from
blocking goals during the Master's Soccer School camp at The
Master's College in Santa Clarita north of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the ``I want to be like Mike'' theme of advertising based
on basketball great Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of girls across the country would rather be like Hamm,
27, the superstar athlete on the U.S. women's team, who broke the
international all-time goal-scoring record this spring and who has
become the darling of the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup games
currently under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could meet (Hamm) I would tell her that she's probably
the best soccer player that ever set foot on this planet,'' said
Jessica, a Valencia resident who has played soccer since age 5.
``Then I would want her autograph and then I would be speechless.''
</P>
<P>
   On soccer fields all across the San Fernando Valley and
surrounding regions, girls raved about Hamm _ her kicking
techniques, her sportsmanship, her team spirit, her scoring the
first U.S. goal in the Women's World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Liliana Madrid of North Hollywood has played soccer for only two
years, but thanks to Hamm, she now dreams big.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to go the farthest I can go. I see myself on the USA
team like Mia,'' said Liliana, 13, one of six girls in the
52-member Aztecas Youth Soccer Group in Sun Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Liliana's room is plastered with five posters of Hamm, as well
as any newspaper clipping of Hamm she finds. When she channel-surfs
on television,Liliana always looks for Hamm, to pick up new
techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``She encourages me. Instead of quitting soccer, seeing her
helps me to support myself _ that I (italics) can (end italics) do
it. That I can be her one day,'' saidLiliana, who plays forward on
her team.
</P>
<P>
   The Women's World Cup, which started Saturday and will end July
10, has catapulted Hamm onto a world stage, but she's been catching
the attention of soccer fans for some time now.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm's string of achievements includes four NCAA championships
at the University of North Carolina, a 1991 World Cup title, and a
1996 Olympic gold medal. For five years in a row she has been named
U.S. Soccer Player of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question, I think she's done a tremendous thing for
women's sports, period, and certainly for soccer,'' said Vic Fodor,
manager of the Valley United Stars club, an all-girl soccer team of
mainly ninth-graders.
</P>
<P>
   ``She presents herself real well and is such a great, great
athlete. I think the girls do look up to her,'' Fodor said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Hamm, Fodor said, his players looked up to older siblings
or friends. Only a handful of female soccer players, like Michelle
Akers _ also a member of the U.S. women's team _ attracted any
attention. Now, with role models like Hamm, girls are even more
inspired to join, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I put the team together in 1994, we were age 10 and
under, but we had to play 11 and under because there were just no
club teams,'' said Fodor, whose team is three-time state champion
and two-time winner of the Far West Regional Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, you see teams under age 9 and 10. There's just such a
great amount of teams.''
</P>
<P>
   As late as 1992, there were no women's soccer teams at the
University of California, Los Angeles; the University of Southern
California; Pepperdine; or Loyola Marymount.
</P>
<P>
   But now, young girls are seeing opportunities are available for
them, mainly college scholarships, said Fred Singer, president of
the Valley United Soccer Club, which is made up of 24 teams, of
which half are girl's teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see soccer as a great avenue for young girls to advance on
to the college level,'' said Singer, who has alumni players who
have gone on to Ivy League universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think girls look up to the women's national program very
much so and leaders like Mia Hamm,'' Singer said. ``That's the only
place they have to look to at this point in time because the United
States doesn't have a professional program.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamm has more than just an avid female-fan base. Her
high-profile position also has attracted male admirers, said Jim
Rickard, men's soccer coach at The Master's College and coordinator
of its youth soccer camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just girls seeing Mia Hamm, my college guys are very
complimentary of our U.S. women's team ... and it's always the
utmost respect when they talk about Mia,'' said Rickard, whose camp
of about 70 soccer players, ages 5 to 15, is about 40 percent
female.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica first heard of Hamm last year during the Women's World
Cup and was instantly awed by her kicking techniques, but what
impressed her most was her attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a really good sport, she doesn't brag about herself and
she cheers on her teammates,'' Jessica said. ``She could beat any
male player.''

 &HT;    Stayin' alive in NYC: Knicks beat Spurs 89-81
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Playing with the ferocity that brought them to a
level in the playoffs that appeared utterly unattainable for an
eighth-seeded team, the New York Knicks road a three-headed scoring
monster to a 89-81victory that halved San Antonio's lead in the NBA
Finals to 2-1 Monday night in frantic Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Houston (34), Latrell Sprewell (24) and Larry Johnson (16)
scored all but 15 of New York's points to save a banged-up team
that appeared on the cusp of being swept. David Robinson and Tim
Duncan combined for 45 points that were not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Van Gundy worried about a lot of things before his players
took the floor for the game that would either resurrect their
chance at a championship or doom them.
</P>
<P>
   He was concerned about the health of forward Larry Johnson _
``He's on a heckuva lot of pain medication'' _ and Johnson's
ability to help his cause with 3-point shooting early in the game.
``When he makes those shots he helps us win games. When he misses,
it's that much tougher for us.''
</P>
<P>
   He fretted over how many minutes he could expect from his
athletic young center-forward Marcus Camby because ``when he plays
a long stretch of time he gets fatigued, but that's true with
everyone on our team right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson remained in the lineup despite his injury and his
off-day tirade and Van Gundy considered starting Camby because the
Knicks needed some energy. ``You make a lineup change, you have to
believe in it,'' the coach said, but he did not come off as a man
operating with great conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Too, he was concerned about the Knicks' ability to hold on at
the end of each half ``because of fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   When they jumped ahead early he got some of what he wanted, but
when Camby committed his second foul after only 5:25 he appeared to
have lost that gamble. Still, the Knicks led by as many as 14 in a
late-first quarter shootout. But it appeared to sap them, because
the Spurs quickly asserted themselves, drawing within four points
on Tim Duncan's three-point play midway of the second quarter and
then 42-40 on Sean Elliott's leaner at 3:51.
</P>
<P>
   For a team trying to get back in a series, a 49-46 halftime lead
was hardly comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes prompted a confrontation between Camby and Robinson
1:20 into the second half, their bumping and shoving leading to
double personal and technical fouls. Only 10 seconds later, Camby
committed his fourth personal _ against Robinson _ and had to leave
again.
</P>
<P>
   All this ignited Houston. He sank three straight shots, the last
a trey, and the Knicks led 56-47. But the Knicks did not score a
field goal from Houston's 3-pointer at 9:17 until 3:04. That
included 12 missed shots and 2-of-4 free throwing.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs crept back to tie at 58 on Duncan's hook with 3:34
left. It was Houston who broke the spell with a 3-pointer, adding
two more free throws, giving him 30 points on the game and the
Knicks a lead of five. But Duncan rallied the Spurs. He had 20.

KNICKS TOP SPURS, 89-81 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Allan Houston took an ominous situation and turned it
into an inspirational journey around David Robinson, Tim Duncan and
the mighty San Antonio Spurs on Monday night before an awestruck
crowd at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The fans watched in wonder as Houston, undaunted by the
predicament the Knicks found themselves in during the National
Basketball Association finals, scored a career playoff-high 34
points to lead his team to an 89-81 victory in Game 3. At the same
time, he preserved faith in a Knicks team that seemed on the verge
of being swept in this series. They now trail two games to one,
with Game 4 at the Garden on Wednesday night and Game 5 there
Friday night,
</P>
<P>
   The victory ended San Antonio's record playoff run of 12
victories in a row and was their first on the road in these
playoffs. The Spurs got 20 points from Duncan, who was blanked in
the fourth quarter, and 25 from Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   But the night belonged to Houston, who saved the Knicks from
doom in the end. The Knicks had a 78-68 lead with seven minutes
left after a jumper from Houston. But after some poor execution,
which included a wild turnover by Latrell Sprewell (24 points), the
Spurs pulled within 4, 81-77, on a 3-pointer from Sean Elliott with
3 minutes 11 seconds left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Houston came back and nailed a jumper over Elliott to give the
Knicks their breathing room. Then Marcus Camby, who was having a
miserable night in his first start as a Knick, came back and hit an
11-foot fallaway jumper to put the Knicks ahead, 85-77, with 2:18
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks made more changes than just the addition of Marcus
Camby in the starting lineup to replace Chris Dudley. They altered
their thinking. Instead of going one on one against the Spurs,
Houston and Sprewell worked together to create open shots for each
other, and it worked to the tune of a 32-21 lead after the first
quarter. But after a sloppy and somewhat chaotic second quarter by
the Knicks, the Spurs were able to creep back into the game and
pull within 3, 49-46, at the break.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks calmed down and went back to Houston to start the
third quarter. After scoring 18 points in the first half, he kept
cooking and scored over Mario Elie on three straight possessions,
including a 3-pointer in transition that put the Knicks up, 56-47,
with 9:16 left in the third. At that point, Houston had 25 points,
almost half his team's total.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of getting flustered, Spurs Coach Gregg Popovich called
two quick timeouts to get his team on its defensive game. It
worked. After a turnover by Charlie Ward and two missed shots by
Sprewell, the Spurs were within 4, 58-54, with five minutes left in
the third.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was screaming for Houston to get the ball, but the
Spurs were double-teaming him every time he touched the ball. And
as the shot clock kept melting down, the Knicks were forcing up bad
shots that were being rebounded by the Spurs, who were within 58-56
with 4:01 left in the third. They tied it on a Duncan bank shot 30
seconds later.
</P>
<P>
   But Houston was unflappable. He picked up a loose ball as the
shot clock was running out and knocked down a 3-pointer at the
24-second buzzer. Then he drove into Jaren Jackson and found his
way to the free-throw line to put the Knicks up by 5, 63-58.
Problem was, Houston was the only thing going for the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the shot blocking of Robinson and Duncan, it was the
poor shooting from the outside and at the line by Sprewell that was
keeping the Knicks from taking to a nice lead. Sprewell, who was 0
for 6 from the floor in the third, missed four of five free throws
in one stretch before hitting one with 1.2 seconds left to give the
Knicks a 65-62 lead entering the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the Knicks' shooting percentage had dipped into the
30s, but by sheer volume of shots, they were ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Each team had blistered the other's defense in the first half.
The Knicks, led by Houston's 18 points and Sprewell's 12, shot 46
percent against the league's best defense. But the Spurs shot 51.4
percent against the league's second-best defense.
</P>
<P>
   While the Knicks tinkered with their game plan, the Spurs played
the same steady beat, pounding the ball into Robinson and Duncan,
who combined for 26 points and 11 rebounds in the first half. It
didn't matter if Camby was out there or not, they were still
dominating. An overeager Camby, who picked up his second foul four
minutes into the game, finished the first half with one rebound,
one blown dunk and no points in eight minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But the Knicks' other big man, Larry Johnson, was having more
success this time around. After shooting 20 percent in Games 1 and
2, Johnson, who has been hindered by a sprained knee, looked more
mobile. He spun and shook as he worked in the post against Duncan,
scoring 10 first-half points on 5-for-9 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   This was more like it for the Knicks. They were playing with
balance while still attacking and getting to the free-throw line.
For once, they were ahead in the latter department. In the first
half, the Knicks went to the line 12 times _ which included 10
successful trips by Houston _ and the Spurs took 10 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Dumping selfishness for togetherness turned a Knicks season on
the verge of ruin into a stunning success story. That unselfishness
was evident from the start on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   A hot Houston helped give the Knicks an 11-point lead after the
first quarter. It was a lead built on teamwork and
unpredictability.
</P>
<P>
   Once Houston sat down, the Knicks went to Johnson in the post,
and he delivered some fancy post moves around Duncan. They were
rolling as they took a 40-33 lead with six minutes left in the
second quarter. But the Spurs' defense started applying more
pressure, and the Knicks turned the ball over on three consecutive
possessions, allowing the Spurs to crawl back into the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs were doing what the Knicks had done to little avail in
the first two games: they were hanging around.

IS JACKSON AN L.A. GUY?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Halfway though Phil Jackson's first press
conference as coach of the Los Angeles Lakers, someone in the
audience wondered if he thought it would be a difficult transition
for him to become a L.A. Guy.
</P>
<P>
   Now I've never quite understood such an arcane connotation,
perhaps because over the past several decades I've met a wide
variety of people of the male gender from this area who haven't fit
any classic stereotype.
</P>
<P>
   What is a L.A. Guy, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   Is it someone who reads Daily Variety, adheres to the trends and
styles in L.A. Magazine, goes nowhere without a beeper and cell
phone, and is constantly ducking creditors because of a mindless
need to make a false public impression by buying expensive cars and
homes he can't afford?
</P>
<P>
   Is it someone who doesn't smoke, diligently monitors his diet,
works out feverishly, surfs, mountain climbs, dates groovy chicks,
invests in stocks, holds down a high-paying computer job and is a
dues-paying member of Great Expectations?
</P>
<P>
   Is it someone who has had a few bit parts in movies no one has
seen, hangs out in the Sky Bar and House of Blues, shamelessly
embellishes the truth, has no visible means of support, and acts
like a big shot at dinner gatherings until the waiter delivers a
tab that always results in his making mysterious disappearances?
</P>
<P>
   Is it someone who has Michael Ovitz's private number, plays gin
with the fellows at Bel Air, once dated Jennifer O'Neal, regularly
sees a manicurist, masseuse and aesthetician, thinks Bill Clinton
is a gas, and calls himself a venture capitalist even though he's a
trust-fund bum who has been rescued countless times from failed
investments from his long-suffering mother?
</P>
<P>
   Is it someone who has breakfast with Larry King at Nate `n' Al's
Deli in Beverly Hills, or is able to get a script read by Steven
Speilberg, or has had a legal beef with Michael Eisner, or is a
regular at Jerry Buss' pre-game Laker dinners, or knows Richard
Riordan on a first-name basis?
</P>
<P>
   Is it someone who looks like Brad Pitt, or Mike Myers?
</P>
<P>
   Honestly, I have no idea what construes the quintessential L.A.
Guy, although I will, in my never-ending quest to upgrade the
sporting scene in these parts, offer Phil Jackson a few tips on how
to survive his upcoming L.A. Odyssey:
</P>
<P>
   Don't Upset Dyan Cannon: I'm not sure either Del Harris or Kurt
Rambis paid proper homage to the Lakers' most passionate female
celebrity patron when they were bumbling oops, pardon me running
Laker matters. I don't know if she practices voodoo if she doesn't
like you, but never underestimate this venerable Hollywood survivor
who once even managed to marry Cary Grant. Keep her on your side,
Phil.
</P>
<P>
   See To It That Your Limo Driver Knows The Directions To The
Huntington Library: This pristine Pasadena sanctuary with its
gorgeous Japanese gardens and its impressive collection of art will
be a perfect spot for Jackson, the Zen master, to meditate when
he's having problems convincing Shaquille O'Neal that O'Neal should
spend all his spare moments studying film footage of Tim Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   Find Time To Have A Post-Game Cold One With Ol' Doc Buss: There
is nothing Jerry Buss likes more in life except for meeting ladies
a third his age than sitting around in the Forum press lounge after
a Laker match and gabbing it up with friends. It's always a
spirited affair with the participants also consuming plenty of
spirits. Like Buss, Jackson is well-versed on a wide range of
subjects, although I'm not sure his liver has the same iron
constitution as Buss'.
</P>
<P>
   Arrange A Sitdown With Ice Cube: The famed LA. rapper is a big
Laker fan and Kobe Bryant admirer. Jackson needs all the allies he
can muster as he gets ready to attempt a most delicate maneuver
transforming Kobe Bryant from a selfish, me-first basketball player
into one who actually is sensitive to the wants and needs of
teammates. There is no doubt that young Kobe is going to brood for
a while about this wild Jackson scheme, and Jackson doesn't need
the aggravation of being dissed in a rap song, does he?
</P>
<P>
   Refrain From Reminding Jerry West How Great A Player He Once
Was: There is nothing the top Laker executive detests more in life
than being shamelessly patronized. He doesn't see himself as anyone
special even though he was it is West's likeness on the official
NBA logo and he can spot a phony faster than he once was able to
drive past a defender. Jackson will have no problem in his dealings
with West unless he decides to bring up the 1972-73 season when
Jackson's New York Knicks beat West's Lakers across five games in
the NBA finals.
</P>
<P>
   Memorize Jack Nicholson's Greatest Lines ``Herrrrrrrres,
Johnny!'' Jackson can roar to the Academy Award winning actor,
mimicking Nicholson's famous refrain from ``The Shining.'' This
definitely would win Jackson a few Brownie points with Nicholson,
who would inevitably inform all his Hollywood pals what a swell guy
Phil Jackson is. I wonder if Del Harris ever tried such a tack with
Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   Know Your Long Beach Getaways: When things are unfolding
miserably Shaq missing free throws, Kobe taking goofy shots, Derek
Fisher committing too many turnovers, J.R. Reid and Robert Horry
shying away from rebounds, etc. Phil Jackson should seek refuge in
our fair city. He can titillate himself with such thrilling
diversions as chasing ghosts at the Queen Mary, inspecting fish at
the Aquarium of the Pacific, discussing police procedures with John
Morris, gazing at celebrities at Trani's, exchanging bon mots with
Fightin' Bob Maxson &AMP; Bev O'Neill and engaging the pint-sized beer
baron Whitey Littlefield in a mean game of hopscotch, or a water
pistol duel.
</P>
<P>
   Know The Way To LAX: When all else fails with the Lakers, Phil
Jackson always can repair to an airport that can return him from
wherever he came and away from the harrowing trouble that
inevitably awaits him at his new calling.

KNICKS' POINT GUARDS CONTINUE TO HAVE PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The talk in the last few days had been about the
Knicks abandoning their embattled and ineffective point guards
completely, sitting them on the bench so a bigger lineup could try
to generate offense against the Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, the Knicks' offense finally came to life in the
89-81 victory but the point guard woes _ a burden that has plagued
them since former general manager Ernie Grunfeld showered millions
on two players who together had one fewer assist than David
Robinson did entering Game 3 _ got a bit worse. Coach Jeff Van
Gundy stayed with a standard backcourt, not pairing Latrell
Sprewell and Allan Houston together. But Chris Childs, the backup
who has outplayed starter Charlie Ward for much of the season,
sprained his left knee in the second quarter in a scuffle for a
loose ball with Tim Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   How bad did things go? Childs was called for a kicked ball
violation and, fittingly for the kind of frustration these point
guards so frequently generate, Duncan got the ball. Childs
returnred midway through the fourth quarter, but finished with just
three points and three assists.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Knicks, Allan Houston's spectacular one-man
performance rendered the point guards an afterthought once again.
Houston and Sprewell had better luck going aggressively to the
basket than they had in the first two games and Houston, in
particular, was sterling from outside. Houston (34) and Sprewell
(24) combined for 58 points.
</P>
<P>
   But before Childs got hurt, he was part of one play that
captured the futility of the point guard tandem. With 5 minutes 21
seconds left in the second quarter and the Knicks leading by 42-35,
Ward reached in an stripped Duncan of the ball. But on the run,
Ward tried to heave the ball downcourt and instead, the Spurs'
Antonio Daniels intercepted it. He fed Duncan, who drove into the
lane for a dunk just as a trailing Childs reached up to grab his
arm for a senseless foul. When Duncan hit the free throw to compete
the 3-point play, the Knicks' mistakes had caused a five-point
swing.
</P>
<P>
   Childs' injury caused the Knicks to rely more on Ward, a
situation they wanted to avoid, despite Childs' struggle to score
in this series. Childs backs up Ward, but has outplayed him most of
the season, most acutely in the later playoff rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Ward has been unable to perform in the new up-tempo offense. A
former college quarterback who seems best suited for a game where
he knows all the plays and has time to watch them develop, Ward's
minutes have dwindled as the Knicks have evolved from a halfcourt
offense to a run-and-gun group. While Ward's statistics are
slightly better than Childs' in this series _ he had scored 12
points and six assists to Childs' six points and four assists
entering Game 3 _ it is clear Van Gundy hoped Childs could not only
run the offense, but make himself the team's third scoring option.
</P>
<P>
   Until Game 3, the offense had foundered no matter who was at the
point, with the Knicks wasting precious seconds on the shot clock,
unable to get into their offensive sets until just 10 or 12 seconds
remained on the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know one thing: Chris Childs and Charlie Ward's importance
doesn't diminish,'' Van Gundy said before Game 3. ``Particularly
Chris. We need him not on the bench. We need him to play better.''
</P>
<P>
   Only in the first-round series against Miami did Ward play more
minutes than Childs. Childs played 10 more minutes in the Atlanta
series and in the Pacers' series, Childs played 174 minutes to
Ward's 114. Not coincidentally, Childs' minutes increased
dramatically after Patrick Ewing got hurt. But with Childs
struggling to find his touch against the Spurs, he has split time
almost evenly with Ward.
</P>
<P>
   With Ewing out and Larry Johnson hobbled and hesitant, Childs
has failed to establish himself as a third scoring option with
Sprewell and Houston. He shot a combined 3 for 16 in the first two
games of the finals and took just two shots, and had no assists or
steals before leaving Game 3 after just 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not having turnovers dribbling up the floor,'' Childs
said before the game. ``What we're not doing successfully is
getting the ball up the court a lot quicker to get in our offense a
lot earlier. We're getting the ball with four or five seconds left
on the shot clock and we're not able to swing it or make a better
decision. But I just haven't shot the ball well. If I'm going to
shoot eight times, I need to make more than two shots. If I'm out
there, I still have to take the shots that are presented. I have to
knock it down. I have to get it to the basket better and get us
some easy baskets.'' &QL;

SPURS LOSE COMPOSURE IN GAME 3 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The rowdiness of the New York fans and the breadth of
the situation were not supposed to rattle the reserved and
typically unflappable San Antonio Spurs. Their experience, their
calm, even their educations, were supposed to make the setting and
scenario a nonissue in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   But the Spurs, the National Basketball Association's ultimate
road warriors, melted beneath the heat of the Madison Square Garden
stage.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter, when the intensity was feverish, the
seemingly frazzled Spurs committed four turnovers, earned two
technical fouls and allowed the Knicks to score 32 points against
their vaunted league-best defense.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was only the Spurs' second of the post-season and their
first on the road. It broke a 12-game winning streak that included
six road victories.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs, who had won by an average of 13.4 points on the road,
had not lost a road game since April 27 at Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   No one seemed more frazzled than Mario Elie, the Spurs' edgy
off-guard who grew up five minutes away from the Garden. Admittedly
excited about playing in the gym of his dreams, he committed two
quick fouls in less than two minutes and received a technical for
screaming at the officials after his second one. It was not the
gallant homecoming he had envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always dreamed about playing in the Garden, about playing
five minutes from the crib,'' Elie said before the game. ``I had to
get 22 tickets, so I'm excited about family and friends watching. I
know where everybody's going to sit, so when I make a good move,
I'll make sure to point at my little section up there.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no pointing, though, as Elie scored just five points
and was scorched all night long by Allan Houston. But Elie was not
alone in his futility. Avery Johnson, the usually sure-handed point
guard, committed two turnovers in the first quarter and four in the
first half. He averaged just 2.2 per game during the regular season
and only 2.5 throughout the playoffs. Johnson made up for his
errors somewhat by scoring 8 first-half points.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the Spurs' coach, Gregg Popovich, was called for a
technical foul late in the first quarter for arguing an official's
call after a Knicks' foul. Then, the Spurs earned another technical
that led to a free throw by Houston for playing an illegal defense
in the final seconds of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   While the Knicks rode the emotion of the Garden crowd to a
blistering start, Tim Duncan suffered through an
uncharacteristically unproductive start. Missing three of his four
shots, he managed just two points over the first 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the Knicks wanted to capitalize and to a certain
extent, they did, taking a 32-21 lead. But because of the
unexpected offense of Johnson and Antonio Daniels the advantage
seemed far from commanding. It is true that Robinson was big,
posting 9 points and 4 rebounds in the first quarter, but if
Johnson and Daniels had not picked up their games, it might not
have mattered. The two point guards kept the game from getting out
of hand until Duncan found himself and regained his dominating
form.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who averaged only 5 points through the first two games
of this series, scored 4 in the first quarter and 8 in the first
half. While his teammates seemed somewhat shocked, he scored on two
of the Spurs' first three field goals on driving layups in which he
moved right through the Knicks' defense. The baskets kept the Spurs
from starting the game in a near standstill.
</P>
<P>
   The contribution of Daniels, the forgotten backup, was even more
significant. After Elie and Jaren Jackson picked up two fouls
apiece while trying to stick with the slithering Houston, the
Spurs' coach Gregg Popovich was forced to insert Daniels.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels, who was moved deeper down San Antonio's bench in favor
of Steve Kerr during the Western Conference final series against
Portland, responded hugely, nailing two 3-pointers in the final 2
minutes, 35 seconds of the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   His first triple sliced an 11-point Knicks' lead, their biggest
of the game to that point, to eight. His second came from 29 feet
out with nine-tenths of a second remaining in the quarter and
followed a 3-pointer by Chris Childs. It kept the Knicks from
entering the second quarter with absolute momentum. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMNL WITH LUGS LIKE THESE, WHO KNOWS? 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With his ugly tirade on Sunday, Larry Johnson pumped
a dose of reality into the finals. He allowed everybody to root for
this to be over immediately, if not sooner.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks, oddly enough, did not feel that way. The freelance
forays by Messrs. Houston, Sprewell and Camby that brought the
Knicks into the finals were revived in the friendly environment of
the Garden on Monday night, as the Knicks defeated San Antonio,
89-81. Now the series must last at least until Friday _ and with
these inconsistent lugs, who knows?
</P>
<P>
   If the Knicks had lost on Monday night, the best scenario would
have been to stay right on the court and play the fourth game
rather than make everybody plod back to the Garden on Wednesday for
a fourth game. A numb nation was already crying out: ``Just get it
over with.''
</P>
<P>
   As my mailman, Jimmy, said on Monday, ``Geez, the Little League
season is over, except for the playoffs. School is out. Spring
soccer is over. But the NBA is still playing?''
</P>
<P>
   Let's move on to Michelle Akers and Linda Medalen, predestined
to bump their combative old noggins in the final of the Women's
World Cup. Let's move on to Jeter and Junior. Maybe Steffi will
spank the little brat Martina at Wimbledon. Let us try to answer
the question that has been nagging me all spring: ``Who is this
Roger Cedeno, and why doesn't Bobby Valentine start him every
game?'' Let us look into the strip-mining of the Islanders' hockey
franchise by the Millstone gang. There is much to do.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the Knicks made more than a few of us giddy, as
if we were on laughing gas. That noted observer of the passing
scene, Don Imus, railed against the front-running euphoria of some
New Yorkers (no names mentioned, for fear of self-incrimination).
</P>
<P>
   Nobody ever claimed the Knicks were all fine fellows, but for a
few crazed days my theory was that it was O.K. to appreciate their
weird and belated internal combustion. After all, they did beat
Riley, Wilkens and Bird in rapid succession. (Now that we think
about it, the Pacers really should be ashamed of themselves.)
</P>
<P>
   Johnson came to the Knicks with a history of crude gestures
while representing the United States in the world championships. He
had a feud with the sweet and affable Alonzo Mourning in Charlotte.
He hasn't exactly been Prince Charming in New York, but rather the
new face of the post-Buck, post-Doc, post-Michael, National
Basketball Association that makes Commissioner David Stern blanch
behind his doggedly optimistic remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Stern was playing spinmeister on Monday morning in his official
State of the Post-Jordan-Apocalypse address. He discussed setting a
minimum age for rookies and he also discussed the need for better
fundamentals in a time when players are shooting to impress the
director of the cable highlight shows rather than to impress their
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is time to make the players pass a fundamentals test
(layups off the glass, two-handed foul shots, soft bounce passes,
boxing out on defense) in order to qualify for a license to play
basketball, like the ancient craft guilds in Europe. But don't hold
your breath.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 playoffs have now lasted practically as long as the
entire ugly lockout-shortened season. Enough, already. That grating
sound you heard was millions of television remote-control clickers
all seeking something, anything.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks persevered as first Patrick Ewing and then Johnson
went down with injuries. Johnson earned a combat ribbon for willing
himself back without missing a game, but he has not been the same,
and that clearly frustrated him. But he gets gigged for $25,000 and
his team gets gigged the same for his profanity-laced outburst at
Sunday's workout.
</P>
<P>
   By cursing at league officials and his blatant contempt for the
world around him, Johnson brought us back to square one _ the
pushing and the shoving, the hard fouls and the no helping-hands of
the Riley regime, the intramural bickering, the backstabbing by the
suits, the parade of new owners, the general lack of soul coming
out of the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tim Duncan and David Robinson set a tone of grace and
manners _ and skill. And Hersey Hawkins, who plays a continent away
in Seattle, received the sportsmanship award on Monday. Larry
Johnson did not.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks had the right to dream on Monday night but Johnson's
outburst has reminded New Yorkers just what they have been going
gaga over. For that, we thank him. &QL;

<P>
   DALLAS _ Ken Hitchcock stood before a packed crowd at Reunion
Arena yesterday and announced his plans for the next two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we got one of these, why not make it two?'' the
Stars coach shouted to a pep rally that had gathered to honor the
Stars' first Stanley Cup championship. ``Hell, let's go for
three.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was the champagne or the adrenalin rush from the
celebration. Maybe Hitchcock was just playing to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   C'mon, seriously, can the Stars really be thinking about a
dynasty?
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe this is an organization that wants to be competitive
every year, every game,'' Hitchcock said. ``And I believe it's an
organization that has been built by Bob \RGainey\S to win for the
long-term. I don't think our goals change just because we've won it
once.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars will start their quest for a second Stanley Cup this
week with the expansion draft and entry draft. The push will
continue next week with the July 1 start of free agency, and it
will continue throughout the summer as Stars management tries to
solidify the roster for next season.
</P>
<P>
   While the Stars already have under contract a team that could
probably compete for next year's Cup, they also know that keeping
the fringes strong is one of the key reasons this team was able to
survive the grueling 60-day run to the championship.
</P>
<P>
   So how do they deal with the roster tweaks, the expectations,
the fact they already are physically exhausted and beaten up? How
do they take just two months off and return in early September for
training camp? How does a team regain the hunger needed to overcome
the hardships? How does a team survive the expectations of wearing
the No. 1 target?
</P>
<P>
   How does a team repeat?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have to take it slowly, take a step back, always
be prepared for your decisions, build in a similar way to what we
did here,'' said Gainey, the Stars' general manager. ``I hope that
what we have built is something that has been built for the
long-term, and I think it is. From there, we have to just try to
continue to make decisions that we believe are right.''
</P>
<P>
   Gainey has done that, and that's one reason this won't be a
controversial summer. The Stars already have secured long-term
contracts with several players: Mike Modano, Derian Hatcher, Darryl
Sydor, Brett Hull and Mike Keane. Players under contract for next
season are Jere Lehtinen, Jamie Langenbrunner, Sergei Zubov, Ed
Belfour, Joe Nieuwendyk, Shawn Chambers, Brian Skrudland and Grant
Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   Those players _ mixed with young prospects Juha Lind, Jason
Botterill, Brad Lukowich, Jon Sim, Blake Sloan, Jamie Wright, Manny
Fernandez and Marty Turco _ give the Stars a competitive team.
However, there are some key questions Gainey and his staff must
answer.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Stars have to decide in the next few weeks whether
Guy Carbonneau, 39, and Craig Ludwig, 38, are too old to play, or
whether they have one last run at a Stanley Cup remaining. Both
veterans have contracts in which the Stars hold the option.
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau is almost a guaranteed return. While the Stars have
solid checking-line centers they would like to bring over from
Europe, including Pavel Patera and Roman Lyashenko, and have a
scrappy center in Aaron Gavey already in the system, no player has
the experience and grit of Carbonneau.
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig, on the other hand, has tougher competition behind him.
Brad Lukowich, 22, played well in playoff situations. Petr Buzek,
22, Richard Jackman, 21, and Alan Latang, 23, also could be given a
chance to play at the NHL level. Or the Stars could go out and get
a more fleet-footed defenseman through free agency to pair with
Chambers.
</P>
<P>
   The club also has options on Benoit Hogue, Derek Plante and
Brent Severyn. Do the Stars need to keep those players or decide
they can live without the higher salaries of Hogue ($2 million) and
Plante ($1 million)?
</P>
<P>
   After they make those decisions, the Stars have to try to decide
if they want to sign any of their unrestricted free agents. Dave
Reid seems a bargain at $700,000 after he contributed 10 points in
the playoffs. Would he come back at the same price? Pat Verbeek
can't possibly be retained at $3.2 million, but maybe he'd play for
less. Tony Hrkac will almost assuredly be back with his $350,000
price tag.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the Stars have to find out what the price is to keep
restricted free-agent Richard Matvichuk. As a restricted free
agent, the Stars have the right to match any offer on Matvichuk.
Because owner Tom Hicks has shown the ability to spend money, no
team is expected to make an offer to Matvichuk knowing Hicks will
likely match. That means the Stars and Matvichuk will have to come
up with a fair salary, something Matvichuk would likely want to be
more than $2 million per season.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars might also try to tie up playoff most valuable player
Nieuwendyk, goalie Belfour and defenseman Zubov to long-term deals,
but those are discussions that will take place later in the summer.
However, the thought of long-term deals brings up an interesting
issue about the future drives for future Stanley Cups. Will Belfour
come back with the same calm after winning the Cup? Will Nieuwendyk
have the same drive that pushed him through a grueling summer of
knee rehabilitation? Will Modano's wrist heal properly? What about
Hull's knee? Will the Stars continue to push themselves just as
hard for Hitchcock, whose driving, defensive style can at times be
wearing?
</P>
<P>
   The players don't have the monetary carrots hanging out there.
Is inner drive enough?
</P>
<P>
   Those are cruel questions for a team of players celebrating the
greatest moment in their respective athletic lives, but they're
questions that are asked by teams that have designs on repeating.
They are questions that are answered by teams that do repeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have less time to get ready for next year and we'll have to
tackle the physical challenges next year,'' said Craig Button,
director of player personnel. ``But at the same time, once you've
done it, you know what it takes. You can always draw on that
experience next year and even in the summer. If you want to win,
you have to pay a price. And these players want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   But getting them to want it just as badly, to be able to come
through even more hardship has to be a difficult challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``In juniors, the first one was always the toughest one,''
Hitchcock said. ``Winning is good for any organization. I think you
just have to look at it like the Chicago Bulls or anyone else that
wins consistently. You make winning a part of your team, and your
team lives winning every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean expectations can be negative or expectations can be
positive,'' Hitchcock added. ``Here, I believe the expectation to
win is a positive thing. We should expect to win every year.''

 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was no hint of this. None. There was nothing in
the first two games to suggest that the Knicks could minimize Tim
Duncan, and win their last chance to make something of this
championship round.
</P>
<P>
   How much could a home-court advantage _ even those loud and
demanding Garden fans _ be worth after two sluggish games in San
Antonio? How could the Knicks possibly overcome the player who has
roared past Shaq and Hill and everybody else of his generation? How
could they get over the loss of Patrick Ewing and the injury to
Larry Johnson?
</P>
<P>
   Totally improbably, the freelance forays by Allan Houston and
Latrell Sprewell that brought the Knicks into the finals were
revived in the friendly environment of the Garden on Monday night,
as the Knicks defeated the Spurs, 89-81. Now the series must last
at least until Friday _ and with these inconsistent lugs, who
knows?
</P>
<P>
   If the Knicks had lost on Monday night, the best scenario would
have been to stay right on the court and play the fourth game
rather than make everybody plod back to the Garden tomorrow for a
fourth game. A numb nation was already crying out: ``Just get it
over with.''
</P>
<P>
   As my mailman, Jimmy, said on Monday, ``Geez, the Little League
season is over, except for the playoffs. School is out. Spring
soccer is over. But the NBA is still playing?''
</P>
<P>
   And still playing. And still playing. It was time to move on to
Michelle Akers and Linda Medalen, predestined to bump their
combative old noggins in the final of the Women's World Cup. Time
to focus on to Jeter and Junior. Maybe Steffi will spank the little
brat Martina at Wimbledon. Let us try to answer the question that
has been nagging me all spring: ``Who is this Roger Cedeno, and why
doesn't Bobby Valentine start him every game?'' Let us look into
the strip-mining of the Islanders' hockey franchise by the
Millstone gang. There is much to do.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks had even forfeited any dubious potential as lovable
comeback kids. Johnson earned a combat ribbon for willing himself
back from his sprained knee without missing a game, but then he got
himself gigged for $25,000 and his team gigged the same amount for
his profane outburst at Sunday's workout.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson took us back to square one _ the pushing and the
shoving, the hard fouls and the no helping-hands of the Riley
regime, the intramural bickering, the backstabbing by the suits,
the parade of new owners, the general lack of soul coming out of
the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Duncan and David Robinson set a tone of grace and
manners _ and skill. And Hersey Hawkins, who plays a continent away
in Seattle, received the sportsmanship award on Monday. Larry
Johnson did not.
</P>
<P>
   He came to the Knicks with a history of crude gestures while
representing the United States in the world championships. He had a
feud with the sweet and affable Alonzo Mourning in Charlotte. He
hasn't exactly been Prince Charming in New York, but rather the new
face of the post-Buck, post-Doc, post-Michael, National Basketball
Association that makes Commissioner David Stern blanch behind his
doggedly optimistic remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson allowed anybody but a diehard Knicks fan to root for
this series to be over immediately, if not sooner. In recent weeks,
that noted observer of the passing scene, Don Imus, railed against
the front-running euphoria of some New Yorkers (no names mentioned,
for fear of self-incrimination).
</P>
<P>
   Nobody ever claimed the Knicks were all fine fellows, but my
theory was that it was okay to appreciate their weird and belated
internal combustion.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is happening again. The Spurs started slowly, but after
the first two games, there was every reason to think they could
pound the ball inside to Duncan _ ``certainly the best player in
the NBA,'' said Jeff Van Gundy of the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   There was not even an air of desperation in the Garden. There
have been more emotional nights in the place. Maybe it was the
sense of inevitability about the intelligent and patient Duncan,
gliding to his spots on the court. Going into the fourth quarter,
Duncan had 20 points and gave the aura of somebody about to take
the game over. He did not. He rushed a few shots, missed all four
he attempted, and never scored again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This showed the true character of the Knicks,'' Van Gundy
said. ``That was the first time we lost two in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   That character includes Larry Johnson's ugly outburst on Sunday.
They are not a lovable bunch, but they won a game with no warning
whatsoever. They are still here. All else is still on hold.
</P>

HOUSTON GIVES THE KNICKS NEW LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As he faced up Sean Elliott at the free throw line
with 3 minutes left _ rising for the shot as Madison Square Garden
rose with him _ it became clear even before the ball rattled around
and through the net:
</P>
<P>
   To get to San Antonio, you must first go through Houston.
</P>
<P>
   With the season essentially in the balance on Monday night, the
most reliable player for the Knicks in the postseason stepped to
forefront again in Game 3 of the finals and delivered another
pulsating performance.
</P>
<P>
   As pretty as his game was _ 34 points in 45 minutes and 4
assists _ Houston's less-noticeable contributions were the reason
why the Knicks have life against this impossibly tall and talented
Spurs team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to give it up to Allan tonight, he's the one who got
some of those guys in foul trouble early and ended up making it
easier for us down the stretch,'' said Latrell Sprewell. ``He was
huge.''
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes of the first quarter, he was taking the ball to
Mario Elie, the physical and tenacious Spurs swingman, the only
native New Yorker in the finals, who came to town this week with
more confidence in his left pinky than the Knicks had in their
entire locker room.
</P>
<P>
   After two quick fouls, Elie became enraged enough to warrant a
technical and had to be sat down. The player who had help take
Houston out of his rhythm in Games 1 and 2 was suddenly
discombobulated himself.
</P>
<P>
   Next up was Jaren Jackson, who also found the going tough
against Houston. Coach Jeff Van Gundy, remembering the success
Houston had had when isolated on the left wing in Game 6 against
Indiana, used that formula until the well went dry on Monday night.
Steve Kerr even got an opportunity to stop Houston in the third
quarter, and he too had little success.
</P>
<P>
   The player who so often had settled for jump shots was taking
the ball with aggression to the basket, making Tim Duncan and David
Robinson leave their men. Houston made-believe he was a point guard
at times, penetrating through the lane and finding his open
teammates on the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   He made his free throws, all 12 of 12. And, finally, when the
defense gave it to him, he stuck that soft jump shot. Again. And
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling more comfortable taking the ball to the basket,''
Houston said after the Knicks came within a game of knotting the
series. ``I'm still not going to pass on any 3-point shots. It felt
good to make one finally. But to stay with this team, we have to
take the ball to the basket.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We tried to get the ball closer to the basket. In
the first two games, we were catching the ball way out on the
wings.''
</P>
<P>
   This was shaping up to be a desperate night for the Knicks. They
tried starting Marcus Camby, and he got into early foul trouble.
They tried isolating Sprewell, and he missed often before the
fourth quarter. So worried about making this a series for suitable
viewing, the beat-up and beleaguered Knicks tried every imaginable
defense to stop Duncan from dominating.
</P>
<P>
   And after all that desperation, after all that experimentation,
the one player New York turned to was the obvious choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will you be the go-to guy in Game 4?'' he was asked, sitting
in the rotunda area of the Garden an hour after he had sent most
19,763 home in a euphoric state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's what it calls on,'' he said, sheepishly. ``I'm
comfortable being in that position.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to say he also needs to look for his teammates when
he's covered tightly and everyone contributed and, well, just get
him the ball and get out of the way. He's the closest New York has
to a franchise player at the moment and, his inconsistency
notwithstanding, he's the best chance the Knicks have to make this
good theater.
</P>
<P>
   With 6 minutes, 29 seconds left, he dropped in about an
18-footer that pushed the Knicks ahead by 10 points _ a shot that
sent the Garden into another wild tizzy. After a few tense moments
down the stretch, after the Knicks had emerged with a game they
needed to save their season, they had Houston to thank once more.
</P>
<P>
   Every time this implausible run seems about to hit a wall, the
composed and clutch shooting guard backpacks his team to some other
plateau, above the calamity of the Garden, above Miami, Indiana
and, on Monday night, the best team left standing in the National
Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   More than a month ago, he started this wild script by taking a
pass at the free throw line, splitting the Heat defense and almost
short-arming a shot that hit the front of the rim and the backboard
before softly falling in. Miami Arena was dead quiet. He punched
the air, and the Knicks had moved on in unbelievable fashion.
</P>
<P>
   His last night at the Garden came in Game 6 against Indiana, a
night many say induced louder sound at the Garden than has been
heard in the past decade. Detonating for 32 points, he faced up
Reggie Miller at one point and laughed at him, as if the cocksure
Pacers veteran was not worth the time or effort, before knocking
down a jumper in his face.
</P>
<P>
   Neither that night nor Game 3 was Jordanesque, but it was the
closest thing New York has of that caliber, the closest thing the
Knicks have to combat the awesome talent of Duncan and David
Robinson. Van Gundy can try any adjustment he wants, and some may
eventually pay off over the next week.
</P>
<P>
   But the enduring image of this victory was of Houston rising
from the free throw line and dropping in his sweet shot. It is
clear: you want to get to San Antonio, you have to go through him.
Again. And again.

HOUSTON LEADS KNICKS TO AN 89-81 VICTORY OVER SPURS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Subs for rewriting throughout) (sw) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was chaos to Allan Houston's left. A ball was
loose in the corner, like a dollar bill swirling in the wind, while
the shot clock was melting down on the New York Knicks. At the last
instant, the burly Kurt Thomas hit the floor, grabbed the ball and
flung it into a sea of tranquillity, right into Houston's hands.
</P>
<P>
   In one smooth motion, Houston set himself and released a
3-pointer that splashed into the net at the shot-clock buzzer to
break a tie in the third quarter. And this was the way Houston made
every ominous situation that presented itself on Monday night into
another leg of his inspirational journey.
</P>
<P>
   It was Houston who preserved faith in the Knicks before an
awestruck crowd at Madison Square Garden. And it was Houston who
matched his playoff career high of 34 points _ including a
3-pointer in transition to stomp on the Spurs' threat in the final
minutes _ to pull the Knicks out of certain doom against the San
Antonio Spurs in an 89-81 Game 3 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of finding themselves on the verge of being swept in the
National Basketball Association finals, the Knicks crawled right
back in it, down two games to one in the four-of-seven-game series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our true character was tested because this is the first time
in the playoffs, one, that we've been down in a series,'' Coach
Jeff Van Gundy said. ``And two, it's first time we'd lost two in a
row. I think you saw the true character of the Knicks. We hung in
there, and were very resilient.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in the finals, the Knicks stood up to the
looming presence of the Spurs' David Robinson and Tim Duncan. They
combined for 45 points and 22 rebounds, but they did not dominate
the game. It was Houston's turn.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, he was not alone. Latrell Sprewell recovered from a
dreadful third quarter and finished with 24 points, while Larry
Johnson provided the Knicks with the third scorer they have been
searching for by adding 16 points. Johnson, feeling much freer on
his sprained knee, was also a part of a defensive effort that held
Duncan to 20 points but none in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In a role reversal, it was the Spurs' turn to stand in praise of
the Knicks, especially Houston. After the Spurs closed to 81-77
with 3 minutes 13 seconds left, Houston hit a jumper in transition
that provided the relief and separation the Knicks needed to pull
off a pivotal victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allan Houston was incredible,'' Duncan said. ``We thought we
played hard through that possession'' in the third quarter, ``and
then Allan comes up big. He made shots when they needed them.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston had his legs all night. In Games 1 and 2, Houston seemed
to wear down from the constant pounding he was taking driving to
the basket and guarding Mario Elie. While the Knicks remained
aggressive on Monday night, they did not dare give Robinson and
Duncan the same predictable chances at blocking their shots. The
Knicks altered their thinking, relying less on one-on-one play and
more on ball movement.
</P>
<P>
   Dumping unselfishness saved their season two months ago. It kept
them alive on Monday night as well. Sprewell shot just 9 for 22 but
had five assists. As much as Houston was shooting _ he was 10 for
24 _ he added four assists and seemed to be everywhere on the
court.
</P>
<P>
   Spurs Coach Gregg Popovich called him unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to be all the time,'' Houston said. ``I hope to be a
pain in the neck and unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm not, that's how I think. Sometimes you'll have a good
night. But I don't want to have a 30-point night and then have 10.
I want to be consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   He was the common thread through the Knicks' victory. Houston
started them off on the right aggressive track by getting to the
free-throw line, and he was a perfect 12 for 12 on the night.
</P>
<P>
   After Houston scored 18 points in the first half, he kept
cooking and scored over Elie on three straight possessions,
including a 3-pointer in transition to put the Knicks up, 56-47,
with 9:16 left in the third quarter. At that point, Houston had 25
points, almost half his team's total.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of getting flustered, Popovich called two quick timeouts
to get his team on its defensive game. It worked. After a turnover
by Charlie Ward and two missed shots by Sprewell, the Spurs were
within 4, 58-54, with five minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was crying for Houston to get the ball, but the Spurs
were double-teaming him every time he touched the ball. And as the
shot clock kept ticking down, the Knicks were forcing up bad shots
that were being rebounded by the Spurs, who were within 58-56 with
4:01 left in the third quarter. They tied it on a Duncan bank shot
30 seconds later.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the loose ball went flying in the corner, Thomas
saved it and delivered it to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just one of those times when his touch was amazing,''
Thomas said. ``I got it to him and he just stroked it, like he did
all night long. He doesn't get flustered by any situation.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how ominous it must seem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Allan had it rolling real well tonight,'' Van Gundy
said. ``Allan has show an ability to make critical shots before.
This time, he made the big shots down the stretch of the game that
made the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs were not at all happy with the officiating, especially
when a 3-pointer by Sean Elliott was waved off because of a foul by
Thomas before the shot.
</P>
<P>
   Popovich lost his temper in the face of Referee Ronnie Nunn, who
slapped him with a technical foul. Houston's free throw on the
technical gave the Knicks an 11-point lead that gave way to a
mini-run by the Spurs, who pulled within 5 points.
</P>
<P>
   A hot Houston helped give the Knicks an 11-point lead after the
first quarter. It was a lead built on teamwork and
unpredictability.
</P>
<P>
   Once Houston sat down, the Knicks went to Johnson in the post,
and he delivered some fancy post moves around Duncan. They were
rolling as they took a 40-33 lead with six minutes left in the
second quarter. But the Spurs' defense started applying more
pressure, and the Knicks turned the ball over on three consecutive
possessions, allowing the Spurs to crawl back into the game.
</P>
<P>
   One play in particular signified the Knicks' self-destruction in
the second quarter. After stripping Duncan of the ball and knocking
him down, Ward then threw the ball away on the break. With Duncan
remaining at the other end on the play, the Spurs' center was in
position for an open dunk. Wide open. But for some reason, Chris
Childs decided to foul him from behind and create a 3-point play
that pulled the Spurs to within 4, 42-38, with 5:11 in the half.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs were doing what the Knicks had done to little avail in
the first two games: they were hanging around.

ST. LOUIS _ On opening day, in his first at-bat, Mark McGwire
walked, bringing Eric Davis to the plate for the first time as a
Cardinal with two men on and one out.
</P>
<P>
   The sellout crowd booed loudly at Big Mac's free pass, then
several thousand rose in unison from their seats and headed for the
concession stands. Apparently, they had come only for the circus.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, albeit through no fault of his own, is ruining baseball
in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals fans, once arguably as knowledgeable and passionate as
any, still stream to Busch Stadium in droves, but they've lost
their sophistication, their appreciation for the game's finer
points. Club management, in turn, has grown fat and complacent,
seemingly content to let the Big Mac sideshow pay the bills and
reap a handsome profit to boot.
</P>
<P>
   The turnstiles tell the story. On Monday night, another 41,506
showed up, the Astros' largest road gate of the season. Everybody
here has gone dinger dingy, Mac mad. How else do you explain what
has happened to the Cards since they won the Central Division in
1996, well before McGwire strode into town and got the locals'
priorities turned upside down?
</P>
<P>
   Once again, St. Louis is mired in mediocrity because no effort
was made over the offseason to shore up a rag-armed pitching staff.
General manager Walt Jocketty's thumbs must be exhausted from all
his twiddling. Come to think of it, he should be hung by same for
letting the situation fester as it has.
</P>
<P>
   First, he frittered away any chance the Cardinals had of keeping
staff ace Andy Benes after the '97 season by refusing to seriously
negotiate until Benes was already house-hunting in Phoenix, then
Jocketty sat around last winter expecting Kevin Brown to come to
him, which the highly coveted Brown hardly needed to do what with
Rupert Murdoch's billions tempting him in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, Jocketty turned up his nose at Orel Hershiser,
Pete Harnisch and Hideo Nomo, each of whom would presently be an
improvement over anyone he can give the ball to today save for Kent
Bottenfield, St. Louis' resident 11-3 overachiever who put a
one-earned-run, four-hit clamp on the Astros in a 5-3 victory.
</P>
<P>
   After the Cards' pitchers killed them last season, they're
routinely committing additional felonies at present, explaining why
St. Louis is below .500 and 7{ games to the rear of the
division-leading, hopefully three-peating Astros.
</P>
<P>
   The one truly relevant stat isn't McGwire's 22 home runs, the
22nd of which soared an estimated 473 feet off Sean Bergman this
night before landing in mid-upper deck. Rather, it's the 5.66 ERA
the Cardinals' starters lugged into the game. That's way last in
the Central and more than two runs per outing over what their
Astros counterparts are allowing, even allowing for Bergman's
thoroughly underwhelming effort.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another negative for your perusal: St. Louis has lost
eight more games than it has won since Big Mac arrived in a trade
that bestowed an instant hero's tag on Jocketty, a status he
continues, amazingly, to enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Tony La Russa can't be deemed blameless, however.
Because the Cardinals' dugout genius (if you don't believe it, ask
him) hasn't demanded more of his GM, he deserves the pummeling he's
receiving on the talk shows _ and the firing that may be coming at
season's end if things don't change drastically.
</P>
<P>
   You don't see the Astros complaining, though. They've profited
hugely from the cockeyed value system engulfing a proud franchise
that won nine world championships and 15 National League pennants
between 1926 and 1987 with only one guy _ Johnny Mize in 1940 _
belting as many as 43 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the Cards have won with pitching, defense and
their ability to manufacture runs with timely hitting and deft
baserunning. Rogers Hornsby and Stan Musial, Dizzy Dean and Bob
Gibson, plus Lou Brock _ those were the players who always
epitomized the St. Louis style, pre-McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   Goodness knows, the Mac-nificent one can cause tingles all over.
His third-inning blast was indeed awesome to behold. It actually
proved to be the winning run as well, a rare feat despite his
prodigious numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, when the Cardinals' pitching was showing a
measure of promise, before the effects of losing Matt Morris for
the year and both Alan Benes and Donovan Osborne indefinitely
(inevitably, too, given their recent medical histories) would be
fully revealed, this three-night series loomed as an early
showdown, a sneak preview of a hot summer's pennant race to come.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, for now, St. Louis is only trying to tread water and
hope for a miraculous turnaround. Or, more modestly, a complete
game. The Cardinals still don't have one, and the overworked
bullpen has been staggered by the burden placed upon it.
</P>
<P>
   The starters are averaging five innings per outing. Even
Bottenfield, whose 11-3 record is more a reflection of aberrantly
high run support behind him than true pitching excellence, has a
mere 87 innings over his 15 starts. He went seven against the
Astros, but they carried him as much as he carried himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was as much our lack of offensive prowess,'' Houston's
general manager, Gerry Hunsicker, complained, ``as it was what he
was doing. We wasted a lot of hittable pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   By the Cardinals' humble standards, nonetheless, it proved a
rare masterful performance.

NEW YORK _ Championships are never supposed to be so very smooth,
so incredibly easy.
</P>
<P>
   You climb this high up the mountain, you come this far, and the
last leg of the journey is supposed to feel more like a crowded,
rocking subway train at rush hour, not a relaxing carriage ride
through Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   This is what the Spurs have been expecting to happen for the
past month in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, somebody hit back.
</P>
<P>
   This is the way the Spurs had figured it was going to be all
through the past month of the NBA playoffs, when they went
nose-to-nose with the abundantly talented Lakers and their youthful
exuberance, when they lined up against the strong and deep and
confident Trail Blazers and their roster full of would-be starters.
</P>
<P>
   In both of the two previous series, the Spurs took a 2-0 lead at
home over LA and Portland and then expected that the real battle
would be engaged as they took to the road.
</P>
<P>
   But first the Lakers fractured from the sledgehammer of the
Spurs' strong inside game and then the Blazers wilted in the heat
of the San Antonio defense.
</P>
<P>
   Sweep. Sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the Spurs take the first two games of the NBA Finals at
home over the Knicks, and broom sales are outpacing the demand for
air conditioning in South Texas on the first day of summer.
</P>
<P>
   However, if it was this easy, then some other team in some other
year would already have done it. Surely, the mighty Bulls with
Michael Jordan dropping in from Mount Olympus would have done it.
</P>
<P>
   Sweep. Sweep. Sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Not ever. Not this time.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks win Game 3 Monday night 89-81, and just like that Bob
Costas is pumping up the volume on the Knicks' Cinderella story
again, NBC is hoping and praying that it might finally have a
chance at getting TV ratings better than PBS and an ugly NBA season
is spared one more black eye of a wipeout in the championship
round.
</P>
<P>
   So Allan Houston gets on a roll of jump shots early and lives on
a steady diet at the foul line for 34 points and the
never-met-a-shot-he-wouldn't-take Latrell Sprewell fills it up late
for 24 points, and the Knicks make it 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   It should come as such a big surprise only because so much of
these playoffs has been such a grand disappointment, which probably
shouldn't have been a shock coming on the heels of an ugly regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks, after all, were returning home to play in front of
the loud and wild crowd at Madison Square Garden, where Spike Lee
wears his orange towel on the front row, where Billy Crystal and
Chris Rock swap jokes at midcourt, where Jerry Seinfeld fires off
one-liners from just above the court level and the players feed off
all of the sheer energy.
</P>
<P>
   This was a New York game from a New York team playing for a
hungry New York crowd. The Knicks fought and hustled and scrapped
like they were battling for a taxi in a rainstorm.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks hit the Spurs with a wave of emotion at the start,
they built a 14-point lead in the first half, and they kept their
noses in front practically all the way.
</P>
<P>
   So a 12-game postseason win streak goes up in smoke. But by no
means is there suddenly a fire licking at the Spurs' heels and
threatening to devour them.
</P>
<P>
   This was the Knicks' night, their game to show that they have a
pulse, more of a heart than the Lakers and Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they got the lightning-bolt games from Houston and
Sprewell and yet the Spurs were still breathing down their necks
well into the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   This was a game where the Spurs may have lost their composure
early or had it taken away from them by the officials. It was a
night that saw Mario Elie hit with two personal fouls and then a
technical while the national anthem was still echoing through the
building. Then Jaren Jackson came in to take his place and was
slapped with two fouls of his own.
</P>
<P>
   This was a game where David Robinson sailed around the basket
for 25 points and 10 rebounds, where Tim Duncan rolled up 20 points
and 12 rebounds and the rest of the Spurs' roster contributed
little _ 36 points and only 14 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   It was a game that saw the previously unstoppable Duncan miss
shots and turn the ball over coming down the stretch, and yet the
Spurs were always there, always lurking close enough to keep the
Knicks worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what you call this tonight,'' Robinson said. ``We
just never seemed to have our focus in this game. But we are a team
that has always responded well after a loss. We reset, we refocus,
and we come back strong. Hey, they played well, no question.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, somebody hit back.
</P>
<P>
   It was indeed the Knicks' night. But still a long, long way from
being their series.

FALATER WASN'T SLEEPWALKING, 2ND EXPERT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Scott Falater could not have been sleepwalking when he
stabbed his wife 44 times and returned 10 to 15 minutes later to
drag her into the family's swimming pool, a prosecution expert
testified Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sleepwalkers have no short-term memory,'' sleep specialist
Mark Pressman testified Monday at Falater's murder trial. ``They
wouldn't even know they had attacked a person, much less know where
the victim's body was lying in the back yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Returning to the body is simply an impossible act for a
sleepwalker,'' said Pressman, a psychologist who directs sleep
disorder centers at two hospitals in suburban Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Pressman is the second sleep expert for the prosecution, which
is expected to wrap up its case today. Closing arguments are likely
tomorrow in the 4-week-old trial.
</P>
<P>
   Pressman said several other actions _ witnessed by a neighbor or
reported by police _ contradict the sleepwalking defense of the
former Motorola engineer, whose attorneys say the bloody
sleepwalking episode lasted 45 to 50 minutes:
</P>
<P>
   _ Using a flashlight, which police found next to the pool pump
where the knife attack occurred. Pressman said sleepwalkers do not
know if it is day or night, so ``taking a flashlight would indicate
that the person is awake and aware.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Making a calming motion to a pet after allegedly not hearing
his wife screaming loud enough to be heard by a neighbor. ``I find
it hard to believe that he'd respond to the dog in this appropriate
manner and yet not respond to someone screaming,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Applying a bandage to his cut hand. Pressman said use of a
bandage involves ``a series of very sophisticated'' motions, ``none
of which could be done by a sleepwalker.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressman's opinion of the Falater case, which he delivered
calmly and clinically, directly contradicted earlier testimony by
an internationally renowned sleep disorders researcher.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Roger Broughton, a Canadian authority on violence by
sleepwalkers, testified that sleepwalking ``is by far the most
probable'' explanation of Falater's admitted killing of the woman
who was his wife of 20 years and the mother of his two children.
</P>
<P>
   Pressman's disagreements with Broughton underlined the
imprecision and lack of uniform standards in the rapidly evolving
study of sleep disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp disagreements between the opposing sides' expert witnesses
have surfaced throughout the trial. They compound the difficulty
facing a jury in a case where a guilty verdict could lead to
Falater's execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are different opinions and it's a changing field,''
prosecution expert Dr. David M. Baratz testified Monday, before
Pressman took the stand.
</P>
<P>
   One example of this conflict among experts concerns their
evaluation of the four nights of sleep studies on Falater, who was
brought to St. Luke's Behavioral Health Services in handcuffs. He
has been in the Madison Street Jail since the killing in early
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Pressman said the psychologist who supervised the study used an
inappropriate method of evaluating Falater's sleep patterns. That
expert, who was retained by the defense, concluded that Falater's
brain waves showed the instability during deep sleep that is
characteristic of sleepwalkers.
</P>
<P>
   Broughton endorsed that conclusion and the science used to reach
it. Pressman said the sleep study violated protocols that he
regards as sacrosanct, regardless of Broughton's conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is really a prime example of why you need a
standard,'' Pressman said. ``Everyone is doing things differently,
and no one knows what it means.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressman not only challenged the empirical evidence presented by
the defense experts, he also disputed their subjective
interpretations of Falater's conduct that night in 1997 and his
reaction in the aftermath of his wife's death.
</P>
<P>
   Broughton said many of Falater's actions, particularly leaving
his dead wife in the pool, struck him as illogical and irrational.
</P>
<P>
   Pressman said he found nothing illogical about Falater's actions
in attacking Yarmila Falater twice, stashing his bloody clothes in
the wheel well of his car, and changing into the pajamas he was
wearing when police arrested him shortly after 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes perfect sense if the defendant was awake and trying
to kill his wife,'' Pressman said.
</P>
<P>
   Pressman also helped prosecutor Juan Martinez make the point
that Broughton and other defense experts should have interviewed
the eyewitness instead of relying on written reports.
</P>
<P>
   Pressman said he interviewed the witness, neighbor Greg Koons,
at length. His information was vital to the investigation into
whether Falater was sleepwalking.
</P>
<P>
   Koons, alerted by his girlfriend that someone was screaming
outside, began looking into the Falater yard after the stabbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Koons really gave one of a kind, direct evidence,''
Pressman said. That evidence is unique, he said, because ``there
has never been a case where there was a direct witness of someone
sleepwalking for an extended period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   The importance of the clinical sleep studies should not be
overstated, Pressman warned, because they cannot prove that Falater
is a sleepwalker. ``The most they could show is that he had the
potential'' to sleepwalk, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pressman will complete his testimony today, after answering
questions that jurors are submitting in writing to Maricopa County
Superior Court Judge Ronald Reinstein.
</P>
<P>
   Those questions today continued the pattern of skepticism about
the defense. One juror on Monday asked if Baratz thought Falater
had changed into his pajamas after stabbing Yarmila because he
anticipated using sleepwalking as a defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a possibility,'' said Baratz, an administrator of the
Sleep Disorder Center at Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center in
Phoenix. &QL;

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Kent Bottenfield is keeping one big secret, and the
rest of the National League can only sit back and guess.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros sure didn't have the answer Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield tied for the NL lead with his 11th win, and Mark
McGwire homered for the third straight day as the St. Louis
Cardinals snapped the Astros' three-game winning streak with a 5-3
victory at Busch Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield (11-3), who never had won more than five games in a
season, tied the Astros' Jose Lima for the league lead. He won for
the third time in four starts and helped his cause with a two-run
double during the Cardinals' three-run second inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no explanation,'' said outfielder Carl Everett, who had
two of the Astros' five hits in the game. ``He doesn't have the
stuff that you would say can dominate a team. He was doing
something that we obviously couldn't solve. I don't know what it is
that he has that we're not hitting, because everything looks
hittable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we find out pretty soon, because he's keeping a secret.
He's just been going on all season.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield held the Astros hitless until the fourth inning as
the Cardinals built a 4-0 lead. The righthander allowed three runs
_ one earned _ and four hits in seven innings. Ricky Bottalico
pitched two scoreless innings of relief for his 10th save.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis, which moved within one game of .500, has beaten the
Astros three times in four meetings this season.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, well behind the pace he set in his record 70-homer
season last year, hit his 22nd home run of the season in the third
inning off Astros starter Sean Bergman (4-4). The blast cleared Big
Mac Land in the left-field upper deck and was estimated at 473
feet, his second-longest of the season, behind only a 484-foot shot
that left Dodger Stadium in May.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman struggled from the outset, never finding a rhythm, and
was gone after four innings. It was his shortest outing since
lasting only 3 innings June 6 at Minnesota. He gave up five runs
and nine hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pitched terrible. I didn't make the big pitches when I had
to,'' said Bergman, who surrendered home run No. 39 to McGwire last
season, one of five homers the Cardinals slugger hit off Astros
pitching. ``I threw too many pitches that were hittable.''
</P>
<P>
   Bergman has dropped three of his last four starts, allowing 15
earned runs in 20 innings. The righthander said he felt some
stiffness in his throwing arm and that he could notice a drop in
velocity on his pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think he had real good stuff, real good velocity, and
that was my concern,'' said interim manager Matt Galante. ``We've
seen him have much more velocity than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Williams and Scott Elarton helped keep the game close,
combining to pitch four innings of one-hit relief.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis wasted little time jumping on Bergman in the second
inning. Bergman hit Fernando Tatis, and Shawon Dunston singled to
put runners at first and second. Edgar Renteria sent an RBI single
through the hole at shortstop, and two batters later Bottenfield
followed with a two-run double to left to put the Cardinals ahead
3-0.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire made the score 4-0 with his solo home run. The first
baseman went 1-for-4 and is batting only .158 (3-for-19) in his
last four games. All three hits, however, have been home runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros scored a pair of runs in the fourth inning, one
courtesy of an error. Jeff Bagwell led off with a single and scored
on a single by Everett. Bottenfield had Everett picked off at
first, but McGwire's throw was wild and allowed Everett to advance
to third. Richard Hidalgo closed the gap to 4-2 with a sacrifice
fly to left field.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few highlights for the Astros came on defense. Right
fielder Derek Bell leaped and crashed into the wall as he caught a
drive by Dunston in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis built the lead back to three runs in the bottom of the
fourth on a run-scoring single by rookie Joe McEwing, who was
2-for-4 to extend his hitting streak to 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros added their final run on another error. In the sixth,
Bill Spiers doubled and advanced to third when right fielder Thomas
Howard bobbled the ball. Bagwell drove him in with a sacrifice fly
to right field.
</P>
<P>
   That was as close as the Astros would get against Bottenfield
and Bottalico.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not fooling anybody,'' Bottenfield said. ``I'm nobody's
ace. I'm not the type of guy like (Kevin) Brown or (Curt) Schilling
or (Greg) Maddux or (Tom) Glavine. I'm not going to throw nine
shutout innings. I'm not going to throw no-hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, he did just enough to keep the Astros guessing.

SALMON TO HONOR VOW TO LIMIT TIME IN CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
 LIMITS-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS MOESER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Rep. Matt Salmon on Monday dug up a political time
capsule called term limits, announcing that he will honor his
pledge to leave Congress after six years.
</P>
<P>
   And few, it seems, care anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The issue that crystallized voter discontent with Washington in
1994 is barely a blip five years later, a result of a strong
economy, an uncooperative Supreme Court and perhaps even greater
voter cynicism than before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dead. It's totally dead,'' said Larry Sabato, a political
science professor at the University of Virginia, speaking of the
term-limits movement. ``Despite the rantings of the activists who
tell you that this movement is still sweeping America, you can't
find anyone talking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But there Salmon was, on the steps of the state Capitol, keeping
his word, along with six other House Republicans who took the
three-term pledge in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   A seventh, Rep. George Nethercutt of Washington, announced
recently that he will break the promise and seek re-election.
Nethercutt defeated then-House Speaker Tom Foley in 1994 largely on
the issue of Foley's 30-year career in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Two others who took the pledge in 1994, Rep. Scott McInnis,
R-Colo., and Rep. Marty Meehan, D-Mass., have also broken
term-limit promises.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's other two representatives elected to the freshman
class of Congress of 1994, J.D. Hayworth and John Shadegg, did not
take the pledge.
</P>
<P>
   While Nethercutt expects a tough race and is being targeted by
term-limits supporters, Meehan and McInnis will likely be
re-elected. That is evidence, experts say, of the demise of the
movement.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason, according to Sabato, is the waning of voter
anger and resentment that began in the early 1990s, reaching its
apogee with the 1992 Ross Perot presidential campaign and the GOP's
Contract with America in 1994. Sabato attributes that mainly to a
healthy economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are good times. They're not that crazy about Congress,
but they really don't care,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But part of the Contract with America was support for term
limits, which the GOP-led Congress defeated in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Merle Black, a professor of political science at Emory
University, said Republicans who had railed against Democrats for
opposing term limits when they controlled Congress soon realized
the powers of incumbency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people have realized it's not a cure-all,'' Black
said. ``The problem is you had these new people in, and the system
wasn't changed. I think it kind of undercuts the argument.''
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. Supreme Court decision that forbids states from enacting
term limits for federal offices also helped douse the fire.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters, including Salmon, argue that it's still the
right thing to do. Salmon said he would only endorse someone for
his seat who takes the pledge. Two prospective candidates who
attended the event, Jeff Flake, executive director of the Goldwater
Institute, and Susan Bitter Smith, executive director of the
Arizona Cable Telecommunications Association, have already agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon admitted that there were times he regretted voluntarily
limiting his term, something no other current Arizona
representative or senator has formally done. But he added that
knowing he wouldn't be around for longer than six years allowed him
to be more aggressive in pushing issues, even taking on GOP leaders
when he felt they were compromising the party's values.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the idea of term limits is still one that works. I
don't know if it's as strong as it once was when I ran on the
Contract with America,'' said Salmon, who is weighing a run for
governor in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to send a clear message to the American people,
whether you're a politician or not. You give your word, it's done.
And so I hope this sends a message out to other politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Term-limit supporters were on hand to praise Salmon, saying he
focused on his job rather than spending time worrying about raising
money for re-election. Paul Jacob, the national director of U.S.
Term Limits, insists that the drive for term limits isn't dead.
</P>
<P>
   He points to 45 House members and 14 senators who have promised
to limit their service.
</P>
<P>
   ``The polls are as high as they were in 1994,'' Jacob said. ``In
the last election, we had five different states vote on term-limit
initiatives and every one passed. ''
</P>
<P>
   Jacob acknowledges that hopes for a constitutional amendment to
limit federal terms have dimmed. The focus remains on getting
candidates to take the pledge voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Goldstein, an ASU professor of political science, said a
large turnover among congressmen since the early 1990s accomplished
many of the goals of term limits through the election process.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein predicts that Salmon will get little mileage out of
keeping his promise if he runs for governor in three years. But
even with interest in term limits waning, breaking his word would
have been damaging.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could help him. There are so many others who simply will
not and cannot give up power,'' Sabato said. ``He kept his pledge
when he could have probably been re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to be the critical issue, but it'll make a damn
good TV ad.'' &QL;

SOX MAKE A CLEAN GETAWAY
</HEADLINE>
 BBA-RED SOX-RANGERS-BOS  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems equally unlikely to imagine, on a cold day in hell or
on the longest day of summer, that John Wasdin would be regarded as
Old Reliable, that the Olde Towne Team would be running wild, that
Tim Wakefield would resemble another Flash in the pen, and that
rookie Brian Rose would be as tough to beat on Yawkey Way as he was
in the South Dartmouth Little League.
</P>
<P>
   But here the Red Sox sit, on the cusp of school vacation and in
a virtual tie for first place with the New York Yankees, because
all of those elements were present Monday night in a 5-4 win over
Texas, their third straight over the Rangers and sixth in eight
games on a rejuvenating homestand.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all the surprises, there was the constant of Nomar
Garciaparra, whose parting gift to the 27,627 fans in Fenway Park
Monday night was a 4-for-4 performance, including a rally-starting
double in the second and a single that preceded Troy O'Leary's
game-tying home run in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra tormented Texas with 10 hits in 11 at-bats in the
last three games of this series, the finishing touches to a
homestand on which he hit .567 (17 for 30) and raised his average
31 points to .350, fourth best in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hits the ball anywhere you pitch it,'' said loser Rick
Helling, who saw a 4-2 lead vanish in the sixth when Garciaparra
whacked a breaking ball up and off the plate into center field for
a single, followed moments later by O'Leary's 14th home run of the
season, a 400-foot drive that landed in the visitors' bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no good way to pitch him,'' Helling said. ``He's one
of the few guys that at pitchers' meetings, you don't talk about
the way to get him out, you just talk about trying to make good
pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Such pitches were few and far between this spring for Wasdin,
who earned his demotion to Pawtucket while in Florida, but Monday
night ran his record to 7-0 with two scoreless innings of relief
while the Sox were mounting their comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be back and 7-0 is unbelievable, really,'' said Wasdin, who
picked up after Rose, the rookie who has now allowed just one
earned run in six of his first seven starts and has yet to lose,
even though Jose Offerman's error led to three unearned runs in the
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way to explain it,'' Wasdin said. ``One of those
weird years, where the moon and sun are aligned the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, who are 12-6 against the three division leaders in the
American League _ the Yankees, Indians, and Rangers _ had diamonds
on the soles of their shoes Monday night, becoming the first team
to steal two bases against Gold Glove catcher Ivan Rodriguez this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra bagged second after Rodriguez tried to pick him off
first base in the third inning but advanced no further.
</P>
<P>
   The game turned on the second steal, by Offerman, who broke for
second on a hit-and-run play with John Valentin at the plate in the
seventh. Rodriguez double-clutched, then threw the ball into the
outfield, allowing Offerman to take third after he dusted himself
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to swing,'' Valentin said. ``The curveball he threw was
really outside. I couldn't put the bat on it, so you know he really
had to reach for it. That put him in a tough place to throw.''
</P>
<P>
   Offerman, who said he took his eye off the grounder that eluded
him when the infield was drawn in with a runner on third and one
out in the sixth, was reluctant to take a bow for the steal,
apparently not wishing to make a tough task even tougher in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question about that,'' he said when asked if Rodriguez was
his toughest challenge as a base-stealer. ``We all know that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone does too well against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentin, who had been doing dreadfully against Helling,
whiffing twice and flying weakly to right, hit a sinking liner that
fell in front of Juan Gonzalez for a single, allowing Offerman to
score the deciding run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Helling pitched a great game,'' Valentin said. ``He kept the
ball away from me all night. He knows my strength is middle in. The
curveball I hit, it was a pretty good pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, meanwhile, have to like the way Wakefield looks. On
a day the Sox learned that closer Tom Gordon won't be back until
after the All-Star break at the earliest, Wakefield rang up his
third save in three nights.
</P>
<P>
   So, it's on to Baltimore, where the Orioles, once 15 games under
.500, have run off 10 wins in 11 games, and play their next six
against the Sox and Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   What to expect? If you're Wasdin, you consult the nearest
astrologer. Next full moon is Monday.

JAIL TERM FOR BURTON IN POINT SHAVING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By L. ANNE NEWELL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ A former Arizona State University basketball player
was sentenced to two months in jail Monday as a U.S. district judge
sentenced five defendants for involvement in the 1994 ASU
basketball point-shaving scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Former ASU guard Isaac Burton Jr. received three years'
probation, which includes two months in jail and six months of home
detention. Burton, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit
sports bribery, also must pay $8,000 and perform 200 hours of
community service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad it's finally over,'' Burton said after leaving the
courtroom. ``If any one of you all can get to Bill Frieder . . .
tell him I'm sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton, Vincent P. Basso, Joseph Gagliano, Joseph Mangiamele,
Dominic Mangiamele, admitted they were involved in a point-shaving
scheme allegedly masterminded by former ASU student Benny Silman
during the 1993-94 season.
</P>
<P>
   Silman, 28, is serving a 46-month prison sentence for getting
Stevin ``Hedake'' Smith and Burton to shave points in certain games
so the team wouldn't beat the point spread.
</P>
<P>
   Basso, of Chicago, received the stiffest sentence of the five
defendants in Monday's federal court sentencing, as Judge Robert C.
Broomfield ordered him to serve 18 months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Basso, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit sports
bribery, will also be under supervised release for three years. He
was ordered to pay a $27,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harm occurred first to ASU, to its fans, its sports programs
and its coaches, especially the head coach, through no fault of his
own,'' Broomfield said after sentencing Basso.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation led to the resignation of Coach Bill Frieder,
who was not charged, and stunned the world of college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Broomfield also sentenced Phoenix resident Joseph Gagliano Jr.,
a former investment adviser, to 15 months in prison, to be followed
by three years of supervised release.
</P>
<P>
   Gagliano, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit sports
bribery, promotional money laundering and avoidance money
laundering, must also pay a $6,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Broomfield sentenced former Chicago trucking executive Dominic
Mangiamele to three years probation, which includes four months of
home detention. Mangiamele, who pleaded guilty to sports bribery,
must pay $5,000 and perform 100 hours of community service also.
</P>
<P>
   Mangiamele's son, Joseph, was sentenced to 90 days in jail, to
be followed by eight months of home detention and 48 months
probation.
</P>
<P>
   Jospeh Mangiamele pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit sports
bribery, promotional money laundering and avoidance money
laundering. He was also ordered to pay a $5,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   The sentences bring the scandal, which the FBI has called ``one
of the most significant sports bribery conspiracies involving
college athletics in the country,'' one step closer to closure.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Anthony Frank are now the only two figures awaiting
sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is scheduled to be sentenced in September and Frank will
go to trial sometime in August, officials with the U.S. Attorney's
Office said.
</P>
<P>
   The group successfully pulled off the point-shaving scheme
during four basketball games in early 1994, winning hundreds of
thousands of dollars from bets placed on ASU opponents at Las Vegas
casinos.
</P>
<P>
   It began when Silman conspired with Smith to fix a game by
making sure ASU did not beat the point spread.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who told his story to ``Sports Illustrated'' last year,
could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   After the pair reached monetary agreement, Silman brought in
Gagliano. Gagliano then brought in the Mangiameles, who raised the
money to place the bets.
</P>
<P>
   Smith asked Burton to help him fix the first two games, but then
Burton did not participate again.
</P>
<P>
   After the third successful game, Gagliano approached Basso, who
asked to be included in further bets.
</P>
<P>
   The scam was discovered during the fifth game and the gamblers
reportedly lost all their bets when ASU won by a large margin.
</P>
<P>
   Basso's lawyer, David Appleton, had asked for leniency because
his client was only involved in the last of the two fixed games. He
also minimized what that involvement was.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one came in later or had a less crucial role,'' Appleton
said.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. trial attorney Corbin A. Weiss disagreed, stating, ``It
is simply not true that no person here played a smaller role than
Mr. Bosso. In some respects, Mr. Bosso's role was even greater than
anyone else's.''
</P>
<P>
   A choked-up Gagliano also asked for the court's mercy as he
talked about spending Saturday, his 31st birthday, at his
3-year-old daughter's dance recital.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is I'm sorry. I made a mistake and paid so
dearly for it already.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton, who has been playing basketball in Cyprus since being
banned by the Continental Basketball Association in 1997, also took
time in court to make public apologies to former coach Frieder, ASU
and Sun Devils fans.
</P>
<P>
   But making what Broomfield said during sentencing were the most
compelling pleas were the Mangiameles.
</P>
<P>
   A tearful Joseph Mangiamele told the court: ``I just wanted to
apologize for what I did. I didn't know this would destroy my
family and I would lose everything. I would never have gotten
involved in this if I'd have known the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Mangiamele, a former Illinois sheriff, lost his job
because of the indictments, said his lawyer, Charles Lauer. Dominic
Mangiamele's lawyer said the case has all but destroyed the
family's trucking business. &QL;

GAME EFFORT TO SAVE FACE 
</HEADLINE>
 BKN-RYAN COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They had more bounce, more zip, more oomph, more
pizzazz, more fire, more zeal, and more desperation. They knew what
had to be done, and they did it. They deserved to win this game,
the New York Knicks did.
</P>
<P>
   Game 3 at home when you're down, 0-2, is time to reexamine who
you are. There is one thing we know no team wants after it has
battled and scraped and fought for months to get this far, and that
is to be swept. That 0-4 is not a pretty thing to have on your
resume.
</P>
<P>
   There is no need to get weepy-eyed here. This is still an ugly
series. This resembles NBA basketball of the '70s and '80s as
military music resembles music, to borrow a phrase. But it's still
the NBA, these are the Finals, and this is the only (male)
basketball we've got.
</P>
<P>
   And it will go till at least Friday. If the San Antonio Spurs
are going to do what we assume they will do, it will have to wait a
few days. There will be no sweep in 1999. The Knicks made sure of
that Monday night with an 89-81 victory in Game 3 that will at
least enable them to save face.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no debating just exactly who was responsible for
this. As he did in the Indiana series, Allan Houston stepped
forward. The smooth swingman with the feathery jump shot carried
his team across the finish line in this one, scoring 34 points in a
route-going performance. He once again did it by mixing his medium-
and long-range jumpers with aggressive drives to the basket. Aided
by some friendly officiating (a few of the touch fouls he was given
had a distinctly Jordanesque aroma), he made a complete joke out of
San Antonio's big guards by getting both Mario Elie and Jaren
Jackson in quick foul trouble and then making it a trifecta by
embarrassing young Antonio Daniels.
</P>
<P>
   This was a very nice win for the Knicks, who are trying to win a
championship with no real center play. Patrick Ewing, you know
about. Chris Dudley, are you kidding? Jeff Van Gundy responded to
popular demand and the obvious urgency of his team's situation and
_ guess what? _ Camby was a nonfactor for three quarters, getting
his first field goal early in the fourth period on a flying
one-hand rebound jam.
</P>
<P>
   At one point you looked out there and got a sense of deja vu.
Check out the following lineup: Houston, Latrell Sprewell, Chris
Childs, Larry Johnson, Kurt Thomas. What's missing? A center;
that's what. And this against a team anchored by David Robinson and
Tim Duncan. If you're old enough, you recall a Knick team gamely
defeating a Laker squad featuring Wilt Chamberlain in a Game 5 with
no one on the floor taller than 6 feet 6 inches. Not to get
weepy-eyed, of course.
</P>
<P>
   This was a wire-to-wire victory, with the only tie coming at
58-all. The Knicks started out with a _ get this _ 32-point first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to get off to a good start,'' said Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt we had done a good job defensively and on the boards
in Game 2,'' added Sprewell, ``but we just needed to get some
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   The first quarter looked like an old-fashioned NBA quarter, if
only because the Knicks were actually making shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every once in a while,'' explained one astute Knick-watcher,
``the Knicks will move the ball. They will make the extra pass, and
when they do that they will also make shots. There is no pattern.
There is no explanation. They don't do it very often. There is no
way of knowing when they will do it again. But when they do it they
are a good team.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, they were hanging on for the final three periods.
Duncan started having his way in the second period, and even though
the Knicks led by 3 (49-46) at the half, there was a feeling we had
already seen the best they had to offer, and there didn't appear to
be any way they could contend with either Duncan or Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   But they did. They double- and triple-teamed Duncan throughout
the scond half and they did not lose heart when the Spurs caught
them at 58.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I told them is, `It's a long game,' '' said Van Gundy.
``We were playing with a lot of emotion, and I thought we were
playing very well against a great team. You've just got to keep
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks had been the aggressors from the start, and when the
fourth quarter began they let San Antonio know just how much they
wanted the game by forcing a violation on the inbounds pass. You
will watch a hundred NBA games and not see anyone even bother to
contest that opening throw-in at the beginning of second, third,
and fourth periods. Well, this was No. 101, and if it was going to
happen it stands to reason it would happen in the Finals, when the
stakes are highest.
</P>
<P>
   New York was leading by 3 at 65-62 at the time and the immediate
Knick response was for Sprewell to take the ball to the hoop and
sink a gorgeous lefty flipper. Duncan was called for an offensive
foul, and that's when Camby came up with the aforementioned
crowd-pleasing jam.
</P>
<P>
   New York was fine after that. The Knicks did what they had been
doing all night, which was to beat San Antonio to the long rebounds
and the loose balls and do all the things teams with a better sense
of purpose than their opponents do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our true character was tested tonight,'' suggested Van Gundy.
``This was the first time we've been behind in a series and this
was the first time we had lost two in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio now has a new experience, something they haven't
experienced in weeks. They've now lost one in a row. If they don't
come out Wednesday with a little more enthusiasm, they will be on
an official losing streak.

KNICKS REBOUND AT HOME 
</HEADLINE>
 BKN-KNICKS-SPURS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At some point, when there are no cameras and
microphones around, the Knicks will examine all the numbers from
this game and wonder, ``How did we do that?''
</P>
<P>
   More than 19,000 people in Madison Square Garden know what they
did in Game 3 of the NBA Finals. They defeated the Spurs, 89-81,
assuring that they will not be the last victims of a series sweep
in the 20th century. How did they do it? Well, you could take all
of the celebrity filmmakers, singers, comedians, and newsmakers in
the audience and chances are they wouldn't be able to tell you.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks shot like a group of guys playing ball at lunch hour,
making 40 percent for the night and an awful 17 percent in the
third quarter. No one in their starting lineup had more than five
rebounds. They got 8 points off their bench . . .
</P>
<P>
   But they never trailed, winning a game and ending a couple of
San Antonio streaks: Twelve consecutive playoff games without a
loss and six straight games on the road without a loss.
</P>
<P>
   How?
</P>
<P>
   ``Allan Houston was incredible,'' said the Spurs' Tim Duncan,
who had 20 points and 12 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Houston said Sunday that the Spurs were no better than the other
teams the Knicks have beaten in the playoffs. He played as if he
wanted to prove his point by himself. In his first 21 minutes on
the floor, he had 18 points and went to the free throw line an
astounding 10 times. He made them all. He finished with 34 points
and 4 assists. He also took Mario Elie out of the game in the first
two minutes, forcing him to pick up two fouls and a technical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to be a pain in the neck and unstoppable,'' said
Houston, after being told that Spurs coach Gregg Popovich called
him a nuisance. ``I just want to be consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   But one player's points are not going to win a game for you.
Many people can tell you about the day a young player at Boston
Garden scored 63 points in a loss. So there must have been
something beyond Houston's points and Latrell Sprewell's 24 points,
5 rebounds, and 5 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on which team you want to win the series, there are
two answers on what it was that gave the Knicks the edge. In San
Antonio, someone will certainly revive the talk of an NBA pro-New
York conspiracy. Really, there are still people who swear David
Stern rigged the 1985 lottery so the Knicks could draft Patrick
Ewing. It wasn't that drastic Monday night. But a day after Knicks
coach Jeff Van Gundy complained about his team not getting calls,
it got calls (30-22 New York edge in free throw attempts).
</P>
<P>
   Popovich said he thought that was strange, considering that the
Spurs are a post-up team and the Knicks are a finesse team. But New
Yorkers can point to David Robinson's 17 free throw attempts. They
can also say the Spurs hurt themselves, turning the ball over twice
as often as the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really outhustled us,'' said Robinson, who had 25 points
and 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   That hustle began from the start, when the Knicks took a quick
14-point lead, saw it reduced to 3 by halftime and even saw it
disappear with a 58-all tie in the third. But they never lost it.
You want a key play of the game? That was it: The Knicks never lost
the lead.
</P>
<P>
   As you can imagine, the Garden crowd loved it. Many fans here
share the same opinion as Houston: They don't think the Spurs are
that much better than the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Knicks didn't guarantee themselves a return trip to
San Antonio for Games 6 and 7, but they did what they promised they
would do Monday night. They made some minor changes (Marcus Camby
starting at center) and played as though they had everything to
lose. Duncan wasn't bad, but the Knicks kept him scoreless in the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you saw the true character of the Knicks tonight,''
Van Gundy said. ``We played extremely hard. We hung in there when
they were making runs. We were very resilient.''
</P>
<P>
   So now we are on to Game 4 Wednesday, the game that could
completely change the series. A Knicks win and the Finals belong to
anyone. A Spurs win and one of the ABA originals will most likely
have a title.
</P>
<P>
   One of the last things Robinson said before leaving the building
was: ``We take it personally when we lose. We always respond well
after a loss. Always.''

 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Respect for authority, for the law, for one's elders is the very
cornerstone of Western civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the spoiled brats of today, this is something every
American boy of my generation was taught. We had respect pounded
into our heads and into our hides, and we came to believe in it,
finally, at the exact moment our plans for partying all night long
were superseded by concern over the amount of fiber in our diet.
</P>
<P>
   We're parents, now.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have children of your own, you recognize the role that
a thoroughly ingrained sense of respect can play when trying to
keep your kids from having the kind of fun you're no longer capable
of having.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the government has failed to help us.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of engendering our youth with a genuine belief in
respect, politicians propose a phony variety.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Congress approved legislation allowing states to
post the Ten Commandments in classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the bill provided no penalties for those who
violate God's laws, perhaps because politicians are reluctant to
punish kids who'd be guilty only of following the example of their
elders.
</P>
<P>
   Why is that?
</P>
<P>
   What good is being a grown-up if you're not willing to make use
of the phrase, ``Because I said so''? &QL; 
 &QL; 
Vision in Louisiana &QL; 
 &QL; 
Lawmakers in Louisiana see the issue more clearly.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, they passed a law requiring students in their state to
address teachers and other school employees as ``ma'am,'' ``sir,''
Mr., Mrs. or Miss.
</P>
<P>
   The men and women of the Louisiana Legislature appear to
understand that respect, in its purest form, must be earned.
</P>
<P>
   Or, failing that, it can be shoved down the throats of the
insolent miscreants who now look at us as we once looked at Richard
Nixon, leisure suits and ``The Lawrence Welk Show.''
</P>
<P>
   The only problem with the Louisiana plan, which creates a
make-believe world in which children are legally required to feign
veneration for their elders, is that it doesn't go nearly far
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Why limit such a glorious piece of legislation to school
personnel?
</P>
<P>
   Why not require a proper show of respect for ALL``'' adults?
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, why limit the officially mandated appellations
to relatively mundane titles like ``ma'am,'' ``sir,'' Mr., Mrs. or
Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Adults should be able to choose exactly how they'd like to be
addressed by children.
</P>
<P>
   I've always thought ``excellency'' had a nice ring to it. Along
with all other respectful forms of address used by British-sounding
actors wearing fancy costumes in movies no self-respecting American
male would watch unless they starred Errol Flynn or Basil Rathbone.
</P>
<P>
   Or both.
</P>
<P>
   (``The Adventures of Robin Hood,'' ``Captain Blood,'' ``The Dawn
Patrol.'')
</P>
<P>
   Any moniker beginning with ``Your'' is a good choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your eminence.'' ``Your grace.'' ``Your worship.'' ``Your
lordship.''
</P>
<P>
   The word ``most'' works as well. I'm thinking here of ``most
noble,'' ``most worthy'' and ``most worshipful.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Consider our options &QL; 
 &QL; 
Nor should the options be limited to English only.
</P>
<P>
   States that hope to make English their official language might
consider exceptions to have our more worldly and sophisticated
grown-ups referred to as ``monsieur,'' ``mein Herr'' or ``el
magnifico.'' A fan of the movie ``Gunga Din'' might enjoy having
youngsters call him ``sahib.''
</P>
<P>
   `` '' Then again, many in our generation may prefer a form of
address less stuffy than ``sir'' or ``ma'am,'' but equally
respectful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big dog,'' for example.
</P>
<P>
   There are even those who may choose to resolve the issue
musically, in the manner of the great Steve Miller.
</P>
<P>
   That way, children familiar only with the crude etiquette of rap
music and grunge might come to understand exactly why ``Some people
call me the space cowboy. Some call me the gangster of love . .
.'' &QL;

   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Americans, famous for wanting their

hearts? By Jane E. Brody.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GENETIC-CODE (Undated) _ Researchers at Mount Sinai School

sleep disorders. By Erica Goode.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FEMALE-ATHLETE-TRIAD (Undated) _ Educators, coaches,
researchers, physicians and parents are expressing increasing
concern about the female athlete triad, a syndrome experts have
defined as three distinct but related problems: disordered eating,

TRADE-CONSCIOUS HAWKINS EARNS NBA SPORTSMANSHIP AWARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Among NBA class notables, Sonics guard Hersey Hawkins
is officially considered an all-around nice guy.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins also believes he's been one of the most tradable players
throughout his 11-year career. So it would not surprise Hawkins if
the Sonics traded him this offseason in an attempt to get younger
and more athletic.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he expects to be moved.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no promises made,'' Hawkins said Monday at Madison
Square Garden, where he won the league's Sportsmanship Award.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (Sonics brass) said they would love to have me back on
the team. But I know that they're going to look at their options. I
can imagine there are six or seven teams they have me going to at
this point.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the Sonics have a decision to make.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins recently decided not to void the remaining two years of
his contract, which will pay him $4.1 million next season and $4.5
million in the 2000-01 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Sonics will not say it publicly, they are fielding
offers for the 6-foot-3 shooting guard. The most recent rumor had
the Sonics offering Hawkins and the No. 13 draft pick to the
Toronto Raptors for their No. 2 pick.
</P>
<P>
   Sonics president Wally Walker denied the offer was made. He did
acknowledge there was considerable outside interest in Hawkins at
the NBA's predraft camp in Chicago early this month.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from adding a solid point guard and a strong, physical
inside presence, the Sonics have expressed a desire to acquire a
player who can create his own shot and play at shooting guard or
small forward.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins' role in four seasons with the Sonics has been primarily
to shoot spot-up jumpers and defend opponents' best scoring guard.
Though Hawkins was known as a pure shooter when he entered the NBA
in 1988, his shooting drastically diminished the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that had to do with the team not calling plays for
Hawkins. Another reason for his slide can be attributed to coach
Paul Westphal's decision to end Hawkins' 461 consecutive start
streak in favor of bringing him off the bench last season.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins, who has said he would voluntarily come off the bench
next season, insists he can still help the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're given an opportunity to do those type of things, I
can do them,'' said Hawkins, who turns 33 in September. ``Do I
think I can create my own shot? Do I think I can penetrate? Yeah, I
can do that. I've displayed that in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``If given the opportunity I can do a lot more of it. Of course,
it gets to the point now where you want to bring somebody in a
little younger and who has the reputation of doing that. I don't
have the reputation for doing that. Of course, people are going to
say you can't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins also said the Sonics must ``find some kind of way to get
some better talent'' if they expect to compete in the Western
Conference. San Antonio, Portland, Utah, Phoenix, Sacramento and
Minnesota all have made strides while the Sonics seem to be
standing pat. And the Los Angeles Lakers are now expected to
flourish with the hiring a Phil Jackson as their coach.
</P>
<P>
   Where do the Sonics fit today?
</P>
<P>
   ``Middle of the pack,'' Hawkins said. ``We're definitely not up
to their caliber. That's where (the Sonics brass) have to get us _
with or without me. The fans (in Seattle) deserve better and are
used to a winning basketball team. I think I can still help the
Sonics get back to that level. But that's a decision they have to
make.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins does not have a clause in his contract that says he can
refuse a trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would just hope they would trade me somewhere where I could
have an opportunity to win a championship or get into the
playoffs,'' he said. ``I wouldn't want them to trade me somewhere
where I was in a rebuilding process and looking at losing 50 to 60
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want that, and I would hope that they would have
enough respect that if they were going to trade me they would try
to trade me somewhere where I could possibly do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins received a bit of respect Monday by being honored as the
NBA player who best represents sportsmanship on the court. Hawkins
received 70 of 118 possible votes from members of the media who
cover the NBA. The league donated $25,000 to Westinghouse High
School, Hawkins' alma mater in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to get some recognition for how you conduct
yourself,'' said Hawkins, who beat out Philadelphia's Eric Snow,
Minnesota's Kevin Garnett and Toronto's Vince Carter.

KINGDOME SWAN SONG STARTS TUESDAY NIGHT WITH LAST HOMESTAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ As a baseball facility, the Kingdome finds itself down
to its last strike, hosting the Mariners for just six more games,
starting with Tuesday night's matchup with the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   While people have been chipping away at the dome's hard-shell
veneer for some time, not everyone is prepared to dismiss the
city's big league baseball home of the past 22{ seasons. At least
not without some sort of acknowledgment.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners backup catcher Tom Lampkin grew up in Seattle, working
the Kingdome's early years as a clubhouse boy, hanging and picking
up laundry. His own playing career has taken him to every ballpark
in the majors. The Kingdome feels like home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first stadium I ever knew,'' Lampkin said. ``Back
then, it was `in.' It was the stadium. All of a sudden I come back
and it's, `Let's get rid of it.' I've always liked playing here.
The Kingdome for years has been a fixture in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when it's gone, it will be a shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitters everywhere no doubt will offer a moment of silence when
the Kingdome has fulfilled its baseball obligations Sunday
afternoon against the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   With its short fences, extra-firm AstroTurf and superior
lighting, the dome has been good for more than a few extra home
runs and batting-average points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a hitter in baseball doesn't like to play here,'' Mariners
first baseman David Segui said. ``Sure, players don't like it. But
the consensus of the hitters in the league is this place is a great
place to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Says shortstop Alex Rodriguez, ``I love it for all of those
reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 11 seasons, Mariners center fielder Ken Griffey Jr. has
averaged nearly 20 points higher at the Kingdome than on the road
and collected 197 of his 376 home runs there. Griffey won't say how
much he'll miss the place, but he turned surprisingly angry after a
recent Post-Intelligencer story made the assumption that he was
eager to move to the new ballpark. Maybe he was just being
protective. After all, the Kingdome has been his only major league
home for 11 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everyone with a bat in his hand has benefited from
playing at the Kingdome. Entering Tuesday's action, the concrete
mushroom has served up 3,612 homers in 1,749 contests, or two per
game. The Mariners have hit 1,798, more than one per game. In
keeping with the Kingdome tradition of honoring each local long
ball, that's a lot of smoke and fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   Former Mariners outfielder Matt Mieske always looked forward to
his Kingdome visits while suiting up for the Milwaukee Brewers. He
says right-handed batters who can go to the opposite field, players
much like himself, can be rewarded over and over.
</P>
<P>
   Mieske says the stadium's tall but relatively close right-field
fence reminds him of another hitter-friendly park on the East
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Monster, anyone?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you flip the field, it's almost another Fenway Park,
dimension-wise,'' Mieske said. ``Through the years, that place has
had Wade Boggs and Ted Williams, guys who could flick the ball off
that (opposite-field) wall. Alex did it here the other night. At
other parks, you can't do that; you have to hit it over a guy's
head. It makes for more at-bats, more consistency.''
</P>
<P>
   Mieske also has noticed that balls seem to carry farther at the
Kingdome when the place is teeming with people than during batting
practice, when the seats are empty. It's as if the stadium warms up
and creates its own jet stream.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Jeff Fassero has observed this phenomenon, painfully so.
He has given up a major league-leading 25 home runs this season, 13
at the Kingdome. A former National Leaguer, Fassero has played in
the Houston Astrodome several times, and that ballpark, he says, is
far easier on a pitcher. Sure, the fences are deeper there. But the
big difference is the smothering air.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife asked me why the ball flies better here,'' Fassero
said. ``It's the humidity. In the Astrodome, it's 95 to 100 percent
humidity, and the ball doesn't fly. There's a lot of moisture in
the air. There isn't any here.''
</P>
<P>
   For his taste, Fassero says Safeco Field _ the Mariners' new
home, beginning on July 15 _ can't open soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be a lot happier over there,'' he said. ``This is not a
pitcher's ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco outfielder Ellis Burks, a Kingdome regular when he
played for the Boston Red Sox, posted some of his best offensive
numbers here, hitting .301 with 13 homers. For that reason, he
appreciated the place.
</P>
<P>
   Burks, however, is not so sure a full-time career in the
Kingdome would have been worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can enhance a career with the numbers, but it can shorten a
career,'' Burks said of the Kingdome. ``You have to look at the
stress the AstroTurf puts on your body here. My question is, how
much longer before Junior has to play first base and not center
field?''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Mieske, ``For a visitor, you're going to feel it for a week
after you play in the Kingdome. It takes five to seven days to get
the soreness out of your body, out of your knees, out of your
ankles.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering Tuesday's contest, Mariners fans have been treated to a
different sort of ache _ more losses (900) than victories (849),
though the numbers have narrowed in recent seasons. Attendance has
ranged from a low of 10,044 per game in 1983 to a high of 39,410
per game in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Mariners fans have witnessed comedic and near
tragic moments under the roof.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay hitting coach Leon Roberts was a Mariners right
fielder from 1978 to 1980, during the franchise's formative years.
The Kingdome story he remembers best was a lesson in playing the
tricky right-field corner.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto leadoff hitter Rick Bosetti slapped a ball to right, a
Texas Leaguer, which Roberts dove for and missed. Roberts chased
down the ball in the corner, wheeled and fired it _ into the
overhanging stands. The ball was deflected sideways back onto the
field, Roberts chased it down again and threw too late to keep
Bosetti from an inside-the-park homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just one of those things,'' Roberts said. ``I probably
got booed.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Baltimore bullpen coach Elrod Hendricks witnessed
something he hopes never to see again in a big league ballpark. A
piece of the roof fell.
</P>
<P>
   Hendricks, who once played minor league ball for the Seattle
Angels, was on the field chatting with an Orioles advance scout in
the stands when he was startled to see a section of the Kingdome
roof, a ceiling tile, come loose. The tile landed with a crash 30
feet from Hendricks and the scout and 10 feet from where the scout
had been seated. Luckily, the gates hadn't opened, and no fans were
inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it coming down,'' Hendricks said. ``I thought it was a
piece for the air conditioning. I thought it was insulation,
something light. It sounded like a cannon when it landed. I said,
`Wow.' The only thing I could think about was I was glad nobody was
in here.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how many hits the place has in it, the gray Kingdome
decor has excited no one. Mariners outfielder Butch Huskey calls
the ballpark fun, yet dull. Third baseman Russ Davis says the place
is plain and lacking in character.
</P>
<P>
   Safeco Field, with its modern architecture, will provide a
welcome change. Ballplayers notice these things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm into aesthetics,'' Segui said. ``That's why I prefer
Camden Yards and Yankee Stadium. They're my favorite ballparks.''
</P>
<P>
   His father, Diego Segui, tried not to look up when he threw the
first pitch for the Mariners in 1977. The Kingdome had him spooked.
He wasn't used to having concrete directly overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I get in there was a big impression,'' he said.
``I started looking around and (the) first thing you're thinking
is, something (could) go wrong, and with everything coming down,
you'll be buried in there forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners needed three seasons before they started to
complain publicly about their accommodations. On March 19, 1980,
they sued King County, claiming that the Kingdome was so small, the
home team was vulnerable to enemy home runs and would never be
successful. There also were complaints about poor lighting and
loose AstroTurf seams.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, improvements were made. Diego Segui, however, says
the mound never has been fixed, another reason why the Kingdome is
a hitters' park. The mound has been moved so many times to
accommodate football and other events, it remains soft and flat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be the flattest mound in the whole league,'' the
61-year-old Segui said. ``It's real hard on a pitcher. You only get
halfway on your follow-through, and you get a lot of high pitches.
A good pitcher in that park is a sinker-ball pitcher who (doesn't)
have to get over the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every pitcher who throws overhand, look at the trouble they
have in there. Look at (Ken) Cloude. You can pitch for two or three
innings, and it's boom, boom, boom, and you've lost it.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon the Kingdome will be nothing but dust and memories. A place
where Griffey and Rodriguez started their careers, and Nolan Ryan
and Don Mattingly ended theirs. Where Gaylord Perry earned his
300th pitching victory and Willie Horton hit his 300th homer. Where
Randy Johnson and Chris Bosio threw no-hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Where foul balls hit speakers and the Mariners fell two games
shy of a World Series. Where the wind never blew and the
temperature never changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-two years is a long time,'' Fassero said. ``It's going
to be a change for the city. But I think baseball will become more
enjoyable for the fans, the conditions more conducive to
baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Six more Kingdome baseball games. Once the Mariners get their
final swings in, the only ones left will belong to the wrecking
ball.

WILD PITCH IN 12TH SINKS MARINERS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ At least the standings should start changing.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners play their next 15 games against division rivals
Anaheim, Texas and Oakland, and their task is clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just try to catch the teams that are ahead of us,'' said
center fielder Ken Griffey Jr., ``and put the teams behind us
further behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Good games or bad this road trip _ and there were generous
helpings of both _ the Mariners were unable to do much with the
Texas Rangers. The last six days, Seattle and Texas have had the
same result, the Mariners stuck at four games behind the division
leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like for the last two weeks, every time they lose, we
lose, and vice versa,'' said left-hander Jamie Moyer, who allowed
two runs in seven innings in Monday night's 4-3 loss to the
Cleveland Indians. ``It's not time necessarily to start
scoreboard-watching, but we can really help ourselves within the
next two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   They could have started Monday night, had they held a one-run
lead. The Mariners scored three times in the eighth inning, and
were four outs away from a win. But relievers Jeff Fassero and Jose
Paniagua lost the lead, and Jose Mesa's bases-loaded wild pitch
scored Jim Thome with the winning run with one out in the 12th.
</P>
<P>
   Thome had led off with an infield single that second baseman
David Bell backhanded, but could not hold. Alex Ramirez advanced
Thome to second with a sacrifice bunt, and an intentional walk and
a single loaded the bases for catcher Chris Turner.
</P>
<P>
   With one strike, Mesa _ an ex-Indian who again was booed by his
former fans _ threw a fastball that sailed well inside on Turner,
eluded catcher Dan Wilson and allowed Thome to race home. It
brought an end to a road trip that began with four wins in five
games but ended in three consecutive defeats.
</P>
<P>
   The most energizing win on the trip was a 4-3 victory last
Thursday at Detroit in which the M's scored three times in the
ninth to erase a 2-1 deficit. After two blowout defeats, the
Mariners nearly duplicated their Detroit heroics at Jacobs Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a great ballclub,'' shortstop Alex Rodriguez said
of the Indians. ``But when you compete like we did tonight, more
often than not, that's a winning situation. We don't have the
victory to show for it, but we sure battled our butts off
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners advanced no runners past second when Indians
starter Bartolo Colon was in the game. But when Griffey came to bat
with two outs and runners at first and second in the eighth, the
Indians called on left-handed specialist Paul Assenmacher, who had
held Griffey to three hits in 14 career at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey ripped a single off the glove of second baseman Enrique
Wilson, scoring Dan Wilson with the Mariners' first run and moving
Brian Hunter to second.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Shuey came in to face Edgar Martinez, and Hunter and
Griffey pulled a double steal. That was significant, because it
allowed two runs to score when Martinez followed with a single,
giving Seattle a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that situation, I definitely am looking to catch them off
guard, so a single can drive in two runs,'' said Hunter, who was
ejected in the 10th when he slammed his bat to the ground after
striking out on a bunt attempt. ``I was looking at pitch selection,
and they were throwing Edgar off-speed pitches, as if there was a
base open.''
</P>
<P>
   The rally put Moyer in position for his eighth consecutive
victory, which would have been a career high. Fassero _ who will
return to the rotation Thursday _ started the eighth with two quick
outs, but walked Thome and got together for an epic at-bat with
Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero got ahead 0-and-2, but the rookie fouled off a slider,
then worked the count to 2-2 as Fassero threw two more sliders,
both in the dirt. Four fouls followed _ the first a long fly to
left, the last a tip _ before balls three and four. The 11-pitch
at-bat ended Fassero's night, and began Paniagua's.
</P>
<P>
   Bell had no play on a slow grounder by pinch-hitter Roberto
Alomar, and it went for a single that loaded the bases. On a full
count, Paniagua walked Enrique Wilson, bringing in the tying run.
Jacob Cruz then bounced a troublesome chopper to Russ Davis, but
the third baseman bare-handed it and retired Cruz for the out.

SPURS' TWIN TOWNERS DON'T STAND OUT IN NEW YORK SKYLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ We have seen this kind of thing before. Small-town
folks coming north to the big city just to get totally smoked.
</P>
<P>
   It was Stevie Wonder, not Billy Joel, who gave us the all-time
great New York state of mind anthem:
</P>
<P>
   (start ital)New York, just like Tim Duncan pictured it.
Skyscrapers and everything.(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   It used to be, just a few days ago, that the Spurs' human
skyscrapers _ Duncan and David Robinson _ were too high to knock
down, too tall to be messed with.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday night, in Game 3 of the NBA Finals, the twin towers
from south Texas were messed up and helpless in the face of
overwhelming obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't so much the Knicks who (temporarily) knocked the crown
off the Spurs' head; it was just being here. Home. At the Garden _
``Marcus Square Garden,'' as one rabid, leather-lunged Noo Yawker
proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's going to be crazy out there,'' Knicks center
Marcus Camby said in the face of the Knicks' 89-81 win Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to go in and give it all my energy,''
</P>
<P>
   Energy ... as if New York needed any more of the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that was Duncan who committed three consecutive turnovers
from the end of the third quarter and into the fourth. A
three-second violation, an offensive foul and a walk left this
gentle giant looking young and humbled in the belly of the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out with a lot of emotion,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van
Gundy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any team starts with belief and trust. Belief in
themselves as individuals, teammates and coaching staff. I think
good teams have that, and I think we played the game better
offensively. I think that was our true character. I think you saw
the true character of the Knicks tonight. We hung in there when
they made runs, and we stayed efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   The center of the universe: That's what it's like in the heart
of the city when any Big Apple home team is rolling toward
championship ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudy Guiliani gets a front-row seat. Spike Lee adorns his
dimunitive frame in neon rally towels. Even the president's wife
wants to muscle in on the action, donning New York ballcaps,
although the front-running potential senator was nowhere to be seen
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, ``Marcus Square Garden'' was alive with the sound of
the regulars _ some of whom taunted members of the national media
for the overwhelming news coverage that said the Knicks, after
being blown away in Games 1 and 2, were all but dead in these NBA
Finals.
</P>
<P>
   During the Knicks' percussive 32-point first quarter, one pack
of delightfully smug Knicks fans turned and offered a section of
reporters rally towels _ a mocking but understandable gesture.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who rooted for the Spurs to sweep, pay back wasn't
pretty.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first quarter, they really outhustled us,'' Robinson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were obviously pumped up by the crowd. That really helped
them. It was just a slow start by us, and they did what we usually
do. They held us off.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks had come home. They heard all the noise and the
craziness and it renewed their confidence (if it ever lagged), and
the Spurs got a feel for the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Infectious _ like some disease the busy New York health
department might have to combat _ New York fever does have a way of
working its way into small cuts and taking a vice-like hold.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it. Once it was Mark Messier who was bigger than life,
grinning that smile wide as all of North America after he led the
long-suffering Rangers to their Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Or remember how the sobbing, stunned Wade Boggs _ who is afraid
of horses _ jumped wildly onto the back of that police stallion and
cantered around Yankee Stadium that balmy October night the Yankees
won the 1996 World Series?
</P>
<P>
   New York, New York, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Even when you can't stomach the idea of the Big Apple's brash
arrogance, you can understand that big things are even bigger here.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to these Knicks, who aren't anywhere close to
big but who are apparently determined to prolong an NBA Finals that
has done little but inspire the NBA rules committee to consider
ways of cutting down on 67-point games and smash-mouth defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Until Monday night, that is. The Knicks have done what no one
but themselves wanted or predicted. They have kept this alive
because this is the city where ``Staying Alive'' became standard
operating procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played a great game. They were aggressive. Allan Houston
and Latrell Sprewell were fantastic. Houston (who had 34 points)
played a great game. They were a little more aggressive,'' Duncan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the surroundings, the Spurs should have expected
nothing less.

KNICKS STRIKE BACK IN GAME 3 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It took an abundance of bright orange rally rags. It
helped to have constricting defense and an unstoppable Allan
Houston. And perhaps the best part for the New York Knicks was the
``I told you so'' at the end.
</P>
<P>
   They finally broke down the road-raging Spurs, detouring an NBA
Finals that seemingly was headed down the path to a San Antonio
sweep.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt in our hearts we weren't going to get swept,'' said
New York's Latrell Sprewell, whose team's heart and courage
permeated the Knicks' 89-81 victory Monday night in Game 3 at
Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt we could have won a game in San Antonio,'' Sprewell
continued.
</P>
<P>
   If the Knicks can find a sequel to how they performed at the
Garden, they might earn a return trip to the Alamo.
</P>
<P>
   New York snapped San Antonio's mighty 12-game playoff winning
streak. The Knicks victory also assured there will be a Game 5 on
Friday after Wednesday's Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio still owns a 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always respond well after a loss. Always,'' San Antonio's
David Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Spurs suffered a loss in the playoffs _ Game 2
against Minnesota in the first round _ they reeled off a dozen
consecutive wins. But the Spurs, who dominated the Knicks in the
first two games, now have something to think about.
</P>
<P>
   They had been invincible away from home in the playoffs, winning
all six games, until Monday night. Surprisingly, San Antonio's
average margin of victory on the road was 13.4 points.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Knicks never allowed the Spurs to lead in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   Every time San Antonio appeared poised to snatch the game away,
the Knicks responded. Particularly Houston, who scored a game-high
34 points.
</P>
<P>
   He was clutch, too.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead 81-77 late in the fourth quarter, Houston immediately hit
a 22-foot jump shot after a timeout. Marcus Camby sank a turnaround
jumper moments later, and the Knicks went ahead 85-77 with 2:18
left to play in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Spurs coach Gregg Popovich called Houston ``a pain in
the neck.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to be all the time,'' said Houston, who made 10 of 24
shots. ``I hope to be a pain in the neck and unstoppable.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Houston was the answer.
</P>
<P>
   He also sank a critical off-balance 3-pointer in the third
quarter after the Spurs tied the game at 58. Houston's basket with
3:05 left and the shot clock running down put the Knicks back in
front. They led 65-62 heading into the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was big for them,'' Spurs center Tim Duncan said. ``We
thought we played hard throughout that whole possession and then
Allan Houston came up big for them.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Larry Johnson, whose 16 points gave the Knicks another
scoring threat to go with Houston's production and Sprewell's 24
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't any lay down and quit in this team,'' Johnson
said. ``We're still in this.''
</P>
<P>
   New York had the best shooting percentage of any home team the
Spurs had faced on the road. The Knicks, who misfired in this
series with 35 percent shooting, shot 40 percent for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a matter of better execution, and that got (their)
guys into foul trouble,'' Houston said. ``We were able to get the
ball where we needed to get it. We did a much better job of just
playing together, driving the ball and kicking it to the open
man.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks put early pressure on the Spurs for the first time in
the series.
</P>
<P>
   After spending the past two days pondering lineup changes, New
York coach Jeff Van Gundy shuffled his bench. He inserted the
6-foot-1 Camby in at center, figuring he could slow down Duncan or
Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs' Twin Towers combined for 45 points and 22 rebounds.
But they didn't control the game from the foul line. This time, the
Knicks did.
</P>
<P>
   Houston shot 12 free throws and the Knicks had eight more
freebies than the Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foul trouble is a huge factor in every game. It's hurt us,''
Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said. `` ... Certainly we need to get
our way to the line because we know they're going to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   From the opening quarter, the Knicks offense was crisp. They
played together. They made shots.
</P>
<P>
   They just followed Houston's lead.
</P>
<P>
   Houston scored eight of the Knicks first 10 points on a variety
of shots from every spot on the floor. This time, San Antonio did
little to stop the Knicks in transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really outhustled us to a lot of loose balls and
rebounds,'' Robinson said. ``It was a tough one, especially with
Larry Johnson hitting tough shots early.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an emotionally charged first quarter, which wound down
with Chris Childs' wide-open 3-pointer that gave New York a 32-18
advantage _ their biggest of the game.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the Knicks made it apparent they were not going to
be easily discarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been a series,'' Camby said. ``They only thing San
Antonio did down there was solidify home court. You're supposed to
win on your home court. Now they just put the emphasis on us. We
have three games in the Garden.''

CANCER-FIGHTING PROTEIN MAY LEAD TO ALZHEIMER'S
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  A protein that can help stop cancer by killing damaged cells
may turn out to be a major culprit in Alzheimer's disease.
<P>
   Researchers at the University of California at San Francisco
report Tuesday that the protein known as p53, well-known for its
pivotal role in cancer and basic cell biology, can trigger the
death of precious brain cells through interaction with another
substance, called amyloid precursor protein.
</P>
<P>
   The findings could lead to a new target for drug developers
hoping to find a way to block the mysterious process that robs
Alzheimer's disease sufferers of mental function.
</P>
<P>
   The study, led by Lennart Mucke and Xiao Xu at UCSF's Gladstone
Institute of Neurological Disease, appears Tuesday in the latest
issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of what we know about p53 we learned from cancer
research,'' Mucke said Monday. ``What we have here is an
interesting link between two major fields.''
</P>
<P>
   Mutant forms of amyloid precursor protein, also known as APP,
have long been associated with Alzheimer's disease and the build-up
of a toxic plaque in the brain. However, scientists have never
quite understood just how the amyloid precursor protein can lead to
the demise of nerve cells.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it appears that the normal form of APP inhibits p53 from
switching on a ``cell suicide'' process in the brain. This
protective function is absent in the mutant amyloid precursors.
</P>
<P>
   This mutant APP is the same brain protein found in elevated
amounts in early-onset Alzheimer's cases known to run in families.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier research by Mucke and UCSF professor Roger Nicoll showed
that mutant forms of APP lead to increased production of a
breakdown product, called amyloid-beta peptide, which in turn can
lead to the hallmark buildup of plaque deposits in the brains of
Alzheimer's patients.
</P>
<P>
   The new study suggests that plaque build-up is not the only
reason why brain cells may start to die off. If that turns out to
be correct, it means that preventing the plaque from forming may
not be an effective treatment in all cases of Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a drug that also aims at the p53 pathway could be an
important element.
</P>
<P>
   The p53 ``cell suicide'' process is thought to be a good thing
in cancer cases, essentially a natural system that halts the
proliferation of damaged cells.
</P>
<P>
   It's a much different story when the cells are mature, fully
wired neurons in the brain _ the elemental circuitry built up by a
lifetime of memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``In cancer, you are trying to keep this p53 pathway active. In
Alzheimer's, it may be helpful to keep it from being
overactivated,'' Mucke said.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a way to do that effectively may take a long time,
probably several years. But Mucke said the cancer research at least
provides a head start in understanding the basic biology.

GOP CHANGE THWARTED IN LEGISLATURE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By ROBERT B. GUNNISON 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SACRAMENTO _ An effort by some California Republicans to ditch
their party's winner-take-all presidential primary died in the
Legislature Monday.
<P>
   The bloodless defeat was a victory for Governor George W. Bush
of Texas, the front-runner for the nomination, shown by polls to be
the most likely beneficiary of a winner-take-all primary on March
7.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, leaders of the California Republican Party voted
for a system that would have allowed Bush and his rivals to share
delegates next year in the state's delegation to the GOP national
convention.
</P>
<P>
   But Senator Richard Mountjoy, R-Monrovia, a backer of Patrick
Buchanan, was thwarted Monday in his effort to rewrite a bill that
would make needed changes in the law and conform with the new party
rules.
</P>
<P>
   A committee meeting scheduled for 4 p.m. was postponed until
Thursday, ostensibly because the day's floor session ran so late
Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But the delay apparently was enough to prevent the bill from
being enacted before the July 1 deadline that the Republican
National Committee requires for new delegate selection plans.
</P>
<P>
   Mountjoy described his chances of meeting the deadline as zero.
</P>
<P>
   Mountjoy said the committee meeting was postponed at the
direction of Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, D-Los Angeles,
as a favor to GOP leaders _ and Bush backers _ who quietly opposed
Mountjoy's measure.
</P>
<P>
   The new system would have awarded three delegates from each of
the state's 52 congressional committees to the candidate who won
the most votes in the district.
</P>
<P>
   A block of at-large delegates would have been granted to the
statewide winner.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the plan said it would invigorate grassroots
volunteer efforts, largely missing in last year's gubernatorial
election, which GOP candidate Dan Lungren lost by 20 points to
Democrat Gray Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a ploy by Bush,'' Mountjoy said Monday of the opposition
by members of his own party. ``We're anointing him. But he is
flying in the face of all the volunteers of the party.''

   SYDNEY, Australia _ Forget the fact they're cute. Sydney 2000
backers would prefer you don't fixate on the 'roos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, but most people don't know there are 27 varieties of
kangaroos, that they're not mammals but marsupials, that they all
have a pouch. And that there's one type of kangaroo that lives in a
tree,'' the Australian mining executive explained to a visitor as
the 15-hour flight from Los Angeles approached Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``And koalas, mate? They're not bears, you know. Marsupials. Not
bears, mate.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearing the tale of his provincial-sounding countryman, Peter
Christopher buries his head in his hands and talks to the table:
``We like 'roos, but there's so much more.''
</P>
<P>
   He is correct, and the setting in which he speaks makes the
point.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher, the Olympics coordinator for the Fairfax newspaper
group, sits at Nick's, a harborside restaurant in the Darling
Harbour area of downtown Sydney. In the turning basin ahead, Sydney
water ferries maneuver. To the left are shops, restaurants and the
massive hall where wrestling, judo and a host of other Olympic
sports will be played. To the right sits the historic Pyrmont
Bridge, now a pedestrian span. A quiet monorail, carrying the
advertising of an Olympic sponsor, glides over the bridge to a
station in a waterside shopping mall on the far side of the basin.
</P>
<P>
   This has the look, the feel and the amenities of one of THE
gathering spots during the Sydney Olympics, which start Sept. 15,
2000.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike Atlanta in 1996, Sydney's is already there.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is one of the nice things: We've got this great gathering
spot that is already in place, waiting for the Olympics,'' said
Christopher, guiding a visitor through the city.
</P>
<P>
   With less than 450 days to go, Sydney is starting to tie up the
loose ends.
</P>
<P>
   By no means is the city finished and ready for the Olympic
crush, but the venue construction is in excellent shape, and work
proceeds along on redoing the airport, city streets, shopping
plazas, transit areas and other public sites.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to Atlanta four years ago would have seen a similar
construction build-up as the city spruced up on schedule for its
Olympic visitors. But a criticism of the Atlanta experience was
that downtown was not entirely visitor-friendly outside the newly
built Centennial Olympic Park, and temporary street vendors brought
an unfortunate tackiness to the affair.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney, with its famed and striking Opera House, its magnificent
harbor and its lively downtown and culture that already include
tasteful street vendors, newsstands and flower stands, looks like a
city that will keep the Olympic crowds happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have to do a lot to bugger it up, `` said Milton
Cockburn, General Manager, Media, for the Sydney Organising
Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG).
</P>
<P>
   But there's always that possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Still looming in the background is the continuing controversy
over the International Olympic Committee's city selection process.
If new problems arise, Sydney could suffer, and there's always the
fear that sponsors would back out.
</P>
<P>
   Hedging its bets, Sydney has started chopping its budget,
seeking ways to save as insurance against a shortfall later. The
latest cuts included about $50 million in funds for a variety of
programs, including a salary freeze, reduced staffing levels during
the Games, a short-term hiring freeze and some savings on Olympic
family services, such as free tickets and pool vehicles instead of
dedicated cars for some IOC family members.
</P>
<P>
   SOCOG's budget is now at $1.69 billion, about the same as
Atlanta's in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly keen to get the IOC to behave as much as
possible like ordinary citizens of Sydney,'' said Michael Knight,
SOCOG president. ``There are some bits that the IOC will be more
relaxed about than others, but in the end I think it's fair to say
that the IOC's negotiating position in the current climate is not
particularly strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the cuts, there were signs of strain between the IOC
and SOCOG. IOC Vice President Richard Pound said Sydney has escaped
the scrutiny given to the Salt Lake bid, kept secret the cool
temperatures there during September and failed to disclose problems
with the city's transport system.
</P>
<P>
   ``A touch of malice,'' one local paper said about Pound.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that mix the debate over Olympic official Phil Coles, who
was embroiled in the IOC controversy. Coles has resigned his post
with SOCOG and the Australian Olympic Committe but remains an IOC
member.
</P>
<P>
   And there are other local controversies, too. Bondi Beach
residents didn't want beach volleyball in their neighborhood, but
it made such a great TV setting that Sydney didn't want to back off
despite protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``NIMBYs, that's what I call 'em,'' one irate taxi driver said
of those who use the not-in-my-back-yard argument. ``Who are they
to tell us we can't have beach volleyball there? They ran off
'Baywatch,' too.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, another beach community did that.
</P>
<P>
   The issue seems settled, at this stage, with concessions being
made to make life more palatable for Bondi Beach residents during
the Games.
</P>
<P>
   And there are the usual concerns that rise from people who
actually live in a host city: steep ticket prices, congestion in
general, how to get to work during the Games, concern about how
their city and country will be portrayed internationally.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney is at the point many Olympic cities find themselves in
the year before the Games: lots of time spent on citizens'
complaints, construction issues, funding debates _ and not much
public discussion of the sports and the Games.
</P>
<P>
   As Sydney heads toward Opening Ceremonies, Cockburn said, SOCOG
has employed 40 to 50 people who worked with the Atlanta Committee
for the Olympic Games, a move that initially bothered some because
locals felt they didn't need any guidance from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But those feelings have for the most part disappeared, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something reassuring when you're in a room and
discussing how to handle issues and hearing those American
accents,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They have taken note of some of the issues from the Atlanta
Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had (ACOG chief operating officer) A.D. Frazier down here a
while back,'' said Cockburn, ``and one of the things that he said
he'd look at differently if he had it to do over again would be
dealing with the press. Not the broadcasters because they aren't
going to go on TV and trash you after they've paid so much to
televise the Games. But the press. He said he still has scratch
marks on his back from that experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Sydney organizers certainly understand how quickly the
international press can turn on an Olympic city, and they're doing
what they can to make sure that doesn't hapen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going through ways to cut the budget,'' Cockburn told editors
from across Australia and New Zealand recently, ``we looked at the
three bars we have in the Olympics area for journalists. We
considered eliminating those to save money, but decided that
wouldn't be a good thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Sydney's Olympic construction is proceeding
without a hitch, with nearly all venues completed on time and
within budget. Still to be finished are the Superdome (for
basketball and gymnastics), Tennis Centre, Shooting Centre,
Velodrome and, early next year, the second water polo venue.
</P>
<P>
   The center of activity is the Olympic stadium (Stadium
Australia), a striking structure that has already seen action,
hosting several sporting events, including one filled to its
110,000-person capacity.
</P>
<P>
   One reviewer calls it ``a display of structural virtuosity.''
Others say it looks like a Pringle potato chip.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium is the centerpiece of the Homebush Bay Olympic
facility. On the outskirts of Sydney, it's the central spot for
Olympic activities and home for track and field, swimming, water
polo, baseball, field hockey and other events. It's a huge sports
complex, made even more photogenic by the burying of major
electrical transmission lines to make the site attractive for the
television audience.
</P>
<P>
   One Homebush Bay stadium _ the woodchop pavilion _ won't see any
Olympic action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually quite a sport ... very strenuous and exciting,''
Christopher said.
</P>
<P>
   Like American pro wrestling?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, this is the real thing.''
</P>
<P>
   While Sydney was struggling with the Bondi Beach controversy,
there was even one proposal that sand be carted to the woodchop
pavilion so it could be used for beach volleyball.
</P>
<P>
   For those who view Sydney's beaches as some of the finest in the
world, that was the last straw in the balancing act between Olympic
needs and local desires.
</P>
<P>
   In a countdown report, the Sydney Morning Herald noted the
timeline, and the local apprehension, and asked: 500 days ``to what
precisely? The greatest event on earth or the greatest
imposition?''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are strange and confounding times for a Sydneysider
attempting to make sense of an event bewildering in its magnitude,
though many of us are yet to come to terms with the scope of the
event.''

   SYDNEY, Australia _ Forget the fact they're cute. Sydney 2000
backers would prefer you don't fixate on the 'roos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, but most people don't know there are 27 varieties of
kangaroos, that they're not mammals but marsupials, that they all
have a pouch. And that there's one type of kangaroo that lives in a
tree,'' the Australian mining executive explained to a visitor as
the 15-hour flight from Los Angeles approached Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``And koalas, mate? They're not bears, you know. Marsupials. Not
bears, mate.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearing the tale of his provincial-sounding countryman, Peter
Christopher buries his head in his hands and talks to the table:
``We like 'roos, but there's so much more.''
</P>
<P>
   He is correct, and the setting in which he speaks makes the
point.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher, the Olympics coordinator for the Fairfax newspaper

   Phil Currie's vision of tyrannosaurus is horrifying: packs of
monsters that stayed together and slayed together. Currie believes
that on top of a ridge in the desolate Canadian wilderness he'll
find a treasure trove of dinosaur bones. And those old fossils
could bolster his theory that two-footed carnivores traveled in
groups, with fleet youngsters driving prey into the powerful jaws
of waiting adults.

   Ice covers roughly 8 percent of the globe and is one of the most
familiar substances, yet it continues to confound scientists.
Unlike other liquids, water expands rather than contracts as it
freezes. And under pressure ice melts rather than solidifying
further like other substances. Writer Richard Woodley reports on
this mysterious, complex stuff that's hard to study.

   Phil Currie's vision of tyrannosaurus is horrifying: packs of
monsters that stayed together and slayed together. Currie believes
that on top of a ridge in the desolate Canadian wilderness he'll
find a treasure trove of dinosaur bones. And those old fossils
could bolster his theory that two-footed carnivores traveled in
groups, with fleet youngsters driving prey into the powerful jaws
of waiting adults.

   Ice covers roughly 8 percent of the globe and is one of the most

Unlike other liquids, water expands rather than contracts as it

this mysterious, complex stuff that's hard to study.

   Phil Currie's vision of tyrannosaurus is horrifying: packs of
monsters that stayed together and slayed together. Currie believes
that on top of a ridge in the desolate Canadian wilderness he'll
find a treasure trove of dinosaur bones. And those old fossils
could bolster his theory that two-footed carnivores traveled in
groups, with fleet youngsters driving prey into the powerful jaws
of waiting adults.

<P>
   To understand why Phil Currie stands shaking on top of a ridge
in a desolate Canadian wilderness, contemplating whether to drag
himself to the next ridge hundreds of yards away and risk dying of
dehydration or to turn back, you need to know only one scene from
his childhood: He is 6 years old, sitting at the kitchen table. He
opens a box of Rice Krispies and out plops a plastic dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
   Imagination shifts into high gear and the rest of little Phil's
life is defined in a moment by creatures that have never been seen
by humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hooked,'' he says. ``They were real. They weren't
mythology. They were the biggest, the strongest, the fastest.''
</P>
<P>
   So that is why he is here, in Alberta's badlands, with the
temperature pushing above 105, shading his eyes against the searing
sun with one hand and thrashing at blackflies with the other,
studying the desolate landscape of fissured earth.
</P>
<P>
   Currie believed the ridge ahead might be the site of a nearly
forgotten treasure trove of dinosaur bones. And those old fossils
could bolster his theory that two-footed carnivores such as
Tyrannosaurus rex and Albertosaurus traveled in packs, with fleet
youngsters driving prey into the powerful jaws of waiting adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people have thought of carnivores, especially the big
ones, as solitary animals,'' Currie says. ``The idea of 10 or so
tyrannosaurs coming at you at once is much more scary than thinking
about just one. Not so much because of the adults but because of
the juveniles. They would have been fast, nasty little animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Long drawn to tyrannosaurs ``because they were so dynamic and
came in many varieties,'' Currie is perfectly located in the
badlands that stretch from Alberta down through Montana and
Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   The area is prime ground for fossil hunters seeking
tyrannosaurs, including the 40-foot-long, seven-ton T. rex and the
slightly smaller Albertosaurus.
</P>
<P>
   The region was also once home to the sharp-clawed and birdlike
Velociraptors, ostrich mimics such as Ornithomimus and duck-billed
plant eaters called hadrosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   Most tyrannosaur skeletons recovered over the years from the
badlands have been found in isolation, reinforcing the traditional
view that they were solitary hunters or scavengers.
</P>
<P>
   To prove otherwise, Currie needed to find a site offering clues
to interaction among tyrannosaurs, which is why he tried to find
that elusive next ridge, the one paleontologist Barnum Brown had
walked along back in 1910.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, dubbed Mr. Bones by newspaper reporters early in the
century, had discovered the first known Tyrannosaurus rex in 1902.
</P>
<P>
   On one of many expeditions sponsored by the American Museum of
Natural History in New York, Brown followed the Red Deer River
through the Alberta badlands and opened a small quarry on the side
of a ridge.
</P>
<P>
   There he collected several bones from what he described as young
tyrannosaurs and ostrich mimics.
</P>
<P>
   He intended to return to the quarry, but farther downstream he
happened upon an area littered with so many dinosaur bones it kept
him occupied for years to come. That fossil-hunting ground, now
known as Dinosaur Provincial Park, is the source of many of the
dinosaur skeletons in various museum collections around the world.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to the New York museum's collections in 1996,
Currie rummaged through the basement in search of bones Brown had
collected at the abandoned quarry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brown said he'd collected both juvenile tyrannosaurs and some
ornithomimids,'' he says. ``We don't have a lot of juvenile
material, so I was pretty interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Currie did not expect to be surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pulled open one tyrannosaur drawer and said, `Hey, these
aren't tyrannosaurs! They're ornithomimids.' Then I compared them
with bones in another drawer and realized, `No, these are actually
baby tyrannosaurs!'''
</P>
<P>
   Although the two groups of animals are related, the
ostrich-mimic bones are smaller, and the jaws lack teeth _ a
feature no tyrannosaur would be without.
</P>
<P>
   More interesting, there were grown-up tyrannosaurs as well as
youngsters. The mixture opened up possibilities. There was the
chance, with a group of beasts, to learn about something that had
been difficult for paleontologists to get a handle on: social
lives.
</P>
<P>
   If the beasts died together, they may have lived together as
well, and Currie thought he had a chance to dig up some clues about
group interactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just knew Brown couldn't have excavated all the remains and
that there must be more,'' Currie says. ``So I knew we had to find
the site.''
</P>
<P>
   And indeed he did. Last spring, after an exhaustive search,
Currie and his researchers reached the site where Brown had found
his fossils. The goal of this excavation: to find out if this was a
group of tyrannosaurs from one time and place and not some random
collection of bones that had been dumped there by river currents.
</P>
<P>
   Currie quickly came to the conclusion that the bones were 95
percent Albertosaurus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, Albertosaurus is only 5 percent of the fauna in this
area,'' Currie says. ``With 95 percent, and all in the same state
of preservation, we can be pretty sure that they were together.''
</P>
<P>
   There were 10, and they ranged in size from about 15 feet long
for the youngsters up to about 30 feet long for the more massive
adults.
</P>
<P>
   The key to understanding the interaction among the tyrannosaur
youngsters and their elders, Currie says, is the different
proportions of the leg bones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legs of baby tyrannosaurs are built with ostrichlike
proportions, similar to the fast ostrich-mimic dinosaurs. So they
were pretty fast,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   When an animal is young and small, it can have long legs like
stilts. But as it gets older, it gains weight, muscle and more
bone. And it also slows down.
</P>
<P>
   A mixed group of fast and slow carnivores may have had different
roles when hunting prey such as the cattlelike hadrosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't help but imagine these young tyrannosaurs cutting a
hadrosaur out of a herd and driving it into the jaws of the big
guys,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Currie also hopes to learn what killed the tyrannosaurs along
the river. It's hard to imagine a catastrophe that would wipe out a
bunch of strong, dominant dinosaurs all at once. There's no sign of
a big flood or volcanic ash that would tell of an eruption. So
Currie is going back to the site this summer, although he hopes for
a much easier trip.

   Physicist William Harrison of the Geophysical Institute at the
University of Alaska in Fairbanks spends a lot of time with his ear
pressed against glaciers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can hear waves of creaking and groaning and cracking,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   On occasion, the noise can be terrifying. On Dec. 3, 1936,
Alaska's Black Rapids Glacier awakened with a thunderous roar after
hundreds of years of repose. A colossal mass of ice, snow and rock
_ measuring a mile and a half across and 27 miles long _ crashed
down the valley at the breakneck speed of 10 feet an hour, setting
a new record in glacier velocity as it headed straight for the
local bar.
</P>
<P>
   More than half a century later, the Black Rapids Glacier is
quiet and slow.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison and his fellow glacier experts have their ears to the
ice but don't have a clue when it might start moving again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still not sure exactly why glaciers surge,'' Harrison
says. ``But I'm really not sure why all glaciers don't surge.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is.
</P>
<P>
   Ice covers roughly 8 percent of the globe and is one of the most
familiar substances, yet it continues to confound scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other liquids, water expands rather than contracts as it
freezes; that's why ice floats in water. And under pressure ice
melts rather than solidifying further like other substances.
</P>
<P>
   After studying frozen lakes and rivers for 25 years, George
Ashton, formerly of the Cold Regions Research and Engineering
Laboratory in Hanover, N.H., and now retired, says he's still
mystified: ``There are so many basic questions yet to be
answered.''
</P>
<P>
   Such as that glacier in Alaska. When a glacier moves, it doesn't
scrape across the ground like a toboggan on a dry spot. No one
knows for certain what causes it to move at all, typically at a
languorous pace.
</P>
<P>
   The most plausible explanation is that the sheer force of
gravity causes the mass of ice to subtly change shape like cold
molasses as it slumps along.
</P>
<P>
   But other forces may be at work when a glacier tears off at a
gallop.
</P>
<P>
   ``During a typical surge, glaciers appear to suffer from a
failure of their internal plumbing,'' Harrison says.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, meltwater bubbles out from internal crevices and exits
from a natural downspout at the glacier's base. But when the
downspout is clogged, the meltwater backs up until the entire
glacier surges down the slope on a thin layer of water and
sediment.
</P>
<P>
   The more puzzling question is why a common patch of ice is
slippery.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's still controversial,'' Ashton says.
</P>
<P>
   One theory is that pressure builds up within the ice and creates
a thin film of water that greases the surface. Another is that ice
emits vapor, so that other solids actually float, rather than
slide, along the surface. A third possibility is that the top
atomic layer of ice is disordered so the atoms act like a box of
marbles and let other solids slide across them.
</P>
<P>
   Ice remains a source of mystery because of the unruly behavior
of H20 molecules. In gas form, they behave as individuals, single
and fancy-free. As water, they form a complicated, ever-changing
lattice with ties that continuously snap, reconnect and snap again.
</P>
<P>
   As ice, the molecules assume a crystal formation, placing
themselves farther away from each other, and even though these
bonds are relatively stationary, they are easily broken.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most solids, ice liquefies under pressure even at subzero
temperatures and refreezes as soon as the pressure is lifted. Hence
a loop of wire can be pulled through a solid block of ice and the
ice will immediately refreeze behind it.
</P>
<P>
   This process of regelation _ thawing and refreezing according to
variance in pressure rather than temperature _ takes place inside a
glacier all the time. But the exact dynamics of such shape-shifting
have eluded scientists.
</P>
<P>
   H20 molecules perform a host of other tricks when they bond
together as ice. To begin with, the molecular structure expands by
a volume of 9 percent as it freezes, creating a solid bigger and
lighter than water. Plus, in the process of bonding, the molecules
force out other substances.
</P>
<P>
   As seawater freezes, the ice crystals expel droplets of
concentrated brine that are eventually pulled down by gravity into
the water below, leaving the ice at the top 99 percent pure. In
fact, Eskimos depend on sea ice as their source of fresh water.
</P>
<P>
   Pure ice is transparent, but the air bubbles in fresh snow
reflect light, a fact that is essential to life as we know it.
</P>
<P>
   Antarctica receives more sun radiation than anywhere else on
Earth, yet the temperatures are so cold and the ice cap so
reflective that minimal ice melt occurs each summer. Otherwise, the
water levels of the oceans would rise by 250 feet and engulf most
of the world's great cities.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ice particles in the upper atmosphere reflect and
absorb solar radiation, acting as a global thermostat and keeping
Earth from burning to a crisp or freezing over.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have recently discovered, however, that atmospheric
ice may not be an entirely benign force. Although
chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, have been blamed for the destruction
of ozone, they actually do little harm until they come into contact
with ice particles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ice clouds were previously considered chemically inert,'' says
Nobel laureate Mario Molina, an atmospheric scientist at MIT. ``But
we found that ice actually speeds up the destruction of the ozone
layer, because chemical reactions take place on and with ice
particles.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Ashton views ice as a continuing source of
fascination and frustration. After spending most of his adult life
trying to figure out the details of how and why ice rots from the
bottom up, he still profoundly distrusts frozen rivers and offers
simple advice to anyone who ventures onto ice in the springtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a metal rod and stick it into the ice in front of you. If
water comes out, turn around and go _ run!

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   To understand why Phil Currie stands shaking on top of a ridge
in a desolate Canadian wilderness, contemplating whether to drag
himself to the next ridge hundreds of yards away and risk dying of
dehydration or to turn back, you need to know only one scene from
his childhood: He is 6 years old, sitting at the kitchen table. He
opens a box of Rice Krispies and out plops a plastic dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
   Imagination shifts into high gear and the rest of little Phil's
life is defined in a moment by creatures that have never been seen
by humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hooked,'' he says. ``They were real. They weren't
mythology. They were the biggest, the strongest, the fastest.''
</P>
<P>
   So that is why he is here, in Alberta's badlands, with the
temperature pushing above 105, shading his eyes against the searing
sun with one hand and thrashing at blackflies with the other,
studying the desolate landscape of fissured earth.
</P>
<P>
   Currie believed the ridge ahead might be the site of a nearly
forgotten treasure trove of dinosaur bones. And those old fossils
could bolster his theory that two-footed carnivores such as
Tyrannosaurus rex and Albertosaurus traveled in packs, with fleet
youngsters driving prey into the powerful jaws of waiting adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people have thought of carnivores, especially the big
ones, as solitary animals,'' Currie says. ``The idea of 10 or so
tyrannosaurs coming at you at once is much more scary than thinking
about just one. Not so much because of the adults but because of
the juveniles. They would have been fast, nasty little animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Long drawn to tyrannosaurs ``because they were so dynamic and
came in many varieties,'' Currie is perfectly located in the
badlands that stretch from Alberta down through Montana and
Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   The area is prime ground for fossil hunters seeking
tyrannosaurs, including the 40-foot-long, seven-ton T. rex and the
slightly smaller Albertosaurus.
</P>
<P>
   The region was also once home to the sharp-clawed and birdlike
Velociraptors, ostrich mimics such as Ornithomimus and duck-billed
plant eaters called hadrosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   Most tyrannosaur skeletons recovered over the years from the
badlands have been found in isolation, reinforcing the traditional
view that they were solitary hunters or scavengers.
</P>
<P>
   To prove otherwise, Currie needed to find a site offering clues
to interaction among tyrannosaurs, which is why he tried to find
that elusive next ridge, the one paleontologist Barnum Brown had
walked along back in 1910.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, dubbed Mr. Bones by newspaper reporters early in the
century, had discovered the first known Tyrannosaurus rex in 1902.
</P>
<P>
   On one of many expeditions sponsored by the American Museum of
Natural History in New York, Brown followed the Red Deer River
through the Alberta badlands and opened a small quarry on the side
of a ridge.
</P>
<P>
   There he collected several bones from what he described as young
tyrannosaurs and ostrich mimics.
</P>
<P>
   He intended to return to the quarry, but farther downstream he
happened upon an area littered with so many dinosaur bones it kept
him occupied for years to come. That fossil-hunting ground, now
known as Dinosaur Provincial Park, is the source of many of the
dinosaur skeletons in various museum collections around the world.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to the New York museum's collections in 1996,
Currie rummaged through the basement in search of bones Brown had
collected at the abandoned quarry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brown said he'd collected both juvenile tyrannosaurs and some
ornithomimids,'' he says. ``We don't have a lot of juvenile
material, so I was pretty interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Currie did not expect to be surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pulled open one tyrannosaur drawer and said, `Hey, these
aren't tyrannosaurs! They're ornithomimids.' Then I compared them
with bones in another drawer and realized, `No, these are actually
baby tyrannosaurs!'''
</P>
<P>
   Although the two groups of animals are related, the
ostrich-mimic bones are smaller, and the jaws lack teeth _ a
feature no tyrannosaur would be without.
</P>
<P>
   More interesting, there were grown-up tyrannosaurs as well as
youngsters. The mixture opened up possibilities. There was the
chance, with a group of beasts, to learn about something that had
been difficult for paleontologists to get a handle on: social
lives.
</P>
<P>
   If the beasts died together, they may have lived together as
well, and Currie thought he had a chance to dig up some clues about
group interactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just knew Brown couldn't have excavated all the remains and
that there must be more,'' Currie says. ``So I knew we had to find
the site.''
</P>
<P>
   And indeed he did. Last spring, after an exhaustive search,
Currie and his researchers reached the site where Brown had found
his fossils. The goal of this excavation: to find out if this was a
group of tyrannosaurs from one time and place and not some random
collection of bones that had been dumped there by river currents.
</P>
<P>
   Currie quickly came to the conclusion that the bones were 95
percent Albertosaurus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, Albertosaurus is only 5 percent of the fauna in this
area,'' Currie says. ``With 95 percent, and all in the same state
of preservation, we can be pretty sure that they were together.''
</P>
<P>
   There were 10, and they ranged in size from about 15 feet long
for the youngsters up to about 30 feet long for the more massive
adults.
</P>
<P>
   The key to understanding the interaction among the tyrannosaur
youngsters and their elders, Currie says, is the different
proportions of the leg bones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legs of baby tyrannosaurs are built with ostrichlike
proportions, similar to the fast ostrich-mimic dinosaurs. So they
were pretty fast,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   When an animal is young and small, it can have long legs like
stilts. But as it gets older, it gains weight, muscle and more
bone. And it also slows down.
</P>
<P>
   A mixed group of fast and slow carnivores may have had different
roles when hunting prey such as the cattlelike hadrosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't help but imagine these young tyrannosaurs cutting a
hadrosaur out of a herd and driving it into the jaws of the big
guys,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Currie also hopes to learn what killed the tyrannosaurs along
the river. It's hard to imagine a catastrophe that would wipe out a
bunch of strong, dominant dinosaurs all at once. There's no sign of
a big flood or volcanic ash that would tell of an eruption. So
Currie is going back to the site this summer, although he hopes for
a much easier trip.

   ``Most people have thought of carnivores, especially the big
ones, as solitary animals,'' Currie says. ``The idea of 10 or so
tyrannosaurs coming at you at once is much more scary than thinking
about just one. Not so much because of the adults but because of
the juveniles. They would have been fast, nasty little animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Long drawn to tyrannosaurs ``because they were so dynamic and
came in many varieties,'' Currie is perfectly located in the
badlands that stretch from Alberta down through Montana and
Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   The area is prime ground for fossil hunters seeking
tyrannosaurs, including the 40-foot-long, seven-ton T. rex and the
slightly smaller Albertosaurus.
</P>
<P>
   The region was also once home to the sharp-clawed and birdlike
Velociraptors, ostrich mimics such as Ornithomimus and duck-billed
plant eaters called hadrosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   Most tyrannosaur skeletons recovered over the years from the
badlands have been found in isolation, reinforcing the traditional
view that they were solitary hunters or scavengers.
</P>
<P>
   To prove otherwise, Currie needed to find a site offering clues
to interaction among tyrannosaurs, which is why he tried to find
that elusive next ridge, the one paleontologist Barnum Brown had
walked along back in 1910.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, dubbed Mr. Bones by newspaper reporters early in the
century, had discovered the first known Tyrannosaurus rex in 1902.
</P>
<P>
   On one of many expeditions sponsored by the American Museum of
Natural History in New York, Brown followed the Red Deer River
through the Alberta badlands and opened a small quarry on the side
of a ridge.
</P>
<P>
   There he collected several bones from what he described as young
tyrannosaurs and ostrich mimics.
</P>
<P>
   He intended to return to the quarry, but farther downstream he
happened upon an area littered with so many dinosaur bones it kept
him occupied for years to come. That fossil-hunting ground, now
known as Dinosaur Provincial Park, is the source of many of the
dinosaur skeletons in various museum collections around the world.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to the New York museum's collections in 1996,
Currie rummaged through the basement in search of bones Brown had
collected at the abandoned quarry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brown said he'd collected both juvenile tyrannosaurs and some
ornithomimids,'' he says. ``We don't have a lot of juvenile
material, so I was pretty interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Currie did not expect to be surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pulled open one tyrannosaur drawer and said, `Hey, these
aren't tyrannosaurs! They're ornithomimids.' Then I compared them
with bones in another drawer and realized, `No, these are actually
baby tyrannosaurs!'''
</P>
<P>
   Although the two groups of animals are related, the
ostrich-mimic bones are smaller, and the jaws lack teeth _ a
feature no tyrannosaur would be without.
</P>
<P>
   More interesting, there were grown-up tyrannosaurs as well as
youngsters. The mixture opened up possibilities. There was the
chance, with a group of beasts, to learn about something that had
been difficult for paleontologists to get a handle on: social
lives.
</P>
<P>
   If the beasts died together, they may have lived together as
well, and Currie thought he had a chance to dig up some clues about
group interactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just knew Brown couldn't have excavated all the remains and
that there must be more,'' Currie says. ``So I knew we had to find
the site.''
</P>
<P>
   And indeed he did. Last spring, after an exhaustive search,
Currie and his researchers reached the site where Brown had found
his fossils. The goal of this excavation: to find out if this was a
group of tyrannosaurs from one time and place and not some random
collection of bones that had been dumped there by river currents.
</P>
<P>
   Currie quickly came to the conclusion that the bones were 95
percent Albertosaurus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, Albertosaurus is only 5 percent of the fauna in this
area,'' Currie says. ``With 95 percent, and all in the same state
of preservation, we can be pretty sure that they were together.''
</P>
<P>
   There were 10, and they ranged in size from about 15 feet long
for the youngsters up to about 30 feet long for the more massive
adults.
</P>
<P>
   The key to understanding the interaction among the tyrannosaur
youngsters and their elders, Currie says, is the different
proportions of the leg bones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legs of baby tyrannosaurs are built with ostrichlike
proportions, similar to the fast ostrich-mimic dinosaurs. So they
were pretty fast,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   When an animal is young and small, it can have long legs like
stilts. But as it gets older, it gains weight, muscle and more
bone. And it also slows down.
</P>
<P>
   A mixed group of fast and slow carnivores may have had different
roles when hunting prey such as the cattlelike hadrosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't help but imagine these young tyrannosaurs cutting a
hadrosaur out of a herd and driving it into the jaws of the big
guys,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Currie also hopes to learn what killed the tyrannosaurs along
the river. It's hard to imagine a catastrophe that would wipe out a
bunch of strong, dominant dinosaurs all at once. There's no sign of
a big flood or volcanic ash that would tell of an eruption. So
Currie is going back to the site this summer, although he hopes for
a much easier trip.

<P>
   Physicist William Harrison of the Geophysical Institute at the
University of Alaska in Fairbanks spends a lot of time with his ear
pressed against glaciers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can hear waves of creaking and groaning and cracking,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   On occasion, the noise can be terrifying. On Dec. 3, 1936,
Alaska's Black Rapids Glacier awakened with a thunderous roar after
hundreds of years of repose. A colossal mass of ice, snow and rock
_ measuring a mile and a half across and 27 miles long _ crashed
down the valley at the breakneck speed of 10 feet an hour, setting
a new record in glacier velocity as it headed straight for the
local bar.
</P>
<P>
   More than half a century later, the Black Rapids Glacier is
quiet and slow.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison and his fellow glacier experts have their ears to the
ice but don't have a clue when it might start moving again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still not sure exactly why glaciers surge,'' Harrison
says. ``But I'm really not sure why all glaciers don't surge.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is.
</P>
<P>
   Ice covers roughly 8 percent of the globe and is one of the most
familiar substances, yet it continues to confound scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other liquids, water expands rather than contracts as it
freezes; that's why ice floats in water. And under pressure ice
melts rather than solidifying further like other substances.
</P>
<P>
   After studying frozen lakes and rivers for 25 years, George
Ashton, formerly of the Cold Regions Research and Engineering
Laboratory in Hanover, N.H., and now retired, says he's still
mystified: ``There are so many basic questions yet to be
answered.''
</P>
<P>
   Such as that glacier in Alaska. When a glacier moves, it doesn't
scrape across the ground like a toboggan on a dry spot. No one
knows for certain what causes it to move at all, typically at a
languorous pace.
</P>
<P>
   The most plausible explanation is that the sheer force of
gravity causes the mass of ice to subtly change shape like cold
molasses as it slumps along.
</P>
<P>
   But other forces may be at work when a glacier tears off at a
gallop.
</P>
<P>
   ``During a typical surge, glaciers appear to suffer from a
failure of their internal plumbing,'' Harrison says.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, meltwater bubbles out from internal crevices and exits
from a natural downspout at the glacier's base. But when the
downspout is clogged, the meltwater backs up until the entire
glacier surges down the slope on a thin layer of water and
sediment.
</P>
<P>
   The more puzzling question is why a common patch of ice is
slippery.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's still controversial,'' Ashton says.
</P>
<P>
   One theory is that pressure builds up within the ice and creates
a thin film of water that greases the surface. Another is that ice
emits vapor, so that other solids actually float, rather than
slide, along the surface. A third possibility is that the top
atomic layer of ice is disordered so the atoms act like a box of
marbles and let other solids slide across them.
</P>
<P>
   Ice remains a source of mystery because of the unruly behavior
of H20 molecules. In gas form, they behave as individuals, single
and fancy-free. As water, they form a complicated, ever-changing
lattice with ties that continuously snap, reconnect and snap again.
</P>
<P>
   As ice, the molecules assume a crystal formation, placing
themselves farther away from each other, and even though these
bonds are relatively stationary, they are easily broken.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most solids, ice liquefies under pressure even at subzero
temperatures and refreezes as soon as the pressure is lifted. Hence
a loop of wire can be pulled through a solid block of ice and the
ice will immediately refreeze behind it.
</P>
<P>
   This process of regelation _ thawing and refreezing according to
variance in pressure rather than temperature _ takes place inside a
glacier all the time. But the exact dynamics of such shape-shifting
have eluded scientists.
</P>
<P>
   H20 molecules perform a host of other tricks when they bond
together as ice. To begin with, the molecular structure expands by
a volume of 9 percent as it freezes, creating a solid bigger and
lighter than water. Plus, in the process of bonding, the molecules
force out other substances.
</P>
<P>
   As seawater freezes, the ice crystals expel droplets of
concentrated brine that are eventually pulled down by gravity into
the water below, leaving the ice at the top 99 percent pure. In
fact, Eskimos depend on sea ice as their source of fresh water.
</P>
<P>
   Pure ice is transparent, but the air bubbles in fresh snow
reflect light, a fact that is essential to life as we know it.
</P>
<P>
   Antarctica receives more sun radiation than anywhere else on
Earth, yet the temperatures are so cold and the ice cap so
reflective that minimal ice melt occurs each summer. Otherwise, the
water levels of the oceans would rise by 250 feet and engulf most
of the world's great cities.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ice particles in the upper atmosphere reflect and
absorb solar radiation, acting as a global thermostat and keeping
Earth from burning to a crisp or freezing over.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have recently discovered, however, that atmospheric
ice may not be an entirely benign force. Although
chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, have been blamed for the destruction
of ozone, they actually do little harm until they come into contact
with ice particles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ice clouds were previously considered chemically inert,'' says
Nobel laureate Mario Molina, an atmospheric scientist at MIT. ``But
we found that ice actually speeds up the destruction of the ozone
layer, because chemical reactions take place on and with ice
particles.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Ashton views ice as a continuing source of
fascination and frustration. After spending most of his adult life
trying to figure out the details of how and why ice rots from the
bottom up, he still profoundly distrusts frozen rivers and offers
simple advice to anyone who ventures onto ice in the springtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a metal rod and stick it into the ice in front of you. If
water comes out, turn around and go _ run!

 By JOSH FISCHMAN  
 c.1999 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   To understand why Phil Currie stands shaking on top of a ridge
in a desolate Canadian wilderness, contemplating whether to drag
himself to the next ridge hundreds of yards away and risk dying of
dehydration or to turn back, you need to know only one scene from
his childhood: He is 6 years old, sitting at the kitchen table. He
opens a box of Rice Krispies and out plops a plastic dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
   Imagination shifts into high gear and the rest of little Phil's
life is defined in a moment by creatures that have never been seen
by humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hooked,'' he says. ``They were real. They weren't
mythology. They were the biggest, the strongest, the fastest.''
</P>
<P>
   So that is why he is here, in Alberta's badlands, with the
temperature pushing above 105, shading his eyes against the searing
sun with one hand and thrashing at blackflies with the other,
studying the desolate landscape of fissured earth.
</P>
<P>
   Currie believed the ridge ahead might be the site of a nearly
forgotten treasure trove of dinosaur bones. And those old fossils
could bolster his theory that two-footed carnivores such as
Tyrannosaurus rex and Albertosaurus traveled in packs, with fleet
youngsters driving prey into the powerful jaws of waiting adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people have thought of carnivores, especially the big
ones, as solitary animals,'' Currie says. ``The idea of 10 or so
tyrannosaurs coming at you at once is much more scary than thinking
about just one. Not so much because of the adults but because of
the juveniles. They would have been fast, nasty little animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Long drawn to tyrannosaurs ``because they were so dynamic and
came in many varieties,'' Currie is perfectly located in the
badlands that stretch from Alberta down through Montana and
Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   The area is prime ground for fossil hunters seeking
tyrannosaurs, including the 40-foot-long, seven-ton T. rex and the
slightly smaller Albertosaurus.
</P>
<P>
   The region was also once home to the sharp-clawed and birdlike
Velociraptors, ostrich mimics such as Ornithomimus and duck-billed
plant eaters called hadrosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   Most tyrannosaur skeletons recovered over the years from the
badlands have been found in isolation, reinforcing the traditional
view that they were solitary hunters or scavengers.
</P>
<P>
   To prove otherwise, Currie needed to find a site offering clues
to interaction among tyrannosaurs, which is why he tried to find
that elusive next ridge, the one paleontologist Barnum Brown had
walked along back in 1910.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, dubbed Mr. Bones by newspaper reporters early in the
century, had discovered the first known Tyrannosaurus rex in 1902.
</P>
<P>
   On one of many expeditions sponsored by the American Museum of
Natural History in New York, Brown followed the Red Deer River
through the Alberta badlands and opened a small quarry on the side
of a ridge.
</P>
<P>
   There he collected several bones from what he described as young
tyrannosaurs and ostrich mimics.
</P>
<P>
   He intended to return to the quarry, but farther downstream he
happened upon an area littered with so many dinosaur bones it kept
him occupied for years to come. That fossil-hunting ground, now
known as Dinosaur Provincial Park, is the source of many of the
dinosaur skeletons in various museum collections around the world.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to the New York museum's collections in 1996,
Currie rummaged through the basement in search of bones Brown had
collected at the abandoned quarry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brown said he'd collected both juvenile tyrannosaurs and some
ornithomimids,'' he says. ``We don't have a lot of juvenile
material, so I was pretty interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Currie did not expect to be surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pulled open one tyrannosaur drawer and said, `Hey, these
aren't tyrannosaurs! They're ornithomimids.' Then I compared them
with bones in another drawer and realized, `No, these are actually
baby tyrannosaurs!'''
</P>
<P>
   Although the two groups of animals are related, the
ostrich-mimic bones are smaller, and the jaws lack teeth _ a
feature no tyrannosaur would be without.
</P>
<P>
   More interesting, there were grown-up tyrannosaurs as well as
youngsters. The mixture opened up possibilities. There was the
chance, with a group of beasts, to learn about something that had
been difficult for paleontologists to get a handle on: social
lives.
</P>
<P>
   If the beasts died together, they may have lived together as
well, and Currie thought he had a chance to dig up some clues about
group interactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just knew Brown couldn't have excavated all the remains and
that there must be more,'' Currie says. ``So I knew we had to find
the site.''
</P>
<P>
   And indeed he did. Last spring, after an exhaustive search,
Currie and his researchers reached the site where Brown had found
his fossils. The goal of this excavation: to find out if this was a
group of tyrannosaurs from one time and place and not some random
collection of bones that had been dumped there by river currents.
</P>
<P>
   Currie quickly came to the conclusion that the bones were 95
percent Albertosaurus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, Albertosaurus is only 5 percent of the fauna in this
area,'' Currie says. ``With 95 percent, and all in the same state
of preservation, we can be pretty sure that they were together.''
</P>
<P>
   There were 10, and they ranged in size from about 15 feet long
for the youngsters up to about 30 feet long for the more massive
adults.
</P>
<P>
   The key to understanding the interaction among the tyrannosaur
youngsters and their elders, Currie says, is the different
proportions of the leg bones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legs of baby tyrannosaurs are built with ostrichlike
proportions, similar to the fast ostrich-mimic dinosaurs. So they
were pretty fast,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   When an animal is young and small, it can have long legs like
stilts. But as it gets older, it gains weight, muscle and more
bone. And it also slows down.
</P>
<P>
   A mixed group of fast and slow carnivores may have had different
roles when hunting prey such as the cattlelike hadrosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't help but imagine these young tyrannosaurs cutting a
hadrosaur out of a herd and driving it into the jaws of the big
guys,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Currie also hopes to learn what killed the tyrannosaurs along
the river. It's hard to imagine a catastrophe that would wipe out a
bunch of strong, dominant dinosaurs all at once. There's no sign of
a big flood or volcanic ash that would tell of an eruption. So
Currie is going back to the site this summer, although he hopes for
a much easier trip.

<P>
   To understand why Phil Currie stands shaking on top of a ridge
in a desolate Canadian wilderness, contemplating whether to drag
himself to the next ridge hundreds of yards away and risk dying of
dehydration or to turn back, you need to know only one scene from
his childhood: He is 6 years old, sitting at the kitchen table. He
opens a box of Rice Krispies and out plops a plastic dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
   Imagination shifts into high gear and the rest of little Phil's
life is defined in a moment by creatures that have never been seen
by humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hooked,'' he says. ``They were real. They weren't
mythology. They were the biggest, the strongest, the fastest.''
</P>
<P>
   So that is why he is here, in Alberta's badlands, with the
temperature pushing above 105, shading his eyes against the searing
sun with one hand and thrashing at blackflies with the other,
studying the desolate landscape of fissured earth.
</P>
<P>
   Currie believed the ridge ahead might be the site of a nearly
forgotten treasure trove of dinosaur bones. And those old fossils
could bolster his theory that two-footed carnivores such as
Tyrannosaurus rex and Albertosaurus traveled in packs, with fleet
youngsters driving prey into the powerful jaws of waiting adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people have thought of carnivores, especially the big
ones, as solitary animals,'' Currie says. ``The idea of 10 or so
tyrannosaurs coming at you at once is much more scary than thinking
about just one. Not so much because of the adults but because of
the juveniles. They would have been fast, nasty little animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Long drawn to tyrannosaurs ``because they were so dynamic and
came in many varieties,'' Currie is perfectly located in the
badlands that stretch from Alberta down through Montana and
Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   The area is prime ground for fossil hunters seeking
tyrannosaurs, including the 40-foot-long, seven-ton T. rex and the
slightly smaller Albertosaurus.
</P>
<P>
   The region was also once home to the sharp-clawed and birdlike
Velociraptors, ostrich mimics such as Ornithomimus and duck-billed
plant eaters called hadrosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   Most tyrannosaur skeletons recovered over the years from the
badlands have been found in isolation, reinforcing the traditional
view that they were solitary hunters or scavengers.
</P>
<P>
   To prove otherwise, Currie needed to find a site offering clues
to interaction among tyrannosaurs, which is why he tried to find
that elusive next ridge, the one paleontologist Barnum Brown had
walked along back in 1910.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, dubbed Mr. Bones by newspaper reporters early in the
century, had discovered the first known Tyrannosaurus rex in 1902.
</P>
<P>
   On one of many expeditions sponsored by the American Museum of
Natural History in New York, Brown followed the Red Deer River
through the Alberta badlands and opened a small quarry on the side
of a ridge.
</P>
<P>
   There he collected several bones from what he described as young
tyrannosaurs and ostrich mimics.
</P>
<P>
   He intended to return to the quarry, but farther downstream he
happened upon an area littered with so many dinosaur bones it kept
him occupied for years to come. That fossil-hunting ground, now
known as Dinosaur Provincial Park, is the source of many of the
dinosaur skeletons in various museum collections around the world.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to the New York museum's collections in 1996,
Currie rummaged through the basement in search of bones Brown had
collected at the abandoned quarry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brown said he'd collected both juvenile tyrannosaurs and some
ornithomimids,'' he says. ``We don't have a lot of juvenile
material, so I was pretty interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Currie did not expect to be surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pulled open one tyrannosaur drawer and said, `Hey, these
aren't tyrannosaurs! They're ornithomimids.' Then I compared them
with bones in another drawer and realized, `No, these are actually
baby tyrannosaurs!'''
</P>
<P>
   Although the two groups of animals are related, the
ostrich-mimic bones are smaller, and the jaws lack teeth _ a
feature no tyrannosaur would be without.
</P>
<P>
   More interesting, there were grown-up tyrannosaurs as well as
youngsters. The mixture opened up possibilities. There was the

<P>
   Physicist William Harrison of the Geophysical Institute at the
University of Alaska in Fairbanks spends a lot of time with his ear
pressed against glaciers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can hear waves of creaking and groaning and cracking,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   On occasion, the noise can be terrifying. On Dec. 3, 1936,
Alaska's Black Rapids Glacier awakened with a thunderous roar after
hundreds of years of repose. A colossal mass of ice, snow and rock
_ measuring a mile and a half across and 27 miles long _ crashed
down the valley at the breakneck speed of 10 feet an hour, setting
a new record in glacier velocity as it headed straight for the
local bar.
</P>
<P>
   More than half a century later, the Black Rapids Glacier is
quiet and slow.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison and his fellow glacier experts have their ears to the
ice but don't have a clue when it might start moving again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still not sure exactly why glaciers surge,'' Harrison
says. ``But I'm really not sure why all glaciers don't surge.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is.
</P>
<P>
   Ice covers roughly 8 percent of the globe and is one of the most
familiar substances, yet it continues to confound scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other liquids, water expands rather than contracts as it
freezes; that's why ice floats in water. And under pressure ice
melts rather than solidifying further like other substances.
</P>
<P>
   After studying frozen lakes and rivers for 25 years, George
Ashton, formerly of the Cold Regions Research and Engineering
Laboratory in Hanover, N.H., and now retired, says he's still
mystified: ``There are so many basic questions yet to be
answered.''
</P>
<P>
   Such as that glacier in Alaska. When a glacier moves, it doesn't
scrape across the ground like a toboggan on a dry spot. No one
knows for certain what causes it to move at all, typically at a
languorous pace.
</P>
<P>
   The most plausible explanation is that the sheer force of
gravity causes the mass of ice to subtly change shape like cold
molasses as it slumps along.
</P>
<P>
   But other forces may be at work when a glacier tears off at a
gallop.
</P>
<P>
   ``During a typical surge, glaciers appear to suffer from a
failure of their internal plumbing,'' Harrison says.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, meltwater bubbles out from internal crevices and exits
from a natural downspout at the glacier's base. But when the
downspout is clogged, the meltwater backs up until the entire
glacier surges down the slope on a thin layer of water and
sediment.
</P>
<P>
   The more puzzling question is why a common patch of ice is
slippery.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's still controversial,'' Ashton says.
</P>
<P>
   One theory is that pressure builds up within the ice and creates
a thin film of water that greases the surface. Another is that ice
emits vapor, so that other solids actually float, rather than
slide, along the surface. A third possibility is that the top
atomic layer of ice is disordered so the atoms act like a box of
marbles and let other solids slide across them.
</P>
<P>
   Ice remains a source of mystery because of the unruly behavior
of H20 molecules. In gas form, they behave as individuals, single
and fancy-free. As water, they form a complicated, ever-changing
lattice with ties that continuously snap, reconnect and snap again.
</P>
<P>
   As ice, the molecules assume a crystal formation, placing
themselves farther away from each other, and even though these
bonds are relatively stationary, they are easily broken.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most solids, ice liquefies under pressure even at subzero
temperatures and refreezes as soon as the pressure is lifted. Hence
a loop of wire can be pulled through a solid block of ice and the
ice will immediately refreeze behind it.
</P>
<P>
   This process of regelation _ thawing and refreezing according to
variance in pressure rather than temperature _ takes place inside a
glacier all the time. But the exact dynamics of such shape-shifting
have eluded scientists.
</P>
<P>
   H20 molecules perform a host of other tricks when they bond
together as ice. To begin with, the molecular structure expands by
a volume of 9 percent as it freezes, creating a solid bigger and
lighter than water. Plus, in the process of bonding, the molecules
force out other substances.
</P>
<P>
   As seawater freezes, the ice crystals expel droplets of
concentrated brine that are eventually pulled down by gravity into
the water below, leaving the ice at the top 99 percent pure. In
fact, Eskimos depend on sea ice as their source of fresh water.
</P>
<P>
   Pure ice is transparent, but the air bubbles in fresh snow
reflect light, a fact that is essential to life as we know it.
</P>
<P>
   Antarctica receives more sun radiation than anywhere else on
Earth, yet the temperatures are so cold and the ice cap so
reflective that minimal ice melt occurs each summer. Otherwise, the
water levels of the oceans would rise by 250 feet and engulf most
of the world's great cities.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ice particles in the upper atmosphere reflect and
absorb solar radiation, acting as a global thermostat and keeping
Earth from burning to a crisp or freezing over.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have recently discovered, however, that atmospheric
ice may not be an entirely benign force. Although
chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, have been blamed for the destruction
of ozone, they actually do little harm until they come into contact
with ice particles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ice clouds were previously considered chemically inert,'' says
Nobel laureate Mario Molina, an atmospheric scientist at MIT. ``But
we found that ice actually speeds up the destruction of the ozone
layer, because chemical reactions take place on and with ice
particles.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Ashton views ice as a continuing source of
fascination and frustration. After spending most of his adult life
trying to figure out the details of how and why ice rots from the
bottom up, he still profoundly distrusts frozen rivers and offers
simple advice to anyone who ventures onto ice in the springtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a metal rod and stick it into the ice in front of you. If
water comes out, turn around and go _ run!

   To understand why Phil Currie stands shaking on top of a ridge
in a desolate Canadian wilderness, contemplating whether to drag
himself to the next ridge hundreds of yards away and risk dying of
dehydration or to turn back, you need to know only one scene from
his childhood: He is 6 years old, sitting at the kitchen table. He
opens a box of Rice Krispies and out plops a plastic dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
   Imagination shifts into high gear and the rest of little Phil's
life is defined in a moment by creatures that have never been seen
by humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hooked,'' he says. ``They were real. They weren't
mythology. They were the biggest, the strongest, the fastest.''
</P>
<P>
   So that is why he is here, in Alberta's badlands, with the
temperature pushing above 105, shading his eyes against the searing
sun with one hand and thrashing at blackflies with the other,
studying the desolate landscape of fissured earth.
</P>
<P>
   Currie believed the ridge ahead might be the site of a nearly
forgotten treasure trove of dinosaur bones. And those old fossils
could bolster his theory that two-footed carnivores such as
Tyrannosaurus rex and Albertosaurus traveled in packs, with fleet
youngsters driving prey into the powerful jaws of waiting adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people have thought of carnivores, especially the big
ones, as solitary animals,'' Currie says. ``The idea of 10 or so
tyrannosaurs coming at you at once is much more scary than thinking
about just one. Not so much because of the adults but because of
the juveniles. They would have been fast, nasty little animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Long drawn to tyrannosaurs ``because they were so dynamic and
came in many varieties,'' Currie is perfectly located in the
badlands that stretch from Alberta down through Montana and
Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   The area is prime ground for fossil hunters seeking
tyrannosaurs, including the 40-foot-long, seven-ton T. rex and the
slightly smaller Albertosaurus.
</P>
<P>
   The region was also once home to the sharp-clawed and birdlike
Velociraptors, ostrich mimics such as Ornithomimus and duck-billed
plant eaters called hadrosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   Most tyrannosaur skeletons recovered over the years from the
badlands have been found in isolation, reinforcing the traditional
view that they were solitary hunters or scavengers.
</P>
<P>
   To prove otherwise, Currie needed to find a site offering clues
to interaction among tyrannosaurs, which is why he tried to find
that elusive next ridge, the one paleontologist Barnum Brown had
walked along back in 1910.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, dubbed Mr. Bones by newspaper reporters early in the
century, had discovered the first known Tyrannosaurus rex in 1902.
</P>
<P>
   On one of many expeditions sponsored by the American Museum of
Natural History in New York, Brown followed the Red Deer River
through the Alberta badlands and opened a small quarry on the side
of a ridge.
</P>
<P>
   There he collected several bones from what he described as young
tyrannosaurs and ostrich mimics.
</P>
<P>
   He intended to return to the quarry, but farther downstream he
happened upon an area littered with so many dinosaur bones it kept
him occupied for years to come. That fossil-hunting ground, now
known as Dinosaur Provincial Park, is the source of many of the
dinosaur skeletons in various museum collections around the world.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to the New York museum's collections in 1996,
Currie rummaged through the basement in search of bones Brown had
collected at the abandoned quarry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brown said he'd collected both juvenile tyrannosaurs and some
ornithomimids,'' he says. ``We don't have a lot of juvenile
material, so I was pretty interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Currie did not expect to be surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pulled open one tyrannosaur drawer and said, `Hey, these
aren't tyrannosaurs! They're ornithomimids.' Then I compared them
with bones in another drawer and realized, `No, these are actually
baby tyrannosaurs!'''
</P>
<P>
   Although the two groups of animals are related, the
ostrich-mimic bones are smaller, and the jaws lack teeth _ a
feature no tyrannosaur would be without.
</P>
<P>
   More interesting, there were grown-up tyrannosaurs as well as
youngsters. The mixture opened up possibilities. There was the
chance, with a group of beasts, to learn about something that had
been difficult for paleontologists to get a handle on: social
lives.
</P>
<P>
   If the beasts died together, they may have lived together as
well, and Currie thought he had a chance to dig up some clues about
group interactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just knew Brown couldn't have excavated all the remains and
that there must be more,'' Currie says. ``So I knew we had to find
the site.''
</P>
<P>
   And indeed he did. Last spring, after an exhaustive search,
Currie and his researchers reached the site where Brown had found
his fossils. The goal of this excavation: to find out if this was a
group of tyrannosaurs from one time and place and not some random
collection of bones that had been dumped there by river currents.
</P>
<P>
   Currie quickly came to the conclusion that the bones were 95
percent Albertosaurus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, Albertosaurus is only 5 percent of the fauna in this
area,'' Currie says. ``With 95 percent, and all in the same state
of preservation, we can be pretty sure that they were together.''
</P>
<P>
   There were 10, and they ranged in size from about 15 feet long
for the youngsters up to about 30 feet long for the more massive
adults.
</P>
<P>
   The key to understanding the interaction among the tyrannosaur
youngsters and their elders, Currie says, is the different
proportions of the leg bones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legs of baby tyrannosaurs are built with ostrichlike
proportions, similar to the fast ostrich-mimic dinosaurs. So they
were pretty fast,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   When an animal is young and small, it can have long legs like
stilts. But as it gets older, it gains weight, muscle and more
bone. And it also slows down.
</P>
<P>
   A mixed group of fast and slow carnivores may have had different
roles when hunting prey such as the cattlelike hadrosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't help but imagine these young tyrannosaurs cutting a
hadrosaur out of a herd and driving it into the jaws of the big
guys,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Currie also hopes to learn what killed the tyrannosaurs along
the river. It's hard to imagine a catastrophe that would wipe out a
bunch of strong, dominant dinosaurs all at once. There's no sign of
a big flood or volcanic ash that would tell of an eruption. So
Currie is going back to the site this summer, although he hopes for
a much easier trip.

<P>
   Physicist William Harrison of the Geophysical Institute at the
University of Alaska in Fairbanks spends a lot of time with his ear
pressed against glaciers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can hear waves of creaking and groaning and cracking,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   On occasion, the noise can be terrifying. On Dec. 3, 1936,
Alaska's Black Rapids Glacier awakened with a thunderous roar after
hundreds of years of repose. A colossal mass of ice, snow and rock
_ measuring a mile and a half across and 27 miles long _ crashed
down the valley at the breakneck speed of 10 feet an hour, setting
a new record in glacier velocity as it headed straight for the
local bar.
</P>
<P>
   More than half a century later, the Black Rapids Glacier is
quiet and slow.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison and his fellow glacier experts have their ears to the
ice but don't have a clue when it might start moving again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still not sure exactly why glaciers surge,'' Harrison
says. ``But I'm really not sure why all glaciers don't surge.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is.
</P>
<P>
   Ice covers roughly 8 percent of the globe and is one of the most
familiar substances, yet it continues to confound scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other liquids, water expands rather than contracts as it
freezes; that's why ice floats in water. And under pressure ice
melts rather than solidifying further like other substances.
</P>
<P>
   After studying frozen lakes and rivers for 25 years, George
Ashton, formerly of the Cold Regions Research and Engineering
Laboratory in Hanover, N.H., and now retired, says he's still
mystified: ``There are so many basic questions yet to be
answered.''
</P>
<P>
   Such as that glacier in Alaska. When a glacier moves, it doesn't
scrape across the ground like a toboggan on a dry spot. No one
knows for certain what causes it to move at all, typically at a
languorous pace.
</P>
<P>
   The most plausible explanation is that the sheer force of
gravity causes the mass of ice to subtly change shape like cold
molasses as it slumps along.
</P>
<P>
   But other forces may be at work when a glacier tears off at a
gallop.
</P>
<P>
   ``During a typical surge, glaciers appear to suffer from a
failure of their internal plumbing,'' Harrison says.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, meltwater bubbles out from internal crevices and exits
from a natural downspout at the glacier's base. But when the
downspout is clogged, the meltwater backs up until the entire
glacier surges down the slope on a thin layer of water and
sediment.
</P>
<P>
   The more puzzling question is why a common patch of ice is
slippery.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's still controversial,'' Ashton says.
</P>
<P>
   One theory is that pressure builds up within the ice and creates
a thin film of water that greases the surface. Another is that ice
emits vapor, so that other solids actually float, rather than
slide, along the surface. A third possibility is that the top
atomic layer of ice is disordered so the atoms act like a box of
marbles and let other solids slide across them.
</P>
<P>
   Ice remains a source of mystery because of the unruly behavior
of H20 molecules. In gas form, they behave as individuals, single
and fancy-free. As water, they form a complicated, ever-changing
lattice with ties that continuously snap, reconnect and snap again.
</P>
<P>
   As ice, the molecules assume a crystal formation, placing
themselves farther away from each other, and even though these
bonds are relatively stationary, they are easily broken.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most solids, ice liquefies under pressure even at subzero
temperatures and refreezes as soon as the pressure is lifted. Hence
a loop of wire can be pulled through a solid block of ice and the
ice will immediately refreeze behind it.
</P>
<P>
   This process of regelation _ thawing and refreezing according to
variance in pressure rather than temperature _ takes place inside a
glacier all the time. But the exact dynamics of such shape-shifting
have eluded scientists.
</P>
<P>
   H20 molecules perform a host of other tricks when they bond
together as ice. To begin with, the molecular structure expands by
a volume of 9 percent as it freezes, creating a solid bigger and
lighter than water. Plus, in the process of bonding, the molecules
force out other substances.
</P>
<P>
   As seawater freezes, the ice crystals expel droplets of
concentrated brine that are eventually pulled down by gravity into
the water below, leaving the ice at the top 99 percent pure. In
fact, Eskimos depend on sea ice as their source of fresh water.
</P>
<P>
   Pure ice is transparent, but the air bubbles in fresh snow
reflect light, a fact that is essential to life as we know it.
</P>
<P>
   Antarctica receives more sun radiation than anywhere else on
Earth, yet the temperatures are so cold and the ice cap so
reflective that minimal ice melt occurs each summer. Otherwise, the
water levels of the oceans would rise by 250 feet and engulf most
of the world's great cities.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ice particles in the upper atmosphere reflect and
absorb solar radiation, acting as a global thermostat and keeping
Earth from burning to a crisp or freezing over.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have recently discovered, however, that atmospheric
ice may not be an entirely benign force. Although
chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, have been blamed for the destruction
of ozone, they actually do little harm until they come into contact
with ice particles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ice clouds were previously considered chemically inert,'' says
Nobel laureate Mario Molina, an atmospheric scientist at MIT. ``But
we found that ice actually speeds up the destruction of the ozone
layer, because chemical reactions take place on and with ice
particles.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Ashton views ice as a continuing source of
fascination and frustration. After spending most of his adult life
trying to figure out the details of how and why ice rots from the
bottom up, he still profoundly distrusts frozen rivers and offers
simple advice to anyone who ventures onto ice in the springtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a metal rod and stick it into the ice in front of you. If
water comes out, turn around and go _ run!

   ``You can hear waves of creaking and groaning and cracking,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   On occasion, the noise can be terrifying. On Dec. 3, 1936,
Alaska's Black Rapids Glacier awakened with a thunderous roar after
hundreds of years of repose. A colossal mass of ice, snow and rock
_ measuring a mile and a half across and 27 miles long _ crashed
down the valley at the breakneck speed of 10 feet an hour, setting
a new record in glacier velocity as it headed straight for the
local bar.
</P>
<P>
   More than half a century later, the Black Rapids Glacier is
quiet and slow.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison and his fellow glacier experts have their ears to the
ice but don't have a clue when it might start moving again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still not sure exactly why glaciers surge,'' Harrison
says. ``But I'm really not sure why all glaciers don't surge.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is.
</P>
<P>
   Ice covers roughly 8 percent of the globe and is one of the most
familiar substances, yet it continues to confound scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other liquids, water expands rather than contracts as it
freezes; that's why ice floats in water. And under pressure ice
melts rather than solidifying further like other substances.
</P>
<P>
   After studying frozen lakes and rivers for 25 years, George
Ashton, formerly of the Cold Regions Research and Engineering
Laboratory in Hanover, N.H., and now retired, says he's still
mystified: ``There are so many basic questions yet to be
answered.''
</P>
<P>
   Such as that glacier in Alaska. When a glacier moves, it doesn't
scrape across the ground like a toboggan on a dry spot. No one
knows for certain what causes it to move at all, typically at a
languorous pace.
</P>
<P>
   The most plausible explanation is that the sheer force of
gravity causes the mass of ice to subtly change shape like cold
molasses as it slumps along.
</P>
<P>
   But other forces may be at work when a glacier tears off at a
gallop.
</P>
<P>
   ``During a typical surge, glaciers appear to suffer from a
failure of their internal plumbing,'' Harrison says.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, meltwater bubbles out from internal crevices and exits
from a natural downspout at the glacier's base. But when the
downspout is clogged, the meltwater backs up until the entire
glacier surges down the slope on a thin layer of water and
sediment.
</P>
<P>
   The more puzzling question is why a common patch of ice is
slippery.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's still controversial,'' Ashton says.
</P>
<P>
   One theory is that pressure builds up within the ice and creates
a thin film of water that greases the surface. Another is that ice
emits vapor, so that other solids actually float, rather than
slide, along the surface. A third possibility is that the top
atomic layer of ice is disordered so the atoms act like a box of
marbles and let other solids slide across them.
</P>
<P>
   Ice remains a source of mystery because of the unruly behavior
of H20 molecules. In gas form, they behave as individuals, single
and fancy-free. As water, they form a complicated, ever-changing
lattice with ties that continuously snap, reconnect and snap again.
</P>
<P>
   As ice, the molecules assume a crystal formation, placing
themselves farther away from each other, and even though these
bonds are relatively stationary, they are easily broken.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most solids, ice liquefies under pressure even at subzero
temperatures and refreezes as soon as the pressure is lifted. Hence
a loop of wire can be pulled through a solid block of ice and the
ice will immediately refreeze behind it.
</P>
<P>
   This process of regelation _ thawing and refreezing according to
variance in pressure rather than temperature _ takes place inside a
glacier all the time. But the exact dynamics of such shape-shifting
have eluded scientists.
</P>
<P>
   H20 molecules perform a host of other tricks when they bond
together as ice. To begin with, the molecular structure expands by
a volume of 9 percent as it freezes, creating a solid bigger and
lighter than water. Plus, in the process of bonding, the molecules
force out other substances.
</P>
<P>
   As seawater freezes, the ice crystals expel droplets of
concentrated brine that are eventually pulled down by gravity into
the water below, leaving the ice at the top 99 percent pure. In
fact, Eskimos depend on sea ice as their source of fresh water.
</P>
<P>
   Pure ice is transparent, but the air bubbles in fresh snow
reflect light, a fact that is essential to life as we know it.
</P>
<P>
   Antarctica receives more sun radiation than anywhere else on
Earth, yet the temperatures are so cold and the ice cap so
reflective that minimal ice melt occurs each summer. Otherwise, the
water levels of the oceans would rise by 250 feet and engulf most
of the world's great cities.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ice particles in the upper atmosphere reflect and
absorb solar radiation, acting as a global thermostat and keeping
Earth from burning to a crisp or freezing over.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have recently discovered, however, that atmospheric
ice may not be an entirely benign force. Although
chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, have been blamed for the destruction
of ozone, they actually do little harm until they come into contact
with ice particles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ice clouds were previously considered chemically inert,'' says
Nobel laureate Mario Molina, an atmospheric scientist at MIT. ``But
we found that ice actually speeds up the destruction of the ozone
layer, because chemical reactions take place on and with ice
particles.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Ashton views ice as a continuing source of
fascination and frustration. After spending most of his adult life
trying to figure out the details of how and why ice rots from the
bottom up, he still profoundly distrusts frozen rivers and offers
simple advice to anyone who ventures onto ice in the springtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a metal rod and stick it into the ice in front of you. If
water comes out, turn around and go _ run!
</P>

STRUGGLING FOR THE GOLD  
 OLYMPIC HOPEFULS SEEK LARGER SHARE OF RICHES

<P>
   `` '' ``News item:'' According to a balance sheet prepared by
investigators, 40 percent of the $33,569 given by the Salt Lake
City bid committee to an International Olympic Committee member
went to his daughter for a scholarship. The 40-year-old woman was
not a student.
</P>
<P>
   ``A day in the life:'' Valley boxer Ray Martinez runs at dawn,
works in telemarketing during the day and spars in the evening. The
19-year-old has postponed college in an attempt to make the U.S.
team for the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney.It's a tale of two
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   One is personified by Ray Martinez's daily routine. It's about
pursuing a dream against long odds and at great personal sacrifice.
There's nobility in the pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   The other is about cashing in on those dreams. It's about big
bucks and the influence peddling that was disclosed in Salt Lake
City's hustle to win the bidding for the 2002 Winter Games. There's
a scandal in the headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's hopeful pursuit of an Olympic medal at a personal
cost and Salt Lake City's bid at any cost are symbols at opposite
ends of a widening controversy. It strikes at the heart of all
those things that are supposed to define the Olympics. The sweat,
sacrifice and struggle on the lower ends of the Olympic movement;
commercialism, corruption and greed at the top.
</P>
<P>
   The Games themselves have always been a work in progress. With
every Olympiad, there are more sports, more nations, more media
attention, more people. In the move from individual to
international, from competition to commercialism, there's
confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Who owns these Games, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   The athletes, whether Olympic medalists or simply hopefuls, will
tell you in words and mostly deeds that they do. Without their
efforts and the subsequent drama they provide, the Salt Lake City
Organizing Committee could have been dealing in widgets, for all
that it mattered.
</P>
<P>
   But widgets don't eat, sleep or train. The athletes do.
</P>
<P>
   Those at the top of their various sports can do so comfortably.
For example, swimmer Gary Hall Jr. of Phoenix receives an annual
training stipend of several thousand dollars. He had a six-figure
endorsement contract during the height of his success.
</P>
<P>
   For those who aspire to the top, it's often a different story,
even more so in sports like cycling and archery that are beyond the
mainstream. In an era of professionalism, they are chasing Olympic
dreams with amateur budgets and ideals. They train with little
fanfare and funding, many of them here in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   As they struggle from day to day to maintain and improve their
chances on the field of play, they read about sorely needed funds
going to people who will watch it all from a comfortable seat.
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly inherent conflict yields as many reactions as
there are sports.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at just a few from Valley athletes battling
daunting odds as they begin the final push toward national trials
that will determine who goes and doesn't go to Sydney in 2000: &QL; Ray
Martinez, boxing &QL; He's been near
the top of his sport. About a year ago, he was ranked No. 3 in the
the United States at 125 pounds. But since losing a
preliminary-round fight at nationals earlier this year, he's
slipped to No. 8 _ beyond a level called elite by USA Boxing.
</P>
<P>
   The elite get some money, a stipend, from United States Olympic
Committee funds. What's more, they get a lot of help in terms of
training from USA Boxing coaches. Above all, they're sure to travel
to tournaments that are stepping stones to the Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez and his family save every dime, stage fund-raisers
through trainer Willy Borchert's west-side gym and often ask for
help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to ask people for money,'' said Martinez' father, Ray
Sr., who is an assistant deputy warden at the state prison in
Florence. ``Me and his mom (Jennie), we can't always afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, Ray Sr. is thankful to USA Boxing. His son has
represented the nation in Europe. He fought last weekend in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The flight and room are paid by USA Boxing. But everything else
_ spending and incidentals _ either comes out of the family funds
or via help from Martinez's west-side neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad and mom have been there for me _ a lot'' said Martinez,
who fits his daily training around his work schedule. ``I'm lucky
to have them. They never had anybody like them. They grew up in the
projects. But for me, they've always been there.''
</P>
<P>
   Being there for the Martinez family won't be easy for the next
10 months. A key trip to Orlando for the Police Athletic League
championships is next on the schedule. It is a qualifier for the
Olympic Trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow, I'm going to get there,'' Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, another promising amateur, 147-pound Ramon Olivas of
south Phoenix, had to leave the PAL tournament after winning bouts
during the first two days. Olivas forfeited before the championship
rounds when he was forced to return home because he didn't have a
place to stay in Orlando on the tournament's final night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to spend some of that money on the kids who are
committed to what they are doing,'' said Martinez's dad, who says
his son finds himself at a disadvantage against the elite boxers
who don't have to work. ``Yes, some of that money should be
diverted to those kids.'' &QL; Trevaia Williams-Davis,
track &QL; Between training at a couple of different tracks in the East
Valley,
Williams-Davis, an alternate for the U.S. team in the 400-meter
hurdles for the 1996 Olympics, works with underprivileged kids at
the downtown YMCA.
</P>
<P>
   She often trains early in the morning before her work shift. For
the most part, she runs either at Mountain Pointe High School or
Mesa Community College. A pair of starting blocks are always in the
trunk of her car.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're nomads,'' said her personal coach, Leonard Braxton, of
the 30-year-old former Nevada-Las Vegas star who moved to the
Valley with her husband, former Baylor track star Terril Davis,
nearly two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Williams-Davis, a relay bronze-medalist at the 1995 Pan American
Games, didn't want to talk about the Salt Lake City controversy.
There's not much she can do about it, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Like Martinez, she is always close to receiving the USOC money
that is divided and then awarded by USA Track &AMP; Field. The top four
nationally in each event get some financial help. Williams-Davis
was fifth last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than you can imagine,'' she said when asked if financing
her Olympic dream was difficult. ``It's almost a Catch-22. In order
to be your best _ be what you know you can be _ you have to treat
track and field as your job.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to train when you need to. You have to pay a strength
coach. There's nutrition. And, sometimes, you need a physical
therapist. Then, there's equipment and travel to the important
local meets.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams-Davis, 30, runs on the European circuit. There, life is
easier. Travel, room and board are paid by the promoters. But the
time away from home can be tough. And there is still the burden of
financing travel to key U.S. meets, such as next week's national
championships in Eugene, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, an engineer, un derstands the challenge. He's faced
it himself. Davis was Michael Johnson's roommate at Baylor for one
year and finished fifth in the 800 meters at the 1992 Olympic
Trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it (money) gets to all the right athletes,''
said Davis, who works to support his wife's training and travel.
``There are a lot of people who get left out, especially in some of
the longer events. There's just not a lot funding out
there.'' &QL; Terry Ann Roach, cycling &QL; At 47, Roach is
balancing her life between a profession, responsibilities as a
single mom and training in an attempt to make the U.S. team in
track cycling.
</P>
<P>
   Her attempt is unique because of her age. When she was younger,
women didn't have the opportunities in sports that they do today.
Nonetheless, she began to display her talent on a bicycle in the
masters division, a level at which she holds three world and 10
national records.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend she won masters national championships in three
events at Frisco, Texas. She's good enough to be considered a
contender at the Elite National Championships in the 3000
Individual Pursuit and Points Race in August at Trexeltown, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   All of that means she good enough to think about the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   But training for the attempt is a different issue. She's forced
to travel at least twice a week to southern California for time on
a velodrome track. There isn't one in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The weekly flights are costly, and the trips take her away from
her job as a kinesio-therapist _ rehabilitating clients who have
suffered muscular injuries. The loss of work amounts to another
cost. Then there's the travel to various competitions. Roach has
worked to secure some private sponsorship, but she receives no
Olympic funding, while many of her rivals at the top of the sport
are getting a stipend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, anywhere you go, everything is politics, from
getting your first job all the way to our government,'' said Roach,
who has an 18-year-old daughter and 22-year-old son in college.
``It's not so much what you know, but who you know.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it is absolutely too bad that it is not restructured in a
way that they give a chance to the people who have potential. There
is always that diamond in the rough, that person who has never been
given a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're missing the boat. They just look at the best people
out there, when there are many others who could do something if
given the right attention.'' &QL; Judi Adams, archery &QL; Adams is a
two-time Olympian. She was
on the 1996 team. She also was on the ill-fated 1980 team, which
never got to compete because of the U.S. boycott of the Moscow
Games.
</P>
<P>
   Adams was angry in 1980. But as she nears 40, she is more
philosophical. She is trying to make another U.S. team. After
working for American Express during the day, she practices by
shooting at a target in an alley behind her parents' home in the
West Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the athletes get enough of the money, but I
don't really know if that's just because I'm in archery, which
never gets much,'' Adams said. ``I can tell you that in my years at
the top of the sport, I have gotten very little.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite that lack of funding, Adams feels lucky. The position at
American Express started through an Olympic jobs program. For
Adams, it has turned into a career, and it helps pay for her
equipment and other training expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said she often is angered by some of the few high-profile
athletes, who are getting rich through commercial endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a Phil Mahre in skiing talks about how much money he
makes during the Olympics, the ignorant public is left to think
that, `Oh, all these athletes are pampered.'
</P>
<P>
   ``What's forgotten are the X-number of these sports that are
really struggling with athletes who still compete for an ideal
that's never going to make them rich. They are truly doing it out
of the amateur spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is all that money available that has been reported as
being siphoned to IOC members, Adams says it should go to the
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   As in other sports, travel is her biggest financial difficulty.
If an archer doesn't travel to various events throughout the
country, it's impossible to stay competitive. In some cases, it
drives promising archers from the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are definitely ones who have struggled and have made the
decision: `I just can't live like this anymore. I can't make $2,000
a year and live at home. I'm 35 years old,' '' Adams said. &QL; Eric
Albarracin,
wrestling &QL; Albarracin, a former Arizona State University wrestler,
joined the
Army to get into the chow line.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Albarracin loves K rations. It's just that those
rations are a lot more dependable and even more nutritious than
Swedish meat balls, chicken wings and chips at happy hour.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Albarracin made it to the Olympic Festival at 118
pounds with nothing but a dream. He had no car, no house and no
stove. He slept on friends' couches. He traveled to and from
practice on in-line skates.
</P>
<P>
   His training table was the happy-hour spread at bars up-and-down
Mill Avenue. Albarracin ran into trouble when a bartender began to
recognize him as this guy who was making a meal out of free ``hors
d'oeuvres'' without buying a drink.
</P>
<P>
   It's the sort of lifestyle that would drive a lot people off the
mat and into some serious drinking. But ASU wrestling Coach Lee Roy
Smith said Albarracin never gave up his Olympic hopes. Hence, he
enlisted, which allows him to train and compete while fulfilling
his service commitment. Otherwise, his wrestling career would have
been over, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Albarracin, who even qualified for one monthly stipend of $250,
is probably an extreme example. Nonetheless, he defines the gap _
the disparity and inconsistency _ between athlete and IOC
plutocrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to hope that they're going to get the pyramid turned
around, because it's upside down'' Smith said of the money and
where so much of it seems to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us in the United States, people with the USOC and our
NGBs (national governing bodies for each sport) would very much
like to see changes in the way the IOC does its business.'' &QL;

COYOTES' UNPROTECTED LIST FEATURES SEVERAL SURPRISES

<P>
   PHOENIX - The Coyotes protected several stars but exposed a few
surprise players to Friday's NHL expansion draft in Boston,
including forwards Bob Corkum and Jim Cummins and defensemen Stan
Neckar and Gerald Diduck, who is recovering from major knee
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Other notable Phoenix players who will be made available to the
Atlanta Thrashers in this week's draft include goalies Mikhail
Shtalenkov and Jimmy Waite, defensemen J.J. Daigneault, Jamie
Huscroft, Sean Gagnon and Brad Tiley, and forwards Mike Sullivan,
Mike Stapleton, Brian Noonan, Stephen Leach and perhaps, Louie
DeBrusk or Tavis Hansen, ``The Arizona Republic'' has learned.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, which will select one player from each of the existing
27 clubs except for the second-year Nashville Predators, will draft
at least four goalies Friday despite acquiring Damian Rhodes in a
trade with Ottawa last week. A league-wide trading freeze was put
into effect on Sunday and will continue until the conclusion of
Friday's draft.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes had to submit their protected list to the NHL by
Monday afternoon. The list will be made official today.
</P>
<P>
   Cummins, an NHL-tested enforcer, and Shtalenkov, an experienced
backup goalie, figure to be two of the most likely candidates to be
nabbed by Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Corkum, 31, the Coyotes' best defensive forward and top faceoff
man, might also be an intriguing pick, but he becomes an
unrestricted free agent on July 1 and may be difficult to sign.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is Neckar, 23, whom the Coyotes obtained
from the New York Rangers in March in exchange for defenseman Jason
Doig and a sixth-round pick in Saturday's NHL draft. He was a
regular player on the team's six-man defensive rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Younger Coyotes players, such as centers Daniel Briere and
Trevor Letowski, are exempt from the expansion draft. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWTON, Mass. _ Wesley Edward Harrington IV, honor roll student
and varsity athlete, made sure his blue blazer was smooth and his
tie straight before he stood to tell his classmates, gathered in
the chapel of St. Sebastian's School, about the boy he used to be.
</P>
<P>
   I once was a bully, he said, and now I'm not.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion was the annual chapel speech required of every
student in this all-boys parochial school in Needham. And the story
Ted Harrington shared the other day with his fellow sophomores was
about the moment in sixth grade when he finally understood what his
parents meant when they told him to treat other people the way he'd
like to be treated.
</P>
<P>
   What started as one more instance of Ted Harrington, funny guy,
drawing a laugh by picking on another kid ended with five boys
jumping Harrington outside the cafeteria of the Day Middle School
in Newton. What hurt more than the blows to Harrington's body were
the blows to his pride, as kids who usually laughed with him
laughed at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was this proud kid and somebody had made himself better than
me in the eyes of my peers,'' he says, recounting the incident _
and the speech _ during a conversation in his Newton home. ``That
hurt. Just being on the receiving end of it and seeing that
everyone wasn't, like, `Oh, this is the funny kid.' It was `Oh,
this is funny.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It took being the victim to realize it wasn't as fun as I
thought it had been. I can never remember feeling good about
pounding on someone or making fun of them or a good joke I made
about someone, but I'll always remember the time I was on the
receiving end.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Harrington was not a classic bully who used hostility to
vent his anger and insecurity. Rather, as a player in the often
confusing, socially uneasy, sometimes cruel culture of American
boyhood, he was one of those kids who initiate taunts rather than
stand to the side or take the heat themselves. Bright, gregarious
and athletic, big and somewhat old for his grade, he slipped into a
social role that fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was one of the ringleaders pretty much,'' he says. ``There
were other kids who started it and were definitely worse than me,
but I did my fair share.''
</P>
<P>
   That he could, in his moment of humiliation, learn empathy
rather than a renewed determination to dominate represents a
victory, years in the making, of home over culture. Boys may be
boys, but ``boys will be boys'' need not always prevail.

   Ted's father, Wesley E. ``Wes'' Harrington III, is a man who
isn't afraid to hug his three children (20-year-old Heather,
16-year-old Ted, and 13-year-old Kyle) or shed tears in their
presence. When Ted repeats what his father, whose company manages
medical trade associations, says about the life of a businessman,
the message is about relationships, not aggressive dealmaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his business anyway,'' Ted says, ``you really need to be a
people person and respectful of what other people have to say.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Judith Harrington, who brokers commercial printing
jobs from their home, won't let problems simmer. ``I might say this
will take care of itself,'' says Wes, ``where she'll make certain
it's discussed.'' She's also the one who bans R-rated movies, even
action films, sometimes to the groans of her husband and sons. ``I
just don't want, especially for my boys, to have those images in
their mind,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   It was back in elementary school, around fourth grade, that Ted
and his friends joined to make life miserable for a precocious,
awkward boy in the neighborhood. The boy's parents finally
transferred him to a private school in fifth grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like him now _ he's a good kid _ but I used to make
fun of him, like, every day,'' Ted says. ``I remember one time
crawling under the seats of the bus _ I thought this was really
crafty at the time _ with a page of stickers and I stuck them all
over his legs and shoes and stuff. Then, like, I went home and was
chucking little pebbles at him and stuff. I didn't even realize
that that was something wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted's parents knew it was wrong as soon as the other boy's
parents told them about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were well aware that, for a variety of reasons, this boy
was having a hard time, not just in our neighborhood,'' says Wes,
51. ``You hoped _ and this is the Pollyanna part _ that your son
wasn't part of it or at least was on the periphery. Ideally, we'd
all like him to be the one who goes in there and says, `Stop it,'
but let's be real. Then to find out that he was part of it, it was
all those emotions we felt: Anger. Disappointment. Concern for the
person most affected by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Should they punish their son, Wes and Judy wondered, ground him,
or take away a favorite activity or toy? Or could that backfire, if
he blamed his loss on the boy he was bullying?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like he broke a neighbor's window. This was something
that had implications for the rest of his life,'' says Wes. ``We
wanted to deal with it so he got the message.''
</P>
<P>
   The Harringtons talked to their son. How would you feel if
someone was doing this to your brother or your sister?
</P>
<P>
   ``He had what we thought were the age-appropriate responses:
`I'd stand up and fight for them, if I had to,' '' Wes recalls.
``We said fine. The point of what you're saying is it's
unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Then they'd revisit the issue, ask Ted how things were going.
``I honestly think Ted was upfront in his answers because they
weren't always rosy,'' Wes says. ``We'd be in there saying, `Were
you part of it? Did you do anything to stop it?' ''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Ted ignored his parents. But in the
banter-and-bravado, tease-or-be-teased, conceal-how-you-feel world
of boys that age it was hard to shed his status as the funny guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I listened but it didn't soak in because it happened again and
again,'' he says. ``I'd feel bad about it for awhile. Then I'd be
back at it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When he left the school every single kid felt they had a part
in it and felt really terrible, even though we were young. We
weren't old enough to be able to admit it to anyone, but we all
knew we felt awful about it. And so whenever I see him I feel kind
of guilty. I do my best to be cool with him.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last October, Judy attended a lecture at Dana Hall School in
Wellesley that gave her some insight into Ted's experience.
Catherine Steiner-Adair, a psychologist, discussed child
development issues and Judy, notebook in her lap, wrote furiously
as Steiner-Adair spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Little boys, Steiner-Adair was saying, pass a ``tragic''
milestone by early elementary school. ``They master the poker
face,'' she said, ``and the developmental challenge of learning how
not to cry.'' If they haven't learned that by age 8 or 9, well,
they're in trouble. They're the ones who will be teased. She called
it ``losing boys to the culture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell little boys to disconnect from their vulnerability,
their sadness, and their feelings,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Harrington certainly wasn't opening up about his feelings
with his friends in late elementary and middle school. ``It's just
not something you did at all,'' he says. ``If you ever open up an
emotion or something, somebody would be right on that. There's this
unwritten rule that you can't be weak.''

U.S. COLLEGIANS MAKE WAVES IN NHL DRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Where are all the great hockey players coming from nowadays?
</P>
<P>
   Well, the best of the best no longer hail only from Canada. And
although a major European invasion of teenage talent continues to
migrate across the Atlantic to the NHL, it isn't just the Finns,
Swedes, Czechs and Russians who are making waves.
</P>
<P>
   A new trend has surfaced on NHL Draft Day, as more and more
players from U.S.-based college programs are now spilling into the
equation. And they are beginning to make quite a splash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if there's a real good answer for it, but the
college game is going pretty good right now, no question,'' said
Bob Murray, a Boston-based agent for several hockey stars,
including the Coyotes' Keith Tkachuk. ``We've seen some guys come
out of the college ranks like a Paul Kariya, who everyone realized
could step in and play the game right away, and NHL teams are
thinking, `Geez, maybe if we give these college kids an
opportunity, they can do this.'
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a little more mature, maybe a little more ready. I
think it's something you definitely could see continuing for a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers support the theory. From 1991 to 1994, only 37
skaters from U.S. universities were drafted by NHL clubs. In the
past three years, however, that figure has risen to an astounding
78.
</P>
<P>
   After only six college players were chosen in the 1994 draft and
five went in '95, a total of 25, 26 and 27 were selected in each of
the past three draft classes, respectively. Three of the Coyotes'
10 picks a year ago played collegiate hockey this past season.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. collegians once again figure to play a significant role in
this year's NHL entry draft, which will be held Saturday in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, only one U.S. college player in history has ever
been selected first overall _ Canadian-born Joe Murphy of Michigan
State in 1986 _ but he won't be alone forever, most scouts, general
managers and agents would agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see a lot more college kids get drafted, and
the majority of them are probably going to be Americans,'' said
Brian Kilrea, coach and general manager of the Ontario Hockey
League's Ottawa 67s, who won the Memorial Cup last season in his
25th year behind the bench. ``The U.S. has jumped ahead of Canada
in many regards because they've kept up with the growth. They
continue to build rinks and continue to give players an opportunity
to improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Canada, we can't keep up with the growth. We can't satisfy
the ice time for everyone who wants to play. Girls hockey is big
here now, too, but we just don't have the rinks like we used to.
Even the outdoor rinks. It used to be, you'd grab your stick and a
puck and go outside and play. But we're laying people off up here
and a lot of outdoor rinks aren't manned, and we've stopped making
ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a Canadian, it's disappointing. We're sort of forgetting
about our greatest export, which is hockey players. Now, there's
more attention being give to U.S. players and Europeans.''
</P>
<P>
   That being said, Kilrea has four players from last season's
Ottawa club who are expected to be taken in the first three rounds
Saturday. Three are defensemen (Luke Sellars, Jeremy Van Hoff and
Jonathan Zion) and the other is a goalie (Seamus Kotyk). Moreover,
two other former Kilrea prospects have re-entered the draft:
defenseman Nick Boynton, who was selected ninth overall last June
by Washington; and center Matt Zultek, taken 15th overall by Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the top 20 North American prospects, however, are
skaters from U.S. colleges. They are Michigan defenseman Jeff
Jillson (No. 11), University of Maine left wing Barrett Heisten
(No. 14), Minnesota defenseman Jordan Leopold (No. 16), Maine
defenseman Doug Janik (No. 17) and Notre Dame center David Inman
(No. 19). All but Inman, who was reared in Toronto, were born in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hockey's growing by leaps and bounds in the United States.
Just look at how many rinks we've got in the Phoenix area now and
how many more are getting built,'' said Canadian-born Bill Lesuk,
the Coyotes' longtime director of scouting. ``We've almost had a
monopoly up here in Canada, but it's just a matter of time before a
kid born and raised in Arizona makes it to the NHL.''
</P>
<P>
   It probably won't be long. But until then, dozens of college
players will take the next step.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a couple of things,'' Coyotes assistant general
manager Taylor Burke said, explaining the recent influx of drafted
collegians. ``First, you typically see a lot of copycat trends in
the league, whether it's the style certain clubs try to emulate,
such as the defensive system of New Jersey, or getting big like
Philadelphia or trying to do what Dallas does. If somebody has
success with something, well, sometimes you try and see if it works
for you, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Former college players like Anaheim's Kariya, Buffalo's Brian
Holzinger, Colorado's Chris Drury and Edmonton's Tom Poti are
changing the landscape. Burke thinks NHL clubs are better for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the other thing, you've got a longer period to look at
them when they're in college,'' he said. ``Guys can stay in college
for four years, and you know more about them after four years than
you do after two years (in junior hockey).''
</P>
<P>
   College players who went undrafted also are becoming prized free
agents, and a host of NHL teams, including the Coyotes, have been
quick to recognize them. Phoenix, for instance, wasted no time in
signing Maine defenseman David Cullen the moment the captain led
his school to the NCAA championship last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``College players have opened people's eyes a bit,'' hockey
agent Murray said, ``and the pros are going after them. Even the
kids who get bypassed in the draft and are too old for the draft.
There's still opportunities for them.''

 LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla.: ... of apartheid.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Valentine's Day, Richard had just returned to Virginia
Wesleyan from Nashville, where he had been organizing protests
against South Africa's scheduled appearance in the Davis Cup tennis
championships. That night, he said, two masked intruders burst into
his office, used metal file drawers to bludgeon him, and carved a
racial epithet _ niger (sic) _ into his belly.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitalized for several days, Richard was reluctant to tell his
young son what had happened. But Joe had heard others talk about
it, and he twisted the accounts into a five-year-old's fantasy. ``I
know you were attacked by bank robbers and they cut your heart out
and put it in your stomach,'' Joe told his father.
</P>
<P>
   In the nightmarish aftermath, local police suggested to
reporters that Lapchick had staged the assault as a cheap publicity
stunt, which Richard later rebutted by submitting to a polygraph
test and a physical exam by the New York medical examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a telephone threat against Joe and his younger sister,
Elisa, who had just returned home from a visit with their
grandparents. ``It must be good to have the kids home,'' a man on
the telephone told Richard at his office. ``It may not be for
long.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard called home and discovered that Joe suddenly was
missing. As the police searched, Richard and Sandy, his wife at the
time, waited helplessly until a neighboring family brought Joe home
more than two hours later. The neighbors said they had taken Joe to
see their new home. ``It was the most terrifying experience of my
life,'' Richard says.
</P>
<P>
   The episode left him feeling so vulnerable that Richard took a
job the next day as a United Nations liaison officer and moved his
family to New York. There, Joe was in trouble from the start,
repeatedly picking fights with other children.
</P>
<P>
   When a child psychiatrist examined Joe, the doctor said the boy
felt guilty because he had not protected Richard from the attack
and was fearful that one day he would be assaulted like his father
had been. The psychiatrist said Joe, in his young child's mind, was
physically preparing himself for the confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   A year of psychiatric therapy curbed the fighting, but Joe
continued to seethe beneath the surface. ``I don't think I grasped
that there was still a lot of turmoil going on inside him,''
Richard says.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble was, Richard was not home much to assess Joe's
crisis. Driven both by a passion for his work and the coolness of
his strained marriage, Richard was away nearly nine months a year.
Joe played an entire youth soccer season and half the next season
before Richard showed up to watch him play. And as they walked away
from the field, Joe asked, ``Dad, why don't you ever play soccer
with me like the other fathers?''
</P>
<P>
   Richard thought he was helping Joe, as his father had helped
him, by not pressuring his son to excel in his sports. But
Richard's absence from Joe's sports life symbolized a deeper
separation between the father and two children. Though Richard
always told Joe and his sister he loved them and was proud of them,
the bond was weak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truthfully, I never knew my dad,'' Joe says, ``until we moved
to Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   That was 1984, when Richard opened the Northeastern center. Joe
was 12, and though he relished his father spending time at their
new home in Milton, Mass., Joe soon witnessed the dissolution of
his parents' marriage. They separated for good on Jan. 1, 1986.
``It was hard to see them fighting,'' Joe says, ``even if they
probably weren't meant to be together in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   When Richard quickly fell in love again, with his current wife,
Ann, Joe became increasingly resentful. ``I felt like Ann was
taking my dad away from me,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Joe, who divided his home life between each of his parents'
houses in Milton, started to funnel his frustration into alcohol
during his freshman year at Archbishop Williams High School in
Braintree, Mass. During the week, Joe all but abandoned interest in
school, and his grades slipped so severely that he needed to repeat
his freshman year when he transferred the next fall to Blue Hills
Regional Technical School in Canton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   On weekends, Joe's drinking escalated. From a six-pack of
12-ounce beers, he went to two six-packs. Then it was 16-ounce
beers. Then 16-ounce beers and a pint of liquor. Then he was
drinking during the week as well. Soon, Joe was smoking marijuana,
too.
</P>
<P>
   While Joe sank into a haze, Richard was warning coaches,
athletes, and educators about the dangers of alcohol and drug use,
especially after Len Bias, the Boston Celtics top draft choice,
died of cocaine intoxication in 1986. But Richard missed the
warning signs at home, as he had squandered his earlier chance to
create firmer boundaries for Joe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look back a lot and wish my dad was more strict with me when
I was younger,'' Joe says.
</P>
<P>
   Richard says he offered Joe more support than discipline because
he worried about the lingering effects of the attack in Virginia.
But he sees now that the strategy was flawed, particularly after
Joe slipped into substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
   During the same period, Richard also found handguns under Joe's
bed, which Joe now says he and his friend planned to use only for
target practice.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, Richard says, his failure to grasp the severity of
Joe's distress reflects an experience that is sadly common among
contemporary parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to be Joe's friend and not his father,'' Richard
says. ``I understand now when people ask, `How could the parents
not know?' I thought I was taking care of my son by trying to be
his friend, and I was not seeing that this little boy was involved
in this life-threatening situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard's wife, Ann, sensed Joe's troubles and urged Richard to
confront Joe. But Joe wanted no part of Ann's intervention or his
father's response to it. ``It may have helped me recognize the
problem,'' Joe says, ``but it made me much more reluctant to accept
Ann. She was bringing all the heat down on me. And it made things
worse between my dad and me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, there was no magic fix. Only after Joe finished high
school, he says, did he recognize he had an addictive personality.
He realized his parents _ and Ann _ loved him and supported him.
And he gradually eased away from his self-destructive behavior.
``My life wasn't focused on drinking anymore,'' he says. ``It was
more on achieving success.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Joe struggled academically for two years at Northeastern
and in a brief stint at Valencia Community College in Orlando, Fla.
Then he discovered while working part-time promoting nightclub
events _ and through his personal interest in cooking _ that he
wanted to pursue a career in the culinary arts at Johnson &AMP; Wales.
</P>
<P>
   But he faced a final hurdle. Joe's father has spent most of his
adult life steering young people, particularly athletes, toward
completing traditional college programs. And Joe feared letting him
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real eye-opener for me,'' Richard says. ``I realized
that whatever pressure I had exerted on him, I had been leading him
to do what he thought I wanted him to do as opposed to what he
wanted to do. He really thought his decision would displease me. In
fact, it really made me very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe, who lives with his girlfriend, Michelle, in Providence, is
preparing to develop and market a marinade based on his mother's
recipe. He says he plans to call the marinade ``Sandy's Sauce,''
and he hopes to strike it rich. He credits his father for helping
him ``fulfill a dream.''
</P>
<P>
   For Richard's part, he says he has seized the lessons he learned
from raising Joe to help him be a better father for his and Ann's
daughter, Emily, who is 9. Richard never misses Emily's soccer
games, and when he travels he no longer leaves a night early and
returns a day later, as he used to do when Joe was young. Now, if
Richard is not home to kiss Emily goodnight, he is there when she
wakes up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been able to learn from my mistakes and do things
differently this time,'' he says. ``I really feel blessed.''

STOTTLEMYRE TO TEST INJURED SHOULDER TODAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Todd Stottlemyre is still far from pitching in a big league
game, but he could have fooled his wife  &UR; Sheri during lunch on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Watching her husband act restless, she asked what was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I kind of have that nervous energy,' '' the
Diamondbacks pitcher said. ``It feels like the day before I'm
pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre wishes he could take the mound against the
Cincinnati Reds tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the right-hander will gently throw the ball for the
first time since going on the disabled list May 18 because of a
partially torn rotator cuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Today), the rehab starts to become fun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he'll likely throw from about 60 to 70 feet today and
gradually progress the workload each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's champing at the bit,'' Manager  &UR; Buck Showalter said.
``He'll be the happiest guy in Phoenix (today), hopefully after he
goes through (the throwing workout).''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre said he gained about eight pounds of muscle from
working out with weights since the injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a pitcher, you're afraid to lift too much weight,'' he
said. ``I had no choice but to make every muscle, from the toes up,
as strong as I can. I'm probably stronger now than I have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre said he'll try to emphasize his legs and midsection
while pitching to take pressure off the shoulder. He's not given
himself a timetable on when he'll pitch in a game again, but
trainer  &UR; Paul Lessard said if all goes well, perhaps in four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I call time frames and deadlines are restrictions,''
Stottlemyre said. ``If I say in three or four weeks I want to pitch
in a game, I might be realistically ready in two or three weeks.'' &QL; 
A batter's eye &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reds first baseman  &UR; Sean Casey was just hoping to play again.
Then, he just wanted to make the most of each at-bat. Now, the
24-year-old in his first full season in the major leagues, is
leading the National League in hitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect to be leading the league right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two games into last season, Casey was struck in the face with a
thrown ball during batting practice while he was out in the field.
He suffered an orbital fracture of the right eye and lacerations
that required 20 stitches. A plate with five screws was inserted to
free up the muscles around the eye for normal motion and vision. &QL; 
Father's long day &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher  &UR; Vladimir Nunez said his wife,  &UR; Wendy, will be induced
Wednesday morning, which will allow him to be with her during the
delivery of their second child and still make it to Bank One
Ballpark in time for the game that night. &QL;

   MEN-EXPECTATIONS (Lake Buena Vista, Fla.) _ By all accounts, Joe

   MEN-BULLY (Newton, Mass.) _ Ted Harrington was not a classic
bully who used hostility to vent his anger and insecurity. Rather,
as a player in the often confusing, socially uneasy, sometimes
cruel culture of American boyhood, he was one of those kids who
initiate taunts rather than stand to the side or take the heat
themselves. By Irene Sege. (2 takes) PHOTO

 RAPID CITY, S.D.: ... is doing.''

<P>
   ``My dad,'' Glenn says, ``has taught me that if you have to
fight, you have already lost.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Violent solutions,'' interrupts the father, ``are never
permanent solutions. Never long term. If you study history, you'll
see that US history has done nothing but taught us that.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ronn was growing up here, a gun was a friend. Little boys
from his era were as interested in guns as they were in shooting
marbles. There was food in the hills, animals to be stalked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every fall, when I was a kid,'' Ronn is saying, ``we hunted
deer before, and after, school. We never brought the guns into the
school. It never crossed our minds to do something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado shootings, the Arkansas shootings, seeped into
South Dakota like they seeped into everyplace else. ``The West is a
small place,'' Ronn says. ``We're spread out, but there's not a lot
of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Littleton also seeped, deep, into Ronn Jones. He sat down and
wrote a couple poems about the shootings, the dreadfulness of it
all.
</P>

<P>
   Or it will be us next.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(unitals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, Ronn Jones is no Auden, but he gets his poems written.
That's satisfaction enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teenagers. We think we're on top of the world,'' Glenn says.
</P>
<P>
   But there are times when, to Ronn, his son looks and feels lost.
There are times when he just can't figure out what kind of thoughts
_ dark or lovely _ might be coursing through Glenn's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always want to find out how he thinks,'' Ronn says. ``Where
the potential conflicts may be coming from. I want to find the
philosophical areas we disagree on. We share common interests, so I
can see something coming if it's coming. I don't know if the
parents in Littleton could have seen that coming. But I know by
communicating with a child, you have a better chance at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Jones's voice goes up and down in octave range, like a
drama student's might on direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't buy it that children get transfixed by outside
influences, such as brainwashing,'' Ronn says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad, I worship a Greek mythology God,'' the son interjects,
matter-of-factly, his head swiveling closer to his dad's.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll grow out of that,'' the father says quickly, bringing a
cigarette to his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   When Glenn first wrapped his finger around the trigger of a
rifle, he was 11 years old. But when he fired that first shot,
there wasn't a deer or prairie dog in sight, only a TV. The echo
and shattered screen scared him fiercely. He laid the Winchester
down and picked up the phone and called his father. He was crying
that he didn't know the gun was loaded. The father rushed home. The
boy was shaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said `Glenn, the fear you have now in you is enough
punishment.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The rod was spared, but not the rifle. Ronn Jones wouldn't let
Glenn Jones hunt. Ronn Jones enrolled his boy in a yearlong weapon
safety course.
</P>
<P>
   He says he knew the fear of not hunting would yank his son's
attention in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know my son,'' Ronn says, the voice rising. ``I can tell you
what my son has in his room. What he has under his bed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Okay dad, what do I have under my bed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Three skin magazines.''
</P>
<P>
   The son laughs, cackles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be a wanna-be cowboy hick,'' Glenn says. ``Now,
mostly what calms my anger is turning the music up and smoking
cigarettes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' the father says, his eyes shooting upward, his voice
hardening, ``I wish you wouldn't tell me you smoke cigarettes.''
</P>
<P>
   What space there is between them narrows when the two set off
into the Black Hills to hunt. They stay through the day and night,
watching stars crawl across the sky, listening to nature's random
melodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like working together as a team out there,'' Glenn says.
``When we go hunting it's just me and my dad, alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Out there, in the hills, or on the wide-open prairie, Ronn can
sometimes feel tenseness and anger just lifting up out of his son.
It's as if he's been given some kind of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he stops talking to me I can tell something's bothering
him,'' Ronn says. ``I think, then, maybe we should go outside and
spar until he's got enough of the surface anger out of him.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the violent video games _ ``Time Kills,'' ``Final
Fantasies,'' _ Ronn figures they're everywhere, at the mall, at the
homes of friends of his son. So he's tried to adopt an intellectual
attitude toward them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play with him,'' Ronn says. ``They're good for the
imagination. But I teach him _ and he knows _ that in fantasy
violence you can shut the game off and those people stop
bleeding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In real life,'' says Glenn, ``you don't get to push the reset
button.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Later in the week Glenn is having a meal at a local restaurant.
He's with his girlfriend, Sammi. Sammi is 13 years old. She lives
with her mother over in back of the K Mart store in a trailer park.
She's being home-schooled. Glenn is bragging about how fast he can
drive, about his grades in school, about how much he knows about
American geography. Sammi's eyes are wide; she worships her
boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very good with a .22,'' Glenn says, regaling Sammi with
hunting tales.
</P>
<P>
   They talk about the two high schools in town. Glenn doesn't want
Sammi to go to Stevens High. ``Too preppy,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``And stuck up,'' she adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully,'' Glenn says, ``I can get through the next three
years of school. I'll be the only boy in my house with a high
school diploma. Right after high school, I'm going into the Army.
If they'll take me.''
</P>
<P>
   He figures he'll have to work, to grind, for his diploma. ``I'm
not the perfect angel,'' Glenn confesses.
</P>
<P>
   He's tried marijuana. Told his dad he tried the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   He once skipped school, was caught because the car he was
driving got stuck in a ditch and he had to be pulled out.
</P>
<P>
   When he feels he might be getting too angry or upset, when he
feels he's beyond even his father, there's a counselor he can go
to. There he can rant and rave; he can tell secrets to the
counselor. ``Some of the stuff I've done my parents couldn't take.
If they knew, I'd be grounded til I was 30.''
</P>
<P>
   He can't predict his future, anymore than he can predict the
number of elk in the Black Hills that will fall to the hunter's
rifle next hunting season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You only get once chance at this life,'' the son says. ``You
screw that up, it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Away from his father, Glenn also says this: ``I got a side to me
nobody's seen.''
</P>
<P>
   And, very sweetly, he says this: ``All my dad's poems are
great.''
</P>
<P>
   Away from his son, Ronn says this: ``We're all amateur parents.
We're all struggling in the dark.''
</P>
<P>
   Just one man; just one father.
</P>
<P>
   And he expresses a little sadness that his son might not
appreciate the discipline he has instilled in him _ not until years
down the road. ``He won't understand my reasons for punishment for
another 20 years, when he has a son. I hope I'm still alive.''
</P>
<P>
   The afternoons across the South Dakota landscape are beautiful
these days, clear as spilled wine.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Jones has recently started talking about setting aside the
swordplay for a stick this summer. A stick he can swing as hard as
he wants.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be something new.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Dust in his eyes. A glove on his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Dad hovering.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be something new for the Joneses.

   TAKE-BOS  
 NEWTON, Mass.: ... be weak.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wes remembers those unwritten rules. He grew up in Holyoke,
where junior high was his most difficult time. He was overweight,
not yet grown into the athlete he would become in high school.
``When somebody picked on me,'' he says, ``and really was
merciless, that was like a stake through the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he went to Williston Academy, a nearby boarding school for
boys. There, he recalls, some classmates taunted one boy by
dangling him by his feet outside a third-floor window.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying I was a candidate for sainthood,'' Wes says.
``By sheer luck, and that's all it was, I happened to fall into a
group of kids and we had other things that were more important to
us than taunting kids. I think the chemistry in our group could
have changed and we would all have been part and parcel of it. None
of us went out of our way to say, `Don't do that!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Wes survived that taunt-and-tease culture, and so, it seems, has
Ted. Does that mean the wounds inflicted and wounds received aren't
so deep after all? Wes is ambivalent, though he can't say how he'd
feel if his son were the one harassed daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not so sure the system doesn't work, if you know what I
mean,'' he says. ``I think boys and men have dealt with resolving
their issues ad nauseum. The way you traditionally deal with
conflict may not be the right way, but I don't think this will
change. And I'm not so sure it has to.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Harrington shakes her head. ``Mars and Venus,'' her husband
laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mars and Venus,'' she agrees. ``But there are still so many
threats to healthy personalities in our culture and in society and
in ourselves. You have to constantly be grappling with those.''
</P>
<P>
   That night at Dana Hall, Steiner-Adair said something that gave
Judy hope. What boys who do well in high school have in common, she
said, ``is an affectionate, interpersonal connection to their
fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   Wes, an only child, was 16 _ Ted's age _ when his father died of
congestive heart failure. His dad was a doctor, a general
practitioner who took young Wes along on house calls and who was
open in his affection. Four years later, his mother died. If you
want a reason for his insistence on keeping his relationships in
order, look to those early losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad,'' says Ted, ``loves us every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Once, as the family was driving home from visiting Judy's
parents on Cape Cod, one of the boys said, ``You know what I really
miss, Dad? We don't know your parents.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean I just started to get all teary-eyed,'' Wes recalls.
``Ted said to me, `Are you crying?' I said, `I really miss my
parents. One of the things I don't have and will never have in my
life is the ability to put my arm around my dad and say these are
my kids.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Teddy kind of understood that. He said, `Well, you better stay
alive because I expect to do that with you and my kids.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Every Christmas, Wes hangs an ornament on the tree for each of
his children, along with a personal letter. This past holiday he
wrote Ted how proud he was of the way he's adjusted to St.
Sebastian's. Both he and his wife schedule ``special days'' with
each child, one-on-one time when they do whatever the child wants.
</P>
<P>
   Wes goes to Ted's games, to lacrosse, soccer, basketball. In
April, after St. Sebastian's lacrosse team overcame a six-goal
deficit to beat Hingham 9-8 in double overtime, Ted broke away from
his teammates to leap into his dad's arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's never cold with me,'' Ted says. ``If I have something to
say he's always there with a hug or whatever. Like if I come off a
playing field and I feel like I've had a terrific game, he'll frown
upon it if I got in a kid's face after I scored or something. It
shows a little bit that morality is above all else. Being a good
person.''
</P>
<P>
   These are the things, more than sit-down talks about other
people's feelings, that together made a difference in this boy's
life. Yet the pull of the culture was strong and lessons about
respecting others were a long time in the learning.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ted never again taunted the boy in the neighborhood after the
boy switched schools, but he didn't stop teasing other kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always liked to be the center of attention. I liked to get
people to laugh. At that stage in life I didn't quite have the wit
to be able to pull it off without it being at someone else's
expense,'' he says. ``I was blind to other people's emotions. It's
not that I was blocking it out. I just hadn't thought of it. All I
knew was I was making a joke and other people were laughing. That
was my reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came middle school. Since the incidents in the
neighborhood, the Harringtons had received no calls from parents or
teachers about Ted's behavior. Still, they were wary. They didn't
expect Ted to be teased, but they made a point of talking to him
again about bullying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern was new school, new territorial rules,'' Wes says.
</P>
<P>
   But the only sign the Harringtons had that something might be
amiss came when Ted complained about another kid, a bigger boy.
Mostly, he told them, the two avoided one another. Then just before
the school year ended, Ted was teasing another boy and the bigger
boy told him to cut it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd either give up my dignity and submit or call his
bluff,'' Ted says. ``So I called his bluff, which wasn't a bluff at
all, and he dropped me on my head.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, after lunch, the bigger boy and his friends surrounded
Ted. ``I had this feeling that they weren't there to talk,'' Ted
says, ``so I picked the smallest one and went at him. Before I knew
it all of them had come down on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted required no more medical attention than a visit to the
school nurse. Still, the Harringtons were upset and angry. They met
several times with school administrators. They made sure the boys
would not share classes the next year. And they talked to their
son.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told him at the time, and it's still vivid today, that you
want to bottle that feeling,'' Wes says. ``You want to never forget
how hideous you felt because you'll be that much more empathetic
the next time you could do it to someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   In seventh grade, Ted hung back when the teasing began. ``But I
never ever would have stood in the way,'' he says. ``You need to be
really sure of yourself to be able to do that. You're not sure of
yourself at all until ninth or tenth grade.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Ted would rather forget all the teasing he once did.
``I feel like an idiot about it,'' he says. Other times, however,
he's glad he remembers. ``If you don't learn from something,'' he
says, ``you're going to do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   His speech the other day in the chapel at St. Sebastian's marked
the first time he had said out loud what he learned that June day
in sixth grade. He elicited laughter, at nobody else's expense,
with the way he described being jumped. He closed with a passage
from the Bible, from the first book of Peter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, all of you, be of one mind, sympathetic, loving
toward one another, compassionate, humble,'' Ted read. ``Do not
return evil for evil, or insult for insult; but, on the contrary, a
blessing, because to this you are called, that you might inherit a
blessing.''

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDDLESEX, N.J. _ The Gladwells' annual family reunion is some
shindig. Polish sausages sizzle on the grill, and a dozen kids
splash in the swimming pool. Proud grandmothers cradle new babies,
aunts and cousins catch up in animated conversations, and a
country-and-western band of dads and uncles fills the sun-baked,
suburban backyard with a strong beat and sweet harmonies.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Gladwell kin flew in from as far as California. The
Sumski brothers came from Long Island, and Karen Taylor, their
sister, drove up from Virginia with her two sons. Relatives
greeting Alex, her older boy, couldn't get over what a man he's
become and how much he looks like his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the spitting image of Jeff in his expressions, his
mannerisms, his wit,'' says Melanie Gladwell, a cousin from San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to think I'm like my dad,'' says Alex, a tall, husky,
and talkative 13-year-old who's not too shy to cut in for a slow
dance with his pretty, red-haired cousin. ``He was a great guy. He
played music, he told bad jokes, and he had a certain way of doing
things that made everybody happy. As I become a man, I'd like to be
like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a successful career in Washington and scholarly
credentials, Alex's father, Jeff Taylor, is remembered at these
reunions as a regular guy, humble and nice, a model parent, and the
life of the party who loved to jump on stage singing his own silly
songs and strumming a guitar. Taylor's brain cancer and death three
years ago, when he was 41, clearly left a huge hole in the family's
heart.
</P>
<P>
   It also launched his wife, Karen Sumski Taylor, on a difficult
journey to find the stamina, means, faith, and humor to fill Jeff's
big fathering shoes and to raise their two boys, Alex and Luke, 6,
to be men as accomplished and decent as he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you, I was worried. I wasn't sure Karen had the
character to carry on,'' says her brother, Richard, who admired
Jeff so much that he named his only son after him. ``But when I
look at Alex and Luke now, I know Jeff must be up in heaven,
smiling.''
</P>
<P>
   No one questions Karen's devotion to the task. A quintessential
New Yorker _ fast-paced, in-your-face, and kind of feisty _ she has
determined that in spite of their loss and a culture that stacks
the cards against it, she is going to bring up her boys to become
moral, mannered men.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning, I told myself there was no way I was gonna
let these boys fall through the cracks,'' Karen says. ``But I'd be
lying to say it's not frightening raising two boys, particularly
one who is headed for high school. And I always wonder if I am
doing the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually she is just too caught up in the everyday logistical and
financial challenges of single motherhood to dwell on the big
parenting picture. Her dining room table is piled high with
still-to-be-sewn costumes for the middle school play, in which Alex
stars as the wizard in the ``Wizard of Oz.'' The catalog and
curriculum she was hired to write on urban-school gardens is still
in the computer. Another kindergarten mother just called, irate
that angel-faced Luke smacked her son a time or two because he
doesn't attend Sunday school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call Luke the mutant alien in this family,'' Karen laughs,
marveling that she bore a blond, dimpled child so athletic that he
can hit a golf ball over the garage and so self-composed he can
spend a whole afternoon alone with a GameBoy. ``But he's no
religious fanatic.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's noon _ drop everything!
</P>
<P>
   Karen, who dubs herself ``the crisis queen,'' needs to deliver
an easy-to-chew lunch to Alex at school. Over the weekend, he took
a baseball right in the braces. It broke a bone in his mouth,
knocked some of his teeth loose, mangled orthodontic wires, and
caused a bloody mess.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I don't know whether to sit down and laugh or cry,''
says Karen, rescuing a pan of overcooked rice from the stove.
``This parenthood stuff is just way too much for one person. I lean
on my neighbors, I lean on people at my church, but believe me, it
is just not the same as having a dad around.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Jeff Taylor got sick, raising the boys was very much the
joint project of two well-educated and financially-secure parents
who saw no limits to the opportunities they could provide. Jeff
held a doctorate in economics and was on the fast track at the
International Monetary Fund. The Taylors of Fairfax, Va., dreamed
large dreams of exciting travel, a grander home, perhaps even
moving the family to China, where Jeff had studied on a Fulbright
fellowship.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe because of his sheer competence, or his laid-back West
Coast upbringing, or the simple fact that he was a man, Karen
wanted him to build a powerful bond with the boys. Page after page
of Alex's photo album shows a totally devoted dad: Jeff on ice
skates, riding horses, walking on the beach, camping with the Boy
Scouts, coaching soccer, opening Christmas presents, balancing a
bicycle, breaking a pinata at a birthday party. In the morning,
Jeff would read Alex the newspaper. At night, he would play his
guitar and sing his sons to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a better father than I was a mother,'' Karen says,
surveying her toy-cluttered kitchen. ``He was gentle, patient,
calm, always wanting to do the right thing and not make a mistake.
I came from a much more knee-jerk, reactive family. As a parent, I
was all over the map. Jeff showed me there was another way.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in middle-class Massapequa, N.Y. _ she sat next to
comedian Jerry Seinfeld in an eighth-grade social studies class _
Karen was intimidated by her own father, who was controlling and
very strict. In college, she wanted to study botany, her first
love. He forbade it, steering her into medical technology because
it would provide her with a trade. Edward Sumski mostly expected
his daughter to marry and ``stay home and raise children,'' Karen
recalls, something she almost didn't do because of her own unhappy
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Jo-Anne Sumski, who is married to Karen's brother Peter, says
her father-in-law was ``a volatile, touch-the-belt man who was
always yelling'' at his offspring. ``Karen had to reteach herself
and make sure what didn't work for her and her brothers would not
be revisited on her children,'' Jo-Anne says.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Taylor, by contrast, came from a big, nurturing, Oregon
family, and he had a close relationship with his father, a school
superintendent. When he met Karen in Washington, D.C., in 1977,
Jeff was headed for a doctoral program at the Unversity of
Michigan. He convinced her to quit her job, marry him, move to
Michigan, and get her master's degree.
</P>
<P>
   The Taylors were married for 17 years. ``As I think about
raising my boys to be men, I look to what I was attracted to in
Jeff _ his intelligence, his integrity, his gentleness, his
generosity, the value he put on education,'' Karen says ``These are
qualities anybody could have, but I find them particularly
attractive in a man.
</P>
<P>
   ``He also acknowledged my needs, which is how I would want my
boys to be in a relationship,'' she adds. ``I want them to treat
women as equals and to encourage their spouses to grow, to achieve,
and to be what they want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen, who stopped working after Alex was born and Jeff's job
demanded more overseas travel, now has plans to pursue her early
ambitions _ horticulture or floral design. She calls Jeff's
pension, life insurance, and other benefits from the IMF ``a gift''
that, with careful budgeting, allows her to keep their comfortable
house in a quiet, family-friendly subdivision and stay at home, at
least until Luke is in grade school.
</P>
<P>
   It also offers Karen, who is 44, the opportunity to be a
full-time parent, a role she embraces with gusto and drive.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just that she hangs around their schools a lot, keeping
tabs on the boys' activities, assignments, and friends. She also
has no qualms about phoning a teacher to report that Alex left his
homework on the kitchen table, or quizzing mothers of the girls who
keep calling and inviting Alex to ``hang out.''
</P>
<P>
   She is also very direct. When Karen heard that one of the kids
in her car pool had a complaint (that she's ``always late''), she
invited the boy into the front seat of her minivan for a little
heart-to-heart chat.

<P>
   BOONEVILLE, Ark. _ Bill Wagner walks through his half-built
farmhouse and sees the life he had planned for his family. That's
the kitchen, he says, pointing to a row of exposed two-by-fours.
There's the bathroom, and there's a bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   All are unfinished, imaginary rooms in a wooden husk Wagner was
transforming into a home, nail by nail and board by board, until
Oct. 10, 1994. That was the day the farmhouse became the equivalent
of a broken clock, its hands frozen to record the precise time of a
bomb blast.
</P>
<P>
   On that day, Bill Wagner's son Willi announced to his parents
that he is gay. It was Willi's 14th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   That very night, as Bill Wagner stood watching the sun set over
his small, beloved farm at the southern edge of the Ozark
Mountains, he made an announcement of his own: To protect Willi,
the family would move away from this Bible Belt town of 3,408
people, where homosexuality is still seen by many as proof of the
devil, away from the blue-collar warehouse job where he had worked
for 24 years, away from the land where he wanted to live out his
days.
</P>
<P>
   A bearded bear of a man, Bill Wagner would move his family to
Fayetteville, a relatively liberal college community two hours away
that bills itself as ``The first home of Bill and Hillary
Clinton.'' He would find a new home, a ranch-style house trashed by
the frat boys who lived there previously, and he would find new
work, on the overnight shift at the local Wal-Mart. It was worth
it, to give Willi a chance for a safe and happy life, to help him
find a place where an outcast boy might fit in.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Wagner couldn't have known then of the torments that would
come, of the beating that would drive Willi to quit high school, of
the battles with school officials and state laws, of the way his
own parents would reject him and his only son.
</P>
<P>
   He also couldn't have predicted the joys, of growing closer to
his boy through hard times, of loving him unconditionally, and of
chaperoning a tuxedoed Willi to a ``gay prom'' in Dallas last
month, watching him walk to the dance floor with a rolling,
rambling teenage strut.
</P>
<P>
   All he knew then was that it was a father's place to do the best
he could for a son, even one he didn't quite understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really like living in town, but you do what you have
to do,'' Wagner, 45, says during a rare visit to the abandoned
farm, which he and his wife Carolyn still own despite the financial
strain. ``As bad as it's been at times, it would have been worse if
we stayed. He got beat up in Fayetteville, but out here you get
killed for being different.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagner says it calmly, without drama or self-pity. It is a
feature of his personality, a mix of equanimity and pragmatism,
that emerges again when a nail pierces his car tire on the drive
away from the farm. He gets out, inspects the problem, quietly
decides what to do, then does it.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving the farm, though, Wagner sees two huge birds
riding the wind, lolling through the air in gentle circles. Bill
and Carolyn watch silently. They are joined by Willi and a friend,
Sarah Vollmer, who came along for the drive. Sarah calls out:
``Look, hawks!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope,'' Bill says softly. ``They're buzzards. Something
must've died around here.''
</P>
<P>
   His words have a dual meaning, but he seems not to notice.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bill Wagner was born in 1953 in Odessa, Texas, where his father
_ ``a redneck,'' Bill says _ was working in the oil fields. After a
sojourn in South America, the family settled in rural Mulberry,
Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Bill's parents, Otis and Miss Jackie Wagner, as she is known,
had grown up in Mulberry. Their families had lived in the rural
part of northwest Arkansas since before the Civil War, during which
the Wagners fought on the Confederate side.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, Otis Wagner bought a small cattle ranch, using Bill and
his twin brother, Bob, as homegrown farm hands. Mostly, they
communicated through work orders and criticism. ``I hope I have a
better relationship with my son than my dad did with me. I try not
to yell at him as much,'' Bill says.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from high school, Bill worked in the local hay
fields, in an ice house, and as a roughneck, ``slinging chain'' for
a gas-drilling crew headed by his father, who continued working in
the oil and gas fields even while running the ranch. Bill was
exempted from military service during the Vietnam War, drawing
number 268 in the draft lottery, high enough for him to stay home
and work.
</P>
<P>
   At 19 he met Carolyn, and in short order they fell in love and
eloped to Dallas. He eventually found a job loading upholstery in a
warehouse in Fort Smith, Ark., near the Oklahoma border, and they
settled in for what seemed like an ordinary life. Bill would work
at the warehouse and volunteer at a local rodeo. Carolyn, who had
returned to school to become a nurse, gave birth to their daughter
Clara in 1977. Willi followed three years later.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Willi was ``all boy,'' his father says _ climbing
trees, riding his blue bike, joining the Cub Scouts, making regular
trips to the emergency room for stitches and minor repairs. He was
bright, playful, and not always obedient.
</P>
<P>
   One day in kindergarten, Willi and another boy were sent out of
the classroom. Bill says it was so he could clean erasers; Willi
says it was because he was misbehaving. Whatever the reason, both
agree that Willi and his pal figured out how to lock the classroom
door from the outside, trapping the teacher and their classmates
inside. By the time they opened the door, the teacher was in tears
and one little girl was desperately in need of a bathroom. Feeling
guilty, Willi gave her a hug.
</P>
<P>
   Another time, Willi caught a snake. Despite his parents'
insistence that he keep it in a closed jar, the next thing they
knew it was slithering across the kitchen floor. ``You'd have to be
real aware of everything you put down, because no matter what it
was, he'd get into it. He was pure curiosity,'' Bill says.
</P>
<P>
   It was around that time that Willi was diagnosed as dyslexic _
just like his father _ and suffering from attention
deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Doctors prescribed Ritalin, a
calming drug that he would take through the seventh grade.
</P>
<P>
   As he watched Willi grow, Bill knew that his son had few
friends, knew he didn't fit in Booneville. But he never suspected
that Willi might be gay. He missed the signs. ``When he would have
other kids over to the house, they were always oohing and aahing
over pictures of Cindy Crawford. Willi had no reaction to it. At
the time, I just figured he hadn't gone into that phase,'' Bill
says.
</P>
<P>
   But Willi, now 18, says that for as long as he could remember,
he knew he had no interest in supermodels, at least not the female
ones. ``It wasn't a sudden realization,'' he says. ``I always knew
I was different. I never wanted the prince to get the princess at
the end of the story.''
</P>
<P>
   His 6-foot-1 frame folded into an overstuffed chair, Willi lets
out a half-laugh, half-cough, then lights another Maverick Special,
a generic cigarette that comes in a black box with what looks like
a gold lawman's star. A dark blonde forelock droops over his eye,
and he pushes it away with fingernails painted a bright chrome, a
nail polish called ``side-swiped silver.'' Two small hoop earrings
dangle from his left ear.
</P>
<P>
   As he grew into an awkward puberty, Willi moved from baby fat
to, in his words, ``really fat.'' By 13, he weighed 250 pounds, and
his schoolmates in Booneville were cruel, taunting him, pressing
his buttons, picking fights. He spent more and more time with his
dog or alone, playing Nintendo and reading science fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Sad and lonely, Willi made several suicidal gestures that in
retrospect seem designed as much to gain attention as to end his
life. Having heard news reports about ``flesh-eating bacteria,'' he
ate a plateful of raw ground beef, hoping it would contain the germ
and either kill him or devour all the fat on his body. Another time
he lay down in a road and cried. He raided the family medicine
cabinet for prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   His parents brought Willi to a private psychiatric hospital in
Fayetteville. On his 14th birthday, several weeks after his
admission, they went to the hospital bearing balloons and a giant
cookie.
</P>
<P>
   But Willi didn't want to talk about his birthday. Hesitating,
with long gaps between words, he choked out the truth: ``Mom. .
.Dad. . .I'm. . .gay. I don't think I'm gay. I don't want to be
gay. I just am.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Wagner, who has since become an Arkansas gay rights
activist, says she was dumbstruck at first. ``I felt like a brick
wall had just fallen on me,'' she says.

 &HT;    Moneytalk: Shoring up your retirement base
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new study reaffirms a painful situation: Most Americans think
they will have enough money to support a comfortable retirement,
but many haven't done much to make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   I talked last week about investing for retirement, in a column
you can find at www
</P>
<P>
   .accessatlanta.com/business.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, a Washington think tank released an important
survey on how Americans are dealing with a much broader range of
tasks that go into building a prosperous retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 Retirement Confidence Survey shows we have a high
degree of confidence things will come out right. In the telephone
survey of more than 1,000 people, 71 percent said they are
confident or very confident they will have enough money to retire.
</P>
<P>
   The study also indicates a high degree of self-reliance. Nearly
half the respondents said their personal savings will be their most
important source of retirement income. Only one in eight said they
look to Social Security or other government programs.
</P>
<P>
   It sure does sound good. But the study also points out specific
actions that many people haven't taken. Here's a look at the most
common shortcomings and some ideas for overcoming them:
</P>
<P>
   _ Only 49 percent of us have tried to figure out how much we
need to save for retirement, up from 32 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, making your best estimate of your future needs can be
monstrously complex. The question is how reliable a projection you
want.
</P>
<P>
   For a general idea, there are any number of worksheets
available. I like the Ballpark Estimate worksheet developed by the
American Savings Education Council. The ASEC is one of the sponsors
of the survey, along with the Employee Benefit Research Institute
and pollster Mathew Greenwald and Associates.
</P>
<P>
   You can find an interactive version of the worksheet on the
Internet at www.asec.org. For a printed version, write to ASEC
Savings Education Brochures, American Savings Education Council,
Suite 600, 2121 K St. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20037-1896. (Send
along a self-addressed envelope bearing $1.01 postage.)
</P>
<P>
   The worksheets _ including a somewhat more detailed version in
the retirement resource center at www.vanguard.com _ have some
drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   For example, they won't help you decide how much risk you're
willing to take to boost your returns. They don't give much
guidance in deciding how costly a retirement you want to save for,
either.
</P>
<P>
   For more reliable estimates, you'll have to do some heavy
reading or hire a professional to help. A number of certified
financial planners will accept a one-time fee to draw up a plan.
The fee might run from $500 to $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ Only 16 percent of Americans have saved more than $100,000 for
retirement. The median was $29,514.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to increase your retirement stash in the future,
you'll have save more from each paycheck now.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the study showed that 57 percent of Americans
could save $20 a week more than they are doing now. Only one in
eight say they would have to give up anything else to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you put $20 a week into a tax-deferred account, such as
an IRA, and earn an 8 percent return on your investments. After 10
years you would have $16,300, in 20 years it would be $51,400 and
in 30 years it would more than $127,200.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Fear continues to be one of the primary motivators for
saving for retirement,'' the survey asserts.
</P>
<P>
   Large numbers of respondents said they save because they can't
count on Social Security (53 percent), they've seen other people
struggling in retirement (48 percent) and they've realized that
time is running out (39 percent).
</P>
<P>
   But fear also can work against you.
</P>
<P>
   ``The negative motivations tend to freeze you, make you want put
your head in the sand and not do anything,'' said Elizabeth Jetton,
a certified financial planner with Financial Vision Advisors.
``Positive motivations make you want get in control and take
action. You've identified what you want. It's the difference
between being scared and hiding, or being drawn to make something
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The trick, Jetton said, is to figure out your goals and what it
will take to reach them, then break the process down into baby
steps and start immediately.
</P>
<P>
   _ Few people know when they will be eligible for Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with that is easy. To order a free estimate of how much
Social Security benefits you'll be entitled to, and when, call the
Social Security Administration at 1-800-772-1213. You can also
order your individualized report over the Internet at www.ssa.gov.
</P>
<P>
   _ Only 36 percent have thought about insurance for long-term or
nursing home care.
</P>
<P>
   Because this can be expensive and hard to shop for, you may want
help from an insurance agent or financial planner.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to do it yourself, you can get a free pamphlet, ``A
Shopper's Guide to Long-Term Care Insurance,'' from the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners, 120 W. 12th St., Suite
1100, Kansas City, Mo. 64105.

 &HT;    Let's put the stigmatism back in curse words
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett

<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ A 25-year-old computer programmer from
Detroit has been found guilty of swearing with vigor and frequency
in front of children and faces a possible 90 days in jail. Seems he
was canoeing on the remote Rifle River when he fell overboard and
let loose with a string of obscenities fit to curl an old salt's
forelock.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's easy to understand the hapless sailor's
frustration at finding himself arse over teacup (my grandmother
used to say that) in a frigid river with a bunch of dry folks
watching, his timing was lousy because there was a family with
young children in a nearby canoe. Taking exception to the bad boy's
trash mouth, Dad instructed the older ones not to listen while Mom
clapped her hands over the baby's ears. Later, they filed a
complaint based on a 103-year-old ban on swearing in front of women
and children. The judge dropped the ``women'' part for obvious and
politically correct reasons, but the American Civil Liberties Union
is fighting the conviction saying it clearly violates the
Constitution. The executive director of the Michigan ACLU reminds
us that we hear unpleasant language every day _ ``on the streets,
on the radio and television, in sports stadiums, and many other
places.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah sure, but that doesn't make it any less revolting.
</P>
<P>
   There was never a ban on swearing in my house. It just wasn't
necessary. My father, as was expected of men in those days, cut
loose with a ``hell'' or a ``damn'' every once in a while when the
situation called for it, otherwise he minded his mouth _ even when
it called for a superhuman effort.
</P>
<P>
   It was early spring and my father had just made his annual
pilgrimage to the attic for screens. He hosed them off in the back
yard and leaned them against the garage to dry. That was on Sunday
afternoon. Monday morning over breakfast, he mentioned to my mother
that he intended to paint them that afternoon when he came in from
work.
</P>
<P>
   Since I'd been with him when he bought the paint and that
special little padded thing for rubbing it on, I figured I knew as
much about the job as anyone else, so that afternoon as my mother
lay reading her latest Kathleen Norris novel and popping
chocolate-covered cherries, I set to work and painted every last
screen. By the time Daddy pulled into the driveway, I'd finished
the job and could hardly wait to show him what I'd done. The way I
had it figured, I'd be up for at least a super deluxe fudge sundae
at Sally Ann's Ice Cream
</P>
<P>
   Parlor for my effort.
</P>
<P>
   Things didn't quite work out as planned. Daddy took one look at
the screens, muttered, ``Thank you, darling,'' and marched into the
house. I followed at a distance because I knew when my father's
face was (SET ITAL)that(END ITAL) red, all was not well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you seen the screens?'' he asked my mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're leaning against the garage where you left them,'' was
her noncommittal reply.
</P>
<P>
   Daddy suggested they were not quite as he'd left them and asked
her if she'd like to take a look at (SET ITAL)her(END ITAL)
daughter's handiwork. All in a row, the three of us paraded down
the drive to the side of the garage where the screens were propped
drying in the late afternoon sun. Mother paled. Daddy got red again
and spluttered about all of the little holes being plugged with
black paint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry,'' my mother warned, ``if you're going to swear, do not
do it in front of the neighbors or the child.'' As Daddy took one
last sorrowful look at what used to be our screens, she added,
``and do not take the Lord's name in vain.''
</P>
<P>
   Profanity used to be a private thing, and while I confess to
being capable of holding my own in any waterfront bar, I am still
offended by the loose lips of a liberated generation where the only
known adjective begins with ``F'' and is used every fourth word.
Makes a body wonder why the English language has half a million
words and why so many folks use only a few four-letter ones.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ One winter's morning 11 years ago, Edward Palmer
dressed his three children, loaded them into his car and set off
across Atlanta, searching, like a lost soul, for a Baptist church
that would take him in.
</P>
<P>
   His pilgrimage ended at Hopewell Baptist, a tiny neighborhood
church. Sunday services had already begun, but Edward strode right
in, oblivious to the ushers and well-dressed church folk on either
side, and seated himself and his children in a front-row pew.
</P>
<P>
   After a heart-heavy pause, he stood. He had come to confess his
failings to that church full of strangers, to tell them how, in his
relentless pursuit of an engineering career, he had given short
shrift to his family, leading his wife to walk out the door.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he broke down in tears. For in that moment, his focus
had shifted from his own inner turmoil to the 5-year-old boy
standing next to him, his son, Jadwin.
</P>
<P>
   Got to save that boy.
</P>
<P>
   The judge who had presided over his divorce had decided to award
him custody of the child, saying that only a father could prepare
his son for the world that awaits him.
</P>
<P>
   Got to raise that boy.
</P>
<P>
   It was a commandment he would embrace, though he would have to
figure out for himself how to do so. His own father slipped out of
his life when he was a young child and his parents divorced; an
ailing grandmother was the adult anchor of his young life.
</P>
<P>
   Jadwin, he resolved, would get something quite different: His
son would never doubt his demands of him, never wonder at his
dreams for him, never miss his stern determination that his boy
would not fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've go to remember, I came from a broken family before so I
always promised never to let my family be the same way,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The love would prove harder to show. It has not been an easy
path for either father or son, though Edward is hardly the only
father to struggle to balance great expectations and tenderness,
his own high ambitions and the time a child needs.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is he alone among fathers in coming down, when it counts, on
the side of expectations and ambition.
</P>
<P>
   ``That judge gave me a responsibility and I intend to follow
through,'' Edward says, ``I can be friends, but it is my job first
to teach him. I don't call that rigid. I call that being a teacher
and father.''
</P>
<P>
   A teacher and father who still struggles to balance family time
with a frenzied career.
</P>
<P>
   Since Edward Palmer, 47, walked into Hopewell Baptist Church, he
has traded one busy lifestyle for another one. His religious
``calling'' came shortly after that Sunday morning but it wasn't
until 1995 that he left his job at an electrical engineering
company to become the assistant minister of Hopewell Baptist, which
has grown into one of the largest and most opulent churches in the
Atlanta area.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer, who is also studying for a master's degree in theology,
spends most of his waking hours counseling, teaching, and traveling
as far as India and Haiti to serve others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm busy in such a different way, not seeking my own selfish
desire, but seeking to help people,'' he says. ``That is the
difference. Back then, it was about helping me.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While his father leads his parish, Jadwin, now 16, has rebelled.
He is casual about school work, preferring to play the class clown.
He has risked and earned his father's displeasure.
</P>
<P>
   The women in the family mainly blame the schism between father
and son on the sort of generation gap common in many households.
But they also wonder if Jadwin's behavior is a symptom of his
father's preoccupation with his spiritual work.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer is mindful that his sternness may widen the emotional
divide between them, but he says it is a risk he will take in order
to protect his son from the low expectations that have defeated too
many young black men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a father has to make time for his children,'' he says,
then shifts the onus to his son. ``But he hesitates to talk to us.
. . . I tell him he has to open up and allow others in his life.''
</P>
<P>
   The gap between father and son hasn't always been so wide. There
was a time when young Jadwin didn't want to be anywhere but near
his father, says Alice Palmer, Jadwin's paternal grandmother.
``When he was young they were real close. Ed was a single father. I
think as Jadwin got older he began to rebel. I think he is looking
for attention,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Jadwin lose his mother to his parents' divorce, but
his father had little time to spare after coming home from a busy
day, cooking dinner and cleaning the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jadwin never recovered from not having a relationship with his
mother,'' says his oldest sister, Sharell, 20, who along with their
grandmother is Jadwin's confidant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did miss her in the beginning, and maybe that has
contributed to things,'' Jadwin says.
</P>
<P>
   Sharell followed another emotional path. Only 8 when her mother
left, she wanted nothing more than to help out her father.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jadwin thinks I favor Sharell,'' says Edward, ``but I love
them the same. It's just that Sharell knew about those hard times.
We built a bond. She has proved herself.''
</P>
<P>
   In those early days, members of Hopewell Baptist, so moved by
the young black man who poured his heart out to them, rallied
around the Palmer family. The women would braid Sharell's hair and
help babysit Jadwin.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the family was mending itself. Edward married
Deborah Wallace, and together they had two girls, Chloe, 3, and
Amber, 16 months. And, just as Hopewell grew from a small
congregation to one with 14,000 members, Edward Palmer has thrived
spiritually and professionally; he now supervises 35 ministers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now he is much busier than before. He takes his job more
seriously because it's a calling from God,'' says Sharell.
</P>
<P>
   But as the tapestry of Edward's life unfolded, Jadwin was
pressed to the sidelines, his self-image fraying. Jadwin shares his
father's church-bred good manners, but beyond that the gap between
them grew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jadwin is not the type to take the initiative, so I try to
wait and watch to see what he wants to do (with me),'' says Edward.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad says I am a class clown,'' Jadwin says. ``It's just
that the other kids think I am funny.''
</P>
<P>
   But the jokes in class have been a problem for teachers at
Collins Hill High School who say they can't compete with Jadwin,
who playfully imitates them as they give lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said while he is smart and a joy to teach, he is very
distracting, too'' Deborah, his stepmother, says.

 &HT;    Rookie Barrett is doubly valuable
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Being there Opening Day wouldn't be such a big deal.
After all, he hadn't even spent one minute in Class AAA yet.
Michael Barrett was destined for an honorable major league career
with the Montreal Expos. Every scouting report said so.
Nevertheless, his timetable insisted there was one charter flight
he absolutely had to make this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told myself last spring my No. 1 goal was not to make the
team out of spring training,'' he said. ``It was to make the trip
to Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrett comes home tonight, four years, two weeks and six days
after the Expos plucked him from Atlanta's Pace Academy, their No.
1 pick in the 1995 draft. He has never seen the inside of Turner
Field but will do so this week from several angles _ from behind
the plate and from third base _ when Montreal plays a three-game
series with the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   And if his eyes look like they're spinning like pinwheels out
there, that's no act. The big leagues seem even bigger from the
inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each day is a mental challenge,'' said Barrett, 22. ``The
energy on the field is just incredible. Each day you have to get up
like it's the World Series in order to hang in there and stay
alive.''
</P>
<P>
   He's alive, all right, hitting .278 with 27 RBIs, and if he ever
learns to hit away from Olympic Stadium _ Barrett's road average is
.219 _ he is rookie of the year material. If St. Louis's Joe
McEwing, Pittsburgh's Warren Morris and Florida's Alex Gonzalez are
the front-running rookies, Barrett is just a length behind the
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   He plays both third and catcher well enough to routinely bump
veterans Shane Andrews and Chris Widger out of the lineup,
remarkable in that he'd never put on catching gear until 1996. He's
already had a taste of history. During a quick eight-game call-up
last September, he was behind the plate for Mark McGwire 69th and
70th home runs on the season's final day in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   But the historic bows to the sentimental this week, during his
first games in his hometown. In some ways, the kid who watched the
Braves across the street at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium is still
growing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old place had a lot of memories,'' Barrett said. ``I had a
chance to talk with Fred McGriff the other day when we were playing
Tampa Bay. I told him I was a big fan of the Crime Dog. To be on
the same field with him was kind of special.''
</P>
<P>
   The Expos made an obstacle course of Barrett's rush to the
majors. Drafted as a shortstop after helping Pace to three
consecutive Class A state championships, Barrett hit .311 in rookie
ball in 1995 but was informed the final day of instructional league
that he was being shifted to catcher. He'd never caught in his
life.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett took a week-long crash course that fall, made a strong
impression the next spring but was exhausting himself. No one ever
told him he didn't have to jump up from his crouch to make his
throw back to the mound, or than catchers weren't expected to
sprint on and off the field during the changeovers.
</P>
<P>
   But the position came naturally and halfway into the 1996
season, he made the South Atlantic League All-Star team. In the
Class A Florida State League in 1997, he threw out a strong 33
percent of stolen base attempts. Last year at Class AA Harrisburg,
he made the Eastern League All-Star team, pumped his stolen base
percentage to 38 percent but was informed after the break he would
be playing third base.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of Widger in Montreal, after coming over from
Seattle in the 1997 Jeff Fassero trade, had made the organization
rethink Barrett's future. Learning an infield position wouldn't
hurt him, even if Baseball America ranked him the best catching
prospect in the minors last season. He went to camp last February
ready for anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barrett's learning to play in the big leagues,'' manager
Felipe Alou said after the Expos broke camp. ``And it isn't fair to
have him alternating from one position to the other.''
</P>
<P>
   But times have proven otherwise and Alou has even used Barrett
at shortstop this season in a pinch. He has become the Expos' best
contact hitter and is ranked sixth in the league for fewest
strikeouts per plate appearance. The first pitch he ever saw at
Olympic Stadium, he hit over the wall last April off New York's
Masato Yoshii.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett knows his run production will have to improve if he is
going to be a third baseman and also knows his game-calling at
catcher will improve as he feels his way through the NL the first
few times. But if this is the way he will make it _ two positions,
both suited for improvement _ that's the way he wants it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy doing both because I don't think there's a person in
the game that's doing what I'm doing now,'' he said. ``It makes my
place in the game very unique and it's something I value. I feel
it's a special quality.''

 &HT;    Many hysterectomies may become procedure of past, thanks to
surgery alternative
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The question was never if Lora Black would have a
hysterectomy, but when. Medication hadn't curbed the excessive
menstrual bleeding that had made her anemic and disrupted her life.
Her three older sisters had undergone hysterectomies. Now it was
her turn.
</P>
<P>
   But when? When could she take four to six weeks off to recover?
``There's never a good time to stop functioning,'' she says, but
the summer seemed less bad than others and, better still, was
months away at the time she decided.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Black's doctor told her about a new alternative
to surgery that uses a heated balloon to burn off the uterine
lining, which was her source of boundless bleeding. Most of it
sounded good, but the word she kept having trouble with was
``new.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she saw a patient talk about her intra-uterine balloon
therapy on a network news show ``I guess I had to hear it from
another woman,'' Black says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell her she believed television more than she believed
me,'' says Dr. Luis Morales, Black's gynecologist at Miami Valley
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Morales performed the procedure on a Friday last December. Black
spent the next day on her feet doing her Christmas shopping. She
went back to work that Monday as an occupational hand therapist
with her own business, subcontracting occupational therapists to
area hospitals and doctors' offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been incredible,'' she says six months later. ``I can go
on vacation whenever I want. I can wear a white dress any day I
want.'' She no longer needs to pile bath towels on her bed before
going to sleep. She never has to excuse herself every five minutes
from her job, a tennis game or whatever anymore to run to the
bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really just dictated my life,'' Black says, ``It was
getting harder and harder to plan anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors expect this balloon therapy _ and some other new
treatments for different causes of heavy uterine bleeding _ will
put a serious dent in the 600,000 hysterectomies in this country
every year. After Caesarean sections, hysterectomies are the second
most common surgery for women and probably the second most commonly
criticized surgery for being unnecessary. The balloon procedure
could replace 20 percent to 30 percent of those surgeries,
generally those not involving fibroids or cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Excessive menstrual bleeding is more than an inconvenience. It
causes anemia in about two-thirds of the women who suffer it, which
can lead to fatigue at least and deadly organ damage from iron
deficiency at worst.
</P>
<P>
   For 40 percent of the women in a clinical trial of the
intra-uterine balloon, the bleeding made it impossible to work
outside the home. But after the procedure, that figure was 4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Black, now 43, was so tormented by her floods of bleeding that
she asked her doctor if there were some kind of medication that
would bring on menopause and end her menstrual periods entirely.
After two or three years of it, the blood bank turned her down for
being anemic and she braced herself for a hysterectomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought it was my turn,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But she knew it was a far riskier passage than gray hair or
reading glasses. On her job, she had talked to women whose bladder
control had been hindered by hysterectomies, even when only the
uterus is removed without the cervix or ovaries. Pelvic pain,
sexual dysfunction and depression can be other side effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a major surgical procedure,'' Morales says, with all the
accompanying risks of blood loss, infection and complications from
general anesthesia. It also costs four to five times as much as the
balloon procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he acknowledges, some doctors probably do more
hysterectomies than are necessary. The Dayton area in particular
has ``about double the rate of Cincinnati,'' says Rich Gunza, the
local executive director of Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, and
a heavy lead over national rates.
</P>
<P>
   But Gunza and Morales both say it's often the patients who
demand hysterectomies. The operation stops the bleeding quickly and
completely, while medication can be a lengthy process with mixed
success. ``We spend more of our time telling people they don't need
a hysterectomy,'' Morales says.
</P>
<P>
   The balloon makes his case easier. Approved in December 1997,
it's a straightforward outpatient procedure that takes about an
hour. ``It's no more uncomfortable than an annual exam,'' says
Black, although cramping is common enough that Morales often needs
to use an additional sedative.
</P>
<P>
   Black apparently had adenomyosis, a condition where the lining
of the uterus grows into surrounding muscle, but it can't be
diagnosed positively without removing the uterus. She also had
fibroids, which are benign tumors in the uterine muscle. Those are
the most common causes of menstrual bleeding, but Black was unusual
in having tumors in locations where the device could reach them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like a balloon on a stick,'' she says. ``It's
actually a straw.'' Inserted vaginally, the balloon is filled with
sterile sugar water that is heated to about 87 degrees. Once
filled, the balloon conforms to the endometrium, the uterine lining
and the primary source of menstrual bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to burn off as much of that lining as you can, so it
cannot do anything,'' Morales says. That leaves a woman essentially
unable to bear children but still able to develop a complicated
pregnancy, so the procedure is only for women whose families are
complete.
</P>
<P>
   An even newer treatment, for fibroids, does not necessarily rule
out pregnancy. Dr. Christopher Conley at Miami Valley has done four
uterine-artery embolizations, radiological procedures in which tiny
solid particles are snaked through an artery and left where they
block the main blood supply to the uterus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fibroids die without the blood,'' Morales says, ``but
there is a lot of collateral circulation to the uterus, so it is
not damaged.''
</P>
<P>
   Within two weeks of her embolization, Kathleen Hanover was free
of her symptoms, which were similar to a mid-trimester pregnancy.
Her fibroids shrank by half in five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tremendous,'' says Hanover, who works for the Miami
Valley American Heart Association. ``I was looking at sterility and
six weeks of recovery and after effects for the rest of my life
with a hysterectomy. I literally jumped up and down when I saw in
the Internet it was being done in Dayton. I was prepared to go
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Black still has very light periods, as do about 80 percent of
women after the balloon procedure. Surveys have shown an
extraordinary rate of 86 percent later saying they were ``very
satisfied'' and another 10 percent ``satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People think because their mothers and sisters had
hysterectomies that they have to have them, too,'' Black says.
``But even if the problem is hereditary, the hysterectomy isn't.
Technology has changed things. All my three sisters have told me,
`We wish this would have been available.''

   DAYTON, Ohio _ The question was never if Lora Black would have a
hysterectomy, but when. Medication hadn't curbed the excessive
menstrual bleeding that had made her anemic and disrupted her life.
Her three older sisters had undergone hysterectomies. Now it was
her turn.
</P>
<P>
   But when? When could she take four to six weeks off to recover?
``There's never a good time to stop functioning,'' she says, but
the summer seemed less bad than others and, better still, was
months away at the time she decided.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Black's doctor told her about a new alternative
to surgery that uses a heated balloon to burn off the uterine
lining, which was her source of boundless bleeding. Most of it
sounded good, but the word she kept having trouble with was
``new.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she saw a patient talk about her intra-uterine balloon
therapy on a network news show ``I guess I had to hear it from
another woman,'' Black says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell her she believed television more than she believed
me,'' says Dr. Luis Morales, Black's gynecologist at Miami Valley
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Morales performed the procedure on a Friday last December. Black
spent the next day on her feet doing her Christmas shopping. She
went back to work that Monday as an occupational hand therapist
with her own business, subcontracting occupational therapists to
area hospitals and doctors' offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been incredible,'' she says six months later. ``I can go
on vacation whenever I want. I can wear a white dress any day I
want.'' She no longer needs to pile bath towels on her bed before
going to sleep. She never has to excuse herself every five minutes
from her job, a tennis game or whatever anymore to run to the
bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really just dictated my life,'' Black says, ``It was
getting harder and harder to plan anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors expect this balloon therapy _ and some other new
treatments for different causes of heavy uterine bleeding _ will
put a serious dent in the 600,000 hysterectomies in this country
every year. After Caesarean sections, hysterectomies are the second
most common surgery for women and probably the second most commonly
criticized surgery for being unnecessary. The balloon procedure
could replace 20 percent to 30 percent of those surgeries,
generally those not involving fibroids or cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Excessive menstrual bleeding is more than an inconvenience. It
causes anemia in about two-thirds of the women who suffer it, which
can lead to fatigue at least and deadly organ damage from iron
deficiency at worst.
</P>
<P>
   For 40 percent of the women in a clinical trial of the
intra-uterine balloon, the bleeding made it impossible to work
outside the home. But after the procedure, that figure was 4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Black, now 43, was so tormented by her floods of bleeding that
she asked her doctor if there were some kind of medication that
would bring on menopause and end her menstrual periods entirely.
After two or three years of it, the blood bank turned her down for
being anemic and she braced herself for a hysterectomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought it was my turn,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But she knew it was a far riskier passage than gray hair or
reading glasses. On her job, she had talked to women whose bladder
control had been hindered by hysterectomies, even when only the
uterus is removed without the cervix or ovaries. Pelvic pain,
sexual dysfunction and depression can be other side effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a major surgical procedure,'' Morales says, with all the
accompanying risks of blood loss, infection and complications from
general anesthesia. It also costs four to five times as much as the
balloon procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he acknowledges, some doctors probably do more
hysterectomies than are necessary. The Dayton area in particular
has ``about double the rate of Cincinnati,'' says Rich Gunza, the
local executive director of Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, and
a heavy lead over national rates.
</P>
<P>
   But Gunza and Morales both say it's often the patients who
demand hysterectomies. The operation stops the bleeding quickly and
completely, while medication can be a lengthy process with mixed
success. ``We spend more of our time telling people they don't need
a hysterectomy,'' Morales says.
</P>
<P>
   The balloon makes his case easier. Approved in December 1997,
it's a straightforward outpatient procedure that takes about an
hour. ``It's no more uncomfortable than an annual exam,'' says
Black, although cramping is common enough that Morales often needs
to use an additional sedative.
</P>
<P>
   Black apparently had adenomyosis, a condition where the lining
of the uterus grows into surrounding muscle, but it can't be
diagnosed positively without removing the uterus. She also had
fibroids, which are benign tumors in the uterine muscle. Those are
the most common causes of menstrual bleeding, but Black was unusual
in having tumors in locations where the device could reach them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like a balloon on a stick,'' she says. ``It's
actually a straw.'' Inserted vaginally, the balloon is filled with
sterile sugar water that is heated to about 87 degrees. Once
filled, the balloon conforms to the endometrium, the uterine lining
and the primary source of menstrual bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to burn off as much of that lining as you can, so it
cannot do anything,'' Morales says. That leaves a woman essentially
unable to bear children but still able to develop a complicated
pregnancy, so the procedure is only for women whose families are
complete.
</P>
<P>
   An even newer treatment, for fibroids, does not necessarily rule
out pregnancy. Dr. Christopher Conley at Miami Valley has done four
uterine-artery embolizations, radiological procedures in which tiny
solid particles are snaked through an artery and left where they
block the main blood supply to the uterus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fibroids die without the blood,'' Morales says, ``but
there is a lot of collateral circulation to the uterus, so it is
not damaged.''
</P>
<P>
   Within two weeks of her embolization, Kathleen Hanover was free
of her symptoms, which were similar to a mid-trimester pregnancy.
Her fibroids shrank by half in five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tremendous,'' says Hanover, who works for the Miami
Valley American Heart Association. ``I was looking at sterility and
six weeks of recovery and after effects for the rest of my life
with a hysterectomy. I literally jumped up and down when I saw in
the Internet it was being done in Dayton. I was prepared to go
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Black still has very light periods, as do about 80 percent of
women after the balloon procedure. Surveys have shown an
extraordinary rate of 86 percent later saying they were ``very
satisfied'' and another 10 percent ``satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People think because their mothers and sisters had
hysterectomies that they have to have them, too,'' Black says.
``But even if the problem is hereditary, the hysterectomy isn't.
Technology has changed things. All my three sisters have told me,
`We wish this would have been available.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ Deep within Disney World, beyond the
perky smiles and the storybook facade, Richard E. Lapchick sits
amid glossy photos of himself with world leaders and the giants of
sport, and faces the painful, private paradox of his public
campaign to turn boys into men.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures capture only Lapchick's glory days. Glistening on
the walls of his back-lot office at the Disney complex are images
of Bill Clinton, Nelson Mandela, and Kofi Annan honoring Lapchick
for his work on behalf of youth, education, and social justice.
There's Lapchick with Muhammad Ali. And there's Arthur Ashe.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly there are photos of Lapchick's father, Joe Lapchick,
the basketball Hall of Famer who starred for the original Celtics
from New York and later coached the New York Knicks and the men's
team at St. John's University. Grainy, black-and-white snapshots
trace Joe Lapchick's legendary career, from his White House visit
with the New York Celtics of the American Basketball League in
1925, to his coaching triumph with St. John's in the National
Invitational Tournament in 1965, the last hurrah of his 50 years in
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Joe Lapchick was as gifted a father as he was a
coach and athlete. He nurtured his son, spared him from the agony
of unmet expectations that living in a legend's shadow can breed,
and watched him thrive.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, Richard Lapchick, as a teacher, author, human rights
activist, and director of Northeastern University's Center for the
Study of Sport in Society, has spent much of his life promoting
better parenting by sharing the lessons he learned from his father.
``Joe Lapchick was my hero,'' says Lapchick, who runs the
Disney-supported Northeastern program out of offices in Boston and
Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the hero's lessons in life and fatherhood may have
been lost on his son. And other images of the Lapchick story defy
heroism, like the days and nights when Richard was busy building
better men and women while his only son, named for the famed Joe
Lapchick, languished.
</P>
<P>
   While Richard, now 53, traveled prodigiously to improve the
lives of children from the back streets of North America to the
shanty towns of South Africa, his son endured a youth of inner
turmoil, substance abuse, and indifference to the pursuit Richard
implored other young men and women to exalt: education.
</P>
<P>
   There were no wonder years for this Joe Lapchick, who struggled
with his father's absenteeism, his parents' failing marriage, and
the aftershocks of a chilling attack on his father when Joe was
only five. ``I had a hard time with it all when I was younger,''
Joe says in a recent interview in Providence. ``It obviously threw
me for a loop.''
</P>
<P>
   At 26, Joe Lapchick has overcome the obstacles. Recently
graduated from Johnson &AMP; Wales University in Providence, R.I., he
expresses deep love and respect for his father and sees no benefit
in assigning blame for the tumult of his youth.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Joe balked for days at publicly telling his story. Two
months ago, he stood with his father at the FleetCenter in Boston
as the Celtics honored Richard as ``a hero among us.'' The last
thing Joe wants to do, he says is tarnish his father's reputation
or scar the legacy of his grandfather, whose death in 1970 was
marked by headlines across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always so honored that I could share the name of such an
incredible man,'' Joe says of his grandfather. ``I've met so many
people who were in awe of him. But I'm more impressed by what
people think of my dad and all the work he does to improve other
people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   After Richard expressed a willingness to share his and Joe's
experience so others might learn from their odyssey, Joe
reluctantly agreed to retrace the course of his troubled youth,
through the fear, the anger, the resentment, the confusion, the
drinking, the drugs, the guns, the confrontations and, finally, to
the peace he found with the support of his father, a man he hardly
knew for much of his life.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The story begins a generation ago, in the warm glow of Richard's
bond with his father, who was no ordinary man, on or off the
basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   The son of Czechoslovak immigrants, Joe Lapchick was born in
1900, nine years after basketball was invented. As the game's
original ``big man,'' Lapchick, at 6-foot-5, dominated the
professional game for much of the early 20th century. A ninth-grade
dropout who pursued a paycheck in basketball so he could escape a
life of factory work, he died as a respected educator and advocate
for racial justice.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1920s, Lapchick helped break basketball's color barrier,
setting off race riots, as the all-white Celtics of New York became
the first pro team to play exhibitions against the nation's top
black team, Harlem's Renaissance Five.
</P>
<P>
   As coach of the Knicks in 1950, Lapchick helped to integrate the
National Basketball Association by signing a black player, Nat
``Sweetwater'' Clifton, just as Red Auerbach, that same year,
drafted the league's first black player, Charles Cooper, for the
Boston Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that Richard, at age 5, glanced out his bedroom window
in Yonkers, N.Y., and saw protestors marching beneath a sprawling
tree in his front yard, with his father hanging in effigy above
them. The scene is Richard's earliest memory. ``My mother whisked
me away,'' he says, ``so I only saw it for a moment.''
</P>
<P>
   But Richard remembers picking up the telephone and hearing
anonymous voices calling his father a ``nigger lover.'' The
memories later inspired his work for social justice, as did a visit
to the Nazi concentration camp at Dachau when he was 14.
</P>
<P>
   But as a child, Richard wanted nothing more than to follow his
father to basketball fame. Even before he developed enough talent
as a teenager to play summer basketball with future Hall of Famer
Lew Alcindor, later known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Richard's friends
and neighbors told him he was bound for stardom, that he would be
the next Joe Lapchick.
</P>
<P>
   When Richard contracted polio a week before his eighth birthday,
the only question one adult neighbor asked his father at the
hospital was, ``Do the doctors think Richie will ever be able to
play basketball again?''
</P>
<P>
   His father cared little about Richard's future in basketball,
though he knew by then that his son would fully recover from the
polio. In Richard's eyes, his father was the only one who did not
push him to excel in sports. Joe Lapchick, the dropout, raised his
son to be a scholar. ``My father freed me from the pressure that so
many other young athletes have faced,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Though Richard played basketball year-round, in school leagues,
at the Jewish Community Center in Yonkers, at the blacktop courts
in Harlem, his father almost never saw him play. His father rarely
initiated a discussion of basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Richard's father talked to him about politics, poverty,
the war in Vietnam. Together, they read ``The Autobiography of
Malcolm X.'' And when the topic became the exploitation of student
athletes, Richard watched his father cry as Joe confided that he
had discovered his basketball players at St. John's were receiving
passing grades even though they had not attended classes.
</P>
<P>
   Richard responded to his father's focus on education by bringing
home straight A's. And he did little to disappoint his parents
other than to tumble into a series of teenage romances that
prompted his mother, Elizabeth, and his father to warn him he was
``too young to be in love.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard's basketball career ended after his freshman season at
St. John's, when he realized his height _ 5-foot-11 _ and skills
would not suffice to make his father's varsity team. But he
continued to flourish in the classroom, and again later through a
doctoral program in international studies at the University of
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   In Richard's youth, Joe spent much of his time on the road with
the teams he coached. But Richard says he never suffered the dull
ache of longing for his father. In Richard's heart, his father was
always with him. And when Richard launched the Northeastern program
in 1984, he said his mission was rooted in sharing the lessons he
learned from his father. ``I only hope,'' he wrote in the New York
Times, ``we can give to other athletes the gift my father gave to
me so long ago.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By then, though, Richard's private struggle, with the hazards of
his chosen life and with fatherhood, had long been raging. His son,
Joe, born on Richard's birthday in 1972, was only five when the
first trauma struck.
</P>
<P>
   Richard, then 32, was teaching political science at Virginia
Wesleyan College, and was emerging as a leader of the movement in
the United States to rid South Africa of apartheid.

   MONEYTALK _ A new study reaffirms a painful situation: Most
Americans think they will have enough money to support a
comfortable retirement, but many haven't done much to make it
happen. Last Tuesday, a Washington think tank released an important
survey on how Americans are dealing with a much broader range of
tasks that go into building a prosperous retirement. The 1999
Retirement Confidence Survey shows we have a high degree of
confidence things will come out right. The study also indicates a
high degree of self-reliance. Nearly half the respondents said
their personal savings will be their most important source of
retirement income. Only one in eight said they look to Social
Security or other government programs. It sure does sound good. But
the study also points out specific actions that many people haven't
taken. (Ezell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

<TEXT>
<P>
   RAPID CITY, S.D. _ Glenn Jones owns three guns. He is 15- years-
old.
</P>
<P>
   With one of the guns _ that would be the .22 Ruger rifle his
father bought him _ the boy can bring down prairie dog at 30 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Out here , in the West _ less wild these days but still wide
open _ that's the way it's always been and is supposed to be.
Children learn to shoot, and their fathers are proud to help.
</P>
<P>
   Out here, fathers and sons can loll over the carcass of a dying
animal and get to talking about the good hunt, and about their love
for one another.
</P>
<P>
   Out here, the guns don't get locked up. Just like the silverware
and dishes don't get locked up.
</P>
<P>
   But now, even this world is changing _ slowly, subtly,
powerfully. It is not that after the string of schoolyard shootings
_ from Jonesboro, Arkansas to Littleton, Colorado _ the love of
guns has lost its grip on the people of the Black Hills. But worry
has crept into the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Ronn Jones, Glenn's father, is a hunter, too. But he also
anguishes about the nuclear fallout of 1999: kids crouched behind
weeds, licking their lips, training their eye, shooting classmates
down in broad daylight.
</P>
<P>
   As if laws were so much dust.
</P>
<P>
   As if classmates were so many prairie dogs.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the clamor about a so-called loss of innocence in
society sometimes seems about as meaningful to Ronn Jones as the
dirt flying around the Black Hills here. In his eyes, the world's
been tricky and dark for a long time now.
</P>
<P>
   Ronn Jones feels he knows his son better than most fathers know
their sons. Feels he can predict his boy's movements, his boy's
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are times when he worries himself sick. He's just
one man, just one father. He trusts his son to use weapons wisely,
but he also fears the gathering power of violence _ of thought,
word and imagery _ in the world Glenn will inherit. Where will all
the anger go?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' the father says about the son, ``I feel that I'm
losing him.''
</P>
<P>
   So how does a father raise a son enamored of guns and the
culture that surrounds them?
</P>
<P>
   This is how Ronn Jones does it: He plows into his son's life.
When necessary, he tries to bearhug the anger out of his boy.
(itals)Talk to me, Glenn. Talk. To. Me.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   He uses his own story to try to connect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still remember what it's like to be a teenager,'' Ronn Jones
is saying. ``I can feel the pressure of wanting to fit in. My dad
was one of the best dads ever. I lost him when he was 63. Much too
early.''
</P>
<P>
   You can travel through the bright mornings and dark nights of
the Dakotas _ so desolate, so legendary _ and wonder what an angry
child might do if provoked.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a kid says, `I'm going to kill so and so,' well, you need
to find out what the kid means,'' Ronn says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep the line of communication open,'' he says of his
relationship with Glenn. ``When a child makes a sweeping statement
_ `I'm going to kill that guy' _ that's a demand for attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The father says he gets dizzy sizing up the world in which we
live. ``I know what to expect from the real hoodlum, but nobody
knows what to expect from the Ted Kaczynskis. They have an agenda.
Some of these kids _ in Littleton, in Jonesboro _ they were quiet
ones to.''
</P>
<P>
   Let Glenn Jones come home from school mumbling, hunching his
shoulders, banging cabinets before slamming his bedroom door, and
he'll get a whoosh of his father, right in his face, eyeball to
eyeball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell what kind of day he's having from the moment I say
hi to him,'' Ronn says. ``If it comes down to it, I'll take him in
my bathroom and stay in his face until I get something.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronn is a night security manager for an area hotel. Over the
years he'd listen to other adults ridiculing kids, shaking their
heads about their manner of dress. They'd just be kids swimming
through the Rapid City night _ in black trench coats, wearing rings
in their noses, often stamped with tattoos. The so-called rebels,
misfits. But somebody's children.
</P>
<P>
   Some would walk by Ronn Jones staring like owls. He'd strike up
conversations. So many reminded them of his own son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got kicked out of high school once,'' he says. ``I know what
it feels like to be an outcast.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronn Jones grew up in South Dakota. His father and uncles helped
put the finishing touches on Mount Rushmore, 35 miles outside town.
He fought in Vietnam and came home with a Purple Heart. He married
Kerry, who already had children. They had Glenn together. But two
of the stepchildren _ boys _ got out of the house without getting
their high school diplomas. He didn't like that. They'd listen to
him all right. But then they'd go their own way.
</P>
<P>
   Ronn vows it'll be different with Glenn. ``I still got input
with him,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Father and son are seated around the living room table. As they
talk, Ronn's wife, Kerry, walks through the house, cuddling the
family's Boston terrier. Kerry knows how to handle a weapon well
enough herself; she also works as a security guard.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs is a neat home, though small and cluttered. Out the back
door you can see the fields of the Dakotas stretching as far as the
eyes can roll. Dozens of paperbacks are squeezed onto a shelf. The
Joneses love Larry McMurtry; he's their Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   The guns are out of sight, but the medieval swords lie just
beside the bookshelves.
</P>
<P>
   Try raising an aggressive 15-year-old. There can be a surprise
everyday _ for Ronn Jones, those swords were one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's love of swords and swordplay was born at a local coffee
shop here. The lady who owns it belongs to the Society for Creative
Anachronisms, an organization born in Berkeley, Calif., back in the
'60s, when counterculture activities were the rage. The SCA's aim
and interest is to re-create the European Middle Ages; they adore
the period. Members celebrate medieval times by studying history,
reading fantasy fiction, and by engaging in swordplay. The stories
are fantasy, but the swords are real.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Glenn, an SCA member, seems a little more interested
in the swords than the literature. Ronn Jones wouldn't let his son
belong to the group alone. So he joined, too.
</P>
<P>
   Erroll Flynn on the prairie.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Jones has a raspy voice. He wears an earring. He talks
fast, words racing out of his mouth faster than his thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn says his father has taught him to deplore violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's stupid,'' he says. ``Just because people make fun
of you doesn't give you the right to turn to violence. There is no
reason you should ruin your life just because somebody is picking
on you.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he can't imagine taking weapons to school. ``Going into
schools with firearms isn't going to solve anything,'' he says.
``You're throwing your life away. That's prison time. That's a
felony.''
</P>
<P>
   He has learned, up close, about that. Two of Glenn's friends
were arrested after Littleton for phoning in bomb threats. ``Two of
my best friends,'' he says. The incidents baffled him. ``People
that do that don't have answers to their problems. They resort to
threats.''
</P>
<P>
   He lost two more friends recently from suicides. One immolated
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real world is not sweet and innocent,'' Ronn says,
stretching for an ashtray, lighting a smoke. ``The real world
sticks it to you. Innocence died in Vietnam. All of our eyes are
now open. It's a different world. We can't wish it away _ but we
can work with it. I wish I could raise my son the way I was raised,
where my biggest fear was being bored to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn may be clear about the hazards of aggression, but he is
still a boy _ and a teenager. He's balled his fists at classmates.
He's made threats under his breath. Ronn knows. ``I ask him to
think about how the other person feels,'' Ronn says. ``Use a little
empathy. See if there's any validity for what the other person is
doing.''

   MONEYTALK _ A new study reaffirms a painful situation: Most
Americans think they will have enough money to support a
comfortable retirement, but many haven't done much to make it
happen. Last Tuesday, a Washington think tank released an important
survey on how Americans are dealing with a much broader range of
tasks that go into building a prosperous retirement. The 1999
Retirement Confidence Survey shows we have a high degree of
confidence things will come out right. The study also indicates a
high degree of self-reliance. Nearly half the respondents said
their personal savings will be their most important source of
retirement income. Only one in eight said they look to Social
Security or other government programs. It sure does sound good. But
the study also points out specific actions that many people haven't
taken. (Ezell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Something is troubling America's boys. Is it confusion over
male roles? A violent culture? The Globe sent writers across
America to find some answers. The project, which reveals a common
struggle among Americans to raise healthy boys in a sometimes
confused and angry world, is reported in a six-part package,
accompanied by photos by staff photographer John Blanding. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MEN-OUTCAST (Booneville, Ark.) _ As Bill Wagner stood watching
the sun set over his small, beloved farm at the southern edge of
the Ozark Mountains, he made an announcement of his own: To protect
his homosexual son the family would move away. By Mitchell Zuckoff.

   MEN-GUNS (Rapid City, S.D.) _ In the West children learn to

the good hunt, and about their love for one another. By Wil

</P>
<P>
   MEN-MOTHERS (Middlesex, N.J.) _ Jeff Taylor's brain cancer and
death three years ago, when he was 41, clearly left a huge hole in
the family's heart. It also launched his wife, Karen Sumski Taylor,
on a difficult journey to find the stamina, means, faith, and humor
to fill Jeff's big fathering shoes and to raise their two boys. By
Mary Leonard. (2 takes) PHOTO

<P>
   MEN-NOTIME (Atlanta) _ It has not been an easy path for father

to balance great expectations and tenderness, his own high
ambitions and the time a child needs. By Tatsha Robertson. (2

   MEN-EXPECTATIONS (Lake Buena Vista, Fla.) _ By all accounts, Joe
Lapchick was as gifted a father as he was a coach and an athlete.
He nurtured his son, spared him from the agony of unmet
expectations that living in a legend's shadow can breed, and
watched him thrive. By Bob Hohler. (2 takes) PHOTO
</P>
<P>
   MEN-BULLY (Newton, Mass.) _ Ted Harrington was not a classic
bully who used hostility to vent his anger and insecurity. Rather,
as a player in the often confusing, socially uneasy, sometimes
cruel culture of American boyhood, he was one of those kids who
initiate taunts rather than stand to the side or take the heat
themselves. By Irene Sege. (2 takes) PHOTO

 ATLANTA: ... stepmother, says.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Teacher conferences and restrictions on television only
temporarily prod Jadwin onto the right track, before he flounders
again. His parents worry that he won't be ready to step into his
adult life when he turns 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that when you turn 18 it is time for you to be a
responsible adult,'' says Deborah Palmer. ``We are not pushing him
out the house, but either you go to college, vocational school, the
military, or get a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward tries to impress on his son that, particularly for a
young black man, realizing life ambitions requires redoubled drive
and focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't showed me that he has the necessary skills to
survive. He has to be disciplined,'' Edward says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, discipline and focus are the hallmarks of Edward
Palmer's life.
</P>
<P>
   On this scorching day in affluent Gwinnett County, where the
family lives in a large split-level home, Edward begins the day
early, in his plush office at Hopewell Baptist Church checking his
messages at the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he will take time out with Jadwin to build a shed in the
family's backyard, help his son apply for a summer job, then rush
back to teach a Bible class at noon.
</P>
<P>
   And so it continues through 3 a.m. While most of his family
members are sleeping (except Jadwin, who is secretly watching ``The
Godfather'' in the basement) Palmer and Sharell are busy seeing off
eight church members headed to Haiti on a missionary assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in idle time,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Or forgetfulness. Earlier that day, when Jadwin and his father
were heading off to deliver a job application, Jadwin realized he
had forgotten his state photo ID. To his father, it was perfect
segue into a lecture on why Jadwin can't be trusted yet to drive or
own a car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh lord, not again,'' says Jadwin, cringing at yet another
sermon.
</P>
<P>
   But later, en route to retrieve the ID, there is a moment of
connection. Palmer, glancing in the rearview mirror, smiles at his
son, a lanky boy with flawless dark skin, dimples, and a strong
resemblance to his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks I'm hard on him,'' his father confides, ``but I wish
I had someone as a young man to guide me.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The oldest of four boys and one girl, Edward Palmer was raised
in the projects of Charleston, S.C., by his granny _ Leona Bennett.
His parents divorced years earlier and his mother, who next married
a military man, spent much of her time away.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Edward's youth was spent washing dishes, helping out,
and changing the bed for his sickly grandmother. When he turned 14,
he moved to Germany to be with his mother, but he still had to make
his own way during the years when a boy most needs a role model.
</P>
<P>
   His teacher was the world around him.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy in Charleston, he saw many loveless marriages, boys his
own age running wild, and unemployed men just hanging the corners.
He vowed that would never be his lot, and that if he had a son he
would show him the way to a better life.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, father and son drove to Charleston to trace
Edward's early years and visit his old haunts. The Palmer men drove
across the seaport city, through the downtown projects where Palmer
grew up. They stayed overnight in a hotel, and ate crabs and
oysters until they were full.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just me and my dad chilling in Charleston, South
Carolina,'' Jadwin chuckles. ``It was fun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a time for us to discuss things, to reflect, just the
father and son,'' says Edward.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the biggest highlights for my brother in a
long time,'' says Sharell. ``Jadwin really wants that relationship
with my father.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Alice Palmer: ``Sometime you can get so busy that you can
lose your child. . . . I think Jadwin loves his daddy more than
anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer is not the emotional father some might expect a preacher
to be, but he believes he can show his love by teaching his son.
And by being the clear voice of male authority in a household that
he won't let fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was imperative and I was determined not to let it
happen,'' he says
</P>
<P>
   But it did. His first marriage was a failure; he lost touch with
the one child who stayed with her mother. But he was more than ever
determined to be the main force in the lives of the two who stayed
with him, Sharell and Jadwin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live up to what I say. I didn't want a broken family and
though I got a divorce, it didn't mean I had to give up my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The hard lessons he learned in life as a soldier during the
Vietnam War era, a student at the University of South Carolina, and
in the corporate world, he wanted to pass along to his son.
</P>
<P>
   And, he believes, Jadwin is finally hearing him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father always says a black man must work twice as hard,''
Jadwin says.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as he scours the internet for job possibilities _ Jadwin
says he can imagine himself as an archeologist, a coroner, even a
private detective _ he feels a new seriousness dawning about the
need to take responsibility for his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize I'm getting older and need to start thinking about
my future,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Edward is slowly evolving, too. While he continues to impress
hard life lessons on his son, he says he feels the need to slow
down, maybe even ease up on Jadwin _ a little.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is trying hard. He wants everything to be all right,''
Sharell says of her father.
</P>
<P>
   The means to that end? Time.
</P>
<P>
   Not long hours _ Palmer doesn't have those to spare _ but more
simple acts of sharing: working on the car together, playing hoop
in the driveway, watching movies at night or building an outdoor
shed. One recent day, Jadwin, wearing baggy jeans held up a board
while his father, dressed in a white worker's apron, hammered away
on the shed.
</P>
<P>
   Jadwin later left to see the new Star Wars movie , but when he
returned, his father was still hard at the task _ using a stick now
to hold up the boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you replaced me with a piece of wood,'' jokes Jadwin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything can be improvised,'' his father retorts. They both
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Later, while the two grab lunch at a local Chinese buffet _
father careful not to fill his plate, son munching through a small
mountain _ Jadwin announces his intention to become an electrical
engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Like his father used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Just bringing it up is a bit of a risk for the boy, and a kind
of emotional test for the father _ a test which at first Edward
doesn't seem to master. ``I know an engineer needs to be
disciplined in his studies and I don't see that,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Then, seeming to sense that he has hurt his son's feelings, he
softens and praises Jadwin for his uncanny memory _ a gift that
could make him a great historian, he suggests. Or an archeologist,
he might have added. Or a private detective.
</P>
<P>
   Jadwin flashes a sudden smile that seems to say: Maybe we are
finally on the same track.

 MIDDLESEX, N.J.: ... heart-to-heart chat.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``So Steve, I understand ya got a little problem with my
drivin','' Karen says, mimicking a Brooklyn mob boss. ``Do ya wanna
discuss it with me?'' The boy, chagrined, didn't stay in the car
pool for long, and since then, none of her other passengers have
ever forgotten to say ``thank you for the ride, Mrs. Taylor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be a meddlesome mom, someone who is always in
their face, or worse, trying to rescue them,'' Karen says. ``But I
tell you, it makes me insane when Alex isn't doing the best he can.
He doesn't have to get straight A's, but he does need to learn to
play the game. We fight about it. Sometimes I think his mind is
disengaged from his body.''
</P>
<P>
   She's not naive; she knows a teenager's world can be one of
confusion and change, temptation, rebellion, and risk. Her middle
brother, Michael, dropped out of her family in a fog of drugs and
alcohol. So she does her best to enter Alex's life through frank
conversations on everything from video game violence to suicide,
from substance abuse to sex, and to shape it with such positive
distractions as soccer, music lessons, and drama.
</P>
<P>
   Church is central, not just to the family's social life, but
also to reinforcing the values that Karen hopes will help her sons
make the right choices as adults. ``I don't care if Alex is a
lawyer or a game-show host, as long as he lives mindfully of
himself and the people around him,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Renee LiaBraaten, the Taylors' pastor at Emmanuel Lutheran
Church, says Jeff's death has strengthened Karen as a mother, and
his life gave her an excellent model for the boys.. ``She is a very
intentional parent, and she takes advantage of the whole village of
men _ in the church, in her family, in the neighborhood _ to mentor
and nurture her sons.''
</P>
<P>
   Alex imagines the boys who shot their classmates at Columbine
High School must have come from homes where parents were not very
involved or supportive. ``My mom has her ways of talking to me and
helping me deal with my problems so I keep a cool head,'' he says.
``I choose my own friends, but if I make a bad choice, my mom lets
me know.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the high-school rampage in Littleton, Colo., Karen
and Alex had one of their talks about video games. She won't allow
him to buy ones that are too violent or demean women, though she
knows he will play them in other homes. Alex argued that the games
serve a useful purpose, allowing kids to vent their frustrations
and anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``So Alex, what are you angry about?'' Karen probes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing,'' Alex answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well then,'' says Karen, her fist planted firmly on her hip.
``I rest my case.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Huber, who teaches Alex eighth-grade civics at Franklin
Middle School, doesn't see the anger, either. Alex is mature beyond
his years, a good student, at ease with his friends, and ``a people
person, sometimes to excess,'' Huber says. She was surprised to
learn Alex had lost his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd never know that he had been under that kind of stress,''
Huber says. ``It's not manifested at all. Alex is very
well-adjusted, very well put together.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jeff Taylor's brain tumor, diagnosed in January 1993, only
four months after Luke was born, had a devastating effect on young
Alex. The father who had helped him write a third-grade paper on
the Chinese political system suddenly couldn't remember to turn off
a water faucet. The dad who loved to wrestle or skate with him now
shunned physical activity, fearing it would cause a seizure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all sitting on a feather,'' says Karen, but it was the
worst for Alex. After his father's death, which came unexpectedly
at home and with the sons present, Alex became depressed. His
self-esteem plummeted, his grades fell, he couldn't make friends,
and he behaved badly in school.
</P>
<P>
   Karen got him into counseling, which helped, but she also gave
Alex a very unusual and, as it turned out, cathartic opportunity
for closure on his father's death. She allowed him to testify about
his dad's illness in a $6 million malpractice lawsuit she brought
against the doctors and hospital that treated Jeff Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   The Taylor suit, which was argued in a Washington civil court
over four weeks in September 1997, alleged that it was radiation
therapy, not a recurrence of Jeff's brain tumor, that caused a
succession of increasingly intense and finally fatal seizures.
Lawyers for the Georgetown University Medical Center maintained
that Jeff's glioblastoma, a particularly aggressive and malignant
form of brain tumor, almost always recurs. They said the doctors's
decision to aggressively treat what appeared to be a second,
cancerous tumor _ but which one hospital pathology report said was
benign scar tissue _ was based on good medical practice.
</P>
<P>
   The Taylors were crushed by the verdict: The jury found no
negligence, and Karen, who said she was seeking vindication more
than money, had to pay Georgetown $9,000 in legal fees. Still, she
took comfort when the jury reprimanded the doctors for their
``callous'' treatment of the family.
</P>
<P>
   Alex said no one made him testify, though he understood it might
make the jury more sympathic. ``It was something I really wanted
and needed to do,'' Alex says. ``I needed to tell them about the
side of my dad I saw after he was treated. It's hard talking about
it anyway. It was really hard talking about my dad to the people
who might have killed him.''
</P>
<P>
   The end of the trial was a turning point for Karen. ``She put
her life on hold until it was over,'' says Martha Hellman, her
friend and neighbor. ``Good or bad, the verdict meant she could
move on, resume her spiritual journey, and find out how much
strength she had as a parent.''
</P>
<P>
   Her relatives saw a change, too. ``At first, she was so
frightened and lonely,'' says Alexandria Gladwell, Karen's cousin
who hosts the family reunion in Middlesex. ``Now we hear Karen say,
`I need a life,' and she is starting to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, Karen organized a support group at her church to let
single parents share their wisdom, bad days, and aspirations. For
her, one dream is coming true. This summer, she will pack the boys
off to a friend's house and take her first solo trip since Jeff's
death, joining a church group for a two-week aid mission to
Estonia.
</P>
<P>
   For Alex, the trial marked an early passage to manhood. It
seemed to reinforce his sense of duty to help his mother and fill
in as Luke's father. Still, acting grown-up puts pressure on a
teenager: whether to tattle on a pesky little brother or take his
hand when he crosses the street; whether to watch ``Austin Powers''
one more time or walk the neighbor's dog for a few extra bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Responsibility usually wins out with Alex. ``Hey, Mom, the Dow
is up!'' Alex calls from the TV room, where he is watching the news
instead of ``The Simpsons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure don't want Alex feeling like he has to be the man
around the house. He's just a kid,'' Karen says affectionately.
``On the other hand, show me the page in the family rulebook that
says a mother has to do everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Some things, like sex education, are especially hard. Karen
believes even the best lessons at school or in books can't teach
love and commitment. But it embarrasses both mother and son to
discuss sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish dad were here,'' Alex will say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, Alex, so do I,'' Karen replies.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom tries very hard to be a dad, but there are certain
things only a father can do, like throw a baseball or a football,''
Alex says later. ``Don't get me wrong _ I love my mom, I worry
about her, she is the foundation of this family _ but it's just not
the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen works to keep good men in the boys' lives and expose them
to what she calls ``guy stuff.'' Each summer she and her sons visit
Grandfather Taylor and Jeff's three brothers in Oregon. Her own
brothers on Long Island take the boys boating and fishing. Gregory
Hanson, the Taylors' next-door neighbor, is teaching the teenager
to hunt with a bow and arrow. Last year, Alex gave Hanson a
Father's Day card.
</P>
<P>
   Says Jaime Ramos, Alex's soccer coach and another strong role
model: ``Karen proves it is not your testosterone level that makes
a good father.'' Still, each Taylor _ including Luke, who sometimes
draws pictures of his dad with angel wings or sobs at the sound of
an old nursery lullaby _ is sadly aware of the empty spot in the
family portrait.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Karen took the boys to the Washington mall for a
rally against cancer, and she hung Jeff's picture on a memorial
wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to them, `We need to make dad's death count for
something,' '' Karen recalls. ``It was very emotional. We all
cried.''

HOW DOES CONGRESS MEASURE UP TO THE TEN COMMANDMENTS?

<P>
   What is it about Alabama and the Ten Commandments? First, an
Alabama judge refuses a federal order to take them down from the
walls of his courtroom. And now, Alabama Congressman Robert B.
Aderholt has persuaded his peers to pass a bill giving states the
right to display the Ten Commandments in schools and other public
places.
</P>
<P>
   The Ten Commandments clause is part of the larger juvenile crime
bill that the House weakened in the service of the radical pro-gun
lobby. In the wake of the Littleton school massacre, the Senate
passed a much stronger version a few weeks ago -- handing the
National Rifle Association the first serious political defeat in
its history.
</P>
<P>
   Radical pro-gun partisans, however, could not abide the thought
that Congress might limit access to killing machines. They lobbied
hard to overturn the wishes of the majority of the American people
as expressed by the Senate's vote.
</P>
<P>
   So, the House defeated serious gun control. Instead, they
suggested that children read the Ten Commandments as a way to end
school violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that simply posting the Ten Commandments will not
instantly change the moral character of our nation,'' said
Aderholt. ``However, it is an important step to promote morality
and an end of children killing children.''
</P>
<P>
   How? A kid with an assault weapon sees ``Thou shalt not murder''
before he pulls the trigger? A pre-rampage conversion? Better
still, little ones could pull the commandments off the walls and
use them for shields while their classmates shoot.
</P>
<P>
   But if Congress insists that we hang the Ten Commandments in
schools, I suggest that we hang the Ten Commandments in the halls
of Congress. Any member caught violating God's law would be
immediately suspended or expelled.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see how they do:
</P>
<P>
   ``Thou shalt not murder.'' With any luck, there are no murderers
in the House of Representatives. But this one is a little tricky
for congressional Christians (Jews, Muslims, and agnostics are
excluded) because Jesus taught that anyone who hates his brother
has committed murder. A few might get caught on this technicality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thou shalt not steal.'' Do our taxes count?
</P>
<P>
   ``Thou shalt not bear false witness against your neighbor.''
These are politicians. No comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thou shalt not commit adultery.'' Well, they were running for
the exits during the President's impeachment trial. But boys will
be boys. Again, Christians have a tougher standard. Jesus said
anyone who looks at a woman with lust has committed adultery.
Sorry, fellows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thou shalt not covet your neighbor's wife, his house, his
field or his manservant, his ox or his donkey or anything that
belongs to your neighbor.'' Does that include his Lexus? What about
a nicer office in the Rayburn Building? What about aspiring to be a
senator or president?
</P>
<P>
   ``Thou shalt have no other gods before Me.'' Can Buddhists,
Hindus, or atheists hold office? If not, God and the Constitution
might be at odds. Are power and money gods?
</P>
<P>
   ``Thou shalt not make for yourself an idol, or any likeness of
what is in heaven above, or on the earth beneath or in the water
under the earth.'' Well, those who cut the National Endowment for
the Arts might breathe a little easier here. But what of making an
idol of yourself? The polls? The gun lobby?
</P>
<P>
   ``Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord your God in vain.''
Let's dock their pay $5 for every swear word. The money can be used
to save Social Security and fund universal health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Observe the Sabbath day and keep it holy.'' Whose Sabbath?
Friday, the Islamic one? Saturday, the Jewish one? Sunday, the
Christian one? Maybe all three -- they would only work four days a
week and we could cut their pay again. In addition, every member of
Congress must divest their holdings in companies that do business
on the Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honor your father and your mother, as the Lord your God has
commanded you.'' We trust that they honor their own fathers and
mothers. But does that include all fathers and mothers? How about
federally mandated paid paternity and maternity leave? Excellent
day care centers? And, of course, decent gun-control laws so
parents will not have to worry about someone killing their
children.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to moral matters, perhaps Congress should follow
another biblical teaching. As Jesus put it, ``Why do you look at
the speck in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is
in your own ... You hypocrites, first take the log out of your own
eye, and then you will see clearly enough to take the speck from
your brother's.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, at the very least, pass sensible legislation regarding guns.

the speck in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is
in your own ... You hypocrites, first take the log out of your own
eye, and then you will see clearly enough to take the speck from
your brother's.''

<P>
   Or, at the very least, pass sensible legislation regarding guns.

PAYNE STEWART HAS HIS EYES ON THE RYDER CUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PETE DOUGHERTY  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ When the national anthem plays, Payne Stewart
places his right hand over his heart. ``Heck,'' he says, ``I sing
the words.'' He is unabashed about his patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   So it should be no surprise that Stewart considers an automatic
berth on the Ryder Cup team to be one of the biggest perks to
winning the U.S. Open golf championship.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, a native of Springfield, Mo., who lives in Orlando,
Fla., earned enough points with his dramatic victory Sunday at
Pinehurst No. 2 to assure himself a spot on the U.S. team that will
try to win back the Ryder Cup from Europe in September at
Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very wonderful spot in my heart for the Ryder Cup,''
Stewart said. ``It's more intense. The only person that I can let
down (in the Open) is myself. If I go out and make the Ryder Cup
team and don't perform well and we don't win, then I'm going to
feel that I let down my other 11 teammates, the captain and my
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, 42, has played in four Ryder Cups, compiling an 8-7-1
match record (2-2 in singles), but hasn't represented the U.S.
since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   He hoped to be a captain's choice the last two times the
biennial competition was held, but Lanny Wadkins ('95) picked
Curtis Strange and Fred Couples, and Tom Kite ('97) went with
Couples and Lee Janzen.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's motivated me this year was the fact that I couldn't
rely on the captains to pick,'' Stewart said. ``I felt like I was a
legitimate selection for the last two Ryder Cup teams. The
captain's choice were good choices. That's something that maybe
I'll have the opportunity to do later in my career is be a captain.
Then I can analyze, `Why did you pick him?'''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart has the passion, the Dottie Pepper-like spunk, to help
the U.S. snap its two-match Ryder Cup losing streak. His
willingness to speak his mind and his no-nonsense attitude on the
course supposedly bother some fellow pros, but none of his peers
had anything bad to say Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``His game has to be respected,'' said Phil Mickelson, who
finished second. ``He seems to be always in contention at the Open.
He and his wife have been very gracious with Amy (Mickelson's wife)
and myself, and I've enjoyed spending time with the two of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson can take some solace in the knowledge that he was part
of one of the most exciting Open finishes of recent memory. Stewart
needed a 15-foot par putt on the final hole to win. Mickelson,
Tiger Woods and Vijay Singh all had their opportunities in the
final round.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who had eight years between Open victories, vows to
handle things differently as champion this time around. He said
last time he was too hung up on trying to fulfill what he perceived
as the responsibility of being the U.S. Open champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a lot more prepared to deal with everything that goes
along with holding on to this trophy for a year,'' he said. ``I
plan on doing the same things that I've been doing that got me in
position to win, which is working out and spending a lot of time at
home and playing when I want to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'm going to be running after the elusive dollar
because I've been invited to go and play here and here and here. I
had so much fun being at home, being a father, getting up in the
morning, making breakfast, taking my kids to school, going to high
school athletics. That's what my life is right now. I'm not going
to do what I did in '91.''

requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,

list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and

criticism from publishing houses.)

   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending June 12, at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other

U.S. OPEN GOES TO PEBBLE BEACH NEXT YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN FORNOFF  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ The 99th U.S. Open closed to critical acclaim
_ with the exception of a John Daly snit _ and there might be some
implications here for the 100th Open, next June at Pebble Beach,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guess what we can now say today for the first time?'' Pebble
Beach director of golf R.J. Harper said. ``We've got the next U.S.
Open and we're thrilled.''
</P>
<P>
   The ending of this last one _ Payne Stewart's dramatic,
par-saving, championship-winning putt on the 18th hole _ will be
hard to duplicate. But even before the final shot, Pinehurst No. 2
gave Pebble Beach a modern lesson in how to make the fans, the
media, the USGA and the players happy.
</P>
<P>
   The fans just want decent seats and views with no transportation
hassles _ preferably with good weather. The USGA seems happy if
there are big names on the leaderboard, an on-time finish for TV
and par standing tall in the end.
</P>
<P>
   As for the players, it seems their concerns are different. And
what they expressed here in the confines of Pinehurst No. 2 made a
clear statement of what they want in an Open.
</P>
<P>
   They want the conditions to be fair. And by this, they don't all
necessarily mean that it is the same for every player and they
don't all necessarily mean that a good shot is rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly they mean that one bad shot doesn't automatically produce
a second bad shot: They want the chance to redeem themselves. And
most found that to be the case at No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``This golf course sucks you out, but it's good,'' said
Germany's Sven Struver, who was 15 over par in his first Open. ``If
somebody's not going to enjoy this, he's not going to enjoy golf.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the USGA has been presenting formatted Opens:
primary rough that was X inches high, secondary rough that was Y
inches high, fairways that were Z yards wide, greens that measured
XX.
</P>
<P>
   But at Pinehurst, the difficulty was presented by the pedestal
greens. The course didn't need six inches of rough, anywhere, and
it didn't have it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be a simple template, and what's exciting is that
Pinehurst changed that this year,'' Harper said. ``I think the USGA
is going to come in here with a more open mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The players also think the Open course should test every club.
</P>
<P>
   They do not want the driver taken out of their hands by narrow,
fast, curved fairways that won't hold a well-struck, on-target
drive. This was the case at the Olympic Club in San Francisco. Jack
Nicklaus expressed concern that it could be the case as well at
Pebble Beach next year if the USGA conditions it that way.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Patterson, vice chairman of the U.S. Amateur, says the
length of the course already has been prescribed for both the
Amateur and the Open. It will be 6,828 yards, with par 71.
</P>
<P>
   Pinehurst was 7,175 yards with par 70.
</P>
<P>
   The second hole, which the everyday golfer plays as a par-5 at
Pebble, will be a tough but reachable 484-yard par-4. The USGA
wanted to shave another stroke somewhere, liking its nice round 70,
but none of the other par-5s at Pebble could budge.
</P>
<P>
   ``A long, long, long ball hitter can reach No. 6 in two, and 14
will always and forever be a three-shot hole, and 18 is not
reachable in two for any but the angriest of golfers,'' Harper
said.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge presented by Pebble generally is finding the small
greens. At the Open, the rough around the greens will heighten the
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   A challenge for the organizers at Pebble will be to present an
Open that is as comfortable for all as was Pinehurst. After
Sunday's grand finale, Stewart thanked the USGA for the way it
handled the large media corps that covers the final round. The tees
were off-limits, which reduced the welcome-to-the-circus feeling.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a challenge to accomplish that at Pebble Beach, where
the Pacific Ocean limits access to fairways on many holes.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson said the course will provide enough bleachers to seat
17,000 of the 32,500 fans expected, which should help relieve the
congestion.
</P>
<P>
   Pinehurst, a village of 8,000 people, handled that well _ with a
bonus. The weather wasn't the hot, humid stuff that had been
feared. It was a little rainy, and mostly mild.
</P>
<P>
   That, Pebble Beach might be able to manage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thursday's going to be sunny, Friday overcast with a little
fog, Saturday sunny again,'' Patterson said. ``And Sunday, it'll
blow 50 miles an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   It's as good a guess as any.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ With the ascendancy of quiet superstars Mia Hamm
and Tim Duncan, you'd think this would be a placid time for
sportswriters. But for every Hamm, we have a Hingis. For every
Duncan, a Daly.
</P>
<P>
   There's always a need for sage advice, always a place for the
voice of reason. This, of course, isn't that place.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Ms. Demeanor: Is there any way to get fans interested in
the men's singles matches at Wimbledon? Everyone wants to watch the
bratty women. Andre helped us by winning the French, but he hurt us
by ditching Brooke. We could be second-class citizens pretty soon.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tim Henman, a k a Greg Rusedksi, a k a Mark Philippousis, a k
a Anonymous
</P>
<P>
   Dear Anonymous et al.: How about getting New York Mets manager
Bobby Valentine to dress up as Pete Sampras during the interview
sessions? This is a character who could keep Fleet Street humming.
Too bad he can't do the same for the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Ms. Demeanor: What's up with Latrell Sprewell's hairstyle,
those zig-zagging cornrows? I'm not sure what they say about the
NBA at the turn of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   _ Vidal Saloon, Staten Island, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Vidal: Let me get this straight: You're following the New
York Knicks, who have played aesthetically challenged basketball
for most of this decade, and you're worried about Sprewell's hair?
I'm not sure why sports fans get so worked up over athletes'
tattoos, hairstyles and body piercings, as if youthful fashion
experiments revealed anything about character.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional assumption about cornrows is that they're
supposed to create an intimidating look. But to buy that, you have
to believe that all young, black men are inherently scary.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, you look at Allen Iverson and see an athlete trying
desperately to disguise the fact that he's as baby-faced as
Leonardo DiCaprio.
</P>
<P>
   As for Sprewell, the cornrows call attention away from his
scrawny physique. The new ones are very much like Dennis Rodman's
annual playoff dye job _ an hourglass for the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   By the middle of the Finals, Rodman's coloring had always faded.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell's cornrows have started to unravel. The crisp lines are
gone now, frazzled by Miami, Atlanta and Indiana, by injuries to
Patrick Ewing and Larry Johnson. That's the biggest statement his
hair can make.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Ms. Demeanor: Why is everyone so appalled by my behavior at
the U.S. Open? The tournament is a disaster, an embarrassment to
serious golfers. Why can't we play the national championship on a
normal course, without rolling greens and shin-deep rough? If you
had to work under these conditions, you would boycott an event,
too.
</P>
<P>
   _ John Daly, Somewhere in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Dear John: As far as I know, no journalist quit working at the
Atlanta Olympics, so don't expect any sympathy here. As for the
U.S. Open, here's a thought: Let the USGA relax the course
standards for a few years, and let's see how you feel when more
club pros and 43-year-old amateurs start slipping onto the
leaderboard, ahead of members of the PGA Tour. Now, that would be
embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   The wacky course dimensions reduce the chance for flukes. The
four contenders down the stretch this year were Payne Stewart, Phil
Mickelson, Tiger Woods and Vijay Singh. That's an impressive group
of golfers, exactly what you'd expect from a U.S. Open. Pinehurst
did its job. You and your 11 strokes on No. 8 Sunday? That was
fairly predictable, too. And the golf course had almost nothing to
do with it.
</P>
<P>
   My suggestion: Take up tennis, and start playing mixed doubles
with Martina Hingis. You two would make quite a pair.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Ms. Demeanor: How can I make myself look more intimidating,
older and maybe a little over the edge?
</P>
<P>
   _ A. Iverson, Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Dear A: Ah, an easy one. Disguise yourself as Bobby Valentine.

   WASHINGTON _ So you're bored with the beach and you've toured
Europe. When it comes to traveling, you've been there, done that.
Where on earth can you go for a real adventure?
</P>
<P>
   How about a vacation in space?

and is betting that travelers will soon be taking sub-orbital
flights.

   ``We are past the snicker factor'' in the development of space
tourism, said Alan Ladwig, a NASA associate administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, on Wednesday, scores of space and travel industry
officials will open a two-day conference in the nation's capital on
``Going Public: Moving Toward the Development of a Large Space
Tourism Business.'' Participants are coming from NASA, the
Department of Commerce, and the aerospace, travel, finance and
insurance industries.
</P>
<P>
   Many participants believe that the key question is when _ not if
_ the final frontier will be open to tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's going to be a space tourism industry,'' said
Ladwig. ``I'm not going to predict how soon. Not in five or 10
years. But in 15 to 20, who knows? To fly in space has been a dream
of millions of people for a long, long time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only two real barriers: cost and safety,'' said
Keith Calhoun-Senghor, director of the Commerce Department's Office
of Space Commercialization. ``Both are technological. Surveys have
shown that the market is there.''
</P>
<P>
   At least two travel agencies already offer vacations at Russia's
Star City. The cost is about $5,000 for a three-day stay, not
including air fare. The space adventure includes a flight with
several parabolas on the Ilyushin-76, the cosmonaut equivalent of
NASA's ``vomit comet'' which provides a few minutes of
weightlessness.
</P>
<P>
   The next big step in space tourism is predicted to be suborbital
flights such as those taken by early Mercury astronauts before John
Glenn orbited the Earth. The X-Prize Foundation is offering $10
million to the first private firm to build a vehicle that carries
at least three people 100 kilometers or higher above the ground
(the international boundary between air and space) and lands safely
_ and then repeats the feat with the same ship within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal desire has been to fly into space. But I did not
want to do it as a government employee,'' explained Peter
Diamandis, president of the X-Prize Foundation. The problem is that
there are only two vehicles on the planet _ the U.S. space shuttle
and the Russian Soyuz rocket _ capable of making such flights, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Already, 16 firms are competing for the prize, and the first
competing vehicles are expected to be launched between 2002 and
2005.
</P>
<P>
   Once tourists are taking suborbital flights, the next question
is ``whether 15 minutes in space is enough. Will they get the John
Glenn syndrome of 'when do I go up next?','' said Calhoun-Senghor.
Then, ``at some point, you need some place to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Space Island Group has an idea for building orbiting
hotels from the discarded external fuel tanks of the space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy for shuttle crews to release the tanks to float
around in space, said Gene Myers, president of the group of
aerospace engineers and marketers. ``The tanks are as big as a
747'' and could be fitted together into a wheel shape.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers would initially have to lease the shuttle and
hire NASA astronauts, first to build a mixed-use station for public
and private efforts and then to build the early hotels, Myers
explained. But eventually a second-generation, privately operated
shuttle capable of carrying 75 passengers would take tourists back
and forth from the orbiting hotels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each station could hold 400 to 500 people on conditions
similar to those on a cruise ship,'' said Myers. The group is
seeking funding through corporate sponsorships similar to those for
the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ``In a larger context,'' space tourism is already booming, said
Calhoun-Senghor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Space travel is what gets attention,'' he said, but the
business begins on terra firma with such attractions as museums.
The Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum is the
most visited museum in the world. The space tourism industry also
includes space camps, NASA tours and theme parks.
</P>
<P>
   The conference at the Capitol Hill Club will ``address the
potential space tourism markets, the present state of space travel
and tourism business efforts, and set the agenda to resolve the
inhibitors'' to space tourism, said Bob Haltermann, executive
director of the Space Travel and Tourism Division of the Space
Transportation Association, a sponsor of the event.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's Ladwig will speak at the conference on government's role
in space tourism _ basically developing new technologies that will
lower launch costs. It now costs about $8,000 a pound to get to
space, he said. ``You'd have to get it down to $100 a pound for a
realistic tourism market.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The question about the conference is, 'Is it too early?','' he
said. ``It's not too early to sort out issues'' concerning space
tourism, he said.

   WASHINGTON _ So you're bored with the beach and you've toured
Europe. When it comes to traveling, you've been there, done that.
Where on earth can you go for a real adventure?
</P>
<P>
   How about a vacation in space?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot closer than a lot of people think,'' said Eric
Anderson, general manager of Space Adventures. The futuristic
travel agency already offers the experience of weightlessness
during tours of Star City, the Russian version of Cape Canaveral,
and is betting that travelers will soon be taking sub-orbital
flights.

 &HT;    END-OF-CENTURY CONGRESS SPENDS $2 BILLION ON ITSELF
 &HT;    With CONGRESS-COST-DATA. For release Sunday, July 4.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As fireworks etch the skies with bright colors for
the last Independence Day of this century, the majestic dome of the
U.S. Capitol will look much as it did 99 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But almost everything else about Capitol Hill has changed in a
century that brought an explosion of staff, construction and
bureaucracy _ not to mention lobbyists _ to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   At the century's start, lawmakers had no suites of offices, only
their desks on the floor of the Senate and House, and only a rare
clerk to help with their part-time legislative duties.
</P>
<P>
   Today Congress operates the equivalent of a fair-sized city,
with 29,000 employees, its own police force, six major office
buildings and an underground trolley system to move lawmakers to
and from the Capitol whenever the bell rings for votes.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with the expense of running the Library of Congress,
the legislature now costs more than $2.2 billion a year, expected
to reach $2.4 billion next year.
</P>
<P>
   House members, who averaged only about three aides each as
recently as 1947, now employ an average of 15 full-time aides in
the capital or in their home districts. Senators, who had fewer
than six staff members each in 1947, now have about 40 aides.
</P>
<P>
   Under Republican majority since 1995, Congress has pared its
payroll by more than 8,800 compared with 1991. But the overall
growth in the legislature's bureaucracy remains largely intact.
</P>
<P>
   What spurred the congressional expansion?
</P>
<P>
   Starting with President Franklin D. Roosevelt, lawmakers began
fearing their powers were slipping away to the more assertive
executive branch. Congress responded by bulking up its staff in the
late 1940s. That effort was redoubled in the 1970s, when Congress
added yet more staff, researchers and investigators, and set up its
own budget office as a counterpoint to the executive branch.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Congress enlarged its operations to keep pace with new
benefit programs, regulations and agencies it was creating.
Lawmakers, who once concentrated their efforts in the capital,
began hiring more staff for home offices, where aides serve as
``caseworkers'' for constituent who have problems with programs
ranging from the Environmental Protection Agency to Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, an army of lobbyists began camping in
Washington. By 1997, the ranks included 11,500 registered lobbyists
whose organizations spent $1.26 billion to try to influence
law-making, according to the private, nonpartisan Center for
Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all moved together,'' said Thomas E. Mann, director of
governmental studies at the Brookings Institution. ``The agenda of
government expanded. The size of congressional staffs, the number
of organizations with representatives in Washington and the number
of registered lobbyists _ they all went up together.''

<P>
   HIGHLIGHTS OF CONGRESSIONAL EXPENDITURES
</P>
<P>
   Based on legislative appropriations proposed for fiscal 2000.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSE LEADERSHIP AND POLITICAL PARTY OFFICES: $14.2 million
</P>
<P>
   _ Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., $1.74 million for his
leadership office plus $406,000 for staff to handle House floor
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Minority leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The rest is divided among other leaders and congressional party
organizations that set strategy and policy, chiefly for staff
salaries. Here's how some of the rest of the leadership money is
spent:
</P>
<P>
   _ More than $17,600 on travel, most of it for a Democratic
retreat at the Wintergreen resort in Virginia with President
Clinton at the end of his impeachment crisis in February. Meeting
rooms and audio-visual equipment rental cost about $6,000 more.
</P>
<P>
   _ Refreshments and meals for strategy meetings of the Republican
House Conference (ranging from $31.50 for Dunkin' Donuts to $1,229
for a December session).
</P>
<P>
   _ Balloons ($92.53), listed as ``supplies for official meeting''
of the Republicans in February.
</P>
<P>
   SENATE LEADERSHIP AND POLITICAL PARTY OFFICES: $11.6 million
</P>
<P>
   Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Minority Leader Tom
Daschle, D-S.D., receive $1.3 million each for their leadership
operations, and the rest is divided among the other party leaders
and party organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Among expenses reported this year:
</P>
<P>
   _ Senate Republicans totalled more than $13,000 in television
satellite feeds to beam their members' comments to the public
during the first two months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Senate Democrats reported spending $1,545 for satellite feeds
during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   VICE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE
</P>
<P>
   Although Al Gore was elected vice president of the United
States, the job that provides his salary and much of his staff is
his post as president of the Senate. Under the Constitution, the
vice president presides over the upper chamber and votes to break
ties. Gore rarely goes to Capitol Hill, but the legislative branch
nevertheless pays $1.7 million a year to support about 30 members
of his staff, most of whom are based in the White House complex.
Congress also gives Gore a $10,000 annual expense account.
</P>
<P>
   OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, the senior Republican
member of the chamber, serves in the largely ceremonial post whose
chief duty is to open the Senate's daily sessions. ``Few presidents
pro tem in the 20th century have had much influence in the
Senate,'' says Congressional Quarterly's Guide to Congress. The
position includes an 11-person staff and costs $404,000. The Senate
is considering a $33,000 increase for next year. ``The biggest
thing is he is third in line for the presidency,'' said Thurmond's
spokesman John DeCrosta. Otherwise, the spokesman said that the
staff has ``various and sundry'' duties, such as scheduling
Thurmond's appearances.
</P>
<P>
   LEADERS' SALARIES
</P>
<P>
   House speaker: $175,400
</P>
<P>
   House majority leader: $151,800
</P>
<P>
   House minority leader: $151,800
</P>
<P>
   Senate president (vice president of the United States): $175,400
</P>
<P>
   Senate president pro tempore: $151,800
</P>
<P>
   Senate majority leader: $151,800
</P>
<P>
   Senate minority leader: $151,800
</P>
<P>
   Expense accounts: $25,000 for the House speaker, $10,000 each
for others.
</P>
<P>
   MEMBERS OF CONGRESS:
</P>
<P>
   Salary: $136,700
</P>
<P>
   Office allowance for House: From $570,000 to about $1 million,
depending on size and population of district
</P>
<P>
   Office allowance for Senate: From $1.8 million (for each
Delaware senator) to $3.1 million (for California)
</P>
<P>
   COMMITTEES:
</P>
<P>
   Staff, expenses for 19 House committees: $115 million
</P>
<P>
   Staff, expenses for 19 Senate committees: $78.1 million
</P>
<P>
   Staff, expenses for 2 joint committees: $9.4 million
</P>
<P>
   MEDICAL BENEFITS FOR MEMBERS:
</P>
<P>
   _ Office of attending physician: $1.9 million (House members pay
$290 a year, senators pay $520 a year for unlimited office visits,
hospital visits, lab work, and other treatment).
</P>
<P>
   _ Free treatment at Walter Reed Army Hospital or Bethesda Naval
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   _ Government-financed health insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESSIONAL PENSIONS: $20 million
</P>
<P>
   Retirement benefits for members of Congress are calculated at a
higher rate than for other federal employees and include annual
cost of living increases, which few private plans offer. Pensions
this year average $60,000 per retired lawmaker, according to the
National Taxpayers Union. These funds are not counted in the annual
legislative appropriations.
</P>
<P>
   OFFICE OF COMPLIANCE: $2 million
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1995, Congress voted to require itself to follow 11
laws already enacted for the rest of the country on workplace
health and safety and non-discrimination. However, Congress has
arranged its own system of enforcement that does not hold
lawmakers, or their office budgets, individually responsible. For
example, employees can charge a member of Congress with employment
discrimination, and any settlement paid comes from taxpayer funds,
with all records kept secret. Only a handful of appeals have gone
into the courts, where the cases become public.
</P>
<P>
   CAPITOL POLICE: $85 million
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 officers patrol the Capitol grounds and
surrounding neighborhoods and provide bodyguard protection to top
congressional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   BOTANIC GARDEN: $3.5 million
</P>
<P>
   Congress operates the botanical garden to ``collect, cultivate,
and grow the various flora of the United States and other
countries'' for study and for garden clubs. Included in next year's
spending plan is $153,000 to design renovations for a fountain
designed by Frederic Auguste Bartholdi, the artist who sculpted the
Statue of Liberty. Renovating the fountain, just west of the
Rayburn House Office Building, is expected to cost $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS: $197 million
</P>
<P>
   Besides upkeep for the U.S. Capitol and its 58.8 acre Capitol
Hill grounds, Congress also provides maintenance and utilities for
a complex that has expanded this century to include five House
office buildings, three Senate buildings, and three buildings for
the Library of Congress. Among the continuous renovations, workmen
are currently replacing the lead-based paint in phase one of a $30
million restoration project on the inside of the Capitol dome.
</P>
<P>
   RESEARCH AND INVESTIGATIONS
</P>
<P>
   _ GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE: $372 million
</P>
<P>
   The investigating arm of Congress, which conducts extensive
research into whether executive agencies are carrying out laws and
programs effectively and efficiently. GAO produces hundreds of
reports with thousands of recommendations each year. The agency
also publishes an annual list of recommendations that have not been
followed. This year's report on ``open'' recommendations is 171
pages.
</P>
<P>
   _ LIBRARY OF CONGRESS: $294.6 million
</P>
<P>
   The world's biggest library, with 17 million books and other
historical documents for use by lawmakers and the public.
</P>
<P>
   _ CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE: $71 million
</P>
<P>
   Provides background reports for lawmakers on legislative issues.
</P>
<P>
   _ CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE: $26.2 million
</P>
<P>
   Provides economic and budgetary estimates.

   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Tuesday narrowed the scope of
a federal law banning discrimination against workers with
handicaps, saying that the law does not apply to such disabilities
as poor eyesight that can be corrected medically.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling on three related cases, the court dismissed
discrimination lawsuits by two nearsighted pilots, a truck driver
almost blind in one eye and a mechanic with high blood pressure who
were either fired or denied employment.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the lawsuits was brought under the 1990 American with
Disabilities Act, which was designed to end discrimination on the
job, in housing and at medical facilities and other places that
serve the public.
</P>
<P>
   The law defines disability as ``a physical or mental impairment
that substantially limits one or more major life activities'' or a
condition where a person is ``being regarded as having such
impairment.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing in the case of the two
nearsighted pilots, said, ``We hold that determination of whether
an individual is disabled should be made with reference to measures
that mitigate the individual's impairment, including, in this
instance, eyeglasses and contact lenses.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 7-2 opinion, the court ruled that the poor eyesight of the
two pilots, Karen Sutton and Kimberly Hinton, failed to
``substantially limit a major life activity'' in their lives and,
therefore, they were not covered under the ADA.
</P>
<P>
   The court reached the same conclusion in the other two cases,
ruling unanimously that truck driver Haille Kirkingburg and 7-2
that mechanic Vaughn Murphy should not be considered disabled under
the ADA.
</P>
<P>
   In each of the cases, the court also ruled that the plaintiffs
failed to show that the companies they sued had banned them from an
entire class of job, such as pilot or driver. Instead, the court
said, the companies refused to consider each person for a specific
job with strict, reasonable criteria that the plaintiffs failed to
meet.
</P>
<P>
   In its rulings, the court said that the ADA allows companies to
prefer certain physical characteristics over others, as long as
those attributes do not rise to the level of being a disability.
</P>
<P>
   ``An employer is free to decide that physical characteristics or
medical conditions that are not impairments are preferable to
others, just as it is free to decide that some limiting impairments
make individuals less than ideally suited for a job,'' O'Connor
said in the pilots' case.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years employers have won 92 percent of the 700 ADA
cases resolved in court from 1992 to 1997, according to the
American Bar Association.
</P>
<P>
   Lower courts had split over how far the law's protections extend
in today's cases, from Colorado, Oregon and Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Bokat, general counsel of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
called the court's decision in rejecting the lawsuits ``extremely
important'' for American business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means that those with true disabilities will continue to be
covered, but people with easily correctable conditions will not be
considered disabled,'' he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   But Louis Bograd, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties
Union, a legal watchdog group, said the court's ruling were a
``serious blow'' to civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court has narrowed the ADA so that it covers only a small,
small group of people and not the people it was meant to cover,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate ruling that also centered on the ADA law, the high
court held 6-3 in a Georgia case that states may have to place
people with mental disabilities in homelike settings if they can
fare just as well there as in state hospitals. In the narrow
decision, the court said the ADA law requires such community
placement of the mentally disabled whenever appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We confront the question whether the proscription of
discrimination may require placement of persons with mental
disabilities in community settings, rather than in institutions,''
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for the court. ``The answer, we
hold, is a qualified yes.''

BIRD SPOTS UP . . AT NO. 30? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No. 30?
</P>
<P>
   Come on, ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Bird has to be better than the 30th-best athlete of the
20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Or so most would think.
</P>
<P>
   In ESPN's ratings, Bird is higher than fellow NBAers Oscar
Robertson (No. 36), Julius Erving (No. 43), Elgin Baylor (No. 58),
Jerry West (No. 62), and Bob Cousy (No. 94).
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the rankings supposedly are based on
athletic ability. By all accounts, Bird was not exactly the most
athletic fella around.
</P>
<P>
   But he was one of the most feared players ever. Here's what a
few opponents had to say about Bird during the 30-minute profile
airing Friday at 10:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd much rather guard Michael Jordan than Larry Bird because
you have to play the game as a thinker when you're playing him,''
said James Worthy. ``You have to get inside his mind. Larry wasn't
quick, couldn't jump really high, but there was just some sleepless
nights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I played, Larry Bird was the only one I feared,'' said
Magic Johnson. ``A lot of black guys always ask me, `Did Larry Bird
really play that good?' I said, `Larry Bird is so good it's
frightening.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Woolridge also gave Bird his props: ``Larry was the
originator of getting in your face and talking trash. And then you
sit there and you go, `Look at this guy up in my face talking
noise.' He ain't that fast. He's slow, but he knew how to aggravate
you, agitate you enough to get you out of your game.''
</P>
<P>
   The keys to Bird's success, according to Indiana University
coach Bobby Knight, were two seldom-mentioned basketball skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a mind that was like a camera,'' Knight said. ``He had
the best hand-eye coordination of maybe anybody that played
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Bird was a great basketball player. But the 30th-best
athlete of the 20th century?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Better than Bobby Orr, ESPN's 31st-best athlete?
</P>
<P>
   ESPN hasn't gone totally loopy.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Williams hasn't been ranked yet, nor has Bill Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Neither has Jack Nicklaus, nor Babe Ruth, nor Jim Brown, nor
Muhammad Ali, nor Michael Jordan, nor Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, nor Wilt
Chamberlain.

NBA takes a dip
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the rate the Spurs-Knicks series is going, this is bound to
be the lowest-rated NBA Finals in 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   Ratings for the first game last Wednesday were 36 percent lower
than last year's Jazz-Bulls opener. The second game was even worse:
44 percent lower than last year's Finals, and 21 percent lower than
the second game in 1994 between the Knicks and Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   NBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol conceded that the loss of
Jordan has had considerable impact. Injuries have kept the Knicks
from making the series more competitive, and having a team from the
NBA's smallest television market doesn't help, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, after basically a decade of the greatest athlete of
this generation, we're due for a building year,'' Ebersol told the
Associated Press. ``And this may be ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol went on to say that he thought the ratings would be down
as much as 25-30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's all over, if it goes six games we'll be right
there,'' Ebersol said. ``If it's a four-game sweep, we'll be
lower.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol said regular-season and earlier playoff ratings were
higher than expected, so the network won't have to repay
advertisers for not delivering promised audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We so overperformed our guarantees for the regular season and
earlier rounds that we have no problems,'' Ebersol said. ``We just
have the problem of any series: We want more than four games.
That's up to the gods.''

   SEOUL _ There's a T-shirt on sale here that says ``Korea _
Asia's Best Kept Secret.'' Truer words were never stamped on a
T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   From its border with North Korea, where perhaps the world's most
unusual tour is conducted, to its sunny southern island of Cheju,
where ancient history blends with thoroughly modern recreation,
Korea is filled with unexpected delights. Whether part of a wider
tour of Asia or as a destination in itself, the Korean peninsula is
a ``secret'' well worth discovering.
</P>
<P>
   For my wife, Linda, daughter, Amy, and me, this was a journey of
discovery in more than one way. Amy, whom we adopted at age 2, was
born there nearly 27 years ago. For 10 days in May, we explored the
land of her birth, and in addition to learning a little more about
her background, we found a clean, safe, friendly country filled
with scenery, history, culture, shopping (and more shopping),
reasonable prices, good (if sometimes exotic) food, and fun times.
With 38,031 square miles, South Korea is slightly smaller than the
state of Virginia, yet it is packed with attractions.
</P>
<P>
   We picked a serendipitous time to visit, too. A royal ritual was
about to take place, a major festival was scheduled, and holidays
would celebrate both children and their parents. What's more, the
country was abloom with wisteria, azalea, rhododendron, lilacs, and
forsythia. Even a few cherry blossoms lingered after their April
peak.
</P>
<P>
   As most trips to Korea do, this one began in Seoul. Riding from
Kimpo Airport to the heart of Seoul, we were introduced to what has
been called the Miracle by the Han River: a thriving, vibrant,
skyscrapered city that, through the fierce determination and hard
work of its people, sprang from the devastation of the Korean War
in the early 1950s.

   In Seoul, the energy is almost palpable. It's a heavily
trafficked city, with sometimes daredevil drivers, and it's a huge
city. (How huge? Nearly 12 million of South Korea's 46 million
residents live in the metropolitan area. On a typical day, there
are 227 marriages and 45 divorces, 463 births and 108 deaths, 305
auto purchases, 1,272 new drivers' licenses, and 5,684 traffic
tickets.)

   Shrines and shops
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But within this modern city is another Seoul: one that reflects
the 5,000-year-old culture and civilization of Korea _ a Seoul of
richly adorned palaces, temples, and shrines. Perhaps picking up on
Seoul's energy, we gave outselves no resting time after our long
flight and headed for Changgyungkung Palace, where the annual Royal
Shrine Ritual was taking place at the adjoining Chongmyo Shrine.
The ritual is replete with processions, colorful costumes, and
music. After joining in the jockeying for position, we listened to
the horns and drums, and my wife remarked: ``Just think, the
instruments alone are older than America.'' The Confucian ceremony
welcomes ancestral spirits of the Chosun Dynasty, entertains them,
and ushers them out. So I hope the spirits forgave jet-lagged me
for inadvertently stepping on a walkway that is reserved for
spirits alone.
</P>
<P>
   We visited another palace, Changdukkung, which conducts tours in
English and provides a wondrous look into another time. Included is
the Secret Garden. (What's the secret? There really is none, we
were told; the name stems from a mistranslation of a sign.) And we
stopped by Buddhist temples, with their striking red and gold decor
and ageless ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   But, to our daughter's delight, it was now shopping time, at one
of Seoul's most charming districts, Insadong. We wandered among the
shops and galleries bearing art, antiques (including lovely
cabinets and chests), crafts, and novelties. Calligraphy supplies
are a specialty, and my daughter ordered a seal with her middle
name: Joy.
</P>
<P>
   Insadong boasts a lot of restaurants, too, and we enjoyed our
first meal in Korea at a small place, wielding stainless steel
chopsticks over a variety of dishes, including bulgogi, a thinly
sliced and tasty meat, and kimchi, that powerfully pickled
cabbage-based food that, along with steamed rice, is the unofficial
national dish. Korean meals typically have a variety of dishes in
small bowls. While I enjoyed most of the meat and vegetables, my
tastes were too Westernized for the more exotic types of seafood
such as cuttlefish, whelk, and sea cucumbers. Koreans like their
food spicy, but usually red pepper paste is served on the side so
you can adjust the spiciness to your liking. (And if you must, you
can find Western style meals in Korea, even fast food at places
with names like Happy Wing and, yes, McDonald's).)
</P>
<P>
   Seoul is a city of shopping areas for everything from trendy
clothes to electronics to jewelry. But we next went to the
Namdaemum people's market, where an astonishing array of goods is
on sale at 1,500 outdoor kiosks, and bargaining _ sometimes major,
sometimes minor _ is permitted. Clothes, jewelry, foodstuffs,
flowers, designer look-alikes, and toys overflowed, and the prices
were excellent. One saleswoman, learning my daughter was born in
Korea, gave her a gift; this kind act would be repeated later at
the Itaewon market area.

</P>
<P>
   The DMZ
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The following morning we did what we recommend every tourist do:
visited the Korean National Tourism Office in Seoul. Here you'll
find a multitude of booklets, brochures, displays, and _ to show
how seriously Korea takes tourism _ a complaint department. Many
kinds of tours can be booked here, including the most unusual one
I've ever taken: to the Demilitarized Zone.
</P>
<P>
   Located as it is between China and Japan, Korea has often been
the target of aggression and foreign rule. The war between North
and South Korea flared from 1950 to 1953, leading to a cease-fire
(but not a peace accord) and the creation of a Demilitarized Zone
and the truce village of Panmunjom, where Nerth Korea and the UN
Command have met sporadically ever since and as recently as last
week in a dispute over territorial waters. Only authorized tours
are permitted, and you soon learn this is no trip to fool around
on. Wearing jeans or open sandals is not permitted; no one wants to
give the North Koreans an opportunity to photograph sloppy
visitors. And because violence has flared occasionally, you are
required to sign a waiver.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, a visit is fascinating, even though seeing a North
Korean soldier looking at you through binoculars may well give you
a chill. The tour includes a stop in the peace conference room,
with a line of demarcation running down the middle. You can step
from one side of the line to the other, thus going from South Korea
to North Korea. All the while you are guarded by South Korean
soldiers assuming a modified tae kwon do stance known as ROK Ready,
the ROK standing for the Republic of Korea, which is South Korea's
official name.
</P>
<P>
   The tour, which costs about $50 and takes about seven hours,
includes stops at Korean War memorials for Philippine participants,
fallen war correspondents, and 10 brave Korean soldiers who gave
their lives to save others. It also includes a buffet lunch of
mostly American-style dishes and an opportunity to shop at low
prices for a variety of goods, including Korea's popular and
beautiful amethyst jewelery. Myself, I brought home a framed piece
of the barbed wire that runs along the border for 151 miles.
</P>
<P>
   The DMZ gave us a lot to think about that day, but back in Seoul
we lightened our mood with a visit to the massive Lotte department
store. As we did on our Korean Air flight and in our hotel, the
Sofitel Ambassador, we observed the kind of constant, helpful,
enthusiastic service that, sadly, seems to be fading fast in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   At night, it was off to Korea House, a tourist favorite in a
traditional wood-framed, tile-roofed building, where we dined
Korean style and saw traditional music and dance. The dancers'
bright, multicolored costumes were topped only by their intricate
steps, with the women coordinating their movements perfectly to
make pretty patterns with fans, and the men leaping and bounding
and gyrating their heads so that streamers attached to their hats
created spirals in the air. All this was accompanied by
almost-hypnotic music from such instruments as a gong and hourglass
drum.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Significant stops
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was time to see the Korea that exists away from Seoul _ a
Korea where rows of misty and mystical green hills are almost
ever-present, as are the rectangular, watery patches of land where
rice is grown. No wonder the country is called the Land of the
Morning Calm.
</P>
<P>
   In Seoul you can almost always find someone who speaks enough
English (and delightfully accented at that) to help you. And most
people will go out of their way for you. Away from Seoul, English
isn't as widely spoken, although road signs are in English as well
as Hangul (Korean). If you're the adventurous type and carry a
phrasebook, you can rent a car or use the extensive public transit
system, or you can be part of a tour group. But you can also hire
drivers and English-speaking guides. Our guide from Global Tour
Ltd., a 27-year old dynamo named Sarah Chung, was simply the best
we have had anywhere. Her English was excellent, her knowledge of
the country extensive, her sense of humor delightful, and her
dedication remarkable. If I were ever to open a guide agency, I
would staff it with Sarah Chung clones.

<P>
   ``I would always come out of his office well briefed,'' joked
McGinty, even though she was supposed to be doing the briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in contrast to many politicians-turned-authors, actually
wrote ``Earth in the Balance,'' which he described as a ``spiritual
journey'' following his 1988 defeat and an accident that almost
killed his son. In it, Gore compared mounting environmental
problems to the years before World War II, suggesting that failure
to take strong actions could produce an environmental disaster to
rival the war with Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers said Gore gave an overly gloomy assessment.
Journalist Gregg Easterbrook says the book doesn't note US
environmental progress until page 82, even though the air and water
are measurably cleaner than a few decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   The book's first half ``might have been ghosted by Chicken
Little,'' argues Easterbrook in his own book, ``A Moment on the
Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Democrats worried during the 1992 election that the vice
presidential nominee's views could open the Clinton-Gore ticket to
charges of extremism. Gore ``equates the failure to recycle
aluminum cans with the Holocaust _ an equation that parodies the
former and dishonors the latter,'' wrote Democratic National
Committee staffer Jonathan Sallet in a 1992 memo trying to
anticipate GOP attacks.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore caught the rising wave of environmental concern in the
United States, as the record-hot 1980s and disasters such as the
Exxon Valdez oil spill convinced many that his grim assessment was
right. Left-leaning Mother Jones magazine dubbed Gore ``the Green
Knight'' as he took office and brought on former staff members to
take the administration's top two environmental posts.
</P>
<P>
   Within months, environmentalists were criticizing the
administration for not doing enough, and offering litmus tests for
Gore to ``prove'' his commitment. Even when the administration beat
back Republican efforts to weaken environmental laws in 1995,
Clinton still got a ``21 chainsaw salute'' from activists angry
that he signed a measure allowing logging on federal land with
little environmental oversight.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, environmental groups pressed Gore to support stronger
limits on air pollution by mocking Gore's fondness for Rachel
Carson, author of the seminal book ``Silent Spring.'' As officials
signaled they would reject the smog and soot standards,
environmentalists complained about ``Al Gore's Silent Spring''
because he had not spoken up.
</P>
<P>
   Gore finally backed up EPA Administrator Carol Browner, and
Clinton endorsed the new standards, but Gore was angered that
activists had publicly tried to divide him from his boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed that they do those things,'' said Browner,
Gore's former Senate chief of staff. ``You can't find a better,
more committed public leader on protecting our environment than Al
Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, environmentalists are only doing what every
advocacy group does: demanding more. Even Gore's harshest critics
acknowledge that the Clinton administration has been much better
for their cause than the Republican administrations that preceded
it. For example:
</P>
<P>
   --Clinton created a 1.7-million-acre national monument in Utah
and committed the government to the world's biggest environmental
restoration project in the Florida Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   --He drastically reduced logging on federal lands, including
spotted-owl habitat in the Northwest and Alaskan rainforest.
</P>
<P>
   --He put up $1 billion for so-called clean energy research this
fiscal year, and the federal government is working with the auto
industry to develop an 80-mile-per-gallon car.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for each achievement, people like Clapp of the National
Environmental Trust list occasions where Clinton and Gore fell
short: The air cleanup at national parks that takes 60 years to be
fully effective; the Midwestern coal plants that are still exempt
from key pollution standards; the ban on new roads in the
wilderness that may be lifted soon.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, environmentalists say the administration has not
curbed the United States' world-leading emissions of carbon
dioxide, the main ``greenhouse gas.'' The administration won't come
close to meeting its goal of returning to 1990 emissions levels by
next year; instead, the country is expected to be about 13 percent
over.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Gore's declaration of his candidacy last Wednesday,
policies will be seen through the lens of presidential politics.
Some political strategists warn that Gore is already too closely
identified with the environment _ the only cause Gore was
significantly associated with in a recent Washington Post/ABC News
poll _ and that he should emphasize other concerns such as
education.
</P>
<P>
   However, environmentalists say they could back another candidate
if Gore avoids their issues. Some note that Democratic challenger
Bill Bradley has a higher lifetime rating from the League of
Conservation Voters than Gore. And Bush recently met with leaders
of the Environmental Defense Fund, announcing not long afterward
that he now believes global warming is real.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people are saying to Gore is that, `For better or worse,
Al, you are the environmental candidate in everybody's eyes right
now. For you to run away from it, it hurts you,' '' said Denis
Hayes of Seattle, the cofounder of Earth Day.
</P>
<P>
   Gore staffers say their man won't duck environmental issues, but
he won't get shaken up over threats, either. After years of
``disappointing'' environmentalists, he doesn't await their
approval.
</P>
<P>
   As Browner of the EPA put it, ``He's human. It can't feel very
good. On the other hand, he believes in what he is doing.''

MONTREAL EXPLORES THE COSMOS

<P>
   Montreal has always been very international, but this summer it
is offering an otherworldly experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cosmos: From Romanticism to the Avant-garde'' at the Montreal
Museum of Fine Arts explores how artists visualized relationships
between the earth and the universe. More than 380 works from 20
countries are featured. Artists include Frederic Edwin Church,
Thomas Cole, Albert Bierstadt, Van Gogh, Picasso, Calder, and David
Friedrich, whose work is seldom seen outside Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   As we enter the 21st century, Cosmos is all about immagination
and the relationship of earth and sky. It's a fascinating look at
our world as artists and others explored both the unknown and
reality. Some paintings are utopian views, others show the planet
in turbulence. There are scenes of beauty _ Bierstadt's
``Yellowstone'' is one. Besides paintings, there are photographs,
from daguerreotypes dating from 1854 to NASA photos, an old space
suit, sculpture, a meteorite, and scientific objects.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit can be seen only in Montreal through Oct. 17. Cosmos
is the new frontier as you've never experienced it. For more
information, call 514-285-2000 or visit www.mmfa.qc.ca.
</P>
<P>
   From Boston, Montreal is an easy five-or-so-hour drive, or just
an hour by plane with great service from Air Canada and other
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal is particularly festive in summer. From July 1 through
11, the 20th annual International Jazz Festival fills the city with
music from noon to midnight. More than 400 concerts are planned,
300 of them free. For information on packages to the festival, call
888-515-0515 or visit www.montrealjazzfest.com. For ticket
information, call 800-361-4595. Other evnts include the Benson &AMP;
Hedges International Fireworks Competition through July 28, and the
Just for Laughs Festival July 15-25.
</P>
<P>
   Being the second largest French speaking city after Paris,
Montreal has a very European ambience, and a lively night life.
Saint-Denis is one of the liveliest streets at night, filled with
trendy new restaurants like Jongleux Cafe. For lively action 24
hours a day, the European-style Casino offers not only gaming
action but great dining and shows. Its dinner-theater is featuring
``Sinatra Remembered,'' a must for any Sinatra fan (one of the
stars bears a remarkable resemblance to Frank). And you won't go
broke seeing this show, which includes a three-course dinner along
with wine and a champagne welcome for $69 _ that's Canadian, which
means the American dollar buys the show at a 40 percent or more
discount. A Casino package including two nights' accommodation, and
air fare begins at $265. Call 800-MONTREAL.
</P>
<P>
   With the dollar buying more in Canada, it's a good time to visit
_ especially Montreal, one of the liveliest and most interesting
cities in North America. For more information, call 800-363-7777 or

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL _ This may have been my first trip to Korea, but the
memories came rushing back.
</P>
<P>
   My husband and I were traveling with our 26-year-old daughter,
Amy, who had been adopted from South Korea at age 2. We had talked
about visiting the country some years before this trip but Amy
wasn't ready. Now she was, and here are the memories our trip
rekindled:
</P>
<P>
   As our jet neared Kimpo Airport, I could see women squatting in
the rice paddies, planting seedlings _ something we would see
almost everywhere. Amy, when she arrived in America, would squat,
seemingly for hours, while she played. Now I knew where that
position had come from.
</P>
<P>
   We saw women with babies and small children tied to their backs
by a garment made for carrying. When Amy got her first doll, she
she took a tiny blanket and showed me how she wanted the doll tied
to her back. That was why.
</P>
<P>
   The first few times Amy saw cats in our yard, she would yell and
throw things at them _ highly uncharacteristic for this fun-loving
child. During our visit, we saw no cats whatsoever, and that
explained Amy's behavior _ she was probably frightened of animals
she wasn't familiar with.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was that hot and spicy Korean cabbage dish called
kimchi. A few months after Amy arrived, we took her to a Korean
restaurant and watched her devour kimchi, all the while making
hissing, blowing sounds because of the spiciness. Most of the meals
we ate on our trip consisted of small communal dishes, and kimchi
was always among them. It was the bowl I avoided and the one Amy
finished, just as she did a quarter-century ago
</P>
<P>
   While on our 10-day trip, I learned that thumbsucking and
pacifiers are frowned upon in Korea. And that, I realized, is why
Amy would get so upset when our younger son sucked his thumb. She
must have considered me an unfit mother!
</P>
<P>
   When we went to the Korean Folk Village outside of Seoul, we saw
houses with charcoal heaters that sit in the middle of the floor
and bedding that is stored at night. To our surprise, our guide
told us that families would have lived in such homes in the 1970s.
Then I remembered that Amy came to us with small scars on her arms
that were attributed in the adoption report to ``possible burns
from charcoal heaters.''
</P>
<P>
   After returning home, I was exhausted by the long flight and the
13-hour time difference. I thought about the tiny 2-year-old who
had made that flight and then wanted to sleep when we were awake
and wanted to play while we were sleeping. I could see her tired
face so clearly.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting Korea, it turned out, was a wonderful way of revisiting
memories.

   TAKE-BOS  
 SEOUL: ... Chung clones.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On this day, with a couple of significant stops, we would ride
some 175 miles, from west to east, to Kangwon Province and stay in
the Mount Sorak area at, of all things, a British-style hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Stop number one didn't have a lot to do with tourism, though. It
was in Wonju, where our daughter was found abandoned at age 2 and
brought to City Hall. The visit yielded no memories for Amy and no
new information about her past, but we felt it was worth making for
Amy to see the city.
</P>
<P>
   Stop number two was one of those surprises that helped make the
trip so delightful. We pulled into the Chamsori Gramophone &AMP; Audio
Museum in Kang Reung-City. And for a fan of old-time radios and
Victrolas, as I am, the place was nirvana. The museum contains more
than 4,000 items, all of them working. They range from music boxes
to many, many Victor Talking Machines to Bakelite radios to a 1925
TV set to today's DVDs, played on a sound system that will rock
you. Many of the machines were housed in beautiful cabinets, and
many were rare.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sorak National Park
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At our British-style hotel, the Kensington, with its rich cherry
wood and its ``tally-ho'' hunting portraits, we settled in, then
dined upon _ shall I confess? _ pizza and spaghetti. We had to fuel
up, because, after all, there was a mountain to explore the next
day.
</P>
<P>
   That mountain is Sorak, at 5,839 feet the third-highest peak in
Korea. At Soraksan National Park, which was not overly crowded this
May morning, we boarded a subway-style cable car for a scenic ride
near the mountaintop, envisioning how beautiful the trees must look
when they dress in the reds and golds of autumn. But the park is
stunning in any season, with its jagged peaks, lush valleys, and
deep forests.
</P>
<P>
   This was Children's Day in Korea (I explained to our guide that
every day is Children's Day in America) and youngsters were
plentiful in the park on this national holiday. And what
adorable-looking children they are, although their good looks
didn't deter some of them from concocting pranks, just like
children all over the world. Our daughter climbed proudly to the
peak of Sorak. But she found that to come down, it was necessary to
be more humble and scoot for a while.
</P>
<P>
   We could have spent many more hours at Sorak. But in the late
afternoon, another pleasant surprise awaited: the Waterpia
waterpark in Sokcho. Here, indoors and out, there are large pools,
fountains, massage pools, and even a lemon-jasmine pool filled with
neon green water. Seldom have I felt more relaxed than after my
soaking at Waterpia.
</P>
<P>
   We learned also that from Sept. 11-Oct. 30, Sokcho will be the
site of the massive International Travel Expo '99, open to the
public and featuring pavilions, shows, rides, a 240-foot-high
tower, nature attractions, and special events, with a theme of
``Man, Nature, and the Life of the Future.'' The expo is expected
to draw 3 million people. Afterward, the site will become a
permanent amusement and cultural park.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cheju Island
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With our Korean odyssey at the halway point, we flew south to
sunny Cheju, island, often called the Hawaii of Korea. It's a
favorite spot for honeymooners, offering a balmy blend of
recreation, scenery, and legend. It's also the home of Mount Halla,
Korea's highest peak at 6,397 feet. And wherever you go, you will
be met by statues of the village guardians _ smiling Mongols.
They're the emblem of the island, and we posed for pictures beside
large versions of them in the lobby of the KAL Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Cheju island features golf, hunting, horseback riding (and a
horse racing track), snorkeling, scuba diving, windsurfing,
fishing, and just lying on the beach. It even has Las Vegas-style
casinos _ for foreigners only (Koreans aren't permitted to lose
their cash foolishly).
</P>
<P>
   We, however, immersed ourselves in scenery, visiting such places
as Sunrise Peak, a volcano whose sides plunge dramtically into the
surf and where dolphins are sometimes seen frolicking; the cool,
wet Hypochae-Ri Lava Caves, including one of the few in the world
with stalagmites and stalactites; the Mok Suk Won Garden, where
basalt and driftwood have been ingeniously arranged to represent
local legends; the gorgeous and extensive Yeomiji Botanic Garden;
and the Chonjiyon Waterfall, which is striking, but do be careful
where you step: We saw a woman fall off the rocks and into the
water (she was quickly rescued). At night, there was shopping in an
underground mall that seemed to stretch on forever, and a meal at
the Lotteria, a takeoff on 1950s' America, with chrome and vinyl
chairs, a mural featuring a pink Cadillac, and even a star from a
mock Hollywood Walk of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Back to Seoul
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We flew back to Seoul on Parents' Day, which combines our
Mothers' Day and Fathers' Day. Parents are traditionally presented
small flower corsages, so our daughter got in the spirit of things
by giving us corsages. Throughout the day there was a flower in my
lapel and a smile on my face.
</P>
<P>
   That evening was our opportunity to see . . . Lotte World! This
is an indoor-outdoor, Disney-style amusement park, complete with
castle. (The name Lotte, like the names Samsung, Hyundai, KAL, and
a few others, crops up everywhere in Korea, on a variety of
products, buildings, and attractions.) Being an amusement park
buff, I enjoyed myself immensely, taking in the half-hour electric
light parade starring Lotty and Lorry Raccoon (think Mickey and
Minnie Mouse), but for once I left rides the wilder rides such as
the Waikiki Wave and the Gyro Drop to the younger people.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, our last full day, was devoted to a couple of
attractions 90 or so minutes from Seoul. The first, the Korean Folk
Village in Suwon, is a must for visitors (and was the first place
where we saw more than two or three other Caucasian faces).
Although we had enjoyed the Cheju Folk Village, this one was even
more extensive, with displays of everything from making mulberry
paper to weaving silk from silkworms. The one-room wooden houses
looked old indeed _ until we learned that our guide had lived in
such a house until the 1970s. There were Korean dances and a
dramatic tae kwon do exhibition where the performers battled with
balletic grace. And there was a wedding. During the week such
marriages are staged, but on Sundays it's the real thing. The
couple, in traditional dress, faced each other, bowed, and knelt.
There is a legend that if the bride smiles during the ceremony, the
first child will be a girl. And although the bride had covered her
mouth with her billowing sleeves, her smile reached all the way
into her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The second attraction was another of those delightful surprises:
the Ceramic Festival in Yoju. Korea is a land of festivals, and at
this one, booth after booth had bargain-priced vases, lamps, and
other items, some with swirls, others with tigers and dragons.
There were snacks and drinks and Teletubbies (yes, those bizarre TV
creatures are popular here, too). My wife and daughter left with
ornate vases, and I walked away holding a Donald Duck cup.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A poignant farewell
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Our final day was also the most poignant because we visited the
Seoul headquarters of Holt International, the organization that had
brought Amy into foster care and eventually to us.
</P>
<P>
   A Holt representative found our daughter's records, and she
learned that she had been found clutching a note that told her name
and birthday. For 25 years, we had believed, either through
miscommunication or misinformation, that Amy's Korean name of Choi
Gi Sook and her birth date had arbitrarily been given to her by the
orphanage. Now we knew this wasn't so, and our daughter would leave
Korea with a name, a birthday, and, after visiting her birth land,
a new pride in being Korean. Looking at her, poised and lovely in a
peach-colored dress, I thought of the frightened 2-year-old who
came kicking and screaming into our lives and I stifled a sob.
</P>
<P>
   It was time to head home. Despite all that we had seen (and so
much that we hadn't, including the major cities of Pusan and
Inchon), I think that what will linger longest in memory are the
everyday scenes: uniformed schoolgirls strolling along holding
hands . . . mothers carrying their babies papoose-style on their
backs . . . a teenage boy going far out of his way to give us
directions . . . an elderly woman singing a lovely, lilting tune to
herself while climbing down Mount Sorak . . . people using what few
English words they knew to make us feel at home . . . kerchiefed
women bent over, working in the rice fields . . . sharp-dressed men
and stylishly dressed women striding down the streets of Seoul with
cell phones attached to their ears . . . and a young boy casually
sidling up to us to get a better view of such unusual-looking
people.
</P>
<P>
   Our suitcases were filled with great souvenirs, but our minds
were filled with even greater memories.

GRENADA SPA EVEN OFFERS FENCING LESSONS

   PINK GIN BEACH, Grenada _ The fragrance of jasmine was in the
air and sunlight dappled the red and white bougainvillea outside
our room when we awoke on the first morning of our trip to this
sweet, unspoiled Caribbean island.
</P>
<P>
   It was only 6:45, but there was no time to smell the flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have 10 minutes before the Power Walk begins,'' the
husband warned, ``and right after breakfast we have a fencing
lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   (itals)Fencing in the Caribbean?(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   ``You gotta be kidding,'' the wife exclaimed, rolling over and
shutting her eyes for a little more sleep.
</P>
<P>
   But the husband wasn't kidding. He was already lacing up his
running shoes. There was much to do.
</P>
<P>
   We had come to this island, 100 miles due north of Venezuela,
for a stay at a five-year-old health spa known as La Source, where
the minutes of the day are calculated against the number of
activities one can fit into it between sunrise and sunset.
</P>
<P>
   And so it was, after a brisk two-mile walk along a narrow road
winding up a bluff, followed by a healthy breakfast of island
fruits and pastries, that we suited up in form-fitting white
jackets and protective gloves, and _ foils in hand _ headed to our
fencing class, prepared to learn the specifics of lunges, parries,
and ``en gardes'' that make up this martial tradition.
</P>
<P>
   It's a martial tradition that has more to do with England, which
once claimed Grenada as a colony, than the Caribbean. The King's
English is still spoken on this island, now an independent
protectorate. You also hear a local, lyrical patois that is a
mixture of Carib Indian and French, the latter having tried and
failed to capture the former in the 18th century.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, our instruction in fencing had nothing to do with
self defense _ unless the idea is to make adversaries laugh
themselves to death. This was all in quest of good health and
exercise. And that morning's fencing was just the beginning of
both.
</P>
<P>
   The range of activities being offered at La Source on that
typical day went like this:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   7:00 a.m. Gymnasium opens
</P>
<P>
   7:10 a.m. Power walk and stretch

<P>
   8:00 p.m. Grenada National Golf Group concert
</P>
<P>
   9:00 p.m. Bonfire beach party
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If that isn't enough, there is another bulletin board just for
water activities: windsurfing, sailing, waterskiing, snorkeling,
and diving. Not to mention lazing around the two swimming pools a
few steps from the main restaurant or sunning on the adjacent
beach.
</P>
<P>
   The activities at the spa continue when the sun goes down and
the floodlights come on. Tennis is a popular nighttime sport
because of the relative coolness, and so is dancing by the pool to
the beat of Caribbean steel drums. (That beat adapts wonderfully to
swing dancing, we discovered.)
</P>
<P>
   Or, you can collapse into the piano bar after dinner and just
sit until closing time, which occurs whenever the last person feels
like leaving. Some guests didn't feel like leaving until 6 in the
morning.
</P>
<P>
   The night owls obviously weren't rigorously pursuing the
``health'' part of this health spa regimen. And, in truth, even the
most rigorous health fanatic might occasionally be tempted to
overindulge in the free tropical drinks that are available at this
spa, night and day. Stick one of the colored flags in the sand next
to your deck chair when you're sunning on the beach and someone
comes along a few minutes later to offer you a delicious Caribbean
concoction in a tall glass. And, like everything else at the
resort, the drinks are free.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this resort is an ``all-inclusive,'' meaning that
everything from airport transportation to golf lessons on the
par-three course are included in the price of admission, all
prepaid.
</P>
<P>
   The all-inclusive concept has been criticized in the press
lately, including the Globe, on the grounds that the local
population receives little benefit from a resort that is run by a
large company somewhere off the island. Furthermore, tourists at
all-inclusives supposedly don't help support the local economy or
come in contact with the local people in the surrounding
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Though there is probably truth to the assertions in many
instances, La Source is owned by a native Grenadian, 61-year-old
Leon Taylor, who argues that the spa makes an important
contribution to the Grenadian economy _ and not only in taxes. ``We
have 250 employees here, and these are jobs that wouldn't exist
without this resort,'' he says. La Source also buys as much fresh
produce as possible from local farmers, according to general
manager Richard Fenn, and uses local taxi and limousine drivers in
addition to the entire resort staff, which is all local.
</P>
<P>
   With an unemployment rate of around 16 percent and the price of
its chief cash crop (nutmeg) falling, Grenadians are more than
willing to move from spices to tourists. ``You have to start
somewhere and resorts such as ours will encourage the tourist
industry to grow up all around us,'' Fenn says. There are
significantly fewer American tourists here than British, and some
people believe that's due to confusion over whether there is still
a ``war'' going on here. Sixteen years ago, American troops stormed
ashore and ousted a pro-Soviet junta that had seized power in a
bloody coup. The only evident legacy is a large modern airport that
provides easy access for tourists.
</P>
<P>
   As to getting out and about, there were plenty of opportunities
to see the rest of the island during our stay. In the orientation,
we were introduced to the owner of a local tourist excursion
company, separate and apart from the spa, who suggested a number of
trips around this beautiful 133-square-mile island. These included
hikes in the rain forest, visits to spice factories and rum
distilleries, and deep-sea fishing excursions. According to Fenn,
more than 90 percent of La Source hotel guests leave the resort
during their stay.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the staff here refer to themselves as ``bodyguards.''
Their mission is to guard the guests' bodies from sloth, not crime.
In Grenada there is more danger from the ocean currents than from
muggings. On the first day, a lovely bodyguard named Tamasha told
us that we could jog around the island ``anytime, anywhere.'' But
if you go swimming, she warned, be sure to stay inside the
roped-off area. ``There's nothing down here between us and
Venezuela, and that's where you could end up if you get caught in a
current.''
</P>
<P>
   We stayed in the roped-off area, no argument. As the days went
by, we signed up for the fencing classes and the archery classes,
the power walks and the snorkeling, the tennis instruction and the
water volleyball, the windsurfing and the Tai Chi, the stretching
exercises and the yoga classes.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the latter two were held in the same little gazebo
on the hill overlooking the ocean. We could go from one class to
the other without the stress of being late, which meant we didn't
have to go to the ``Stress Reduction Class,'' also offered at the
spa every day.
</P>
<P>
   By 4 the afternoon, we usually were trying to decide whether to
make ``tea'' time or ``tee'' time. With all the British influences
here, many people at the resort stop for tea and sweets on the
veranda at that hour, but we normally opted for a round of golf in
the afternoon, and were teeing off on the par-three course, alone
save for a couple of other American hackers.
</P>
<P>
   Another time-related decision at the resort is how to fit in all
the body treatments that are part of the spa package _ the Swedish
massages, the body wraps, the facials, and the foot massages that
melt away whatever remaining tensions one brings from Big Dig
traffic jams when jetting out of Boston to this idyllic spot.
</P>
<P>
   Our favorite massage was aromatherapy, which utilizes specially
scented oils to accomplish specific results. We had a choice of
``The Energy Blend,'' featuring oils of safflower, almond, canola,
jojoba, lemon, lime, basil, and peppermint . . . or ``The
Relaxation Blend'' (rosewood, lavender and orange) . . . or ``The
Love Blend'' (safflower, almond, canola, ylang ylang, tangerine,
patchouli, nutmeg).
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the recipes for the special tropical drinks offered each
day at the bar sounded strangely similar to the ingredients in the
massage oils: ``Grenada Papa,'' for example, featured orange,
pineapple, coconut creme, rum, and nutmeg. Was this a drink or a
scented oil? Who could tell?
</P>
<P>
   In the end we decided it didn't matter. They were all delicious.
For the record, our favorite was the ``La Source Cocktail,'' which
is made from dark rum, coco cristal, Grenadine, pineapple, and
``seamoss creme,'' an algae from the sea, dried and boiled as
oatmeal before it is blended into the drink. Who said this isn't a
health spa?
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the Other Drink, not featured on the resort menu
but discussed with winks and smiles among the locals. Aptly named
``Under-The-Counter,'' this Grenadian specialty cocktail is made
from Barbados rum, raw peanuts, worm, deer horn, and part of a tree
bark found on the island called bois bande. The drink is said to
have the same effect on the drinker as Viagra. Local legend has it
that several years ago an elderly man with a young girlfriend
quaffed down two cups of the potion and later had to be taken to a
hospital emergency room, where minor surgery was performed to
offset the drink's powerful effects.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, we never got near that drink. The only medical
problem we had at La Source came after our aromatherapy sessions.
</P>
<P>
   On those occasions _ oiled and pampered to a dreamy state of
mind _ we were given strict orders by our masseuse as we floated
out of the treatment room: ``No exercise, alcohol, or sun for the
next two hours.''
</P>
<P>
   (itals)No exercise, alcohol, or sun for two hours?(unitals)

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Build a bullet train? For $23.3 billion, twice
the annual budget of Casey Jones' home state of Kentucky? They've
got to be kidding _ or high on cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Why go faster when the pace of life is killing us already? Why
would anybody want to get to Sacramento any sooner? Where's the
kick in cruising through Pacheco Pass en route to Gilroy?
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine speeding the length of California at maximum speeds of
over 200 miles per hour, without ever leaving the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what it says on the California High Speed Rail
Authority's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I can imagine it. And it makes me want to reach for the
Dramamine.
</P>
<P>
   It would be more fun pedaling a bicycle cart along the Santa
Barbara boardwalk.
</P>
<P>
   Or riding a 1930s streetcar along Market Street in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   I rode a bullet train in France last fall _ the TGV, for ``train
a grande vitesse'' _ and it wasn't good even there. I sat backward,
it was raining and the baguettes were stale. I was nauseated all
the way from Paris to Arles.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the darned thing never got up over 150 kph (93 mph). The
thrill was nil.
</P>
<P>
   Next time I'm in France, I intend to take the lowliest choo-choo
I can find. I want an old-fashioned pullet train, the kind real
people ride with their farm animals and goatskins filled with red
wine.
</P>
<P>
   The kind that smells from engine oil and Gaulois cigarettes and
garlic and liver sausage and hay. A train out of a movie by Marcel
Pagnol.
</P>
<P>
   I want to gaze out the window onto the same sun-soaked fields
that impressed the Impressionists.
</P>
<P>
   There is no point in tying California together more tightly,
which is what the California High Speed Rail Authority intends to
do, with the blessing of the state Legislature and Gov. Gray Davis.
</P>
<P>
   At the rate we're going, all of California soon will be roadbed,
track and runway. We'll get a terminal case of terminalitis. The
one core value the state's 33 million residents will share will be
a tunnel through the Tehachapis.
</P>
<P>
   The price tag on this profligate project with a nifty name is
huge beyond belief. Put the money into schools. Or health care. Or
birth control.
</P>
<P>
   Or give it to me.
</P>
<P>
   The bureaucratic bozos behind this boondogle say 20 million
passengers will use the bullet train every year. That works out to
54,794.52 people per day. Enough to fill PacBell Park, and then
some. I don't believe it.
</P>
<P>
   And even if it were built, the average person won't be able to
afford a ticket to ride an appreciable distance, if today's prices
are any indication. Fancy rail service carries a fancy tariff.
</P>
<P>
   Check it out.
</P>
<P>
   In November 2000, voters will be asked to approve a half-cent
sales tax to fund this doozy.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't sound like much. But neither does one drip from a
leaky faucet at midnight. Multiply it by 10,000 and you've got a
problem. That's how teensy taxes work.
</P>
<P>
   It's not too soon to begin wrapping your mind around a no vote
on the bullet train.
</P>
<P>
   But if you don't want to wait until November 2000 to register a
protest, consider firing up your computer and sending the
commission a message at its Web site, www.hsr.ca.gov.
</P>
<P>
   There's a public input page at the site. Punch their ticket.

   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Every time you see another supermodel or movie
star with huge breasts and the hips of an 8-year-old boy, don't you
wish you lived in some bygone era when women weren't such slaves to
the impossible quest for a perfect body?
</P>
<P>
   I thought that too until I went microfilm diving and happened
upon a ``ladies section'' in the San Francisco Examiner from the
summer of 1909. A headline taunted: ``How to Make the Figure
Beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   The author: Madame Lina Cavalieri, ``The Most Famous Living
Beauty.'' Her job: To ``enumerate the standards of beauty for the
female form, then discuss how these standards may be approached by
the woman who is dissatisfied, and with good reason, with her
figure.''
</P>
<P>
   You think it's hell trying to look like Naomi Campbell? Try
Madame C. on for size.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly determine how far your figure falls short of
perfection ...,'' she advises. ``The critical view in the duplex or
triplex mirror may reveal that the figure is too broad or too thick
for its height. If too broad, the defect is serious, and will be
difficult, if not impossible, of remedy.''
</P>
<P>
   If the defect is merely thickness, guess what she prescribes?
``Diet, exercise and massage.''
</P>
<P>
   Does that sounds simple? It isn't. Not given the body blueprint
that Mme. Cavalieri uses for all women: ``Perfection ... according
to the canons of classic statuary. The standards of Greek sculpture
have never been improved.''
</P>
<P>
   To live up to the ``undeviating rules'' of classic statuary, a
woman's figure should be ``exactly six times as long as the foot,''
she said. Does a woman's figure include her head? Madame did not
say. If it does, then I, who have 93 1/4-inch-long tootsies, should
stand 4-feet-10-1/2-inches. But I'm 5-feet-6. If I'm allowed to
subtract nine inches of noggin, I still miss the standards of Greek
perfection by 11 1/2 inches.
</P>
<P>
   It goes downhill from there.
</P>
<P>
   The perfect face _ which ``has always been pearshaped'' _ should
measure exactly one-tenth of the ``entire stature.'' The perfect
hand, from tip of middle finger to end of palm, should be the same
length as the perfect face.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, ``the body when standing with the arms extended
horizontally should form a human Maltese cross. The length of the
body should be the same as the distance ... from the middle finger
of one hand to the middle finger of the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Comfy _ there before your mirror trying to form a human Maltese
cross? Turn around.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the back is full and the hips bulge, the waist is large,
the figure has no elegance; is, indeed, common. If you are the
possessor of such blemishes to beauty, you should at once set to
work to remove the deficits.''
</P>
<P>
   No, not liposuction. Diet, exercise and massage.
</P>
<P>
   The Cavalieri diet? Simplicity itself. ``Reduce your diet at the
beginning by one-quarter, then one-third and after that one-half.''
</P>
<P>
   Her exercise program? ``Walk, walk, walk.''
</P>
<P>
   As for massage, which ``has always seemed to me a cure-all for
defects in beauty,'' Madame says do it deep and with an astringent
of tincture of iodine, iodide of potassium, distilled and aniseed
water.
</P>
<P>
   That is unless your ``entire outline is too meagre'' and you
need a ``curve-making and flesh-building'' cream. Then it's fresh
mutton tallow, lanolin, spermaceti and coconut oil.
</P>
<P>
   Even in 1907, breast size was a big deal. But a different big
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women who think their busts are too large write me often
asking how they may reduce them,'' Mme. Cavalieri confides.
</P>
<P>
   Not at all a fan of breast reduction remedies beyond diet and
exercise, she does share a ``European formula'' _ sweet almond oil,
white wax, tincture of benzoin, rose water, tannin _ but cautions
that a doctor should ``sanction'' its use.
</P>
<P>
   Last but hardly least, the most famous living beauty advises:
``After exercise and diet for improving the figure, there is
nothing so important than to be well corseted.''
</P>
<P>
   What does she mean by ``well?'' Well, the intimate sausage
casing should be ``pliable and hygenic'' and have rubber webbing in
its sides. Most important, ``every corset should have eight
garters. Yes, I mean it; four on each side.''
</P>
<P>
   Kind of makes the Wonderbra look benign.
</P>

HAYMAN ISLAND _ EDEN WITH PLUMBING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAYMAN ISLAND, Queensland, Australia _ Just plain dumb, wet
luck.
</P>
<P>
   That's all it was. And that's how friend Aurelio and I sort-of
braved the cyclone and flood, ducked a serious dunking, and landed
_ orphans of the storm _ on Hayman Island, which is not exactly a
refugee camp. Unless, of course, you consider the Ritz a flophouse.
Orphans, we, who hit the jackpot like Little Orphan Annie.
</P>
<P>
   Daddy Warbucks, in this case, was a sumptuous Frenchman named
Philippe Beaucher-Coyle. Philippe operates a new railroading
venture called the Great South Pacific Express, an offshoot of the
renowned Orient Express, both of which make American trains look
like . . . well . . . American trains.
</P>
<P>
   Debuting this year, the Great South Pacific runs some 850 miles
miles through Queensland from Brisbane, the glistening seaside
state capital, to Cairns, a springboard to the Great Barrier Reef.
Eventually, as modern track is laid, it will be a 3,000-or-so-mile
round-Australia shot:
Perth-Adelaide-Melbourne-Sydney-Brisbane-Cairns.
</P>
<P>
   However, when we arrived ticketed in Brisbane for the
``All-aboard!'' command to ride this chichi choo-choo, Margaret
Dalli, the charming elfin emissary of M. Beaucher-Coyle, uttered a
mournful declaration that sounded like something associated with
baseball: ``No game _ rain.'' Also, in our case, ``Wait till next
year. But you get a rain check.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh.
</P>
<P>
   And what rain! Nothing half-hearted. All-out, as Australian
weather can be. The deluge had sired a horrendous, tragic flood
that, submerging the community of Gympie and killing seven, was the
villain. Fortunately, we had made it through Gympie by car only
hours before the Mary River rose astoundingly almost 70 feet
overnight. But the look of water creeping up the railbed and onto
the highway had been ominous.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's our train's tracks, we're out of business,'' Aurelio
had predicted accurately, stepping on the gas to get out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Dalli and Beaucher-Coyle weren't party poopers.
``Instead, we're sending you to Hayman Island by plane, bus, and
boat,'' she said, ``as a replacement for the train trip. The flood
did us in for a while, and there's no point to Cairns at the moment
because there's a cyclone in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you're disappointed, but you'll like Hayman very
much.''
</P>
<P>
   This, it developed, was like apologizing with, sorry, you can't
have strawberry shortcake _ but as consolation there's peach melba,
blueberry pie a la mode, and baked Alaska. Disappointment is just
as easily swallowed on this island that lacks nothing in the way of
sun-blessed resort comforts unless you're looking for ski lodges
and slopes.
</P>
<P>
   How can I put Hayman in one sentence? It's Eden with plumbing
and an understated, elegant, architectural makeover.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat advanced from its early days as a 1930s getaway, a time
when visitors, put up in tents, were advised: ``Bring your own
cutlery, linen, lamp, and dish.'' There's plenty of that stuff to
go around now, amid statuary, paintings, regal gardens, shops,
handsomely decorated library and game rooms, six fine restaurants,
a nightclub, suites, and bedrooms that kings would OK (and
sometimes show up to tenant.)
</P>
<P>
   As the northernmost of the Whitsunday Islands clustered off
Australia's northeast coast, Hayman first came to the attention of
the outside world in 1936 when the American writer Zane Grey, a
keen big-game fisherman, appeared to indulge his avocation and make
a movie called ``White Death.'' Its star was a fearsome (though not
very credible) sea creature, possibly grandfather of ``Jaws.'' An
unmemorable production, although Grey did leave his mark by
planting the first of crowds of cocoanut palms.
</P>
<P>
   Many, thronged by sometimes squawky cockatoos, are visible from
the ocean-fringed breakfast room, the one place where you realize
that quite a few other folks are sharing this idyll. Basically the
clientele is spread out, not much noticed in their activities or
nonactivity. Living quarters are well-spaced among lush gardens,
hidden-away swimming pools, fresh- and saltwater. Beaches are long,
several of them secluded. At other meals, the various restaurants,
(including French, Italian, Australian, Asian) divide the populace
nicely.
</P>
<P>
   All this has been installed not long ago, in 1987, when the
complex was razed, and rebuilt, lyrically, as in: ``I dreamt I
dwelled in marble halls _ with adjoining beach.'' So tastefully and
subtly luxurious that the tropical essentials remain intact. The
sea, solitary beaches, and hilly bush trails were original
attractions for privacy-minded, shack-accommodated habitues of
Hayman's still-primitive postwar hotel days. Luxury and cordon bleu
came to town without knocking out the feeling of
as-casual-as-you-want-to-be.
</P>
<P>
   Remaining, too, is perhaps the prime lure of the territory: the
Great Barrier Reef. It's right out there, about 30 miles, waiting
to be pored over by snorkelers and divers who arrive by boat, as I
did 30 years ago, or helicopter this time.
</P>
<P>
   Garry Cochrane, a jocular and informative Aussie, pilots the one
we're in. Whirring above Hayman's kindred Whitsundays, green
volcanic bumps on a blue Pacific, you feel that if Claude Monet
could reappear in a window seat, he'd exclaim: ``Voila!
Fantastique! A Pacific variation on my lily pad theme. Where's my
easel?''
</P>
<P>
   Cochrane, more a man for landing pads, says, ``Only 10 of the 74
Whitsuns are inhabited. The rest are national parks. There are
2,000 reefs out here in any number of shapes'' _ shadowy forms
lurking in a vast coverlet of spritzing turquoise. Some seem
amoebas. Heart Reef is obviously named, Hook Reef a sinuous snake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just below us, now, is the place we think is the most
beautiful beach in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly it's a contender, lonely Whitehaven Beach, stretching
almost four miles on Whitsunday Island, the group's namesake. Acres
of silica, blinding ivory sand, are cuddled by the sea in swirls of
mint, jade, chartreuse and lime. Later Aurelio visited to report:
``Gorgeous beyond gorgeous . . . at Hall Inlet the water and sand
blend as a wet verdant rainbow.''
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter finds its own island 44 miles beyond the
mainland, a plain concrete pad where launches await for a short
trip to ReefWorld. Another platform, but inhabited, this way
station is devoted to providing visitors' lunch and looking.
Naturally fresh seafood abounds. Not only at a buffet but
in-your-face for those who go overboard in masks and flippers to
peep at the Reef.
</P>
<P>
   Millions and millions of coral, requiring sunny water to do
their construction jobs, continue the unending task of
reef-building. Their creation: a mysterious marine junkyard of
misshapen chunks, prongs, piles, protuberances. It wanders
irregularly and erratically, an underworld whose stunning residents
finningly flash by in a kaleidescopic blizzard of sizes and colors.
</P>
<P>
   Marine biologist Jackie Shields guides a quartet of snorkelers,
offering a swimming commentary of who's-who and what's-what. Shiny
green oozy anemones and brightly-hued parrotfish may be the most
confused locals, she says. ``The anemones are born male, but
eventually become female. Just the opposite for the parrot fish,
born female. They don't know who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is perfect.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hayman Resort comes close. That's the feeling as we
picnic beneath a breadfruit tree after a long rising-and-falling
wilderness walk to deserted Blue Pearl Bay. A moderate surf rustles
shards of coral, and as dusk approaches squadrons of bats take off
out of a valley, darkening the last of the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vampires in paradise?'' wonders Aurelio. ``But, I don't think
so. They haven't targeted our necks. Yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor do they, deciding to forage elsewhere. As we do for dinner,
wrapped in the soft, lilting embrace of a moon-streaked night in a
Japanese garden. Outside the Oriental bistro, our table is at the
edge of a pond glimmering with reflections from stone lanterns.
Frogs warble gently, a waterfall gushes and a stand of bamboo
shudders in a peaceful breeze. We could be in a remote corner of
Hokkaido.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmie Mok, the engaging maitre d'hotel, is very attentive,
suggesting succulent marine dishes such as Vietnamese steamed
scallops in lemon grass, grilled spicy fresh water barramundi, and
black-peppered Moreton Bay bug, a native shellfish.
</P>
<P>
   ``And what about green ants, Mr Mok?'' I ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pardon me, sir?''
</P>
<P>
   The other day, Aurelio, taking a grounds tour with garden
supervisor Geoff Hansen, had experienced a timeless aboriginal
gastronomical treat. Plucking a green ant from a gum tree, Hansen
showed her how to eat the plump posterior. ``Tasted like lemon
nectar,'' she approvingly reported, ``which, of course, it was. We
won't starve as long as the ant population holds up.''
</P>
<P>
   Right. ``So?'' I query Mok.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have ants on the menu, sir.'' He is polite but firm.
</P>
<P>
   As I say, nothing is perfect.

   The world's largest cruise ship, the 109,000-ton Grand Princess,
has celebrated its first birthday. And what a year it's had, plying
the Caribbean and Mediterranean waters. In its first year, the
Grand Princess:
</P>
<P>
   --Logged 101,986.6 nautical miles, using 63,000 tons of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   --Carried 109,200 passengers, including 8,146 children and
teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   --Hosted 47 celelbrities, including Olivia de Haviland (who
christened the ship), Buzz Aldrin, Rita Moreno, Gavin McLeod, and
Judge Wapner and Judge Judy.
</P>
<P>
   --Celebrated 157 weddings in ``Hearts and Minds,'' the first and
only seagoing wedding chapel.
</P>
<P>
   --Created 123,000 Baked Alaskas and baked 450,000 loaves of
bread.
</P>
<P>
   --Created 342,000 pizzas and served up 100,000 pounds of pasta.
</P>
<P>
   --Used 5,299,200 eggs, 93,744 pounds of sugar, and 357,304
pounds of flour.
</P>
<P>
   --Washed 59,796 towels 10,045,728 times.
</P>
<P>
   --And supplied 192,480 rolls of toilet paper, measuring 6,840
miles.
</P>
<P>
   Come late November, the Grand Princess will relinquish its title
of world's largest cruise ship to Royal Caribbean's Voyager of the
Seas, and who knows what statistics that 142,000-ton ship will
produce. &QL; 
 &QL; 
And speaking of cruises: A Card Player Cruise, with a poker room
staffed by professionals in addition to the regular gambling
opportunities, is scheduled Aug. 15-22 aboard the Carnival
Celebration. The ship will ply the western Caribbean and prices
start at less than $750. The card-playing portion of the cruise is
under the aegis of Barry Shulman, chairman of Card Player magazine.
For more information, call Pita at 702-871-1720. &QL;

Travel Trivia: In the classic song ``Route 66'' (sung best by Nat
King Cole), 12 communities are mentioned. Give yourself 8.333
points for each one you can name. (Answer at end of column.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a name: In Japan, the movie ``Primary Colors'' is called
``Perfect Couple.'' &QL;

Quotable: ``I'm going to Charleston. I want to see if somewhere
there isn't something left in life of charm and grace.'' _ Rhett
Butler in Margaret Mitchell's ``Gone With the Wind.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Museum of the month: The 118-year-old Buckhorn Saloon &AMP; Museum has
returned to downtown San Antonio after spending several decades at
the Lone Star Brewery. The museum is filled with oddities, such as
a stuffed two-headed calf, and Western memorabilia, including a bar
that cowboys and cattlemen bellied up to for more than a century.
In all, there are more than 3,300 artifacts and 520 species. For
more information, call 210-247-4000 or visit

Wooden . . . and wild: This is a summer for roller coasters, with
new thrillers opening up in amusement parks all over the nation.
But one that sounds especially intriguing is Gwazi, which has just
opened at Busch Gardens in Tampa, Fla. This one is a wooden
coaster, just like in the old days, but it's hardly old-fashioned.
Gwazi, you see, is a double coaster. You choose the Lion or Tiger
side, and after rising to the top of each track's 90-foot lift, the
coasters fly by within feet of each other, each at top speed of 50
miles per hour, and achieve a force of up to 3.5Gs. During the 2
1/2-minute tangle, there are six close encounters. For more
information about the park, call 800-4-ADVENTURE or visit
www.buschgardens.com. &QL; 
 &QL; 
And speaking of roller coasters: ``The technology is there now to
build a 200-miles per hour roller coaster,'' says Paul Reuben,
editor of Park World, an amusement industry trade magazine. We

sells travel products such as a self-inflating lower back support,
an inflatable U-shaped travel neck rest for sleeping on planes, a

EUROPE, CHRISTMAS ON SALE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   While the war in Kosovo seems over and peace may be at hand, it
has taken its toll on the European cruise season.
</P>
<P>
   Some lines have canceled cruises for lack of passengers, others
are pulling ships back to American shores.
</P>
<P>
   The good news from this is that lines are offering discounts on
remaining cruises in Europe, especially in the Mediterranean area.
The uncertainty over bookings for the remainder of the year has
even brought on a rash of holiday discounts.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Orient Lines is offering Greek isles cruises on its
Marco Polo starting at $1,750 a person, and that includes hotel
stays in Athens and Istanbul. Round trip air fare is only $99.
Norwegian Cruise Line is offering 13-day cruises in Scandinavia,
the Greek isles, Black Sea, and trans-Atlantic from $1,529, if
booked by June 30. Air fare is extra.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal Cruises is offering savings of up to 61 percent on three
Mediterranean sailings in September. Cunard has 50-percent-off fare
for a second guest, and Windstar Cruises is offer two-for-one rates
through Oct. 23.
</P>
<P>
   While cruises booked over the Jan. 1 holiday are going for big
bucks, many lines are finding the period before and after to be
lacking customers. Carnival has noted that sailings over the New
Year's holiday have been growing _ especially this year _ while
Christmas cruises have softened. For this reason travelers thinking
of taking a Christmas cruise will find some great bargains.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Dec. 19-26 Carnival cruise on the Elation
begins at $738 a person, while the same cruise Dec. 26-Jan. 2 is
$1,938. Even Crystal Cruises is cutting its fares 25 percent on its
Crystal Harmony sailing to South America.
</P>
<P>
   Holland America is offering discounts of up to 61 percent off
published fares for holiday cruises. The two-for-one and discounted
fares are being offered on the Rotterdam, Veendam, Volendam,
Ryndam, Amsterdam, and Westerdam.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Small ships
</P>
<P>
   The LeLevant, an elegant yachtlike cruise ship, will debut at
Boston's Black Falcon Cruise Port Oct. 9. The 90-passenger French
vessel will sail on an eight-day New England-Canada itinerary. The
vessel is designed for off-the-beaten-track routes and to appeal to
those who enjoy active to soft adventures. In addition to tenders,
the vessel carries a fleet of Zodiacs for otherwise inaccessible
beach landings.
</P>
<P>
   American Cruise Lines of Haddam, Conn., is building the
49-passenger American Eagle for cruises along the East Coast. The
ship, being built in Maryland, will offer large staterooms with
picture windows that open and private baths, and large observation
decks. All cruise itineraries will include daily shore excursions.
The company said ports of call will be those with ties to major
events in American history.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Back in time
</P>
<P>
   While moviegoers are watching ``Star Wars,'' about a galaxy
``long ago and far away,'' EuroCruises is planning a Sept. 11
cruise to a Mediterranean world of long ago that can be traced in
monuments, cities, landscapes, and seascapes. The 22-day cruise
from Dover, England, is for ``those travelers who would rather look
back at the past millennium or two than ahead to the next one,''
said Bjarne Mikkelsen, EuroCruises president. The cruise can be
taken in 11-day segments, and large discounts are available. The
cruise is on the Black Watch, the former Royal Viking Star. For
information, call 800-661-1119.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
On the Web
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean's Voyager of the Seas, which will become the
world's largest cruise ship, doesn't sail until November, but
travelers can tour the ship via a new Web page. To visit the ship,
which features such innovative items as a rock climbing wall and
ice-skating rink, click on www.rccl.com/voyageroftheseas. The site
will be constantly updated _ a work in progress until Voyager is
introduced.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A promise
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian Cruise Line's newest ship, the Norwegian Sky, now in
the final stages of construction in Germany, is coming with a
guarantee on its maiden voyage. Since many maiden voyages have been
canceled, NCL is offering cruises a money-back guarantee on the
Aug. 9 European maiden voyage. The Sky will be sailing out of
Boston later this fall on cruises to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The Sky is NCL's first inaugural in six years and will introduce
new features intended to provide passengers with flexibility to do
what they want when they want to do it, and that includes meals.
``The era of regimentation in cruises is over,'' said Geir Aune,
NCL president. Restaurants on board will offer a variety of
cuisine's, one, the Internet Cafe, will also provide direct access
to the Web by satellite from 10 computer terminals.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Short cruises
</P>
<P>
   Carnival says it is responding to those who want shorter
cruises. The line said by mid-1999 it will have half its fleet on
itineraries of five or fewer days. Sixteen one- to five-day
itineraries are planned.
</P>
<P>
   Among the four- and five-day itineraries is one featuring the
line's newest ship, the 102,000-ton Carnival Triumph, out of New
York City this summer. Other short cruises sail out of Miami, Los
Angeles, Tampa, and Port Carnaveral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays, consumers prefer the flexibility and convenience of
taking several shorter vacations over the course of a year and
Carnival's cruise getaways fit in perfectly with today's
lifestyles,'' said Bob Dickinson, Carnival president. He added that
short cruises also offer added value as they are less costly, serve
as a good ``first-time'' cruise experience, and can easily be
paired with a pre- or post-cruise land vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Other cruise lines offering short cruises include American
Hawaii Cruises, with three- and four-night sailings in the Hawaiian
islands; and Commodore, with two- and five-night cruises from New
Orleans on the Enchanted Capri, including a two-night cruise to
``nowhere'' and a five-night voyage to Mexico. Cunard will have
four-day cruises on its Sea Goddess I in the Virgin Islands in
December and a five-day sailing in the Mediterranean on the Sea
Goddess II in October. Disney Cruise Line, meanwhile, will offer
more of a choice when its second ship, the Disney Wonder, begins
service in August. The line will then offer sailings on Sundays,
Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays. Norwegian offers special
``weekenders'' on the Leeward from Miami, departing Fridays, and a
four-day Mexico sailing on Mondays. Premier offers three- and
four-night itineraries from Port Canaveral to the Bahamas and two-
night voyages on the SeaBreeze departing New York City every
Friday. Princess will have Love Boat Samplers in September and
October, with Vancouver to San Francisco or Los Angeles
itineraries. Regal has one- to three-night party cruises to nowhere
from New York City through September. And Royal Caribbean
International offers three- and four-night southern Caribbean
cruises from San Juan and three- and four-night voyages from Miami
to the Bahamas, as well as three- and four-night cruises throughout
the year from Los Angels to Catalina Island and Ensenada.

Singles
</P>
<P>
   Some cruise lines have relaxed their single-occupancy surcharge.
River Barge Excursions (888-282-1945, www.riverbarge.com) is
entirely eliminating the singles supplement for those who book
summer cruises before June 30. A seven-day cruise from Nashville
starts at $1,480. Orient Lines (800-333-7300, www.orientlines.com)
charges only a 25 percent supplement on its Australia and Africa
cruises.

UNDER SWIFT'S SOFT IMAGE, A STEELY POLITICIAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Lieutenant Governor Jane M. Swift is not as nice as
people think she is _ at least that's her own candid assessment.
</P>
<P>
   She was called ``Snow White'' by her colleagues when she entered
the state Senate in 1991 at age 25, the youngest woman ever elected
to the chamber. She has the haircut and the giggle to match the
nickname but the similarities end there.
</P>
<P>
   Swift admits to having spontaneous and strategic ``episodes,'' a
handy euphemism for verbal, prosecutorial assaults on
administration staff who blunder. She has a long memory for
political slights and she's always prepared. Anyone who wants her
respect had better be prepared, too.
</P>
<P>
   However, both images have helped this fairy-tale rise to power,
from a working-class family in North Adams to the executive suite
at the State House, all in just over a decade.
</P>
<P>
   And whatever one may have thought of the demure-looking,
pregnant Swift during the campaign, six months into the
administration, she has made herself a formidable force.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for example, while Cellucci was off with Texas
Governor George W. Bush, Swift worked hard to sway legislators
about the virtues of teacher testing, one of the administration's
major policy initiatives. And this week, while Cellucci is on a
trade mission to France and Ireland, Swift will be running
Massachusetts, rolling out statewide crime statistics and filing
health privacy legislation.
</P>
<P>
   She proved her strength early on, when she was responsible for
recruiting Public Safety Secretary Jane Perlov from the New York
City Police Department, sidestepping former Senate colleague James
Jajuga, the expected choice, straining their friendship in order to
bring more women into the administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark my words. Within two years, Jane Swift will be the most
powerful and influential person in state government,'' said North
Adams Mayor John Barrett III, a Democrat who created a stir by
endorsing the Republican Swift during the 1996 1st District
congressional campaign against US Representative John Olver.
</P>
<P>
   Those inside and outside the administration say Swift is a true
cogovernor, with a relationship similar to that between Governor
Paul Cellucci and former Governor William F. Weld, when the former
was lieutenant to the latter. In a building where power is asserted
as much as earned, Swift, 34, has done both.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you're mentally tough . . . particularly in political
situations, you're going to get rolled, day in and day out,'' Swift
says.
</P>
<P>
   Such street talk seems incongruous with a woman from the
Berkshires, whose public image is more aligned with a photograph of
her nuzzling daughter Elizabeth Ruth Hunt, born two weeks before
the last election.
</P>
<P>
   But she's more than a mom, more than second-in-command at the
State House, and her hometown of North Adams is not one of those
bucolic towns that dots western Massachusetts. It was a tough place
to grow up, particularly as part of a competitive family that Swift
says keeps her ``real,'' with a father running a plumbing business
and a mother delaying teacher work until all four children were
grown.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett, her hometown mayor, says he endorsed her because, after
initial unease with the young legislator, ``she got more done than
any other senator I've ever dealt with.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes working both sides of the aisle in the early
1990s, convincing Weld and then-Senate President William M. Bulger
to squeeze $35 million out of a shrinking state budget to build the
Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art in North Adams.
</P>
<P>
   But Swift and others say she was hardly taken seriously when she
began that congressional campaign nearly 50 points behind Olver.
She lost by about 5 points, a relatively close but crushing defeat
for the former Trinity College rugby player who does not like to
lose. And in a year when Republicans were dropping like flies, she
ran the best race in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Olver seems to get cranky just thinking about it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really not interested in reliving that,'' the softspoken
congressman snapped. ``It was 2 1/2 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being a quick study, her precocious political
instincts are what made at least one member of Cellucci's close
circle of advisers recommend Swift _ largely unknown east of
Springfield _ for lieutenant governor over then-Secretary of
Administration and Finance Charles D. Baker, the man characterized
at the time as being the smartest man on Beacon Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had I not been competitive and had something of the street
fighter instinct, I would not have been successful, nor would have
my brothers and sister,'' Swift said. ``We have all done well for
ourselves, but not because we were born to it.''
</P>
<P>
   If it sounds as if she has a chip on her shoulder, or likes to
thumb her nose at the Boston establishment, or wants to make sure
western Massachusetts gets its due, few would argue the point.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her high-profile job, or perhaps because of it, Swift's
forcefulness is not always visible to the public. She is not the
governor. At least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has the stuff to become the first female governor _ no
question about it,'' said Republican insider Ray Howell, who was
Weld's campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   But Cellucci is the leader of the state, the one often standing
before microphones and TV cameras, banging his fist on a podium to
emphasize a point, while she stands aside, ready and able to
whisper in the governor's ear answers to technical questions
reporters throw his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an easy role,'' Swift said. ``I have a great deal
with Paul Cellucci. He listens to me. He allows me to take a
leadership role. If occasionally you're standing in the background
of a picture without knowing what expression to put on your face,
I'm willing to accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   Often that expression is one of intensity, holding behind her
back rumpled and highlighted notes, all part of her preparedness.
``The frustration,'' she added, ``is more that there are people
trying to judge what your level of influence is.''
</P>
<P>
   Gus Bickford, executive director of the state Democratic Party,
discounts her importance and does not see her as a threat in the
2002 gubernatorial election, should Cellucci end up associated with
a Bush presidency and out of the running locally.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been invisible,'' Bickford said. ``I'm not too worried
about her.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind closed doors, however, in morning and weekly meetings,
Swift does not hesitate to speak her mind. While Cellucci is laid
back, Swift is anything but.
</P>
<P>
   At one such gathering recently, Swift tore into an
administration and finance employee who was asked to make a
presentation on the state's arcane but significant School Building
Assistance Program. Feeling the report was not comprehensive
enough, and that more should be done to alter the way the state
handles the program, the lieutenant governor went on the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the room who had not witnessed one of her self-described
``episodes'' before sat back aghast, eyes wide open.
</P>
<P>
   As one person who was there described the rant: ``It was
animated and long. She had very strong opinions about this issue
and wasn't shy about sharing them. It was very aggressive. It was
almost prosecutorial. It was reminiscent of Bill Weld, on the
occasion when he would delve into a subject, making very strident
points. She does her homework, she knows the issue. And she
repeatedly raised legitimate concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   When shaken attendees filed out of the room, Swift pulled aside
the administration and finance staff member and told her not to
take any of it personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes my toughness or my temper are normal emotional
reactions to situations that dovetail with my personality,'' Swift
reflected. ``There are also times when pitching a fit is a very
strategic decision. In the Senate I used to joke with my staff that
I haven't eaten a Cabinet secretary for lunch lately and perhaps
they were forgetting I could be very nasty.''
</P>
<P>
   She attributes the toughness to her mother's Italian blood, on
having two older brothers and from playing sports in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't back away from confrontation . . . and sometimes
people's feelings can be hurt by that,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   However, a softer side, one with a sense of humor, emerged last
week in an incident that also shows the comfort level Swift has
with the governor.
</P>
<P>
   When the heat forced nonessential government workers home, she
told a TV reporter that Cellucci was included in that group. The
governor says he roared with laughter at the joke when he caught
the clip on television later that night.
</P>
<P>
   Some have been waiting for Swift's ``other side'' to come to the
fore, post-pregnancy and post-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``She used the baby in every way possible for her benefit''
during the campaign, said one Democrat who requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Swift bristles at this observation, which she has heard before.
``No one eight months pregnant wants to have TV cameras following
her around,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   However, she does admit that being a mother, even an expectant
one, allowed her to talk about children's issues more convincingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also care deeply about kids. This isn't the side of me that
throws the F word around.''

GIULIANI IS NO SURE BET 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It was not quite three years ago. On a balmy,
moonlit night, I found myself gazing out at the rolling waves of
the Pacific from the promenade deck of the elegant Hotel del
Coronado in San Diego. Behind me, music blared and Republicans
boogied with abandon.
</P>
<P>
   Bernadette Castro, Gov. George Pataki's parks commissioner, was
in the process of earning formal recognition as Best Dancer in the
New York's delegation to the 1996 Republican National Convention.
That's when I found myself chatting with a pleasant, dark-haired
guy in a golf shirt.
</P>
<P>
   I'm Rick Lazio, he told me. I asked him what he was doing at the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' he said, ``I'm a member of Congress from Long Island.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, that surprised me. The framers of the U.S. Constitution
specified that you have to be 25 years old to serve in Congress.
This guy appeared to have barely made the cut.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I know now, Lazio is 41. Few people who don't live on
Long Island know who he is. But it's entirely possible that it'll
be him _ not New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani _ who'll face
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton next year in her race to
represent New York in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton still isn't a sure thing to run, but she's a 99 percent
bet. Giuliani hasn't formally announced either, but he's
overwhelmingly likely to jump in. Most national media attention has
focused on what a cheerfully bloody contest a Clinton-Giuliani
matchup would be. And it would be, too _ King Kong meets Ms.
Godzilla.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with that scenario is that Giuliani seems likely to
face a primary challenge next year from Lazio, and the outcome of a
clash between these two guys is hardly a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Giuliani's name is better known than Lazio's. But New York
City, Giuliani's base, contains only one in 12 of the Empire
State's Republican voters, and Lazio can be expected to buy name
recognition wherever he doesn't have it now through an extensive
and expensive advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Lazio has the support of some serious players in the
party. It seems obvious, although not stated openly, that he would
be the choice of Pataki, former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato and the Lauder
family. That's Lauder as in Estee Lauder, the huge cosmetics
company. The Lauders have warehouses just for thousand dollar
bills. You can bet that Lazio would have access to a hefty share of
that cash.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Lazio is the candidate of powerful Nassau County GOP chief
Joe Mondello and of Mike Long, who heads this state's Conservative
Party.
</P>
<P>
   The ties here are complicated and tight. The governor's wife has
a cushy job with the Lauder family. Long's daughter has a nice job
in the Pataki administration. Everybody here is linked to somebody
else in some intensely personal way, and Lazio would benefit
immensely from all that.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Republican Party is composed heavily of
Italian-Americans. In a primary fight, Giuliani would have no
ethnicity advantage over Lazio. As a creature of the city, Giuliani
would have no advantage in the suburbs or upstate over a
congressman from the quintessential New York City suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Giuliani has been a uniquely pugnacious mayor. His
campaign slogan probably will be, ``Hey, are you looking at ME?''
Just in doing his highly visible, difficult job, the mayor has made
enemies who don't know enough about Lazio to dislike him.
</P>
<P>
   So despite what you're seeing on network television, it's not
inconceivable that the candidate who'll eventually end up duking it
out with Clinton next year won't be Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it could be the smiling, boyish-looking guy I met on
that promenade deck that night in San Diego.

MEXICO MODIFIES BORDER FEE THAT BEGINS JULY 1 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID HENDRICKS  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Mexican officials are easing the rules on the new
$15 fee all visitors to the interior of Mexico must pay beginning
July 1.
</P>
<P>
   All foreign nationals, including children who travel beyond the
15-mile-deep border zone, are subject to the fee.
</P>
<P>
   When the fee first came to light in February, officials said it
would apply to each visit. But under the rules announced Monday by
the Mexican consul general in San Antonio, Carlos Sada, tourists
will only have to pay the fee once every six months. Non-Mexican
business travelers will pay the fee every 30 days, Sada said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he said the new rules would allay fears of financial
burdens on travelers, transportation company officials said they
were concerned about the effect of the fee on businesses.
</P>
<P>
   For airline passengers, the fee will be added to the price of
each ticket. Auto and bus passengers must pay the fee and have
their visas stamped at a Mexican bank in a border city. The visas
will be checked for a payment stamp at Mexico's interior
checkpoints, usually about 15 miles from each border crossing.
</P>
<P>
   Foreigners driving into Mexico already must stop at an auto
registration station in a border city to pay a long-standing $12
fee before taking a motor vehicle into the interior. The $15 fee
will be collected in addition to that.
</P>
<P>
   Sada said the 24-hour auto registration stations, such as the
one in Nuevo Laredo, operate in conjunction with Mexican banks to
collect the auto fees. Visitors can pay the $15 fee at those banks
or at any other bank in the border cities, Sada said.
</P>
<P>
   Banks are considering extending service hours to accommodate
weekend travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Vehicles already must stop twice after crossing into Mexico,
once in the border city to obtain the visa and/or auto registration
and once at the interior checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Sada said frequent visitors must keep their visas _ often called
tourist cards _ to show the $15 fee stamp when re-entering Mexico
by land or plane.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to cities along the border will not pay the fee if
their stay does not exceed 72 hours. That exemption also applies to
tourists entering Mexico from cruise ships for visits lasting fewer
than 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican citizens and Mexican-born U.S. citizens or resident
aliens who qualify for Mexican nationality will not be subject to
the fee. Mexican passports also will be accepted as proof of
nationality at the border to be exempt from the fee, Sada said.
</P>
<P>
   The government expects to collect $120 million from the fee
annually. About half of that will be used internationally to
promote tourism. Mexico is the seventh-top tourism destination in
the world, Sada said.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates are that 8 million foreign visitors entering Mexico
each year will pay the fee.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining funds will be used to upgrade immigration stations
and services at the border and at airports, and for other services
to visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Sada said the fee would not create a financial hardship on
visitors because of the six-month open period for tourists and
30-day period for business travelers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public was upset at first because no one knew then how it
would work,'' he said.

</P>
<P>
   But businesses tied to Mexico travel remained concerned Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know the effect yet,'' said Juan Sanchez, the San
Antonio office manager of McAllen-based Sanborn's Mexican Insurance
Service, which sells auto insurance for Mexican travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Mulet, the regional sales manager for Mexicana Airlines in
San Antonio, expressed concern over his airline's role in
collecting the fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people won't need to pay, so we will have to ask
questions beyond what airlines should do to qualify the passengers.
On the phone, that is hard to do,'' Mulet said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect the fee is going to hurt. We don't know for how
long, whether it is four months or six months. It is starting at
the beginning of the high-travel season,'' he said.

 PROPOSED SAMARITAN LAW COMES UNDER FIRE
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ No one denies what college student David Cash Jr.
did or did not do was deplorable. No one disputes that he probably
could have prevented 7-year-old Sherrice Iverson's death in a
Nevada casino restroom stall.
</P>
<P>
   All Cash had to do was tell casino security. But he didn't.
Instead he walked out of the bathroom as his best friend began
assaulting the girl. He kept quiet even after Jeremy Strohmeyer
confessed the murder to him.
</P>
<P>
   Cash's choice that day in May 1997 _ and his boasts afterward
that his newfound notoriety helped him meet women _ sickened
parents everywhere and spurred state and federal legislators to try
to hold adults accountable if they witnessed certain crimes against
children. Many legislators want to make inaction a crime, too, as
Nevada did recently.
</P>
<P>
   But Cash has found some unlikely allies in California, where he
still attends the state university in Berkeley and where he and
Iverson both grew up. In a rare display of unity, defense attorneys
and prosecutors find themselves on the same side of a proposed
state law. They're against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a horrible case, to have someone like David Cash come
out in public and say, `It's not my mother, it's not my sister, who
cares?' '' said David LaBahn, deputy director of the California
District Attorneys Association. ``But unless you have a very clear
law, there are going to be unintended consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Barry Broad, legislative advocate for the California
Public Defenders Association: ``There's an old statement that bad
facts make bad law. The corollary is that outrageous cases that
offend people can make for dangerous legislative activity.''
</P>
<P>
   LaBahn and Broad said they fear the California bill known as the
``Sherrice Iverson Child Protection Act'' would lead witnesses who
do not come forward promptly to demand immunity from prosecution in
exchange for their testimony. Had Strohmeyer not pleaded guilty to
kidnapping, sexual assault, and murder, Cash might well have won
his freedom under the proposed statute by agreeing to take the
witness stand, they said.
</P>
<P>
   It is even more problematic, defense attorneys and prosecutors
say, that credible testimony could be tainted in jurors' eyes if it
appears witnesses were intimidated, either by police or by their
own fear of prosecution. The California bill, which recently passed
the Senate on a bipartisan vote of 28-0 and is expected to win
approval in the state Assembly, would make failure to report
certain crimes against children 14 years old and younger a
misdemeanor punishable by six months in jail, a $5,000 fine, or
both.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada, where witnesses now have 24 hours to report their
suspicions that a child under 12 is being sexually or physically
abused, threatens similar jail time and a $1,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Like Nevada, however, California also would exempt close
relatives from prosecution, an exemption that opponents of the bill
said would water it down to the point of uselessness. For example,
spouses would not be required to report each other, regardless of
what they witnessed. Grandparents would also be exempt. But,
opponents note, much of the abuse and sexual crimes against
children is committed by family members.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses who feared for their safety would also be released
from the reporting requirements, which mimic those already in place
for such professionals as teachers and medical personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you exempt family members, it seems to me you exempt a lot
of the people to whom a bill like this should be directed, if in
fact there should be a bill like this,'' said Mary Broderick,
executive director of California Attorneys for Criminal Justice.
``But you can't create a conscience in somebody by making it a
crime to do something or not to do something. I'm not sure even if
the law had been on the books when Sherrice Iverson was killed that
it would have changed David Cash's behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of more child-protection laws, however, argued that
witnesses might think twice before walking away from a crime
without contacting police, although none of the laws would require
direct intervention that might put an observer at risk.
</P>
<P>
   As they did in Nevada, Sherrice Iverson's family and friends
have lobbied heavily for the California legislation, sponsored by
state Senator Tom Hayden. The family is also suing the Primadonna
casino, about 40 miles south of Las Vegas, where Leroy Iverson was
playing the slot machines at 3 a.m. while his son and daughter
played in the building unsupervised.
</P>
<P>
   Najee Ali, executive director of the Sherrice Iverson Justice
Campaign, stressed that neither the California nor Nevada laws
would enforce morality, only accountability. Still, he conceded
such laws go counter to the tradition of not forcing citizens to
become informants against their will.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been attacked from day one, because it really is
encroaching on someone's civil liberties, that you have the right
not to be involved if you don't want to be involved in something. .
. .'' said Ali. ``If you see a child being sexually assaulted or
violently attacked, you should at least alert the authorities. It's
the least you should have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the organizations representing prosecutors and defense
attorneys in California insisted the legislation would only hamper
their cases. If the bill passes and is signed into law by Governor
Gray Davis, both sides said, witnesses worried about their own
prosecution would be entitled to plead self-incrimination to avoid
testifying.
</P>
<P>
   Said Broad, ``This is one of those issues where no one doubts
the sincerity of the people pushing it. It's a question of whether
it's a good idea.''

NEW PRINCIPAL HEADS TO SCHOOL THAT ONCE BARRED HIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Photo available on Wieck database.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CECILIA BALLI  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ As a student, John Simpson was not allowed to
enter Parish High School in Selma, Ala., because of his skin color.
Soon, though, the retired Air Force training instructor will return
to what is now Selma High School to become its principal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is ironic that I'm going back to the high school that I
wasn't able to attend,'' said Simpson, 47, the summer school
principal at Southwest High School in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's why I decided to take that job, because I knew that
there was a force that I didn't understand just yet that was
driving me back home. Maybe I'll understand it in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Returning to Selma to give back to the community was a recurring
topic of conversation at high school class reunions. But, Simpson
said, he never thought he would be the one to do it.
</P>
<P>
   He left the city 29 years ago, after spending his youth living
the scarring reality of racial segregation and raising his
consciousness by fighting it.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, he sat through mass organizational church
meetings and marched in protests with other supporters of the 1960s
civil rights movement. He and other protesters were once forced
onto a bus with a cow prod. They spent the night ``crowded like
sardines'' in a jail with overflowing commodes until they were
bailed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``That experience is the reason I know I am what I am today,
because I could never see myself in jail again. Never,'' Simpson
said. ``The experience was just horrendous.''
</P>
<P>
   As Simpson finished the seventh grade, Selma was the site of
Bloody Sunday, the day in May 1965 when state troopers and the
police attacked and brutally beat 2,000 demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Racism also lingered in less historically significant moments.
For Simpson, what remains the most stark reminder of his schooling
at the all-black Hudson High School _ what he calls a
``second-rate'' education _ are the textbooks that are outdated.
</P>
<P>
   He could not fully shed his legacy in Selma even as he joined
the Air Force. While stationed at Mountain Home Air Force Base in
Idaho, a staff sergeant and mentor once took Simpson to his house
for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``His family sat around the table staring at me,'' Simpson said.
``And he told me, `Sorry, but this is the first black person
they've seen in their lives in color.'''
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, Simpson was assigned to Lackland Air Force Base in San
Antonio, then he spent several years at bases overseas. He returned
to Lackland in 1982, and retired from the Air Force nine years
later. At that point, he entered Southwest Texas State University
to earn a college degree.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest High School Assistant Principal Rudy Mora encouraged
Simpson, his neighbor, to try teaching, something he had practiced
throughout his time with the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   Working toward his teaching certificate and a master's degree in
educational administration on week nights and weekends, Simpson
joined Southwest as a history, government, sociology and world
geography teacher. He later worked with students considered to be
in danger of dropping out.
</P>
<P>
   ``To become a historian or history teacher and tell these
stories (of the Civil Rights Movement) to my students, it's
incredible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson was tapped as a potential candidate for the Selma High
School position while he was home for a funeral. He was hired,
Selma City School System Superintendent James Carter said, because
of his intellect, his communication skills and his vision for the
school.
</P>
<P>
   He will be the fourth black principal of Selma High School, but
the first who attended the city's all-black public high school.
Selma desegregate its schools in 1970, the year after Simpson
graduated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took them that long,'' Simpson said, referring to the 1954
court mandate that schools be integrated. ``They did everything in
their power to keep the schools segregated, and it wasn't just
there in Selma. It was all over the South.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, about 95 percent of Selma High School's 1,200 students
are black, Carter said, due largely to white movement away from the
city.
</P>
<P>
   In light of the school's legacy, Simpson faces the challenge of
helping create a Selma High School that not only is diverse and
tolerant, but one that students want to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the main thing is to get the students to believe
in themselves,'' he said. ``My challenge would be to get those kids
that are fleeing from the school _ white flight, black flight _ to
come back to the school.''

STUDY REVEALS GAINS, LOSSES OF MINORITY PROFESSIONALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In 1997, after more than a dozen years in Boston, attorney
Carleasa Coates left a position as partner at a prestigious law
firm to work in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Coates says she left for social and professional reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Software consultant Jim Collier, by contrast, was wooed away by
a California company, which offered him a position as vice
president of product development.
</P>
<P>
   The experiences of Coates and Collier are not coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   Although the number of African-American professionals in Boston
has increased to 7,000 and is now growing at a rate of 3.5 percent
per year, many minorities in senior positions are leaving the area.
</P>
<P>
   A study released last week by The Partnership, a nonprofit
organization that helps companies retain minority professionals,
found that the number of entry or junior level African-American
employees at local companies grew 31 percent between 1991 and 1996.
At the same time, there was a 5 percent decline in black senior
level officials and managers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, only 18 of Greater Boston's top 100 firms had
minority officers as of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``While certain Boston industries and companies show measurable
progress in hiring African-American professionals, others struggle
to keep pace and may even show more pronounced losses than the
average levels of decline,'' the study said.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said the city had changed significantly over the
last 20 years, but that many minority professionals continue to
have a negative image of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Benaree Wiley, president and chief executive of The Partnership,
hopes the study will spur debate and lead to some viable solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected to see growth among the number of entry-level
professionals here because the city is an academic center and there
are many, many schools,'' said Wiley. ``What concerns us is that
senior professionals are leaving, and we are not sure why.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked why she left, Coates didn't mince words.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is definitely a ceiling there, and you bump up against
it fairly quickly,'' she said. ``Even if you get into the rarified
air between the ceiling and nirvana, it is isolating because you
are probably the only one there. In 1996, I was the only black
female partner in the top five law firms in the city. That is a
problem, to look around and not see anyone like you, and then to
wonder why.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk to Collier, however, and a different picture emerges. A
specialist in a rapidly changing field, he credited The Partnership
and a former employer, Lotus Development Corp., with helping him
adjust to the city. And, he said, he would have remained in Boston
if he had not been offered a more lucrative job.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Boston, there is no pretense,'' he said. ``So groups like
The Partnership are focused, steadfastly focused. They understand
that there is a need for the organization and they know why.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiley noted the reasons for the decline could be as diverse as
the people themselves. ``Boston has many schools and could be a
great training ground for young professionals. So, the good news
may be that companies in other cities recognize the talent and are
wooing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, we also know that what happens between 7
p.m. and 7 a.m. is important to being able to survive in a city,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Coates, for example, noted that although The Partnership helped
her network with other African-American professionals, there were
few social clubs where minorities could meet.
</P>
<P>
   Collier, meanwhile, said the friends he met through the network
helped him develop close ties that sustained him during his first
few years in the city.
</P>

   While economic growth and increased competition have created an
environment ripe for mergers and acquisitions, the price has been
heavy for American workers, reports Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas
Inc., a Chicago outplacement firm. One out of nine job cuts in the
last four years occurred because of such corporate marriages, the
firm said.
</P>
<P>
   In May, 2,856 jobs were cut from US company payrolls because of
acquisitions or mergers, bringing the total to 32,606 job cuts
since 1995. ``Companies are quicker than ever to form an alliance
if it will help them maximize their potential earnings,'' says
Challenger's chief executive, John A. Challenger.

   A survey by Louis Harris and Associates found that 71 percent of
people with disabilities who are of working age are unemployed, 5
percentage points more than in 1986, when the study was first
conducted.

LATEST TRAVEL PERKS COULD SEND YOU PACKING

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (note: accent over ``e'' in crudites and canapes; ylang-ylang and
eucalyptus citriodora are cq;) 
 
By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when I was beginning to think travel promotions couldn't
get any more outlandish or innovative ...
</P>
<P>
   _ If guests at Ritz-Carlton hotels in Hong Kong, Singapore,
Kuala Lumpur and Sydney are singing ``Splish, splash, I was taking
a bath'' with a flair, it's because those establishments have
introduced new menus.
</P>
<P>
   Not dinner menus. Bath menus.
</P>
<P>
   The Ritz-Carlton, Hong Kong offers a selection of eight tub
soaks created with aromatherapy bath oils and designed to _ take
your pick _ relax, cure, pamper or rejuvenate.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the best part: Each is prepared and drawn by a butler.
</P>
<P>
   Care for the ``Evening Out'' bath? According to the menu,
peppermint, rosemary and juniper invigorate and stimulate the body
and mind; guests will feel ``energized to party.'' Leaving nothing
to chance, the ``natural uplifting qualities of this bath'' are
enhanced by a glass of champagne and strawberries dipped in
chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps the ``Post-Workout Reliever'' is in order. This bath
of marjoram, lavender and geranium is followed by a one-hour
massage, a pot of tea and a platter of freshly prepared sushi. (No,
I'm not making this up.)
</P>
<P>
   The ``Ladies' Bath'' is scented with geranium and melissa
essence, with lavender to rub on the temples, and accompanied by a
glass of freshly squeezed carrot, watermelon, pineapple or
grapefruit juice and a selection of crudites.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Gentleman's Bath,'' by contrast, is ``spiced with the
woody and earthy scents of vetiver, known for its calming and
relaxing effects.'' It comes with a fine cigar, a glass of cognac
and a plate of lobster canapes.
</P>
<P>
   There is no word on whether ladies can trade their carrot juice
and crudites for cognac and lobster.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Honeymooners' Bath'' is prepared by candlelight and
features patchouli, jasmine, ylang-ylang and rose petals scattered
in the tub. The couple also receives champagne, strawberries with
brown sugar and cream, and a dozen red roses.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite is the ``Flu Fighter,'' a ``medicinal blend of
eucalyptus citriodora, tea tree and ginger'' accompanied by a hot
toddy of whiskey, lemon and honey.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour's notice, a butler will arrive 15 minutes before
the desired bathing time to handle all preparations (and, I hope,
provide a second or third hot toddy if the, er, flu is serious). Or
arrangements can be made to ensure that a bath is ready upon
check-in.
</P>
<P>
   Prices range from $26-$38.50 (plus 10 percent service) in U.S.
currency.
</P>
<P>
   Other Ritz-Carltons in the Asia-Pacific region apply individual
touches to their bath menus. ``Ladies Bath'' participants at Kuala
Lumpur, for example, soak in exotic milk with lavender. And a
``Revitalizing Salt Bath'' is formulated with Dead Sea salt
material.
</P>
<P>
   By summer's end, all nine of the chain's Asia-Pacific properties
will offer bath menus reflecting their locations and cultures.
Baths in Bali will include essences from tropical flowers; ginseng
canapes will tempt bathers in Seoul; and Japanese tea will be
served tubside in Osaka.
</P>
<P>
   A travel agent can make reservations (though I'd like to see the
expression on the agent's face when you relay your bath requests).
Or call 800-241-3333.
</P>
<P>
   _ TravelLite, an Illinois-based company, offers not a butler but
a Virtual Bellhop for travelers weary of hauling luggage through
airports or enduring long waits at baggage carousels.
</P>
<P>
   For fees that begin at $65, the ``bellhop'' will come to your
home, office or college dormitory on a specified date, pick up your
bags and make certain they are waiting at a hotel or other
destination prior to your arrival.
</P>
<P>
   To get the cheapest fares, packing early is essential: That $65
price tag is for guaranteed three-day shipping of up to two bags
that weigh a maximum 50 pounds combined. Next-day and second-day
air service are available for a higher tariff. The more bags you
ship, the more you pay.
</P>
<P>
   The Virtual Bellhop handles golf clubs, skis, computers and
business files, too. For information and a price list, access
www.virtualbellhop.com on the Internet or call 877-235-5467.
</P>
<P>
   One suggestion for those who use the three-day service: You may
want to pack an iron to get the wrinkles out of that dress or
shirt.
</P>
<P>
   _ I'll leave you with this gem: Gatorland, an Orlando, Fla.,
attraction celebrating its 50th birthday, has launched a contest in
which 10 entrants will ``win'' the opportunity to ``wrestle hungry
alligators.'' Training with an experienced alligator wrestler is
included.
</P>
<P>
   Gator wrestling is only the second prize. First prize is a
four-day Florida vacation, including air fare, for a family of
four; 90 third prizes provide free park admission for two people.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how to enter: Find your favorite photograph, postcard or
souvenir commemorating the park's exhibits over the past
half-century. Send it (or a color copy of the photo/postcard or a
snapshot of the souvenir) to Gatorland's 50 Years of Great Tales,
14501 S. Orange Blossom Trail, Orlando, Fla. 32837, Attention:
Birthday Bash. Include your name, address, phone number, a
description of the entry (no more than 50 words) and the year it
represents. All entries must be postmarked by Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, access www.gatorland.com on the Internet
or call 800-393-JAWS.
</P>
<P>
   And if you win but don't fancy grabbing gators, not to worry:
You can choose instead to spend a day with the Gatorland Zoo
curator enjoying a variety of other animals.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't request an ``Alligator Bath'' at the Ritz-Carlton,
Hong Kong.

DON'T SLAM THE DOOR ON YOUR WAY OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You and your friends probably get out of taxis, leave theaters,
abandon ships (when necessary), quit jobs; exit is rarely the verb
of choice for the person in the street. So why, wonders Betsy
Cazden, is it all around us? ``The suspect exited the vehicle,''
say the police; flight attendants, adding neologism to euphemism,
tell us to reference the card in the seat pocket so we'll know how
to exit in an emergency. Is this ``another example of military or
quasi-military jargon working its way into civilian life?'' asks
Cazden.
</P>
<P>
   Could be, but journalists might well be contributing to the
plethora of exits. There's a whole collection of words you wouldn't
overhear in a lifetime of eavesdropping _ amid, atop, fled, coif,
doff _ that journalists are keeping alive, often simply because
they're short. ``Serbs exit Kosovo'' trumps leave and depart and
their even longer synonyms in a spot (say, a headline) where every
letter counts.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there's anything wrong with exit, historically
speaking; Latin had both the verb exit _ ``he/she/it leaves'' _ and
the noun exitus, long before English was born. And exit, along with
its plural, exeunt (``they leave''), was a stage direction as early
as 1538. (Perhaps its most memorable appearance comes in ``The
Winter's Tale,'' where Shakespeare forces a character to ``Exit,
pursued by a bear.'')
</P>
<P>
   Yet today, the noun seems natural _ ``I raced for the exit'' is
colloquial English _ while the verb (``I exited as fast as I
could'') sounds pretentious. Maybe that's because doors and
directional arrows all around us are labeled ``exit,'' subliminally
persuading us that the noun is the standard word for what the Brits
sometimes label ``way out.'' (Subliminally would be the appropriate
route, too: The word comes from Latin for ``below the threshold,''
in this case the threshold of the door to consciousness.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, the transitive exit that annoys Cazden is relatively
recent; the verb was used without an object, according to the
Oxford English Dictionary, from 1607 till this century. In 1844, it
was still ``She exited from the chamber,'' not ``She exited the
chamber.'' Only in 1976 do we find the plainly transitive ``he
exited the freeway,'' an Americanism that may well have been
inspired by our speedier travel on those lengthening freeways.
</P>
<P>
   This exit may be a recent arrival, but it's firmly entrenched
now, thanks to our computers. Just as access marched in unopposed
the moment we needed to talk about getting into files, exiting a
program was instantly standard usage. That doesn't mean we're
doomed to extend the usage and begin exiting our houses or cars or
buses (or accessing them, either); plenty of insider lingo stays
corralled in its own pen. The transitive exit could well remain a
verb for drivers, computer users, police officers _ and, of course,
journalists in need of a four-letter word.
</P>
<P>
   Worth the wait
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband and I have a difference of opinion on the
expression wait on,'' writes Ellen Garvey. ``I find it delightful
if he offers to wait on me in the context of bringing me a cup of
coffee or slice of toast. But my skin crawls when he announces that
he'll wait on me when I'm running a bit late. . . . Am I being
overly sensitive?''
</P>
<P>
   The short answer is yes, according to the Merriam-Webster usage
experts, who offer a thorough treatment of the debate. Wait for vs.
wait on may have begun as a regional difference _ Northerners used
for, Southerners on _ but both forms are widespread now, says M-W's
English Usage. Wait for is more common, and avoids confusion with
what waitpersons do, but it has no other claims to superiority.
</P>
<P>
   Tastes in such two-part verbs often vary from place to place; in
my native Midwest, we baby-sat for the neighbors' children;
Bostonians seem to baby-sit them. The Eastern version seems to
suggest sitting on the kids _ sometimes a useful tactic _ but
there's logic to it, too; it's the parents, after all, you are
baby-sitting for. Similarly, while we debate different from vs.
different than, Britons often say different to. (Forget that logic
I just mentioned; convention is everything in this realm.)
</P>
<P>
   In any case, if you've got a husband who thinks you're worth
waiting on and waiting for, the only reasonable conclusion is vive
la difference.

GIULIANI'S MISSTEPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK -- Who da thunk it?
</P>
<P>
   The person who has bought into the crackpot notion that next
year's Senate race here is some grand national crusade is not
Hillary Rodham Clinton. It's Mayor Rudy Giuliani, whose second-term
egomania continues to obscure his first-term problem-solving to
such an extent that he has created a small opening for a
potentially serious Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani publicly anticipates some magical Ken Starr report that
may turn out to be Godot; he screams ``carbetbagger'' to the wind;
and joins in the ``why is she doing this?'' psychobabble. Little
things _ education, health care, transportation, and housing _ he
leaves to Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In just his latest myopic goof, Giuliani went down to Washington
last week to raise serious national money, and proceeded to step
all over his message by refusing to commit himself to serving a
full, six-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, meanwhile, dared to be boring and made plans for a
multiday swing through upstate New York. And for Representative
Rick Lazio, who sounds every day like a plausible challenger to
Giuliani's presumed lock on the GOP nomination, it was another
chance to say ``I told you so.''Lazio has not only taken the pledge
conspicuously, he also regularly taunts Giuliani for seeking but a
``temporary perch'' in the Senate, which just so happens to be one
of the points the mayor makes about Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   There has been so much babble about this nascent campaign that
the fundamentals have been forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, what's actually happened is that Mrs. Clinton has
cleared the Democratic field. Assuming she keeps running, she is
the nominee, and if she's smart (another given), she'll use her
time introducing herself and talking about the everyday concerns of
voters, shedding the podium for as much retail campaigning as
security concerns will allow, and ignoring the national press.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, however, has yet to clear the Republican field, and
his tactic of acting as if he has only adds to his imperious image
and makes that grubby task more difficult. The mayor is not George
W. Bush. And not clearing the field could mean a hard-fought
primary campaign lasting all the way into September of next year,
less than two months before the election.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the Republican Party here remains a vipers' nest
of competing ambitions and ideologies. The most personal feud is
between Giuliani and defeated Senator Al D'Amato and his
considerable army of bitter henchmen.It started with Giuliani's
endorsement of Democrat Mario Cuomo for reelection five years ago.
The fact that D'Amato's protege, George Pataki, not only won but
has gone on to become as nationally ambitious as Giuliani only
complicates things.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Republicans here say Pataki gave more than casual
consideration to running for the Senate himself. And instead of
cracking heads to clear the field, several of his people are
encouraging Lazio. Still others are pushing an even darker horse,
Representative Peter King, whose conservatism includes a
right-to-life platform Lazio and Giuliani reject.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio is a credible Republican. He came out of Long Island's
South Shore to whip a Democratic big shot and Al Gore buddy, Tom
Downey, as the GOP was taking over Congress. He is well-liked, and
has a genuine legislative credit from his bipartisan aproach to
last year's successful reform of public housing programs.But he is
also a combative conservative, a Newt Gingrich company commander
during the 1995 budget wars and a solid proimpeachment vote last
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Among Republicans, he has more going for him than Giuliani's
Mario Cuomo apostasy. The best example is his suburbanite hatred
for a now-repealed tax on commuters that the mayor once
supported.From Long Island to Westchester to Rockland, taxes are
the bread and butter of Republican politics, and the issue gives
Lazio potential traction in the counties that decide GOP primaries,
often in favor of the more conservative candidate. Upstate,
traditional resentment of New York City counts even more, and in a
primary the city remains a lousy Republican base.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio still has a long way to go, but money will not be a
problem, and neither will the work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   In the national media frenzy over this race, the historical
point of reference is Robert Kennedy's uphill conquest of Kenneth
Keating here 35 years ago _ when a young collegian named Giuliani
helped defuse the carpetbagger issue by writing about the state's
first senator, Rufus King, who moved here from Massachusetts just
before his election in 1792.
</P>
<P>
   But savvy Republicans worry about 1970 and 1980, when two
liberal Republican Senators (Charles Goodell and Jacob Javits) lost
primaries to conservatives (James Buckley and D'Amato), who won in
November because their GOP foes hung around on the once-legitimate
Liberal Party line and split the left.
</P>
<P>
   This time, they see a similar problem on the right, with further
chances for ballot mischief open to the Conservative Party (which
likes Lazio) and the right-To-lifers.
</P>
<P>
   Before this race gets real, two points: The Republicans don't
have their act together; and the ``hate Hillary'' sentiment either
knocks her out of the race soon, or her issue profile will make her
look a lot like, well, a New Yorker.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the land of the wealthy, dirt is king.
</P>
<P>
   Take a stroll through Jupiter Island, Fla., for instance. A
one-acre plot of land with 150 feet of waterfront fetches between
$2 million and $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The house sitting on that dirt might be palatial, but that
hardly matters: On this island of exclusivity, houses come and go
with alarming speed. ``There are a number of houses going up right
now, and every single one of them will eventually be knocked
down,'' says Gene Albarelle, a local broker who deals in high-end
properties.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a speculator paid $1.65 million for an acre of ground
with a five-bedroom house on it. The house was immediately torn
down, and though its replacement has not yet been finished, the
owner is now asking $4.4 million for this small parcel of paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Jupiter Island is prime territory, removed by 574
feet of bridge from the strip-malled Florida mainland and situated
just 20 miles north of Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Jupiter Island is also the number-one town on WORTH's
annual list of America's wealthiest enclaves.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it was number two, right behind Aspen, Colo.; in
previous years it has ranked seventh and ninth. In other words,
Jupiter Island is a well-credentialed top town.
</P>
<P>
   It has been the winter residence of some of the oldest names in
American business (Field, Doubleday, Ford) as well as some of the
newest, like Chuck Curcio, founder of Tire Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   His former home, a six-bedroom, 16,000-square-foot behemoth on
five acres with waterfront, sold in April for $12.5 million; the
buyer was Stephen Garofalo, CEO of Metromedia Fiber Network
Services, who paid another $4.2 million for an adjacent piece of
property that Curcio also owned.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter Island ranks number one on this year's list because its
median home sales price for 1997 and 1998 combined was $1.7
million, the highest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In compiling the list, we gathered data as we have for the past
three years: through public records and multiple-listing services
and with the help of Prudential Real Estate agents and brokers
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   We found (no surprise) that Americans are buying houses as never
before: 1998 was a record year for existing-home sales; some 4.78
million houses changed hands, according to the National Association
of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of newly constructed single-family homes reached levels
not seen since 1977, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and the
nation's home-ownership rate soared to a new high of 66.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many factors driving our housing market _ it's
hard to list all of them,'' says Kory Bockman, an economist with
NAR. ``We have a tremendous job market right now, unemployment is
near historical lows, consumer confidence is high, the stock market
is strong, oil prices are low...The list just goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the appreciation in the median home price last year
outstripped inflation by 3.6 percentage points. (The median home
price for our entire list of 250 towns is $504,144, an increase of
13.3 percent over last year.)
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, according to NAR data, the West showed the greatest
existing-home-price appreciation: 7.23 percent, followed closely by
the Midwest, with 7.20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gains were especially high around hubs for the high-tech
industry. Economist Bockman says, ``I think the strength of the
high-tech industry may be the most important driving factor in the
high-end market right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The California towns of Atherton (No. 3), Woodside (No. 12), and
Palo Alto (No. 89) moved up on our list from last year, as did the
Seattle suburbs of Medina (No. 48), Yarrow Point (No. 50), and
Mercer Island (No. 157).
</P>
<P>
   Because of stock options and bonuses, a remarkable number of
home purchases at the very highest end are increasingly transacted
in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Zinn, an entrepreneur who's in the process of starting a
manufactured-housing company, says she achieved peace of mind when
she and her husband, Tim, paid cash for a $1.8 million,
7,000-square-foot Mediterranean-style house in Rancho Santa Fe,
Calif. (No. 10).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in having a mortgage,'' she says. ``I like to
think that whatever happens, my home is my home.''
</P>
<P>
   Zinn may sound a bit like Scarlett O'Hara surveying Tara _
though in the current housing market, Tara would be a teardown and
the land would be subdivided into miniature ``estates.'' &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The Zinns have 2.5 acres, which isn't bad these days. In fact,
Zinn says, ``we have total privacy, because the property is high up
and protected by trees. We could have a whole nudist colony in the
backyard, and no one would know'' _ a plot, perhaps, for ``Gone
With the Wind, Part IV.''
</P>
<P>
   The Zinns weren't the only high-end cash buyers in Rancho Santa
Fe, an expensive suburb just 25 miles north of San Diego. &QL;

</P>
<P>

 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to analyst John Karevoll at Acxiom/DataQuick, a
national real-estate research firm in La Jolla, Calif. (No. 83),
Rancho Santa Fe was the greenest town in the Golden State last
year: 46.1 percent of all homes sold there were bought with cash.
</P>
<P>
   In another wealthy spot _ Palm Beach, Fla. (No. 26) _ 52 percent
of the homes sold in 1998 were paid for in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, cash purchases are often made in wealthy
markets like Southern California, Colorado, and Florida, which
attract the middle-aged and successful (who are looking for a
second home) and retirees (who arrive with decades' worth of
accumulated wealth).
</P>
<P>
   The Zinns, for instance, spend part of the year in their
turn-of-the-century brownstone in Chicago's Lincoln Park area and
part of the year in their sunny California home. ``My heart is
slowly moving West,'' says Ellen Zinn, 53.
</P>
<P>
   Other such hot spots: Vail (No. 43), Telluride (No. 113), and
Mountain Village (No. 6), all in Colorado, and the Town of Paradise

   ``It's not so much that home prices have appreciated,'' she

   In some wealthy California towns, home buying has become a
high-speed, high-stakes challenge. ``Just last week, some clients
of mine made an offer on a house in Palo Alto (No. 89) that was

<P>
   ``All of the brokers were basically standing in line, waiting
their turn to make their pitches. I was number 13 of 13, and I knew
we didn't stand a chance _ my clients couldn't afford to go more
than $22,000 above asking.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to make an acceptable offer has also resulted in a
few unusual situations: Last year, a couple of Hollister's clients
huddled in the study of a house they wanted to buy _ and didn't
leave _ as the owners huddled in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sellers' agent and I ran from den to living room and back
again with offers and counteroffers,'' Hollister says, ``until we
got the deal worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Such frantic competition has created an auction-house atmosphere
in some markets and led to a phenomenon known as ``gazumping,''
British slang for a situation in which one buyer, who thinks he has
made a acceptable offer on a house, loses out to another, who
offers more money on the sly.

   Stylistically, wealthy Americans continue to express themselves

Stuart Cohen, architect and professor of architecture at the
University of Illinois at Chicago, says that ``the high-end
construction market trickles down in terms of presenting a kind of
ideal that people buying $300,000 to $400,000 houses aspire to.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly unfashionable are the ranch-style, low-slung
modernist rectangles created in the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, very few of them are of any kind of architectural
distinction, because they're coming down like crazy,'' says Cohen.
But architectural distinction _ even historical significance _ is
no protection against the bulldozers.

   Tearing down a house, though, is not always a swift or easy

<P>
   ``My family is Midwestern, with Quaker roots,'' says Nancy

<P>
   In the land of the wealthy, dirt is king.
</P>
<P>
   Take a stroll through Jupiter Island, Fla., for instance. A
one-acre plot of land with 150 feet of waterfront fetches between
$2 million and $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The house sitting on that dirt might be palatial, but that
hardly matters: On this island of exclusivity, houses come and go
with alarming speed. ``There are a number of houses going up right
now, and every single one of them will eventually be knocked
down,'' says Gene Albarelle, a local broker who deals in high-end
properties.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a speculator paid $1.65 million for an acre of ground
with a five-bedroom house on it. The house was immediately torn
down, and though its replacement has not yet been finished, the
owner is now asking $4.4 million for this small parcel of paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Jupiter Island is prime territory, removed by 574
feet of bridge from the strip-malled Florida mainland and situated
just 20 miles north of Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Jupiter Island is also the number-one town on WORTH's
annual list of America's wealthiest enclaves.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it was number two, right behind Aspen, Colo.; in
previous years it has ranked seventh and ninth. In other words,
Jupiter Island is a well-credentialed top town.
</P>
<P>
   It has been the winter residence of some of the oldest names in
American business (Field, Doubleday, Ford) as well as some of the
newest, like Chuck Curcio, founder of Tire Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   His former home, a six-bedroom, 16,000-square-foot behemoth on
five acres with waterfront, sold in April for $12.5 million; the
buyer was Stephen Garofalo, CEO of Metromedia Fiber Network
Services, who paid another $4.2 million for an adjacent piece of
property that Curcio also owned.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter Island ranks number one on this year's list because its
median home sales price for 1997 and 1998 combined was $1.7
million, the highest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In compiling the list, we gathered data as we have for the past
three years: through public records and multiple-listing services
and with the help of Prudential Real Estate agents and brokers
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   We found (no surprise) that Americans are buying houses as never
before: 1998 was a record year for existing-home sales; some 4.78
million houses changed hands, according to the National Association
of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of newly constructed single-family homes reached levels
not seen since 1977, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and the
nation's home-ownership rate soared to a new high of 66.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many factors driving our housing market _ it's
hard to list all of them,'' says Kory Bockman, an economist with
NAR. ``We have a tremendous job market right now, unemployment is
near historical lows, consumer confidence is high, the stock market
is strong, oil prices are low...The list just goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the appreciation in the median home price last year
outstripped inflation by 3.6 percentage points. (The median home
price for our entire list of 250 towns is $504,144, an increase of
13.3 percent over last year.)
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, according to NAR data, the West showed the greatest
existing-home-price appreciation: 7.23 percent, followed closely by
the Midwest, with 7.20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gains were especially high around hubs for the high-tech
industry. Economist Bockman says, ``I think the strength of the
high-tech industry may be the most important driving factor in the
high-end market right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The California towns of Atherton (No. 3), Woodside (No. 12), and
Palo Alto (No. 89) moved up on our list from last year, as did the
Seattle suburbs of Medina (No. 48), Yarrow Point (No. 50), and
Mercer Island (No. 157).
</P>
<P>
   Because of stock options and bonuses, a remarkable number of
home purchases at the very highest end are increasingly transacted
in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Zinn, an entrepreneur who's in the process of starting a
manufactured-housing company, says she achieved peace of mind when
she and her husband, Tim, paid cash for a $1.8 million,
7,000-square-foot Mediterranean-style house in Rancho Santa Fe,
Calif. (No. 10).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in having a mortgage,'' she says. ``I like to
think that whatever happens, my home is my home.''
</P>
<P>
   Zinn may sound a bit like Scarlett O'Hara surveying Tara _
though in the current housing market, Tara would be a teardown and
the land would be subdivided into miniature ``estates.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 800) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Zinns have 2.5 acres, which isn't bad these days. In fact,
Zinn says, ``we have total privacy, because the property is high up
and protected by trees. We could have a whole nudist colony in the
backyard, and no one would know'' _ a plot, perhaps, for ``Gone
With the Wind, Part IV.''
</P>
<P>
   The Zinns weren't the only high-end cash buyers in Rancho Santa
Fe, an expensive suburb just 25 miles north of San Diego. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>

</P>
<P>
   According to analyst John Karevoll at Acxiom/DataQuick, a
national real-estate research firm in La Jolla, Calif. (No. 83),
Rancho Santa Fe was the greenest town in the Golden State last
year: 46.1 percent of all homes sold there were bought with cash.
</P>
<P>
   In another wealthy spot _ Palm Beach, Fla. (No. 26) _ 52 percent
of the homes sold in 1998 were paid for in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, cash purchases are often made in wealthy
markets like Southern California, Colorado, and Florida, which
attract the middle-aged and successful (who are looking for a
second home) and retirees (who arrive with decades' worth of
accumulated wealth).
</P>
<P>
   The Zinns, for instance, spend part of the year in their
turn-of-the-century brownstone in Chicago's Lincoln Park area and
part of the year in their sunny California home. ``My heart is
slowly moving West,'' says Ellen Zinn, 53.
</P>
<P>
   Other such hot spots: Vail (No. 43), Telluride (No. 113), and
Mountain Village (No. 6), all in Colorado, and the Town of Paradise
Valley (No. 56) in Arizona. &QL;

<P>
   In the land of the wealthy, dirt is king.
</P>
<P>
   Take a stroll through Jupiter Island, Fla., for instance. A
one-acre plot of land with 150 feet of waterfront fetches between
$2 million and $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The house sitting on that dirt might be palatial, but that
hardly matters: On this island of exclusivity, houses come and go
with alarming speed. ``There are a number of houses going up right
now, and every single one of them will eventually be knocked
down,'' says Gene Albarelle, a local broker who deals in high-end
properties.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a speculator paid $1.65 million for an acre of ground
with a five-bedroom house on it. The house was immediately torn
down, and though its replacement has not yet been finished, the
owner is now asking $4.4 million for this small parcel of paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Jupiter Island is prime territory, removed by 574
feet of bridge from the strip-malled Florida mainland and situated
just 20 miles north of Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Jupiter Island is also the number-one town on WORTH's
annual list of America's wealthiest enclaves.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it was number two, right behind Aspen, Colo.; in
previous years it has ranked seventh and ninth. In other words,
Jupiter Island is a well-credentialed top town.
</P>
<P>
   It has been the winter residence of some of the oldest names in
American business (Field, Doubleday, Ford) as well as some of the
newest, like Chuck Curcio, founder of Tire Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   His former home, a six-bedroom, 16,000-square-foot behemoth on
five acres with waterfront, sold in April for $12.5 million; the
buyer was Stephen Garofalo, CEO of Metromedia Fiber Network
Services, who paid another $4.2 million for an adjacent piece of
property that Curcio also owned.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter Island ranks number one on this year's list because its
median home sales price for 1997 and 1998 combined was $1.7
million, the highest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In compiling the list, we gathered data as we have for the past
three years: through public records and multiple-listing services
and with the help of Prudential Real Estate agents and brokers
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   We found (no surprise) that Americans are buying houses as never
before: 1998 was a record year for existing-home sales; some 4.78
million houses changed hands, according to the National Association
of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of newly constructed single-family homes reached levels
not seen since 1977, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and the
nation's home-ownership rate soared to a new high of 66.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many factors driving our housing market _ it's
hard to list all of them,'' says Kory Bockman, an economist with
NAR. ``We have a tremendous job market right now, unemployment is
near historical lows, consumer confidence is high, the stock market
is strong, oil prices are low...The list just goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the appreciation in the median home price last year
outstripped inflation by 3.6 percentage points. (The median home
price for our entire list of 250 towns is $504,144, an increase of
13.3 percent over last year.)
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, according to NAR data, the West showed the greatest
existing-home-price appreciation: 7.23 percent, followed closely by
the Midwest, with 7.20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gains were especially high around hubs for the high-tech
industry. Economist Bockman says, ``I think the strength of the
high-tech industry may be the most important driving factor in the
high-end market right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The California towns of Atherton (No. 3), Woodside (No. 12), and
Palo Alto (No. 89) moved up on our list from last year, as did the
Seattle suburbs of Medina (No. 48), Yarrow Point (No. 50), and
Mercer Island (No. 157).
</P>
<P>
   Because of stock options and bonuses, a remarkable number of
home purchases at the very highest end are increasingly transacted
in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Zinn, an entrepreneur who's in the process of starting a
manufactured-housing company, says she achieved peace of mind when
she and her husband, Tim, paid cash for a $1.8 million,
7,000-square-foot Mediterranean-style house in Rancho Santa Fe,
Calif. (No. 10).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in having a mortgage,'' she says. ``I like to
think that whatever happens, my home is my home.''
</P>
<P>
   Zinn may sound a bit like Scarlett O'Hara surveying Tara _
though in the current housing market, Tara would be a teardown and
the land would be subdivided into miniature ``estates.'' &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The Zinns have 2.5 acres, which isn't bad these days. In fact,
Zinn says, ``we have total privacy, because the property is high up
and protected by trees. We could have a whole nudist colony in the
backyard, and no one would know'' _ a plot, perhaps, for ``Gone
With the Wind, Part IV.''
</P>
<P>
   The Zinns weren't the only high-end cash buyers in Rancho Santa
Fe, an expensive suburb just 25 miles north of San Diego. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to analyst John Karevoll at Acxiom/DataQuick, a
national real-estate research firm in La Jolla, Calif. (No. 83),
Rancho Santa Fe was the greenest town in the Golden State last
year: 46.1 percent of all homes sold there were bought with cash.
</P>
<P>
   In another wealthy spot _ Palm Beach, Fla. (No. 26) _ 52 percent
of the homes sold in 1998 were paid for in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, cash purchases are often made in wealthy
markets like Southern California, Colorado, and Florida, which
attract the middle-aged and successful (who are looking for a
second home) and retirees (who arrive with decades' worth of
accumulated wealth).
</P>
<P>
   The Zinns, for instance, spend part of the year in their
turn-of-the-century brownstone in Chicago's Lincoln Park area and
part of the year in their sunny California home. ``My heart is
slowly moving West,'' says Ellen Zinn, 53.
</P>
<P>
   Other such hot spots: Vail (No. 43), Telluride (No. 113), and
Mountain Village (No. 6), all in Colorado, and the Town of Paradise
Valley (No. 56) in Arizona. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;

   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 525 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,025) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The high-end ``is the segment of the market that emerged the
fastest in the mid-1990s and has done the best since then,'' says
Karevoll.
</P>
<P>
   In University Park (No. 190), near Dallas, homeowners were
practically leapfrogging one another to trade up ``from cottage or
ranch to Tudor or two-story traditional,'' says Cheryl Saldana, a
local Prudential real-estate agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much that home prices have appreciated,'' she
adds, ``but that land value has skyrocketed. A typical
70-by-150-foot lot that sold for $300,000 in 1997 sold for $450,000
last year. It's the biggest boom year we've seen since the 1980s.
People are comparing this market to California's.''
</P>
<P>
   In some wealthy California towns, home buying has become a
high-speed, high-stakes challenge. ``Just last week, some clients
of mine made an offer on a house in Palo Alto (No. 89) that was
listed for $559,000,'' says Prudential broker Linda Hollister.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the brokers were basically standing in line, waiting
their turn to make their pitches. I was number 13 of 13, and I knew
we didn't stand a chance _ my clients couldn't afford to go more
than $22,000 above asking.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to make an acceptable offer has also resulted in a
few unusual situations: Last year, a couple of Hollister's clients
huddled in the study of a house they wanted to buy _ and didn't
leave _ as the owners huddled in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sellers' agent and I ran from den to living room and back
again with offers and counteroffers,'' Hollister says, ``until we
got the deal worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Such frantic competition has created an auction-house atmosphere
in some markets and led to a phenomenon known as ``gazumping,''
British slang for a situation in which one buyer, who thinks he has
made a acceptable offer on a house, loses out to another, who
offers more money on the sly.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the celebrity wars over houses not even on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Seinfeld offered $14.5 million for a spread in East
Hampton, Long Island, N.Y., had his offer rejected, and
subsequently lost out to clothing designer Helmut Lang, who also
liked the property but came up with an acceptable $15.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Stylistically, wealthy Americans continue to express themselves
through their houses in large, grandiose strokes. A few towns, like
Newton, Mass. (No. 227), have instituted house-to-plot-size ratios,
and a few have rules and regulations about architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain Village, Colo. (No. 6), which sprang up in the last
four years near Telluride, is small (population: 1,000) and very,
very rich.
</P>
<P>
   As mandated by the town administration, all new homes in this
young Rockies resort have to ``contribute to a single identity''
and ``foster a sense of visual harmony and lasting value.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have very strict design guidelines,'' says Andy Hanley,
mayor of Mountain Village (and a real-estate broker and developer),
``so there's a little bit of a process you have to come through.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;

</P>
<P>
   Homeowners are quick to follow the trends of those above them.
Stuart Cohen, architect and professor of architecture at the
University of Illinois at Chicago, says that ``the high-end
construction market trickles down in terms of presenting a kind of
ideal that people buying $300,000 to $400,000 houses aspire to.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly unfashionable are the ranch-style, low-slung
modernist rectangles created in the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, very few of them are of any kind of architectural
distinction, because they're coming down like crazy,'' says Cohen.
But architectural distinction _ even historical significance _ is
no protection against the bulldozers.
</P>
<P>
   In Hinsdale, Ill. (No. 139) _ known as the teardown capital of
the Midwest _ more than 100 homes were leveled last year, some of
them Victorians.
</P>
<P>
   In Greenwich, Conn. (No. 23), fat green dumpsters parked in
driveways have replaced Mercedeses as neighborhood status symbols. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,700) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tearing down a house, though, is not always a swift or easy
decision. The Maloneys of Greenwich bought a waterfront house in
nearby Riverside (No. 62) for $2.3 million and struggled with the
decision of whether to renovate or level.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family is Midwestern, with Quaker roots,'' says Nancy
Maloney. ``And philosophically, they're not people to tear things
down. There's something that really bothers me about just razing
the place, and I keep asking, `Can't we use anything?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Although her husband and their architect finally convinced her
that building around the elements she liked would be more expensive
than replacing them, she hopes to salvage what she can: She
mentions a porthole window and a favorite faucet.
</P>
<P>
   Some architectural details, like the staircases, would not meet
current building codes even if they could be saved. ``You just
can't get away with some of these things anymore,'' she says
wistfully, ``even if you like them.'' &QL;

   After a record-breaking year of home sales, the market shows few
signs of slowing down. California has 76 towns on our list this
year, and next year looks just as strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are initially forecasting an 8 percent decrease in home
sales,'' says Leslie Appleton-Young, an economist with the
California Association of Realtors. ``And I hate to change a
forecast, but I think that sales this year are going to be
extremely strong. The biggest constraint on the market is supply.
When the market is this hot, there just isn't that much
inventory.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, says Bockman, the NAR economist, ``our numbers are
actually coming out ahead of where we were last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were expecting the beginning part of the year to be strong
and then the second part of the year to tail off a little bit. We
expect to settle in for 1999 right around the same levels that we
had for 1998, and we may even end the year a little bit higher,
depending on how things go over the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our forecasts is that mortgage rates are going to drop
shortly, and if this happens, we expect to see another glut of home
buyers hitting the market. All of those people who missed out on
the last opportunity will finally get off the fence and make that
purchase.'' &QL;

   Higher home prices? Smaller lots? Bigger houses? It takes a
historian to put these trends into perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Jackson is a former chairman of Columbia University's
history department and an expert on suburbia who lives in Rich Town
No. 163 (Chappaqua, N.Y.). He makes the point that no matter how
expensive houses may seem ``they're still cheap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Similar dwellings in Japan, Germany, France, or Switzerland
would almost certainly be more expensive, if they were available at
all _ and most likely they wouldn't be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have space,'' he explains. ``Both our land and our
construction costs are less expensive in the United States than
elsewhere. An acre of land in Japan would be an undreamed-of
luxury: nothing in San Marino (No. 72), Greenwich (No. 23), or even
Atherton (No. 3) could compare to it. In world terms, a million
dollars an acre is not an expensive price to pay.'' &QL;

SOME ENVIRONMENTALISTS SAY GORE HAS MORE PASSION THAN ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You'd have to go back to Teddy Roosevelt, who created many of
the national parks, to find a presidential candidate with
environmental credentials like Al Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   While Republican front-runner George W. Bush got his first major
briefing on global warming this spring, Gore's study began in the
1960s at Harvard University, where he learned at the knee of the
man who invented the theory.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made the environment the centerpiece of his 1988 campaign
for president, when rival Jesse Jackson said Gore's dissertations
on the state of Earth made him sound like the ``national chemist.''
But defeat only spurred Gore to write a best-selling book on how to
save the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Vice President Gore is the environmental point man for
the first administration run by men who call themselves
``environmentalists.'' As perhaps the most influential
environmental policy maker in the world, Gore helped push issues
such as global warming to the center stage of American politics.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as Gore begins his second run for the White House, he faces
a rebellion from the one group whose support many thought he should
have sewn up long ago: environmentalists. Gore's passion for nature
may rival Roosevelt's, but critics say he has too often squandered
opportunities to produce tough policies.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Clinton ``talk very big rhetoric and actually propose
very little in terms of action. It's what I would call the school
uniform solution to environmental problems,'' said Phillip E. Clapp
of the National Environmental Trust, one of Gore's most vocal
critics on the environment.
</P>
<P>
   On issues from saving swordfish to logging in national forests,
environmentalists say the administration has chosen modest
compromises over Gore's tough principles.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to global warming, for instance, Gore
``understands the science at a level that few, if any, politicians
ever have. On the other hand, he needs to engage with people on the
policy,'' said Michael Oppenheimer, senior scientist at the
Environmental Defense Fund in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Some prominent environmentalists say privately that Gore can't
take their votes for granted, and nonpartisan groups such as the
Environmental Defense Fund are talking to several candidates in
hopes of building bridges to the eventual winner.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism from environmentalists, in the form of big
newspaper ads and open letters expressing ``disappointment'' in the
vice president, angers Gore loyalists. They say that Gore has had
to contend with a Republican Congress and skeptical White House
advisers who make bold environmental measures difficult. Even so,
they say, the Clinton administration has done more for the
environment than any other in recent history.
</P>
<P>
   They say that today's environmentalists seem to forget the
not-so-distant past when former President Reagan symbolically tore
the solar panels from the White House roof or when Vice President
Dan Quayle tried to relax environmental standards to help industry.
Now, say Gore boosters, environmentalists can always count on a
sympathetic hearing from Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore ``has dramatically moved the bar'' in protecting the
environment, said Katie McGinty, until recently the director of the
White House Council on Environmental Quality. ``We would not have .
. . an international game plan to save the world from disruptive
climatic changes if not for Al Gore's leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   She was referring to an international treaty, called the Kyoto
Protocol, that Gore brokered in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Some criticism of Gore may have been inevitable because of
expectations Gore created through his 1992 book, ``Earth in the
Balance,'' which portrayed a global environmental crisis. Gore
called for making environmental protection ``the central organizing
principle for civilization,'' and called global warming ``the most
serious threat we have ever faced.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's passion has often not been matched by action. The
Clinton administration has proposed few measures to control the
United States' burning of oil and coal, the leading human source of
gases that contribute to global warming. And Gore icily rejected
environmentalists' urging that the Kyoto Protocol be sent to the US
Senate so that American commitments would become binding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Name a senator who would support me,'' Gore told the leaders
of several environmental groups last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Gore argues that he wants to steadily advance environmental
causes without creating a polarizing debate, a mistake that he says
the administration made in 1993 by trying to slap a new tax on coal
and oil. Congress swiftly rejected the so-called BTU tax, and the
fight has poisoned administration efforts to win support for
policies against global warming ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, however, suspect Gore's caution is driven by his
presidential ambitions. Gore himself has cited his ``tendency to
put a finger to the political winds and proceed cautiously.'' With
Republicans already seizing upon passages in Gore's book for
evidence of extremism, Gore may not want to give them more
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody thinks he's insincere,'' said John Passacantando of the
Washington-based environmental group Ozone Action. ``The criticism
is more that he and his staff are letting the fearmongers
circumscribe his political agenda, limiting him on environmental
issues to small potatoes.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Gore is that rare politician who thrives on the
scientific and technical details of environmental issues, surfing
the Web or calling scientists directly for the latest information.
Even Gore's cocktail party conversation often turns to issues such
as stabilizing global population.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Gore is formidably well-informed, as he
demonstrated a couple of years ago when he very publicly tutored
President Clinton on the ecological role of phosphorous in Lake
Tahoe, Calif.

ANNIE PROULX SPINS DARK YARNS OF WILD, WEARYING WYOMING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (``CLOSE RANGE: Wyoming Stories''; By Annie Proulx; Scribner,
$25.) 
 
By BARBARA LISS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Welcome to Wyoming. ``Dangerous and indifferent ground,'' writes
Annie Proulx. This is her kind of country, for she is addicted to
hard places _ Newfoundland's rugged coast in the Pulitzer
Prize-winning ``The Shipping News''; New England's rocky soil in
``Postcards.'' Landscape, she tells us, is destiny.
</P>
<P>
   And never more so than in the penetrating stories of ``Close
Range.'' Proulx's Wyoming looks nothing like the West that glows
from the pages of Cowboys and Indians magazine. Her adopted home
state is a sublimely beautiful, treacherous place where the weather
wins every time in the struggle to keep the ranch going.
</P>
<P>
   The main thing, one stoic explains, is to ``last as long as you
can, make things come out so it's still your ranch when it's time a
get buried.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardly anyone does last that long. Nowhere in the 11 stories is
there a happy ending. Not that Proulx cares about such things. But
none of the characters in ``Close Range'' escapes an abusive
childhood or a wrong choice. So read at your own peril, and be
warned that nobody gets even the absence of misery that passes for
happiness in ``The Shipping News.''
</P>
<P>
   The first story, ``The Half-Skinned Steer,'' which is included
in ``The Best American Short Stories of the Century'' anthology,
reads like the fable it is. (It comes from an Icelandic folk tale.)
A fierce old man gone from Wyoming 60 years travels back by car for
his brother's funeral. On the road, he meets up with a series of
disasters, each one worse than the one before.
</P>
<P>
   Although we know his homecoming will finish him off, Proulx
impressively builds suspense in this mournful tale. And she sets
the stage for the stories to come.
</P>
<P>
   Another pugnacious loner, Diamond Felts, makes his way on the
rodeo circuit in ``The Mud Down Below.'' Diamond has something to
prove to his father, and the first time he rides a bull, he is
consumed with ``the feeling of power as though he were the bull and
not the rider; even the fright fulfilled some greedy physical
hunger in him he hadn't known was there.'' For the reader who
thinks the rodeo might be as romantic as an old Judy Collins song,
here is the antidote.
</P>
<P>
   In a story worthy of Faulkner, the grim ``People in Hell Just
Want a Drink of Water,'' an ambitious rancher builds a dynasty on
the backs of his eight sons. Raised hard and mean, they are
contemptuous of weaker men. In their arrogance they exact a cruel
justice against the son of another rancher.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of Proulx's protagonists are male (``a reflection
of the real world, like it or not,'' she has said), Josanna Skiles,
a woman of ``plain face and thickening flesh,'' stands at the
center of ``The Lonely Coast.'' If life is an endless ridge of
disappointments for men in Wyoming, it is a valley of tears for
women. They do not go the distance in these stories.
</P>
<P>
   Josanna spends her Friday nights with her friends, reading the
newspaper personal ads aloud. The man she meets through the paper
turns out to be a handsome, quick-smiling, ``one step this side of
restless drifter.''
</P>
<P>
   The narrator, who has her own man troubles, understands what
happened to Josanna one night out on the Casper highway. And in
words too eloquent to be hers _ a young woman tending bar _ she
explains Josanna's actions.
</P>
<P>
   All of Proulx's characters suffer loneliness as punishing as a
Wyoming blizzard. In ``The Bunchgrass at the Edge of the World,''
Ottaline, a young woman ``approaching the size of a hundred-gallon
propane tank,'' works her father's ranch, pining for love.
</P>
<P>
   One day an abandoned John Deere tractor talks to her from a
gravel pit, both wooing her and ticking off its grievances. When
Ottaline is drawn to the burnt-out machine, we know that bad times
wait ahead for somebody.
</P>
<P>
   Proulx has fun with this venture into magical realism, western
style, but its downbeat weirdness will not suit everyone's taste.
</P>
<P>
   There is something for everyone _ adultery, divorce, sexual
harassment, violence _ in ``Pair a Spurs,'' a complicated tale
about a set of magical handmade spurs that pass from one person to
another. Like Proulx's accordion in ``Accordion Crimes,'' the
owners of the spurs come to a bad end.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not the spurs that eat at Car Scrope, a luckless
rancher ``on his way downhill.'' Car, starved for love, or maybe
just for sex, pushes headlong into craziness. In Proulx's world, if
grasshoppers, dust storms and tractors don't get you, loneliness
will.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe a sense of despair will finish you off. The young man
whose ranch is failing in ``The Governors of Wyoming'' tells his
wife, ``I can't get a holt on it. On anything.'' Shy Hamp, whose
downfall takes entirely too long to tell, hasn't really lost the
knack of ranching because he never had it.
</P>
<P>
   His grandfather's photographs of Wyoming governors reproach him
from the living-room wall. And to add insult, his wife has made a
success selling Ralph Laurenesque western clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Out of frustration and rage, Shy becomes an agitator against the
beef industry. Cows have wrecked the West, an anti-beef organizer
tells him. Well, thinks the reader, they have certainly wrecked
Shy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brokeback Mountain,'' the last story _ and maybe the best _
takes the most chances, surprising us with its homoerotic theme.
Proulx pours enormous sympathy into an account of two country boys
who meet one summer in their youth tending sheep and then spend
their lives running from and to their passionate relationship. One
of the men tersely sums up their situation: ``We do that in the
wrong place, we'll be dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The stories would be wearying if it were not for Proulx's wry
observations. For example, of a teen-age girl's family history, she
writes, ``Her mother lived in Austin, Texas, with a sitar player
whose name was unpronounceable.'' About a woman who, in her
madness, throws her baby into a river, she comments, ``A murderer
she might be, but no one could say her house wasn't clean.''
</P>
<P>
   Proulx's compelling description and rich cadence bring Wyoming
fully alive. As city folks, however, we are probably not meant
always to get her characters' words. Sometimes what they say about
their ranches or their jobs is so obscure, it's as if they are
speaking a foreign language. What we do understand, though, is how
they come to grief trying to live their cowboy lives.
</P>
<P>
   But their grubby, gritty days are waning. Goodbye to the Old
West. Soon no one will be in Wyoming except movie stars and
telecommuters. ``Close Range'' shows us why.
</P>

ON WEEKENDS, UPS SHIPS PASSENGERS, NOT PACKAGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there is one truism in the economics of the airline industry,
it is that planes don't make money parked on the tarmac.
</P>
<P>
   That reality hits especially hard for the air freight business,
which does much of its business during the work week. Saturday and
Sunday deliveries are the exception rather than the rule.
</P>
<P>
   To extend the air time of some of its fleet, UPS each weekend
transforms some of its Boeing 727s from stripped down cargo planes,
to charter flights carrying human cargo.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers don't have to sit among overnight envelopes or carry
boxes on their laps. Instead a choreographed crew takes about four
hours to put in overhead bins, seats and even galleys.
</P>
<P>
   UPS is the only cargo company to try to adapt its planes for
such weekend use, according to the Air Transport Association, the
trade group representing most major airlines and air freight
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an interesting thing because aircraft utilization is a
big thing,'' said ATA spokesman David Fuscus. ``Cargo planes may
get an average of two or three hours a day and passenger airplanes
may get as many as 13 hours a day.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of shipping people on weekends instead of packages,
came out of a UPS employee group looking at asset utilization, said
Paul Martins, director of air charter service for UPS.
</P>
<P>
   But it took a year to go from from brainstorm to takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   First there was some design and engineering changes needed for
the five Boeing 727-100 aircraft so they could get converted each
weekend. In addition to some cockpit equipment, such as an on-board
computer that alerts pilots to other aircraft in the area and
required on passsenger planes but not cargo flights, there was the
design and cost of the overhead bins complete with emergency oxygen
masks that pop down, rows of seats and kitchens. The interiors cost
about $2.5 million per aircraft. And then there was some crew
training, after all UPS pilots do not usually make in-flight
announcements to the cargo on board, and prior to this endeavor,
they never had to worry about evacuating anyone but themselves.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the matter of flight attendants. UPS
contracts with Denver-based Inclusive Solutions Inc. to hire
experienced flight attendants. But unlike the most visible of UPS
employees, the flight attednants don't wear brown uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought about it fleetingly, but decided it would be too
dull,'' said Martins. Instead, the interior of the planes are blue
and flight attendants are dressed in blue and gold. ``It is a
vacation-mindset interior.''
</P>
<P>
   The exterior of the planes, however, do not change. The brown
stripe runs the length of the white fuselage along the window line
and the UPS logo is printed in gold on the brown empennage.
</P>
<P>
   The first flight took off in 1997 and one of the original
companies using the planes was Boston-based TNT Vacations. UPS
started flying passnger charter flights out of Logan International
Airport in 1998 and had one flight as recently as June 5. The TNT
contract has lapsed, however and both companies are in the process
of negotiating a new one.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to tour operators, other regular clients include the
White House, which charters a UPS plane to transport overflow press
on some presidental trips.
</P>
<P>
   While a Boeing 727 can seat 137 people, the 33-inch pitch in
seating _ more generous than the standard 31-inch pitch, means the
UPS planes can seat only 113 passengers. In addition, the company
spends between $7 and $8 per passenger on food, while the industry
average is about $5.
</P>
<P>
   The planes have flown more than 180,000 passengers to Florida,
the Carribean, Cancun and Costa Rica. Perhaps most impressive is
the on-time arrival rate. UPS says it is 87 percent, well above the
industry average (which was 75 perent for April of this year).
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard some of the jokes from our customers: `Do we have to
wear brown uniforms?' and `Does the plane have windows?' but as far
as service goes, both in terms of of quality and on-time
performance, they have been outstanding,'' said John Dircks, chief
operating officer of TNT Vacations.
</P>
<P>
   There is enough demand for the charter flights that two of the
five planes stay configured as passenger aircraft during the week.
The planes now fly more hours ferrying passengers than they do
cargo. They are making money for the company, but Martins would not
say what the return is.
</P>
<P>
   The operation has yet to make back the original investment of
more than $12 million in interior equipment alone. ``I don't think
anyone went in to this with the expectation we would make that back
in two years,'' said Martins. ``But we are certainly making a dent
in it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that you have to be smarter with the assets
that you own and how you can get as much bang for your buck as
possible and no airline in the world makes money when planes are
sitting on the ground.''
</P>

AGAINST THE TIDE 
The Fate of the New England Fisherman 
By Richard Adams Carey 
Houghton Mifflin, 381 pp., $23 
 
AGAINST THE TIDE 
The Battle for America's Beaches 
By Cornelia Dean 
Columbia University Press, 279 pp., illustrated, $26.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the morning tide one recent February, Richard Adams Carey
joined the crew of the Honi-Do, an all-purpose dragger out of
Chatham, Mass., in an anything's-better-than-staying-ashore run to
haul enough shrimp to pay expenses with something left over for the
mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   As they head out, Carey observes that in the 25-knot blow of the
day before, ``a piece of the beach had been stripped away'' and
that a summer house was ``sagging fatally'' into ``what Thoreau
described as . . . `the true Atlantic house, where the ocean is the
land-lord, as well as the sea-lord.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Except as the chance observation of a writer who misses nothing
and cannot resist a literary allusion, this scene has little to do
with Carey's account of four Cape Cod fishermen in the declining
years of a livelihood that is also a culture. But it neatly links
together two books which by the oddest of coincidences have been
published in the same month with the exact same title.
</P>
<P>
   In both Carey's ``Against the Tide'' and Cornelia Dean's, which
is about the threat to America's beaches, the underlying issues are
viewed as ``tragedies of the commons,'' that ecoscience formulation
in which a common good _ in one case the sea and the fish in it, in
the other the beaches _ are ruined for all by the greed of
overfishing or overdevelopment.
</P>
<P>
   Carey's account of the Honi-Do's shrimp run is a beautifully
reported set-piece, his prose bringing the reader aboard. ``Around
five o'clock the (sun had) mouldered to a purple bruise in the
west, and we finished our fourth tow in the dark, hauling the net
in the hard glare of the Honi-Do's cockpit light, the gulls
hovering in silence at the frayed edges of the darkness. `We need a
nine-box tow,' Dave said as the winches began to grind, the reel to
turn, and a drowned gull came up attached to a sweep cable, one
foot tangled between the cable and a chain link.''
</P>
<P>
   The attentive New Englander reading this does not need to be
told that this tow, like the day's others, brings up barely enough
shrimp to fill three boxes. But over the marine radio the Honi-Do's
skipper learns that back on the dock in Chatham there's a buyer for
whatever he has, and they head in, only to run hard aground on the
outer bar. ``I've got a bad feeling that we're going to eat our
catch,'' Dave mutters. For that same New England reader, hardened
by years of doom-and-gloom reports on the region's fisheries, this
shapes up as the ultimate metaphor _ the Honi-Do's crew watching
the lights of the shrimp-buyer's truck disappearing down the road.
</P>
<P>
   But the buyer stays on the dock, and the Honi-Do sells its catch
_ and that ending turns out to be the metaphor for Carey's
optimistic view of the future of the New England fisheries.
</P>
<P>
   It is a view based partly on recent legislative and regulatory
actions that promote sound ``ecosystem management'' practices, and
partly on omen _ the catch, three summers ago, of a rare golden
haddock in the nets of a New Bedford dragger. ``From such small
coincidences of beauty and fortuity,'' writes Carey, who spent a
year working with the fishermen he writes about, ``hope breathes
like a fair-weather breeze across the berths and moorings of
another generation of voyagers.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean, the science editor of the New York Times, covers
considerable territory as she details the persistent efforts of
developers and developer-prodded government agencies to ``armor''
the coast against the action of wind and waves. But ``nature,'' she
notes, usually ``has the last word,'' undercutting seawalls and
toppling houses.
</P>
<P>
   Like Carey, Dean also sees in government action a hope for the
preservation of the beaches, citing, among other cases, the
successful fight to save South Beach in 1987 _ a place which ``for
many . . . summed up what it meant to live on Martha's Vineyard.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Carey nor Dean gloats over misfortune and tragedy, but
both his overloaded scalloper Patricia Marie (which sinks with loss
of crew and catch) and her ``beachless beach towns'' along the
coast, from New Jersey south, stand as grim reminders of the
results of overfishing or overdevelopment.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what Carey and Dean have to say is _ or should be _ well
known to New England readers. Not all New Englanders, however, will
share their optimism that the fishing industry and the coastal
beaches can survive against the tides. So the vigilance of those
who care about such matters should not be lulled by that optimism
for these are still tragedies ``of the commons'' very much
occurring before our eyes and in our time.

 By CYNTHIA GORNEY  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Here is a very small story _ which we will refer to as the
Milk-Bag Incident _ set in mid-February in a public middle-school
cafeteria in Duluth, Minn.
 &HT;    Numerous schoolchildren are crowded together at tables with
their food and their milk, which in Duluth is doled out not in
cartons but in single-serving plastic bags with straws.
 &HT;    At one cafeteria table, set together in close quarters amid the
commotion: several boys, two girls, a milk bag. One of the boys
picks up the milk bag. He shapes it into a recognizable replica of
manly genitalia, including scrotum.
 &HT;    The boy announces his achievement to everyone within earshot,
which includes the girls at his table, and points out that the
genitalia he has sculptured is fully tumescent. (The boy's exact
choice of words will not be printed here, but fits into what would
probably qualify as ``age appropriate'' disgusting language for a
modern American sixth grader, which is to say: REALLY disgusting
language.)
 &HT;    The boy and his friends, brandishing the tumescent milk bag,
fall about in general hilarity. The bell rings; lunch period comes
to a close.
 &HT;    Sometime in the course of the next few days, the girls _ like
the boys, these are sixth graders, 12 years old _ appear at the
school vice principal's office to make a complaint. Do the girls
use the term ``sexual harassment''?
 &HT;    Possibly, for they have encountered these words in a
middle-school assembly and one or two contemporary novels assigned
at their grade level, but probably not Maybe they use the word
``harassment,'' or maybe ``gross.''
 &HT;    In any case they understand that there is a Procedure, and the
vice principal, having paid close attention to the training she has
received, now sets the Procedure into motion: She pulls out a
harassment complaint form.
 &HT;     (Sexual harassment, sexual advances or other forms of
religious, racial or sexual harassment by any pupil, teacher,
administrator or other school personnel, which create an
intimidating, hostile or offensive environment, will not be
tolerated under any circumstances.) 
 &HT;    Do the girls want to fill out the form and sign it? They do. She
calls up the Duluth school system harassment specialist _ a job
title that a decade ago did not exist in the Duluth public schools
_ or, for that matter, in any other U.S. school system.
 &HT;    The specialist is a small, cheerful, 58-year-old former
special-education teacher named Judy Gillen. She works out of the
Duluth school administration headquarters, in a 6-by-10-foot
office-enclosure wedged into half a small room and decorated with
teddy bears, puppets, framed photographs of her grandchildren, a
Women's History Month poster and a big bright sign, affixed to the
front of a file cabinet, that reads: SEXUAL HARASSMENT _ IT'S
ILLEGAL.
 &HT;    There also are books, pamphlets, videotape guides and visual
aids for overhead projection. ``Sexual Harassment in Our School:
What Parents and Teachers Need to Know to Spot It and Stop It.''
``Girls and Boys Getting Along: Teaching Sexual Harassment
Prevention in the Elementary Classroom.'' ``The Hostile School
Bus.'' ``Sexual Harassment: Pay Attention!''
 &HT;    There are copies of a districtwide newsletter Gillen composes,
formerly Harassment News Notes until she changed the title, in a
flush of optimism, to Prevention News Notes. And there's an active
complaints folder, where the Milk-Bag Incident harassment form will
be parked while the middle-school vice principal, with Gillen
monitoring the situation from the downtown office, considers what
to do.
 &HT;    Until late April, when the words ``student-on-student sexual
harassment'' suddenly appeared on newspaper front pages, the
Milk-Bag Incident would have provoked pretty predictable responses
in most outsiders.
 &HT;    It would have made them say: Come ON; 12-year-old girls running
straight for the office because somebody OFFENDED them, vice
principal nodding soberly and handing over FORMS to fill out _ have
these people completely lost their bearings? Or, These are
children. They're SUPPOSED to conduct themselves from time to time
like hormonally overstimulated jerks.
 &HT;    Then, on May 24, in a case called Aurelia Davis vs. Monroe
County Board of Education, the Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 that any
school receiving federal money can face a sex-discrimination suit
for failing to intervene energetically enough when a student
complains of sexual harassment by another student.
 &HT;    The Davis case started as a lawsuit brought by the mother of a
Georgia schoolgirl who was in fifth grade when she began
experiencing what her family describes as prolonged sexual
harassment _ that was the label from the outset, sexual harassment,
even though the two children involved were 10 and 11 years old _ by
the boy who sat beside her in class.
 &HT;    At the center of the typically lengthy and complicated Supreme
Court opinions was a rather remarkable and contentious
back-and-forth between Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the
majority, and Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the minority.
 &HT;    O'Connor said ``student-on-student sex harassment'' could be a
deeply serious matter, affecting a child's ability to learn;
Kennedy said ``student-on-student sex harassment'' was in essence a
phrase that made no sense. O'Connor said school officials who
ignored protracted and serious harassment could be sued under Title
IX, the federal law prohibiting sex discrimination in educational
institutions; Kennedy said the U.S. Supreme Court had no business
poking around in matters of local school discipline.
 &HT;    ``After today,'' Kennedy wrote, ``Johnny will find that the
routine problems of adolescence are to be resolved by invoking a
federal right to demand assignment to a desk two rows away.''
 &HT;    Kennedy said ``sex harassment'' is a term that properly applies
to the behavior of adults, not to children ``who are just learning
to interact with their peers.'' He said one published harassment
manual advises that one student's saying ``You look nice'' to
another could be construed as sex harassment, depending on the tone
of voice and other variables.
 &HT;    Kennedy did not say, but suggested by the indignation in some of
his memorable prose, that he believes the banner of
``student-on-student sex harassment'' is being carried at the
present time in our legal and social history by meddling,
litigation-happy, overreaching hysterics placing impossible demands
upon schools that have their hands full teaching children how to
read and write.
 &HT;    Gillen is familiar with the manual Kennedy quoted so
disapprovingly. It's called ``Flirting or Hurting?'' and has sold
about 20,000 copies to U.S. schools since it was first published in
1994. Gillen uses elements of it when she conducts sex-harassment
workshops for middle- and high-school students. The line Kennedy
lifted is part of a chart used to inspire student argument about
possible differences between flirting and harassment.
 &HT;    Flirting, suggests the chart: ''You look nice.'' ``Like your
hair.'' ``Wink.'' ``Wave.'' Harassment, suggests the chart:
``'Ho.'' ``Grab own crotch.'' ''Pinch.'' ``Lip licking.'' And
maybe, depending on the tone of voice, the facial expression and
who else is around: ``You look nice.''
 &HT;    Kennedy may have a real problem with this. So may a great many
other thoughtful people, already working hard to understand the
boundary lines defining sexual harassment among adults. But Gillen
has no problem with it.
 &HT;    ``I mean, get real,'' says Gillen, who read every word of Davis
vs. Monroe County, including the long dissent, the afternoon the
decision was handed down. ``We need to teach responsibility, we who
work directly with kids, and shaping kids' behavior and kids'
lives. Because behavior is learned. We can't accept that kind of
behavior.''
 &HT;    Quite a few public schools are consulting harassment specialists
these days. They're supposed to, or somebody will have a problem
and nobody will know what to do about it and there'll be a
complaint and state or federal investigators and a lawsuit against
the school district and maybe an expensive settlement.
 &HT;    There were at least a dozen reported lower court lawsuits even
before the Davis ruling, with its announcement that
student-to-student Title IX suits may proceed if it can be shown
that school officials exhibited ``deliberate indifference'' to sex
harassment that took place on their watch. Now there will be many
more, as school officials scramble to figure out what ``deliberate
indifference'' means.
 &HT;    Often the specialist is an outside professional who comes in
with manuals and case studies in student harassment. It's unusual
for a school district to invent a wordy systemwide job title that
includes ``Harassment Curriculum,'' but Minnesota is particularly
aggressive in what is referred to by its adherents as ``gender
equity,'' and besides, as far as is publicly known, Duluth Public
Schools was the first district in the country to pay out a monetary
settlement in a student-to-student sex harassment case.
 &HT;    Gillen knows the pertinent narratives that float up from the
central pages of many harassment lawsuits. For example, the case of
a young Wisconsin man who was recently awarded a $962,000
settlement from school officials. They were found by a jury to have
violated student's constitutional rights by failing to stop what
happened to him in junior high and high school after he
acknowledged being gay. The boy was taunted, shoved, sworn at,
laughed at, beaten up, subjected to mock rape and cornered in the
bathroom while other boys urinated on him. School administrators
were described as advising the boy's parents that trouble of this
nature is to be ``expected'' when a student is openly gay.
 &HT;    Gillens has intensely studied many other cases too: the
large-breasted California girl who was regularly greeted at the
school doorway and followed through the hall by boys making mooing
noises at her; the eighth-grade Texas girl who was repeatedly
groped on the school bus by a boy who kept demanding to know what
size bra and underpants she was wearing; the seventh-grade
California girl who became the subject of a rollicking schoolwide
rumor, spread by both boys and girls, about sexual acts performed
with hot dogs; the school bus in Minnesota _ in a district down
near Minneapolis _ in which 8-year-old girls were being urged to go
home and perform fellatio on their fathers.
 &HT;    That famous North Carolina story about the 6-year-old who was
suspended from school three years ago for kissing a classmate on
the cheek? Sure. She knows that one too.
 &HT;    Gillen rolls her eyes. ``For a while I got asked that question
just about every place I went,'' she says. ``'And what do you think
about that? How stupid can they be?' And frankly, I agreed with
them. It was stupid.''
 &HT;    For the record: The school subsequently recanted the suspension,
and the Lexington, N.C., school district revised its sex-harassment
policy to take into account the age and maturity of the accused
harasser.
 &HT;    But there's a reason people latched on with such enthusiasm to
the image of school officials banishing a 6-year-old for bussing
his classmate on the cheek: It was simple. Norman Rockwell, felled
by the overreaching hysterics. Much simpler to think about than
packs of junior-high-school boys mooing at a schoolgirl's breasts.
 &HT;    In the Davis case, what the boy accused of harassment did _ what
the Georgia school officials are accused of ignoring, despite
repeated pleas for help from the girl and her family _ was to spend
five months directly and explicitly pressuring his classmate to
have sex with him.
 &HT;    From the Davis plaintiff's brief to the Court: ``... repeatedly
attempted to touch LaShonda's breasts and vaginal area, ... told
her in vulgar terms that he want(ed), ... to get in bed with her,
... placed a doorstop in his pants and behaved in a sexually
harassing manner.''
 &HT;    All of these allegations have yet to be proved in a court of
law; the two sides in Davis were fighting about whether harassment
charges could be brought under Title IX.
 &HT;    But the suggestion that an 11-year-old boy might make advances
as crude and aggressive as a grown man's comes as no surprise to
Gillen, nor to anybody else who has read the details of those
lawsuits. Something truly has changed, she tells gatherings of the
perplexed, and it starts far younger than you think, and it's not
confined to rough inner-city schools.
 &HT;    ``The kids today are not the same kids we dealt with 15 years
ago,'' Gillen says. ``One of our assignments has been just to send
kids home to watch television for an evening, and put down hatch
marks for every swear word, every put-down, every direct sexual
reference, everything that is derogatory against another person.
And the fallout the next day is: 'Can you believe it?'''
 &HT;    Under the schoolhouse code of conduct implicit in the new
vocabulary, the girls don't get to humiliate a boy on the school
bus by speculating loudly as to the modest size of his penis
(that's from a drivers' instructional video), and boys don't get to
pass around annotated lists of the school's 25 Most (expletive)
Females (that's from an actual case brought before the Minnesota
Department of Human Rights _ the financial settlement, paid by the
school district to the senior class girl who brought the complaint,
was $40,000).
 &HT;    The expression ``boys will be boys'' frequently comes up at this
point in the discussion, even though in Gillen's experience the
perps, especially in the vicious-mouth department, are as likely as
not to be girls.
 &HT;    And Gillen's job is to answer: Not that way. Not anymore. ``It's
a whole new set of game rules,'' Gillen says. ``The fun between all
of us has sort of taken on a new dimension. You have to be so
careful. You feel like you're walking on eggs: 'If I wanted to
flirt with you, how would I go about it without offending you?' 'My
God, maybe I just better not do anything anymore.' That's been a
lot of the typical responses I've had.''
 &HT;    It's an enormously difficult thing to teach children and adults
alike a vocabulary that somehow separates benign vulgarity and
flirting from behavior that escalates into humiliation or fear. But
at its core the message Gillen _ and others like her _ has to
deliver is simpler and less elusive than many critics give it
credit for. The message is: There is a certain kind of lousy
feeling that ought not be inescapable, at least not in school, not
when adults are supposed to be watching out for you.
 &HT;    And the law has so far laid out what even the National School
Boards Association agrees is a fairly reasonable base line for
school administrators trying to avoid getting sued: Don't ignore a
complaint.
 &HT;    You must take it seriously, when they come to you with the thing
that's troubling them, and if it is bad, then you must intervene at
least actively enough to avoid being accused of ``deliberate
indifference.'' You must, at risk of a federal lawsuit charging
your school with sex harassment under Title IX, ``respond to peer
harassment in a manner that is not clearly unreasonable.''
 &HT;    So how was the Milk-Bag Incident settled? The boys at the center
of the action were summoned to the principal's office for a mild
chewing-out, told that behavior of this nature was offensive and
unacceptable in school and sentenced to an in-school suspension,
which required taking one day's classes and lunch in a detention
room.
 &HT;    The girls were told that their complaint had been attended to,
were reminded in passing to keep their language out of the gutter
too, and were given to understand what in an ideal world all
schoolchildren ought to know _ that some grown-up at school is
ready to listen, seriously, without shooing them away amid
dismissive reassurances about the inescapable parts of adolescence.
 &HT;    Repercussions? None, so far. Event over.
 &HT;    ``I think we've done an excellent job of educating kids, that
they're willing to report that,'' Gillen says. ``I don't think
we'll see those boys involved in anything again.''
 &HT;    If she's right, then maybe this is how the system, clumsy and
heavy-footed as it is, is supposed to work.

bathroom while other boys urinated on him. School administrators
were described as advising the boy's parents that trouble of this
nature is to be ``expected'' when a student is openly gay.
 &HT;    Gillens has intensely studied many other cases too: the
large-breasted California girl who was regularly greeted at the
school doorway and followed through the hall by boys making mooing
noises at her; the eighth-grade Texas girl who was repeatedly
groped on the school bus by a boy who kept demanding to know what
size bra and underpants she was wearing; the seventh-grade
California girl who became the subject of a rollicking schoolwide
rumor, spread by both boys and girls, about sexual acts performed
with hot dogs; the school bus in Minnesota _ in a district down
near Minneapolis _ in which 8-year-old girls were being urged to go
home and perform fellatio on their fathers.
 &HT;    That famous North Carolina story about the 6-year-old who was
suspended from school three years ago for kissing a classmate on
the cheek? Sure. She knows that one too.
 &HT;    Gillen rolls her eyes. ``For a while I got asked that question
just about every place I went,'' she says. ``'And what do you think
about that? How stupid can they be?' And frankly, I agreed with
them. It was stupid.''
 &HT;    For the record: The school subsequently recanted the suspension,
and the Lexington, N.C., school district revised its sex-harassment
policy to take into account the age and maturity of the accused
harasser.
 &HT;    But there's a reason people latched on with such enthusiasm to
the image of school officials banishing a 6-year-old for bussing
his classmate on the cheek: It was simple. Norman Rockwell, felled
by the overreaching hysterics. Much simpler to think about than
packs of junior-high-school boys mooing at a schoolgirl's breasts.
 &HT;    In the Davis case, what the boy accused of harassment did _ what
the Georgia school officials are accused of ignoring, despite
repeated pleas for help from the girl and her family _ was to spend
five months directly and explicitly pressuring his classmate to
have sex with him.
 &HT;    From the Davis plaintiff's brief to the Court: ``... repeatedly
attempted to touch LaShonda's breasts and vaginal area, ... told
her in vulgar terms that he want(ed), ... to get in bed with her,
... placed a doorstop in his pants and behaved in a sexually
harassing manner.''
 &HT;    All of these allegations have yet to be proved in a court of
law; the two sides in Davis were fighting about whether harassment
charges could be brought under Title IX.
 &HT;    But the suggestion that an 11-year-old boy might make advances
as crude and aggressive as a grown man's comes as no surprise to
Gillen, nor to anybody else who has read the details of those
lawsuits. Something truly has changed, she tells gatherings of the
perplexed, and it starts far younger than you think, and it's not
confined to rough inner-city schools.
 &HT;    ``The kids today are not the same kids we dealt with 15 years
ago,'' Gillen says. ``One of our assignments has been just to send
kids home to watch television for an evening, and put down hatch
marks for every swear word, every put-down, every direct sexual
reference, everything that is derogatory against another person.
And the fallout the next day is: 'Can you believe it?'''
 &HT;    Under the schoolhouse code of conduct implicit in the new
vocabulary, the girls don't get to humiliate a boy on the school
bus by speculating loudly as to the modest size of his penis
(that's from a drivers' instructional video), and boys don't get to
pass around annotated lists of the school's 25 Most (expletive)
Females (that's from an actual case brought before the Minnesota
Department of Human Rights _ the financial settlement, paid by the
school district to the senior class girl who brought the complaint,
was $40,000).
 &HT;    The expression ``boys will be boys'' frequently comes up at this
point in the discussion, even though in Gillen's experience the
perps, especially in the vicious-mouth department, are as likely as
not to be girls.
 &HT;    And Gillen's job is to answer: Not that way. Not anymore. ``It's
a whole new set of game rules,'' Gillen says. ``The fun between all
of us has sort of taken on a new dimension. You have to be so
careful. You feel like you're walking on eggs: 'If I wanted to
flirt with you, how would I go about it without offending you?' 'My
God, maybe I just better not do anything anymore.' That's been a
lot of the typical responses I've had.''
 &HT;    It's an enormously difficult thing to teach children and adults
alike a vocabulary that somehow separates benign vulgarity and
flirting from behavior that escalates into humiliation or fear. But
at its core the message Gillen _ and others like her _ has to
deliver is simpler and less elusive than many critics give it
credit for. The message is: There is a certain kind of lousy
feeling that ought not be inescapable, at least not in school, not
when adults are supposed to be watching out for you.
 &HT;    And the law has so far laid out what even the National School
Boards Association agrees is a fairly reasonable base line for
school administrators trying to avoid getting sued: Don't ignore a
complaint.
 &HT;    You must take it seriously, when they come to you with the thing
that's troubling them, and if it is bad, then you must intervene at
least actively enough to avoid being accused of ``deliberate
indifference.'' You must, at risk of a federal lawsuit charging
your school with sex harassment under Title IX, ``respond to peer
harassment in a manner that is not clearly unreasonable.''
 &HT;    So how was the Milk-Bag Incident settled? The boys at the center
of the action were summoned to the principal's office for a mild
chewing-out, told that behavior of this nature was offensive and
unacceptable in school and sentenced to an in-school suspension,
which required taking one day's classes and lunch in a detention
room.
 &HT;    The girls were told that their complaint had been attended to,
were reminded in passing to keep their language out of the gutter
too, and were given to understand what in an ideal world all
schoolchildren ought to know _ that some grown-up at school is
ready to listen, seriously, without shooing them away amid
dismissive reassurances about the inescapable parts of adolescence.
 &HT;    Repercussions? None, so far. Event over.
 &HT;    ``I think we've done an excellent job of educating kids, that
they're willing to report that,'' Gillen says. ``I don't think
we'll see those boys involved in anything again.''
 &HT;    If she's right, then maybe this is how the system, clumsy and
heavy-footed as it is, is supposed to work.

 By JAMES BENNET  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    On the windy Friday in February that the Senate acquitted her
husband of perjury and obstruction of justice, Hillary Rodham
Clinton turned her attention to her life after his presidency.
 &HT;    From before the first vote that day until long after the last,
she met with her friend Harold Ickes on the second floor of the
White House, in the family quarters, to weigh whether for the first
time to promote herself rather than Bill Clinton for public office.
 &HT;    Hillary Clinton felt flattered that Democrats were begging her
to run for the Senate from New York, an idea she had laughed off
when Rep. Charles Rangel, the mischievous Manhattan Democrat, first
suggested it in a Chicago church last October.
 &HT;    She was delighted with the shift under way in her public image,
from passive victim to political heavyweight. After all her policy
work and speechifying, it had galled her to watch her popularity
spike upward in the past year as she turned her lapidary smile to
the world and suffered through the revelations of her husband's
affair with that woman.
 &HT;    Now, for four hours, as she and Ickes _ a scarred veteran of New
York politics and a former aide to her husband _ moved from the
living room to lunch in the family dining room and back to the
living room, she plumbed the risks of a race for the Senate seat
that Daniel Patrick Moynihan had decided to vacate.
 &HT;    Would she really want to be one of a hundred senators? Could she
survive a street fight with a nasty opponent? Could she stand the
pawing of New York City's feral reporters?
 &HT;    The backing and forthing with Ickes had fitting precedent. Half
a century ago, a woman Clinton regards as a role model, Eleanor
Roosevelt, mulled running for the Senate from New York at the
prompting of a former adviser to her husband. He was also named
Harold Ickes; he was the father of Hillary Clinton's friend.
 &HT;    But like so many parallels between the century's two most
compelling first ladies, this one illuminates as many differences
as similarities. Hillary had summoned her Harold, while Eleanor was
importuned by hers. Pulled between her lofty aims and her cautious
nature, Hillary was embarking on months of painstaking cogitation,
while Eleanor almost immediately turned her Harold down.
 &HT;    ``I feel very strongly that running for office is not the way in
which I can be most useful,'' she wrote him on May 26, 1945, just
days after he raised the idea. She did not want to burden her
children with another office-holding parent. She also did not want
to burden herself with having to follow what she called ``the party
line.''
 &HT;    ``I hope to continue to work with the Democrats and for them,''
Eleanor continued briskly, ``but I think the knowledge that I will
be free of any obligation may at times be very healthy.''
 &HT;    ``Free of any obligation'' _ it is an expression lustrous with
meaning for political spouses, and particularly for first ladies of
the United States. Since Martha Washington likened herself to a
state prisoner, first ladies have felt oppressed by arranging
flowers or delivering speeches, by wielding influence or not enough
of it, by the private compromises and the planetary humiliations.
 &HT;    Eleanor Roosevelt feared continued limitation in winning office
for herself. Hillary Clinton glimpses freedom, or so her friends
and advisers say _ freedom to participate in politics fully, with
her own constituents, on her own terms, for her own purposes.
 &HT;    Hillary Clinton is about to become a liberated woman. Come
January 2001, for the first time since she moved to Arkansas as a
26-year-old lawyer in 1974, she will be able to walk her own path
regardless of her husband's political career. While most people
provided such an opening might be fantasizing about anonymity and a
long break, Clinton is methodically exploring her options for
staying in the spotlight.
 &HT;    If she does not pull out of the New York race in June, she is
likely to announce an exploratory committee in July, knowing that
that will be regarded as throwing her hat in the ring. With that
announcement, the Clintons would neatly reverse roles, at least
regarding New York. She would step forward to present herself as a
leader, while he would be relegated to behind-the-scenes,
supporting chores.
 &HT;    To be sure, since she graduated from Yale Law School and opted
for Bill Clinton and Arkansas, it has become unremarkable for women
to compete for higher office.
 &HT;    As she pondered the Senate race, Clinton was standing in the way
of another woman, Rep. Nita Lowey of Westchester County, and an
older but far less traditional political spouse, Elizabeth Dole,
was running for president.
 &HT;    Clinton's race would be path-breaking, but only because she
would be undertaking it while her husband was still in office. In
that sense, it would certainly be pioneering for Clinton and for
first ladies, but not for women generally. She is too late for
that.
 &HT;    But so what? Clinton did not sacrifice her ambition to her
husband's so much as yoke them together. As a result of that
decision, it has been her fate to be judged more for how she has
stood by her man than for what she has accomplished with him and
more for what she represents as a woman than for what she has done
as first lady.
 &HT;    As it happens, she has done quite a bit. And the flip side of
the loyal role she has played is that she regards his
accomplishments as hers too. When she was saving his presidency
last year _ condemning unnamed conspirators and then sticking with
him after he admitted they were right about his affair _ she was
also saving her own.
 &HT;    By now, Hillary Clinton is operating under the presumption that
she will run for the Senate, and she is looking for a house in
Westchester County. Her goals remain rather vague, but her ambition
for service and confidence in herself remain intact and vaulting.
It is just that Bill Clinton is no longer the best vehicle.
 &HT;    But that does not mean that she will run, and that points up
another difference between the Clintons. When it comes to politics,
he works from the gut as well as from his beloved polls, while she
is more cerebral. The risks and challenges of a race excite him.
They scare her. This is a defining life decision for her, perhaps
the biggest she has made since her marriage, and in the end she may
decide not to gamble her popularity and political clout.
 &HT;    She does not want to lose. Horse-race polls don't mean much now,
but the ones that showed her running away with victory have been
replaced by others showing at best that she might squeak by
Giuliani. And some of her advisers are more worried about a
possible challenge from Rep. Rick Lazio, the Long Island
Republican, or even Gov. George Pataki.
 &HT;    ``One of the lures of being senator is you're out on your own,''
one of her advisers told me. ''One of the liabilities is you lose
on your own.''
 &HT;    Paradoxically, Clinton's record in her husband's office is
clearest where it is least relevant to the voters who might elect
her. Far more than in the United States, Hillary Clinton has found
her own voice overseas. She has spent more days this year in North
Africa than in New York. And abroad, she conducts a sort of shadow
presidency, with advisers borrowed from assorted agencies and an
aging 707 whose port engine periodically bursts into flames.
 &HT;    She does it with what amounts to her own foreign policy,
promoting issues of women's rights, health care and development
that her husband addresses rarely, and almost always with her at
his side. In her speeches abroad, she seldom even mentions the
president, not wanting to muddy her message of female empowerment
by acknowledging that her influence derives from his power.
 &HT;    Yet Clinton's passion for that role could be a problem in New
York, where it plays into what her advisers view as her chief
liability: the suspicion that she would have her eye on concerns
far from Binghamton or the Bronx. It has probably not helped her
that in her remarks about a possible race, she has tended to dwell
on why New York is big enough for her, rather than vice versa.
 &HT;    ``New York is truly a microcosm of America,'' she recently told
reporters in Manhattan. Chuck Schumer has advised Clinton that if
she decides to run, she will have to devote herself completely to
the race. ``You can't be both first lady and candidate,'' he says.
 &HT;    As first lady, she has had two luxuries that will vanish if she
presents herself as a candidate: picking and choosing what issues
she wants to address and falling back on exhortation rather than
specific proposals to solve the problems she raises.
 &HT;    Her record of passionate concern for children would surely give
her great credibility on issues like gun violence in the schools,
which after Littleton she is turning into a crusade. (``I have not
stopped thinking about it,'' she told me.)
 &HT;    When I asked her what specifically she hopes to accomplish as a
senator or citizen, she began by replying, ``Well, you know, I'm
concerned about a broad range of issues.''
 &HT;    Then she gathered speed. ``You know, much of what I care about
falls into the broad categories of creating conditions for children
to grow up and be healthy and well educated and productive
citizens. And so that means I'm interested in everything from
economic policy to education policy to adoption and foster care and
welfare policy to health care.'' She laced her fingers together as
she added, ``I think that all of these social, political, economic,
cultural issues intersect.''
 &HT;    Clinton is widely viewed as more liberal than her husband, but
there is not much evidence to support that. In Arkansas, it was
Hillary who persuaded Bill to advocate the testing of public-school
teachers. The efficacy of the test is debatable, but there is no
question it angered some of their staunchest liberal supporters.
 &HT;    ``You know, people think she's such a big lib,'' says Maggie
Williams, Clinton's former chief of staff and one of her closest
friends. ``I think she's extremely conservative. I think she has
more in common with people in upstate New York than in New York
City, in a lot of ways.'' Williams calls Clinton ``patriotic and
practical. She thinks it's important to spend money on social
programs, but she wants to know that they work.''
 &HT;    Maybe so. But until she stands on her own politically, none of
us can know.
 &HT;    After Clinton stuck by her husband through the Lewinsky scandal,
she came to present a fat target for those who found her wanting as
a feminist. And it is hard not to wince these days over some things
she says, at times so self-righteously.
 &HT;    ``We can point to many problems around our world today where
women _ for reasons of history, culture, discrimination, prejudice
_ are used to lift up patriarchy, are used really as objects in
order for others to exercise power,'' she said in commemorating
International Women's Day this year.
 &HT;    Clinton makes no apologies for her decisions last year. In the
interview, she said at first that ``people have to make their own
judgments about that,'' but then went on to suggest they had no
business doing so. A bit paradoxically, she presented her actions
as evidence of her independence and self-sufficiency.
 &HT;    ``I would hope that young women _ women of all ages _ understand
how important it is to live your own life according to your own
values,'' she said, unspooling one of those lengthy sentences
characteristic of either Clinton, ``and not be constantly looking
over your shoulder to think what anybody else is thinking about you
or saying about you, because ultimately, at the end of the day, you
have to live with yourself and you have to do what you think is
right. And again, my choices may not be someone else's choices.''
 &HT;    When it comes to the Clintons, it is hard to separate the
personal and the political. Regardless of her feelings for him,
leaving her husband last year would have brought down a presidency
she believes in to her bones.
 &HT;    Some of the Clintons' closest associates have regarded their
relationship for years as a partnership with staged shows of
affection _ ``what they had to for the moment,'' as one of them put
it to me. Even some of Hillary Clinton's friends wonder if she will
stay with him after they leave the White House.
 &HT;    But politics did not keep the Clintons together, according to
other, closer friends of Hillary. She considered leaving him last
year, they say, but her daughter and her marriage vows stopped her.
Most important, they insist, she still loves him.
 &HT;    ``She loves him, and she doesn't have to, but she does,'' one
said. Part of the reason, this friend said, is their intellectual
bond: ``Whether you think they're changing things for better or
worse, they're always going to have something to say to each other
about it.''
 &HT;    But maybe it is time to leave wondering if the Clintons truly
love each other to the historians and to focus on the
accomplishments, failures and ideas that define his presidency and
would define her Senate race.
 &HT;    If Clinton runs, she is likely to limit her husband's role,
though he will try to meddle. Indeed, it has not escaped some of
her friends that being forced onto the sidelines would be
excruciating punishment for him, as, without a campaign of his own,
he watches his wife and his vice president run.
 &HT;    But Hillary Clinton wants to find out what she can do on her
own, they say. Further, having her husband front and center would
make her look weak.
 &HT;    And therein lies a delightful switch. For years, White House
aides have praised Hillary Clinton's ability and contributions
while in the next breath minimizing her influence in order to build
up the president. Now, Hillary's allies are unself-consciously
treating her husband the same way.
 &HT;    ``She'd be a fool not to work with him very closely on this,''
one of them told me. ``It will, however, be Hillary Rodham
Clinton's campaign. It'll be her voice, and it'll be her persona. I
see him playing very much a behind-the-scenes role.''

They scare her. This is a defining life decision for her, perhaps
the biggest she has made since her marriage, and in the end she may
decide not to gamble her popularity and political clout.
 &HT;    She does not want to lose. Horse-race polls don't mean much now,
but the ones that showed her running away with victory have been
replaced by others showing at best that she might squeak by
Giuliani. And some of her advisers are more worried about a
possible challenge from Rep. Rick Lazio, the Long Island
Republican, or even Gov. George Pataki.
 &HT;    ``One of the lures of being senator is you're out on your own,''
one of her advisers told me. ''One of the liabilities is you lose
on your own.''
 &HT;    Paradoxically, Clinton's record in her husband's office is
clearest where it is least relevant to the voters who might elect
her. Far more than in the United States, Hillary Clinton has found
her own voice overseas. She has spent more days this year in North
Africa than in New York. And abroad, she conducts a sort of shadow
presidency, with advisers borrowed from assorted agencies and an
aging 707 whose port engine periodically bursts into flames.
 &HT;    She does it with what amounts to her own foreign policy,
promoting issues of women's rights, health care and development
that her husband addresses rarely, and almost always with her at
his side. In her speeches abroad, she seldom even mentions the
president, not wanting to muddy her message of female empowerment
by acknowledging that her influence derives from his power.
 &HT;    Yet Clinton's passion for that role could be a problem in New
York, where it plays into what her advisers view as her chief
liability: the suspicion that she would have her eye on concerns
far from Binghamton or the Bronx. It has probably not helped her
that in her remarks about a possible race, she has tended to dwell
on why New York is big enough for her, rather than vice versa.
 &HT;    ``New York is truly a microcosm of America,'' she recently told
reporters in Manhattan. Chuck Schumer has advised Clinton that if
she decides to run, she will have to devote herself completely to
the race. ``You can't be both first lady and candidate,'' he says.
 &HT;    As first lady, she has had two luxuries that will vanish if she
presents herself as a candidate: picking and choosing what issues
she wants to address and falling back on exhortation rather than
specific proposals to solve the problems she raises.
 &HT;    Her record of passionate concern for children would surely give
her great credibility on issues like gun violence in the schools,
which after Littleton she is turning into a crusade. (``I have not
stopped thinking about it,'' she told me.)
 &HT;    When I asked her what specifically she hopes to accomplish as a
senator or citizen, she began by replying, ``Well, you know, I'm
concerned about a broad range of issues.''
 &HT;    Then she gathered speed. ``You know, much of what I care about
falls into the broad categories of creating conditions for children
to grow up and be healthy and well educated and productive
citizens. And so that means I'm interested in everything from
economic policy to education policy to adoption and foster care and
welfare policy to health care.'' She laced her fingers together as
she added, ``I think that all of these social, political, economic,
cultural issues intersect.''
 &HT;    Clinton is widely viewed as more liberal than her husband, but
there is not much evidence to support that. In Arkansas, it was
Hillary who persuaded Bill to advocate the testing of public-school
teachers. The efficacy of the test is debatable, but there is no
question it angered some of their staunchest liberal supporters.
 &HT;    ``You know, people think she's such a big lib,'' says Maggie
Williams, Clinton's former chief of staff and one of her closest
friends. ``I think she's extremely conservative. I think she has
more in common with people in upstate New York than in New York
City, in a lot of ways.'' Williams calls Clinton ``patriotic and
practical. She thinks it's important to spend money on social
programs, but she wants to know that they work.''
 &HT;    Maybe so. But until she stands on her own politically, none of
us can know.
 &HT;    After Clinton stuck by her husband through the Lewinsky scandal,
she came to present a fat target for those who found her wanting as
a feminist. And it is hard not to wince these days over some things
she says, at times so self-righteously.
 &HT;    ``We can point to many problems around our world today where
women _ for reasons of history, culture, discrimination, prejudice
_ are used to lift up patriarchy, are used really as objects in
order for others to exercise power,'' she said in commemorating
International Women's Day this year.
 &HT;    Clinton makes no apologies for her decisions last year. In the
interview, she said at first that ``people have to make their own
judgments about that,'' but then went on to suggest they had no
business doing so. A bit paradoxically, she presented her actions
as evidence of her independence and self-sufficiency.
 &HT;    ``I would hope that young women _ women of all ages _ understand
how important it is to live your own life according to your own
values,'' she said, unspooling one of those lengthy sentences
characteristic of either Clinton, ``and not be constantly looking
over your shoulder to think what anybody else is thinking about you
or saying about you, because ultimately, at the end of the day, you
have to live with yourself and you have to do what you think is
right. And again, my choices may not be someone else's choices.''
 &HT;    When it comes to the Clintons, it is hard to separate the
personal and the political. Regardless of her feelings for him,
leaving her husband last year would have brought down a presidency
she believes in to her bones.
 &HT;    Some of the Clintons' closest associates have regarded their
relationship for years as a partnership with staged shows of
affection _ ``what they had to for the moment,'' as one of them put
it to me. Even some of Hillary Clinton's friends wonder if she will
stay with him after they leave the White House.
 &HT;    But politics did not keep the Clintons together, according to
other, closer friends of Hillary. She considered leaving him last
year, they say, but her daughter and her marriage vows stopped her.
Most important, they insist, she still loves him.
 &HT;    ``She loves him, and she doesn't have to, but she does,'' one
said. Part of the reason, this friend said, is their intellectual
bond: ``Whether you think they're changing things for better or
worse, they're always going to have something to say to each other
about it.''
 &HT;    But maybe it is time to leave wondering if the Clintons truly
love each other to the historians and to focus on the
accomplishments, failures and ideas that define his presidency and
would define her Senate race.
 &HT;    If Clinton runs, she is likely to limit her husband's role,
though he will try to meddle. Indeed, it has not escaped some of
her friends that being forced onto the sidelines would be
excruciating punishment for him, as, without a campaign of his own,
he watches his wife and his vice president run.
 &HT;    But Hillary Clinton wants to find out what she can do on her
own, they say. Further, having her husband front and center would
make her look weak.
 &HT;    And therein lies a delightful switch. For years, White House
aides have praised Hillary Clinton's ability and contributions
while in the next breath minimizing her influence in order to build
up the president. Now, Hillary's allies are unself-consciously
treating her husband the same way.
 &HT;    ``She'd be a fool not to work with him very closely on this,''
one of them told me. ``It will, however, be Hillary Rodham
Clinton's campaign. It'll be her voice, and it'll be her persona. I
see him playing very much a behind-the-scenes role.''

CITIZENS, UST CHIEFS WERE DRIVEN TO GET DEAL DONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What drove UST Corp. and Citizens Financial Group into each
other's arms? The answer was just a few blocks away from Citizens'
Boston headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   In this region, at this time, everything that has to do with
banking takes place in the shadow cast by the pending merger of
Fleet Financial Group and BankBoston Corp. The coming divestiture
of more than 200 branches and $12 billion on deposit at Fleet or
BankBoston looms as an event that will affect every banking
competitor in New England.
</P>
<P>
   UST chief Neal Finnegan argues that he might have made the same
deal with Citizens chairman Lawrence Fish absent the daunting
backdrop. Perhaps sometime, but probably not right now.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.4 billion price tag, good but not extravagant, is an
indication that Citizens and UST truly need each other at this
moment. Both banks could have been hurt in the Fleet/BankBoston
divestiture if they stood alone. Together, they are assured a much
stronger position no matter how the divestiture bidding unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens could have soon turned into a number three competitor
by some measures if a big national bank won all or nearly all of
the divested business. A giant Fleet-BankBoston would dominate New
England and some other company would be viewed as the primary
banking alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't let that happen,'' said Fish. ``Couldn't.
Wouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   UST brought its investment bankers in to survey all of the
options as soon as the Fleet-BankBoston deal was announced.
Standing still was not an option.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became very clear that making a deal with another company
made the most sense and Citizens was the most attractive,'' said
Finnegan.
</P>
<P>
   UST and Citizens began to talk about six weeks ago, two months
after the Fleet-BankBoston announcement, and the deal was done by
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The sale is the last leg in an impressive comeback for UST,
which recovered from serious loan problems in the early 1990s.
Finnegan, a longtime Shawmut executive who later worked for Bankers
Trust in New York, was recruited to run the company after efforts
to sell it failed to attract an acceptable offer in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Finnegan grew UST through several acquisitions and the purchase
of branches divested in another local merger, BankBoston's purchase
of BayBanks Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the upcoming Fleet-BankBoston divestiture,
conducted by the companies with the Department of Justice looking
over their shoulders, will probably be announced in July or August.
Final bids are weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   Three possible decisions seem most likely: a big bidder winning
the entire package; big winners in each of the states where
branches will be sold (Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode
Island); or one dominant winner with some piece of the business
carved out for small banks.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome that most worries Fish and Finnegan _ a national
bank winning the entire divestiture package _ is no longer such a
severe threat. A combined Citizens/UST will control more than twice
the deposits to be divested by Fleet and BankBoston, and more than
three times the loans.
</P>
<P>
   But UST will bring more than branches, deposits, and consumer
loans to Citizens. Its longstanding commercial lending operation to
small- and middle-market businesses is an important building block.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens grew through the 1990s mostly as a savings bank serving
retail consumers. It tried to generate its own commercial lending
business with tepid results, later acquiring more capacity when it
bought First NH in New Hampshire three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The pace has picked up very recently. Just last month, Citizens
spent $350 million to acquire the commercial business of State
Street Corp. and its $2.2 billion portfolio of loans. Add UST's
operations and Citizens has dramatically improved its standing as a
commercial lender in short order.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens, which is owned by the Royal Bank of Scotland, has no
publicly traded stock of its own and pays cash when it buys a bank.
That usually means Citizens is spending money out of its parent's
pocket _ and this time it dug deep for UST.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens has purchased 14 New England banks since 1992 for a
combined $1.5 billion. The UST deal, for $1.4 billion, will nearly
double that figure in a single transaction. It is about twice as
expensive as its largest previous purchase, the $710 million
acquisition of First NH.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the Royal has spent money to make money.
Citizens, which started as a modest American subsidiary, accounts
for 25 to 30 percent of its parent's profits today.
</P>
<P>
   That's as good a reason as any to pony up for a deal that will
help protect its American franchise against the threat posed by the
Fleet-BankBoston divestiture.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is always the possibility that Citizens will
actually win a part of the divestiture package. Combined with the
other recent deals, it could turn out to be a transforming period
for the Citizens franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Fish is coy about his interest, if any, in the divestiture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to wait and see,'' he said. ``We'll stick
around.''

STOCK SALES AMONG GOOD ECONOMIC SIGNS FOR SOCCER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The soccer economy appears to be still growing. Two weeks ago,
when Christian Vieri was transferred to Inter from Lazio for $48
million, even high-powered agents in Italy expressed shock.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Lazio is negotiating a deal worth nearly $90 million,
including salary and ``miscellaneous fees,'' for Arsenal's Nicholas
Anelka.
</P>
<P>
   As inflated as these prices appear to be, they will likely
continue to increase as revenue streams continue to open. Lazio
S.p.A. became the first club to be quoted on the Italian stock
exchange, and president Sergio Cragnotti made moves to establish
the team among the elite in Serie A. Many teams in England have
gone public.
</P>
<P>
   In Spain, Barcelona concluded a deal with Via Digital e
Telefonica for television rights worth nearly $500 million for
2003-08.
</P>
<P>
   And in England, a financial firm predicted that Manchester
United's value would increase to about $3 billion in five years.
Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB recently bid $1.06 billion for Manchester
United, so upsetting fans and minority stockholders that they
successfully blocked the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hands-off approach
</P>
<P>
   One team that will miss out on the financial advantages is
Obilic, the Belgrade club controlled by Zeljko Raznatovic, better
known by his nom de guerre, Arkan. Obilic has been prevented from
playing in the UEFA Cup, despite finishing second to Partizan in
the Yugoslavian League, because Arkan has been accused of crimes
against humanity. Also, the French club Bordeaux ended negotiations
for an Obilic player, Ivan Vukomanovic, signaling the start of an
informal commercial boycott of the club. Obilic's national team
players, Nenad Grozdic and Nenad Lukic, likely could also have
attracted interest.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Going gets rough
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiras coach Luiz Felipe Scolari attained the results he
promised upon being hired in 1997, leading the team to the Copa
Libertadores title and a date with Manchester United in the Toyota
Cup in Tokyo in December.
</P>
<P>
   But Scolari's ultra-pragmatic style has caused problems in
Brazil. Palmeiras had a player ejected in losing to Corinthians in
the Sao Paulo championship final Sunday. When Cleber was red-carded
in the 21st minute, he became the 11th Palmeiras expulsion in 14
matches. But instead of taking further action, referee Paulo Cesar
de Oliveira simply whistled the match to a halt after an
altercation in the 30th minute of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Corinthians won the first leg, 3-0, and had tied the second on a
goal by Edilson in the 29th minute of the second half. But Edilson
then provoked the Palmeiras team, leading to a brawl.
</P>
<P>
   Edilson paid a high price for his involvement. He was dropped
from the national team by coach Wanderley Luxemburgo and will not
play in Copa America, which starts next week in Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He's on the mark
</P>
<P>
   Milton resident Dick Johnson was among the most prescient of
those involved in women's soccer in the US when he promoted the New
England Sports Museum Challenge Cup in 1991. Johnson, director of
the museum, not only attracted crowds that shocked US Soccer
Federation officials, he also anticipated the finalists in the
first Women's World Cup: Norway and the US. The Norwegians won both
Challenge Cup matches, 1-0 before 5,563 in New Britain, Conn., Aug.
30, and 2-1 before 4,758 at Tufts University Sept. 1. The night
before the Tufts match, Norway's 16-year-old goalkeeper Bente
Nordby suffered an appendicitis attack and was rushed to Mt. Auburn
Hospital. Nordby then held the US to a Kristine Lilly goal and has
kept the starting position through Norway's 2-1 win over Russia at
Foxboro Stadium Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The color purple
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Renegades paid tribute to fired coach Rick Copland by
wearning purple ribbons in their game last Friday. Kara Brown
scored as the Renegades, under interim coach Peter Bradley, took a
1-0 victory over the Springfield Sirens in a W League match before
1,800 spectators at Bowditch Field in Framingham.
</P>
<P>
   Copland, who guided the Renegades to a 13-3 record, including a
loss in the league final last year, had been fired earlier in the
week after a dispute with chief operating officer Farrukh Quraishi.
The Renegades, in third place in the Northern Division with a 6-3-1
record, visit the Laval Dynamite Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Copland coached Charles River United to a 3-2 win
over the Boston Bolts in the Under-18 State championship game
Sunday to qualify for the Northeast regional tournament starting
July 3 in Kingston, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clock watching
</P>
<P>
   The MLS competition committee should take a lesson from the
Women's World Cup. In every game, the clock counts up and the
official time is kept by the referee. This is a very simple system,
universally applied, and appreciated and understood by 5-year-olds,
teenagers, and pensioners of both sexes.
</P>
<P>
   An incident that decided the D.C. United-Los Angeles Galaxy game
Saturday indicates the committee understands neither the game of
soccer nor how to promote a new league.
</P>
<P>
   With six seconds remaining in a 1-1 game, United's Geoff Aunger
pulled down Greg Vanney. Chinese referee Baojie Sun called a direct
free kick. The clock was stopped by a ``fifth official,'' allowing
Mauricio Cienfuegos to line up the kick, which he converted for a
2-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The first lesson is that the referee, and only the referee,
should be allowed to terminate the match. The clock should run to
45 minutes in each half, then the referee decides the stoppage
time. If others are allowed to make crucial decisions, the
referee's authority becomes usurped, and the door becomes open to
even more outside interference in what is a very simple game.
</P>
<P>
   The second lesson is that if someone else is going to control
the clock, at least do so in favor of the home team.
</P>
<P>
   Said United coach Thomas Rongen, ``This is one of the reasons
that we're not taken seriously by the rest of the world
sometimes.''

   You've got Charles Schwab. Merrill Lynch. Morningstar. Albert
Belle.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Belle?
</P>
<P>
   That's right. The enigmatic Baltimore Orioles outfielder, who
signed a five-year, $65 million deal in December, has been doling
out financial advice at his Athlete Direct site (keyword: ADsports)
since its launch on America Online two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Belle, who as usual is throwing temper tantrums and refusing to
talk with reporters this season, has been directing anyone seeking
his comment _ writers or otherwise _ to his AOL site the past three
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   True to his word, Belle posts an explanation about why he was
upset for being replaced in the ninth inning of a recent game.
Orioles manager Ray Miller benched Belle for not running out a
ground ball, and Belle later responded by shouting expletives at
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, Belle doesn't raise his voice at his site. The only
sound the site emits is a welcome clip by Belle.
</P>
<P>
   His financial advice is only a small part of his site, but
considering that he's not exactly people-friendly, it is worth
noting. Belle's recommendations are standard and come with a
disclaimer, but he also advises that investors try speculative
investments, such as Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   Belle's site also includes an interactive crossword puzzle and a
youth-oriented cartoon series featuring an animated Belle dressed
as a superhero. Fans also can buy the fat-free corn flakes that
Belle markets for charity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different perspective of Albert that he usually doesn't
get from the media because he doesn't talk to the press,'' said
Ross Schaufelberger, president of Los Angeles-based Athlete Direct.
</P>
<P>
   Belle works closely with his brother Terry, a financial analyst,
to develop the site's content, Schaufelberger said.
</P>
<P>
   Athlete Direct also produces commercial sites for Cowboys
quarterback Troy Aikman, Stars goalie Ed Belfour and Rangers
catcher Pudge Rodriguez. Belle's site is among the three
most-visited sites for baseball players, Schaufelberger said. A
recent visit to the site's message board shows nothing but
pro-Belle posts.
</P>
<P>
   Belle's site also has an Ask Albert section where fans can
e-mail questions, which begs the question: Does Belle actually
respond?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, definitely,'' Schaufelberger said. ``We've been happy with
his popularity.''
</P>
<P>
   You might want to get a second opinion on Belle's financial
tips, however.
</P>

VETERAN MIDFIELDER PROVIDES THE FOCUS FOR US SQUAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LISLE, Ill. _ The photographs are almost always the same.
Captured at the center of a midfield goal celebration is Mia Hamm.
Members of the US team with broad smiles surround her. They have
their arms around each other in a jubilant, jumping hug. And almost
always Kristine Lilly is there, standing with her back to the
cameras, face obscured. In the moment of arrested joy, the
midfielder is identifiable only by her No. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Whether in mid-celebration or the middle of a difficult workout,
Lilly does not cut an inposing figure. A slight 5 feet 4 inches,
125 pounds with a straight-to-the-point demeanor and a reputation
for consistent rather than spectacular play, she does not attract
the attention her more famous teammates do. That's fine.
</P>
<P>
   The player with the most international soccer appearances in
world history always has known how to make her presence felt.
</P>
<P>
   The Queen of Caps has saved her biggest statements for the field
and the record books. On May 21, 1998, in Kobe, Japan, she played
in her 152d international match and passed Norway's Heidi Store.
Lilly now has 181 career caps and counting. But the figure becomes
more impressive when you learn just what representing your country
181 times means over a 12-year career. Through 1998, the veteran
had appeared in 87 percent of the games played by the US women's
national team in its history. Also by the end of 1998, Lilly had
started in all but four of her international appearances and played
a full 90 minutes in 134 of her then-record 163 games. She has
played more than 1,000 minutes on the US team for six consecutive
years and ranks as the Americans' all-time leader in minutes
played.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when people ask about it, I think about how many
(caps) there are,'' said Lilly. ``I can't even believe it. I never
counted how many or kept track of how many games I played. Every
once in a while I look back and I think, `Holy cow, I've been doing
this for a while.' And the body keeps reminding me every so
often.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet if the US opener against Denmark provides any indication,
the 27-year-old attacking midfielder may play her best soccer in
the 1999 Women's World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   When the US needed an offensive spark and with young striker
Cindy Parlow struggling against the Danes, Lilly moved from the
midfield to forward in the second half. She proved the switch a
smart decision after launching a leftfooted shot from the top of
the box and tucking the ball just inside the left post in the 89th
minute.
</P>
<P>
   Up front, Lilly provides a lot of mobility and can showcase her
strength, which is movement off the ball. Depending on the opponent
she can find more room to maneuver at forward or be more productive
starting the offense from midfield. In the second half Saturday,
she found the seams in the Danish defense, saw lots of touches on
the ball, and worked well with Hamm and Tiffeny Millbrett leading
the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The versatility demonstrated by Lilly should be an important
asset as the US prepares for two teams it has never faced before _
Nigeria and North Korea. Although known as the world's best flank
midfielder before a recent move to attacking midfielder, she has
seen significant time at forward this year. Monday, coach Tony
DiCicco did not know if Lilly would remain at forward or return to
her midfielder position. But even as attacking midfielder she
utilizes her speed and fitness, covering a lot of ground and
frequently joining the attack. Regardless of her place on the
field, DiCicco and the US team know they can depend on Lilly not
just to show up, but contribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm delighted that she had an excellent game in the first game
of the World Cup and I hope she has her best games from here on
in,'' said DiCicco. ``She deserves to have a World Cup that
distinguishes her in everyone's mind as one of the very best that's
ever played the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Added cocaptain Julie Foudy: ``Lil's unbelievable, the most
capped player in the world and I would say in every single one of
those games she's had a presence. That's so hard to say for any
player at any level. She's so consistent. If I could point to one
player, it's Kristine who I would take day-in and day-out becaue
she's always going to be there. You know when you walk onto the
field that she's going to be battling right next to you. If she
scores, great. If not, you know she's going to be creating a lot of
things just with her mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   Her teammates realize that Lilly has quietly built a career
filled with personal milestones and historic accomplishments. It's
often said that she is the most respected member of the national
team for her caps, commitment, and longevity.
</P>
<P>
   When Lilly first played for the national team as a 16-year-old
in China, she wasn't quite sure what she had gotten herself into.
The player raised in the suburban soccer preserve of Wilton, Conn.,
claims that at the time she was called to duty, she didn't even
know the national team existed. Now like so many of her veteran
teammates, who won the 1991 World Cup title in China in relative
obscurity and Olympic gold with fanfare but little respect from
NBC, Lilly stands as a prime example of how far women's soccer has
come.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been waiting for this moment,'' she said. ``We've been
waiting for big crowds. We've been waiting for media to come out
and support us. Thank God it's happened because this is what we've
been waiting for.''
</P>
<P>
   After 181 international appearances, it appears the Queen of
Caps finally has her chance to hold court.

BOERNE'S 150TH ANNIVERSARY PROMPTS RENEWED INTEREST IN TOWN'S
HERITAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While Ripley Arnold and his dragoons were swatting mosquitoes on
the banks of the Trinity and building Fort Worth, a group of German
settlers was chiseling away at the limestone rocks of the Texas
Hill Country, trying to establish Boerne almost 300 miles to the
south.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1849 and the Germans were spreading out over the Hill
Country. They had flooded in from an impoverished homeland where
only the wealthy could look forward to getting wealthier.
Intellectuals had no place in the German economic struggle, and
religion was a cause for persecution.
</P>
<P>
   They were deceived about Texas, told that there was abundant
land for everyone, plenty of crops, plenty of freedoms. They were
not told that the land was actually inhabited by very angry
Comanches who were stubbornly reluctant to give it up.
</P>
<P>
   As Boerne celebrates its 150th anniversary this year, it is
trying to tell the story of the early settlers, and it is
struggling to prove that it is not merely a bedroom community for
nearby San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   It should be said, however, that the later mission is made
harder with the ``Go Spurs Go'' signs that populate almost all
Boerne stores, and the red and black Spurs flags that fly from
nearly every passing car.
</P>
<P>
   ``The locals here don't like the term `bedroom community,'''
said Bettie Edmonds, a retired Air Force colonel and Boerne
historian. ``We've tried hard to keep our own identity, but it has
been tough the past 10 years or so. The Texas Hill Country is very
popular now and people are moving here from all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Boerne's growth is generally attributed to Interstate 10. When
the town was established, it took two days to get to San Antonio;
now it's 30 minutes, tops.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Edmonds pointed out, Wal-Mart inadvertently caused a boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Wal-Mart came in the early 1980s, it decimated
downtown,'' she said. ``It ran some of the mom and pop businesses
out and left 25 or 30 buildings vacant.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened then transformed the sleepy town into one of the
hottest tourist stops in the chalky hills. In a word _ antiques.
</P>
<P>
   From the tiny town of Evant, down through Lampasas, Marble
Falls, Johnson City, and on from Llano, to Fredericksburg and
Kerrville, antiques are the life's blood of the hills. It seems at
times that workers must be laboring day and night to create all
these antiques.
</P>
<P>
   When the affected businesses packed up and fled the Wal-Mart
shadow in Boerne, antique stores instantly filled the vacuum. Now,
quaint stores, eateries, gift shops and inns populate Main Street
and welcome the hordes of vacationers who hop from town to town in
search of treasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least we've been able to keep the old architecture,''
Edmonds said. ``People are restoring the old buildings and adapting
them for modern use. We continue to get historical markers for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   And, she insisted, the 150th anniversary is bringing the town
closer to its roots. The year-long celebration has made people
aware of their local heritage. It has made them aware that Boerne
is more than a bedroom community.

CALIFORNIA TEACHING ASSISTANTS VOTE TO UNIONIZE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Teaching assistants on all eight University of
California campuses have voted to unionize under the United Auto
Workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge victory,'' said Berkeley graduate assistant
Ricardo Ochoa, president of UAW Local 2165. ``We've been fighting
for union representation for 16 years. It's been a long battle.''
</P>
<P>
   The university system's 8,400 teaching assistants, plus 1,200
readers and tutors, voted for unionization by a 68 percent majority
Monday, with a voter turnout of 55 percent, according to a final
tabulation of election results at six campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Academic student employees at the Berkeley and Los Angeles
campuses voted to unionize last spring.
</P>
<P>
   The system's teaching assistants are undergraduate and graduate
students who work as teachers. They account for more than half of
the actual instruction at University of California campuses. They
work 20-hour weeks for the nine-month academic year and earn
$13,600 _ if hired for two semesters _ plus benefits, said
University of California spokesman Brad Hayward.
</P>
<P>
   The system resisted unionization strenuously but was forced to
accede to the representation elections by pressure from the
Legislature and a decision last December by the state Public
Employment Relations Board. The board determined that teaching
assistants, tutors and readers have bargaining rights as employees.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblywoman Dion Aroner, a Democrat from Oakland, said she
doubted the university system would have agreed to go forward with
the elections without legislative pressure, notably from Senate
President pro tem John Burton, a Democrat from San Francisco, and
Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, a Democrat from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told them that if they had not come to an agreement to
allow for the elections that we were going to put pressure on their
budget,'' Aroner said. ``It's very disconcerting that public
dollars were being used to fight unions.''
</P>
<P>
   Collective bargaining for readers and tutors is under way at
Berkeley and for teaching assistants at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   The Public Employment Relations Board finished counting the
ballots for the other six teaching campuses Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Bargaining will be conducted by teams elected by the bargaining
unit's membership on each campus.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW also represents graduate teaching assistants at two
University of Massachusetts campuses and has petitioned the
National Labor Relations Board for elections at the State
University of New York campuses.

 By VERLYN KLINKENBORG  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    The architecture of Dan Hinkley's garden on the Kitsap Peninsula
in Washington State is native, shaped by old Douglas firs and a
seeping bog.
 &HT;    But in the cultivated understory, he has convened plants from
all around the globe, reuniting the tribes of the botanical
diaspora. More than 50 kinds of arisaemas _ called
jack-in-the-pulpit in North America _ rocket from the soil, and
one, Arisaema nepenthoides, stands fully erect, a single cobralike
spathe beside a rotting stump crowned with ferns.
 &HT;    Thirty-five varieties of Solomon's seals, or polygonatums, from
China, Japan, Taiwan, Nepal and Sikkim unspiral from their early
growth, and dozens of types of hellebore have just passed their
prime.
 &HT;    Throughout the garden, hydrangeas and viburnums are beginning to
dispense their leaves; Stachyurus and Edgeworthia, winter-flowering
shrubs from Asia, are leafing out. On some loops of the garden
trail, where a Cardiocrinum giganteum thrusts its antediluvian
seedpod six feet into the air, you almost expect to see a dinosaur
wander past. Bud-break has stirred among an orderly chaos of
growth-forms.
 &HT;    The man behind this collection of plants is Daniel Hinkley, a
45-year-old native of northern Michigan who has come to be regarded
as one of the pre-eminent plant explorers in the world. Hinkley is
the co-owner and chief plantsman of Heronswood Nursery, started in
1987, which lies within the visual domain of the Olympic Mountains
across Puget Sound from Seattle.
 &HT;    Heronswood is Hinkley's personal garden, his trial garden and a
two-and-a-half-acre commercial nursery rolled in one. It's also
Hinkley's home, which he shares with his partner, Robert Jones, an
architect who is to the mailing list, the account books and the
commercial operations at Heronswood what Hinkley is to the plants.
 &HT;    Here are more than 9,500 plants sprung from seed gathered all
over the world. Most are numbered and listed in a loose-leaf binder
that Hinkley calls the Big Bang, a compilation of plants already
for sale and those that someday will be. The binder listing current
inventory is called the Grand Mal. To most gardeners, the plants on
these lists would be unfamiliar.
 &HT;    Instead of the classic Hosta ``Frances Williams,'' for instance,
there is Hosta kiyosumiensis, which Hinkley collected from Mount
Kiyosume in Japan's Chiba Prefecture in 1995. Instead of hybridized
Asiatic and Oriental lilies, there is Lilium nanum, collected by
Hinkley during a joint expedition to the Himalayas in 1995.
 &HT;    Instead of a Norway maple or a David Austin rose, there is Acer
rufinerve, a striped-bark maple he gathered in central Japan in
1997, and a rose of as yet undetermined species collected from an
altitude of 10,800 feet in China's Yunnan province in 1996.
 &HT;    From this garden each year also comes the Heronswood catalogue,
a major literary artifact in the world of gardening ephemera.
Printed solidly in small type, it begins with Hinkley's wry musings
on the imperfect art of running a mail-order nursery and ends 300
pages and some 2,500 plants later.
 &HT;    The catalogue is a saga of botanical excitement and a chronicle
of adjectival fatigue, the fate of a man driven to travel the world
searching for remarkable plants and then doomed to write a terse,
descriptive paragraph about one $6 or $8 clone after another,
beginning with Abies balsamea ``Nana'' in the ``Conifers'' section
and ending with the New Zealand sedge Uncinia unciniata, the final
plant in the section on grasses.
 &HT;    Though it advertises nowhere and admits visitors only by
appointment, Heronswood Nursery mailed 35,000 copies of the 1999
catalogue, and subscription requests are currently arriving at the
rate of 100 a week. At $8 for a two-year subscription, the
catalogue just pays for itself, unless you count the cost of
Hinkley's writing time, in which case it is grossly underpriced.
 &HT;    Subscribers pleasantly lost among Hinkley's paragraphs can be
forgiven for wondering whether the nursery exists to justify the
catalogue, or vice versa. Still, appealing to a newly adventurous
generation of gardeners, Heronswood was an almost instant success.
In 1993, the year after it incorporated, it had a gross income of
$220,000. In 1998, it was five times larger, $1,100,000.
 &HT;    These days, as Robert Jones says, he and Hinkley are trying to
choose their limits, trying to let Hinkley's interests, rather than
mere economic growth, continue to shape their offerings.
 &HT;    At Heronswood, mid-April is the peak of the spring
plant-shipping season. Overworked staff members try to meet the
florid expectations of gardeners by selling them plants that are
not only garden-worthy but that also carry, for many customers, an
echo of the exotic places where Hinkley has collected _ Nepal,
Sikkim, China, Japan, Korea, Tasmania, Mexico and Chile.
 &HT;    The nursery office, an attractive prairie farmhouse of sorts, is
surrounded by open shade-canopies sheltering tables crowded with
flats, each marked with a customer's name and shipping date.
 &HT;    Hinkley's Michigan drawl crackles over a walkie-talkie clipped
to a plant-packer's belt. Concealed somewhere in the woodland
garden, he is the ghost in this botanic machine, enjoying a 10-day
respite from a busy spring speaking schedule and preparing for a
collecting trip to Japan.
 &HT;    A path leads into the benign enveloping shade characteristic of
the Northwest woods. The light falling on the mounded garden beds
seems detached from its source, and what it illuminates has a
freshness that is an attribute of the early season and of the
vegetation itself. A hundred yards down the path, Hinkley works in
mottled shade helping a new crew member shovel steer manure from a
garden cart onto a planting site.
 &HT;    Hinkley speaks quietly, slowly, but there is a sense of haste
about him, the result of living in what he calls ``a perfect
madness of plants,'' a garden that needs to be brought into peak
condition within the next few weeks. ``At this point it feels like
it's moving day,'' he says.
 &HT;    ``But as long as I keep bringing new plants into trial, it's
always going to be like this. I get tired of one plant, or it's
just not doing for me, so I get rid of it and start over again. But
every time you do that you want to rejuvenate the soil, and to do
that you've got to move another plant.''
 &HT;    Hinkley kneels on the ground, chopping at the soil with a border
spade and looking up from time to time as he talks. He is direct
and delicate at the same time, handling plants with none of the
hesitation of the amateur gardener. He overflows with affection for
the garden he has made, and yet his criticism of each individual
plant-form _ a kind of veiled self-criticism in fact _ is
unsparing.
 &HT;    Hinkley is bearded and balding, and he wears wide suspenders
over a T-shirt from the J.C. Raulston Arboretum at North Carolina
State University. Raulston, who died at 56 in a car accident three
years ago, was one of Hinkley's mentors and a widely respected
emblem of intellectual and horticultural generosity.
 &HT;    Hinkley has dedicated his next book, ``The Explorer's Garden,''
which Timber Press will publish in the fall, to Raulston and to
Gerald Straley of the University of British Columbia, another
gardening mentor who died in his 50s.
 &HT;    ``J.C.'s everywhere in this garden,'' Hinkley said. ``Every day,
I could take out a plant that he gave me, and I would never run out
of plants. He knew, he sensed what a good plant was.''
 &HT;    To sense what a good plant is _ to recognize it in the wild and
then confirm it in his own garden _ is the essence of Hinkley's
work.
 &HT;    ``We have all this Lutheran guilt,'' he says. ``We all moved
west from the Midwest where we couldn't have winter gardens, and so
our gardens in Seattle and Portland and Vancouver are amazingly
timid as far as what our climate can actually do.'' But there is no
timidity in this garden.
 &HT;    What takes it beyond timidity isn't massed plantings or vibrant
color or expansive scale or even mere exoticism. It is Hinkley's
subtle reliance on the globally diverse forms of individual plants.
Each plant, grown well, reveals itself and reveals something too
about its neighbor.
 &HT;    What creeps grows next to what climbs. The fastigiate and the
pendulous conspire. Bark peels, thorns protrude, vines finger their
way across an arbor, and what unites it all, what makes these
plants garden-worthy, is the interest they bestow upon each other.
 &HT;    There are few explicit canons for deciding what makes a plant
garden-worthy, but one of them _ a base line below the realm of the
esthetic _ is lack of ecological invasiveness. Most gardeners are
familiar with species that tend to be invasive in the garden, such
as Ajuga reptans, sometimes called carpet bugle.
 &HT;    But what haunts Hinkley is the thought of plants that can break
loose from cultivation and run rampant across the landscape _
purple loosestrife, kudzu, tamarisk, honeysuckle. ``My greatest
concern,'' he says, ``is the introduction of a bad plant.''
 &HT;    Invasiveness is a hot issue, and it inspires a botanical
xenophobia, a fear that just because a plant is exotic _ i.e.,
non-native _ it's inevitably invasive or otherwise harmful to the
suite of native plants, changing the balance of nitrogen in the
soil, for instance, or causing the water table to dip below the
roots of native plants.
 &HT;    But in horticulture, as in agriculture, the distinction between
exotic and native has been blurred by the ancient, extensive
exchange of plants for their economic or ornamental value. Because
plant material _ seeds, cuttings, fruits _ moves as readily as
humans do, human plant collecting, like the invention of
agriculture, predates history itself.
 &HT;    Hinkley points out some of the plants he admires _ such as
Podophyllum delavayi, a May apple from Sichuan, which, he says,
``deserves to be worshiped'' _ and some of the plants he thinks
will become important to American gardeners in the years ahead, not
only among ``plant nerds,'' as he puts it, but also among gardeners
generally. He points out a group called the woodland lilies _
Smilacinas, Polygonatums, Uvularias, Disporums and Disporopsis.
 &HT;    But above all he points out Hepatica _ Hepatica acutiloba, an
American native and Hepatica maxima, which grows only on one island
in the Japan Sea, Hepatica in a single clone, in many clones, in
enough clones one day to sell.
 &HT;    To a casual visitor, these are perplexing plants, modest,
growing in low mounds with rather formal, old-fashioned leaves and
small flowers, not half as striking as the arisaemas and trilliums
that are rioting in the woodland.
 &HT;    But besides being a ``simply good'' plant, Hepatica maxima, for
one, is also very rare in cultivation, which makes its goodness no
longer simple. It goes about its business in a quiet corner of the
garden, reaffirming a strange premise of life itself, for being
there at all is part of its beauty.

 By VERLYN KLINKENBORG  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    The architecture of Dan Hinkley's garden on the Kitsap Peninsula
in Washington State is native, shaped by old Douglas firs and a
seeping bog.
 &HT;    But in the cultivated understory, he has convened plants from
all around the globe, reuniting the tribes of the botanical
diaspora. More than 50 kinds of arisaemas _ called
jack-in-the-pulpit in North America _ rocket from the soil, and
one, Arisaema nepenthoides, stands fully erect, a single cobralike
spathe beside a rotting stump crowned with ferns.
 &HT;    Thirty-five varieties of Solomon's seals, or polygonatums, from
China, Japan, Taiwan, Nepal and Sikkim unspiral from their early
growth, and dozens of types of hellebore have just passed their
prime.
 &HT;    Throughout the garden, hydrangeas and viburnums are beginning to
dispense their leaves; Stachyurus and Edgeworthia, winter-flowering
shrubs from Asia, are leafing out. On some loops of the garden
trail, where a Cardiocrinum giganteum thrusts its antediluvian
seedpod six feet into the air, you almost expect to see a dinosaur
wander past. Bud-break has stirred among an orderly chaos of
growth-forms.
 &HT;    The man behind this collection of plants is Daniel Hinkley, a
45-year-old native of northern Michigan who has come to be regarded
as one of the pre-eminent plant explorers in the world. Hinkley is
the co-owner and chief plantsman of Heronswood Nursery, started in
1987, which lies within the visual domain of the Olympic Mountains
across Puget Sound from Seattle.
 &HT;    Heronswood is Hinkley's personal garden, his trial garden and a
two-and-a-half-acre commercial nursery rolled in one. It's also
Hinkley's home, which he shares with his partner, Robert Jones, an
architect who is to the mailing list, the account books and the
commercial operations at Heronswood what Hinkley is to the plants.
 &HT;    Here are more than 9,500 plants sprung from seed gathered all
over the world. Most are numbered and listed in a loose-leaf binder
that Hinkley calls the Big Bang, a compilation of plants already
for sale and those that someday will be. The binder listing current
inventory is called the Grand Mal. To most gardeners, the plants on
these lists would be unfamiliar.
 &HT;    Instead of the classic Hosta ``Frances Williams,'' for instance,
there is Hosta kiyosumiensis, which Hinkley collected from Mount
Kiyosume in Japan's Chiba Prefecture in 1995. Instead of hybridized
Asiatic and Oriental lilies, there is Lilium nanum, collected by
Hinkley during a joint expedition to the Himalayas in 1995.
 &HT;    Instead of a Norway maple or a David Austin rose, there is Acer
rufinerve, a striped-bark maple he gathered in central Japan in
1997, and a rose of as yet undetermined species collected from an
altitude of 10,800 feet in China's Yunnan province in 1996.
 &HT;    From this garden each year also comes the Heronswood catalogue,
a major literary artifact in the world of gardening ephemera.
Printed solidly in small type, it begins with Hinkley's wry musings
on the imperfect art of running a mail-order nursery and ends 300
pages and some 2,500 plants later.
 &HT;    The catalogue is a saga of botanical excitement and a chronicle
of adjectival fatigue, the fate of a man driven to travel the world
searching for remarkable plants and then doomed to write a terse,
descriptive paragraph about one $6 or $8 clone after another,
beginning with Abies balsamea ``Nana'' in the ``Conifers'' section
and ending with the New Zealand sedge Uncinia unciniata, the final
plant in the section on grasses.
 &HT;    Though it advertises nowhere and admits visitors only by
appointment, Heronswood Nursery mailed 35,000 copies of the 1999
catalogue, and subscription requests are currently arriving at the
rate of 100 a week. At $8 for a two-year subscription, the
catalogue just pays for itself, unless you count the cost of
Hinkley's writing time, in which case it is grossly underpriced.
 &HT;    Subscribers pleasantly lost among Hinkley's paragraphs can be
forgiven for wondering whether the nursery exists to justify the
catalogue, or vice versa. Still, appealing to a newly adventurous
generation of gardeners, Heronswood was an almost instant success.
In 1993, the year after it incorporated, it had a gross income of
$220,000. In 1998, it was five times larger, $1,100,000.

   TOP-JUDGE _ COLUMBIA, S.C._When Jean Toal graduated from the

has been elected South Carolina's first woman chief justice of the

irrespressible and brilliant. But her greatest pride, she says, is
being a successful wife and mother. She says of her husband, a law

sports nuts, and we've raised two wonderful girls.'' (Riddle,

YOUNG AUTHOR'S FIRST NOVEL IS A GEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BOBBIE HESS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``My wife of more than 45 years shot herself yesterday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least that is what the police assume, and I am playing the
part of a grieving widower with enthusiasm and success. Life with
Sarah has schooled me in self-deception, which I find _ as she did
_ to be an excellent training in the deceiving of others. Of course
I know that she did nothing of the kind. My wife was far too sane,
far too rooted in the present to think of harming herself. In my
opinion she never gave a thought to what she had done. She was
incapable of guilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was I who killed her.''
</P>
<P>
   So begins ``The Drowning People'' (Warner Books, $24, 340
pages), 21-year-old Richard Mason's amazing debut novel that deals
with love, betrayal, murder and revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Now James Farrell looks back on his life to figure out just what
led to the murder of his wife in their castle in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   It all began nearly 50 years ago, during a magical summer in
London. Having just graduated from Oxford and determined to pursue
a career as a violinist against his parents' wishes, James
encounters the beautiful aristocrat Ella Harcourt one day in the
park. Learning that she is engaged to an upper-class Brit she
doesn't love, 22-year-old James is determined to win her heart.
</P>
<P>
   They begin a passionate, clandestine and selfish affair and she
agrees to break off her engagement. Ella encourages James to accept
his friend Eric's offer of a place to stay in Prague, where he can
study with one of the great violinists of his day.
</P>
<P>
   When Ella and James are reunited, she forces James to prove his
love by committing an unspeakable act against Eric. Unable to face
himself, James breaks off the affair and retreats into his music.
Three years later, they will meet again, but the lies of the past
and a cunning act of murder will damn the future.
</P>
<P>
   Mason wrote ``The Drowning People'' when he was 18. How a
man-child could have so much wisdom and insight is baffling. His
elders will be jealous of his storytelling ability, not to mention
his beautiful command of the language. His descriptions of Prague
are lyrical and his take on British high society uncanny.
</P>
<P>
   Mason has produced a literary gem.

   Elizabeth Peters' latest mystery featuring archaeologists Amelia
Peabody and her husband, Radcliffe Emerson, (``The Falcon at the
Portal,'' Avon Books, $24, 366 pages) is a delight.
</P>
<P>
   As the Emerson clan is about to leave for the 1911 excavation
season in Egypt, they learn someone is selling fake antiquities and
trying to point the blame at archaeologist David Todros, who is the
best friend of the Emersons' son Ramses and the new husband of the
Emersons' niece, Lia.
</P>
<P>
   On arrival in Egypt, they learn that the director of
antiquities, who is terrified of Radcliffe, has once again given
him a very poor archaeological spot _ the pyramids of Zawaiet el
Aryan. Ramses is pursued by the pretty but dimwitted Maude, while
the Emersons' beautiful and bright ward, Nefret, is being courted
by almost every unattached American or British male in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   When Maude is found dead in a shaft at Zawaiet, her brother Jack
accuses Ramses of the murder. En route to the digs, someone takes
potshots at Amelia. More forgeries turn up, as does a small girl
who looks amazingly like Amelia. Meanwhile, there are accusations
of drug smuggling and Amelia must use all her wiles to clear
David's name and keep her family together.
</P>
<P>
   As always, the dialogue is witty, the pace is as fast as a
sandstorm, and the intrigue just escalates. But it is Peters' wily
cast of characters that keep this reader coming back for more.

   More light-hearted than the previous nine ``Prey'' thrillers,
``Certain Prey'' (by John Sandford, G.P. Putnam's Sons, $24.95, 339
pages) pits Lucas Davenport against one of his most unlikely foes.
</P>
<P>
   Minneapolis defense attorney Carmel Loan has almost everything
she wants _ a million-dollar practice, a Jaguar, a beautiful
apartment. But she doesn't have the gorgeous but not-so-bright Hale
Allen, a married attorney at her firm; so Loan uses one of her
former clients to hire a hit man to kill Allen's wife. To her
surprise, the assassin is a well-dressed young female named Clara
Rinker.
</P>
<P>
   Wanted by the FBI for 25 previous hits, Rinker has left few
clues behind. However, when one of Loan's former clients tries to
blackmail her, Loan again asks Rinker to help her clean up the
loose ends. Now the high-priced lawyer becomes a murdering
sociopath. Meanwhile, Davenport asks the FBI for help in tracking
down the Minneapolis killer. When he finds evidence linking Loan to
the murders, things really heat up.
</P>
<P>
   The previous ``Prey'' thrillers have all been riveting, with a
lot of edge. ``Certain Prey'' is more of a summer romp. Like
Davenport, you gain a certain respect for Rinker _ after all, she's
just doing her job. You root for Loan to get her comeuppance. And
you are glad Davenport will be around for the 11th ``Prey.''

   When Martin Cruz Smith's latest thriller, ``Havana Boy,'' landed
on my desk, I was delighted, especially since its main character is
``Gorky Park's'' extremely likable protagonist, Arkady Renko. But
the book (Random House, $24.95, 329 pages) is as tired as the
middle-aged Renko, now suicidal because his beloved wife Irina is
dead.
</P>
<P>
   Renko has flown to Cuba after receiving an urgent message from
the Russian Embassy requesting his help in finding his old
acquaintance Pribluda. On arrival, he is told that a corpse just
fished out of Havana Bay is Pribluda's, but he soon learns that the
body had been in the water too long to make identification certain.
Renko wants to hang around to see if Pribluda is really dead and,
if so, how it happened and why.
</P>
<P>
   Once Havana held out the welcome wagon to Russians, but no
longer, not since the Soviet Union fell and all aid to the island
has stopped. The Cubans want Renko to leave immediately, and during
one of several attempts on his life, he ends up killing one of his
attackers. A female Havana police officer reluctantly decides to
help him solve the puzzle so he can go home.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the heat, Renko trudges around Havana wearing a cashmere
overcoat that still bears Irina's scent. Unable to speak the
language, Renko doggedly traces Pribluda's last days and meets an
unsavory cast of characters.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz's descriptions of the decaying Havana are beautifully
written. He is a master of weaving complex plot threads and drawing
out an incredible cast of offbeat characters. Yet the story seems
worn and faded.

COURT NARROWS SCOPE OF DISABILITY LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: UPDATES, added material, minor edits throughout.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Tuesday narrowed the scope of
a federal law banning discrimination against people with handicaps,
saying it does not apply to such disabilities as poor eyesight that
can be corrected medically.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling on three related cases, the court dismissed lawsuits by
two nearsighted pilots, a truck driver almost blind in one eye and
a mechanic with high blood pressure _ all of whom were either fired
or denied employment.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the lawsuits was brought under the 1990 American with
Disabilities Act (ADA), which was designed to end discrimination on
the job, in housing and at medical facilities and other places that
serve the public. The court's dismissal of the suits means that the
ADA did not protect those plaintiffs and others like them.
</P>
<P>
   Before the decision, the ADA was thought to cover about 160
million people. As a result of the court's ruling Monday it covers
about 43 million.
</P>
<P>
   The law defines disability as ``a physical or mental impairment
that substantially limits one or more major life activities'' or a
condition where a person is ``being regarded as having such
impairment.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing in the case of the two
nearsighted pilots, said, ``We hold that determination of whether
an individual is disabled should be made with reference to measures
that mitigate the individual's impairment, including, in this
instance, eyeglasses and contact lenses.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 7-2 opinion, she said, the poor eyesight of the two
pilots, Karen Sutton and Kimberly Hinton, failed to ``substantially
limit a major life activity'' for them, and therefore they were not
covered under the ADA.
</P>
<P>
   The court reached the same conclusion in the other two cases,
ruling unanimously that truck driver Haille Kirkingburg and, by a
7-2 vote, that mechanic Vaughn Murphy should not be considered
disabled under the ADA.
</P>
<P>
   In each of the cases, the court also ruled that the plaintiffs
failed to show that the companies they sued had banned them from an
entire class of jobs, such as pilot or driver. Instead, the court
said, the companies refused to consider each person for a specific
job because of strict, reasonable criteria that the plaintiffs
failed to meet.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Sutton and Hinton, twin sisters who were regional
airline pilots from Spokane, Wash., applied for jobs as commercial
pilots at United Airlines in Colorado. Although they met basic age,
education, experience and Federal Aviation Administration
qualifications, United turned them down for employment because
their uncorrected vision was worse than the airline's requirement
of 20/100.
</P>
<P>
   In Kirkingburg's case, his employer, Albertsons Inc., a
supermarket chain, hired him as a truck driver in 1990 based in
Portland, Ore. Kirkingburg had had more than a decade's experience
and performed well when on a road test for the company. But after
two years with the firm, he took an exam and failed to meet
Department of Transportation standards for drivers. As a result,
the company fired him.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to meet Transportation Department standards also led to
Murphy's dismissal. Murphy, who suffers from high blood pressure,
was hired by United Parcel Service in Manhattan, Kan., as a
mechanic, a job that required him to drive to different locations
around the city.
</P>
<P>
   A month after being hired, the company discovered Murphy's high
blood pressure, which disqualified him from driving under
government regulations, and fired him.
</P>
<P>
   In its rulings Tuesday, the court said that under the ADA, a
company can prefer certain physical characteristics over others,
such as favoring people with perfect vision over near-sighted
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``An employer is free to decide that physical characteristics or
medical conditions that are not impairments are preferable to
others, just as it is free to decide that some limiting impairments
make individuals less than ideally suited for a job,'' O'Connor
said in the pilots' case.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Bokat, general counsel of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
called the court's decision in rejecting the lawsuits ``extremely
important'' for American business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means that those with true disabilities will continue to be
covered, but people with easily correctable conditions will not be
considered disabled,'' he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   But Louis Bograd, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties
Union, a legal watchdog group, said the court's ruling were a
``serious blow'' to civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court has narrowed the ADA so that it covers only a small,
small group of people and not the people it was meant to cover,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years employers have won 92 percent of the 700 ADA
cases resolved in court from 1992 to 1997, according to the
American Bar Association. Lower courts had split over how far the
law's protections extend in the cases decided Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate ruling that also centered on the ADA, the high
court held 6-3 in a Georgia case that states may have to place
people with mental disabilities in homelike settings if they can
fare just as well there as in state hospitals. In a narrow
decision, the court said the ADA requires such community placement
of the mentally disabled whenever appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We confront the question whether the proscription of
discrimination may require placement of persons with mental
disabilities in community settings, rather than in institutions,''
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for the court. ``The answer, we
hold, is a qualified yes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case, Lois Curtis and Elaine Wilson, two mentally
disabled women, challenged the state of Georgia's insistence that
they remain in a state hospital in Atlanta until places in a less
restrictive community care center opened.
</P>
<P>
   They argued that the state should make places for them at the
care center because it would offer them a setting where they could
interact with more people who are not disabled and that forcing
them to wait amounted to isolating and segregating them from
mainstream American life.

   NUDE-CHEFS (Undated) _ The ads are titled, ``famous chefs naked
with their blender.'' The first one appeared in the June issue of
Food Arts, a glossy trade magazine. In moody black and white,
Jean-Louis Palladin wears nothing but some jewelry, his glasses and
a strategically placed Vita-Prep blender. Coming models in the
naked series promise to draw even closer scrutiny: Eric Ripert, of
Le Bernardin and Aquavit's Marcus Samuelsson, two of the food
world's four-star heartthrobs. Success for the modern chef can
demand much more than just high-level cooking skills. Charm and
glamor are prerequisites. And now, so is good looks: The chef as
hunk. It's a development that some clearly revel in, others
tolerate and still others find silly and trivializing. By Rick
Marin.

   SELYEM-WINERY (Healdsburg, Calif.) _ The question sounds like a
line from an old radio script: Can a minuscule winery, started by a
couple of ornery, rough-hewn rural Californians, find continuing
happiness as part of an international combine owned by a big-time
venture capitalist from Wall Street? The winery is Williams Selyem,
whose pinot noirs have moved to the head of the table in the years
since the first was made in a garage in 1981. Fewer than 8,000
cases a year are produced. Almost all go directly to people on the
Williams Selyem mailing list, which is as hard to crack as the
guest list for a royal wedding. By R.W. Apple Jr.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Swapping stories, swapping punches
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Larry L. King (the one who wrote ``Best Little
Whorehouse in Texas,'' not the little guy on TV) doesn't fight
anymore, except maybe with book publishers and that's mostly on the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he's nearly 70 years old. For another, after
almost that many years of cigarettes, his lungs are, in his words,
``tattered as a 10-year-old sock.''
</P>
<P>
   A long-standing AA, he has now quit smoking as well after a
serious sinking spell put him in the hospital awhile back. Thank
goodness he still has the breath to tell a good story.
</P>
<P>
   We got together with friends for lunch one day. Somehow James
Dickey's name came up, famous dead author of the novel
``Deliverance,'' and King launched into this story.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't taking notes, so the quotes are approximate, and I have
cut the account about in half, having eliminated the cussing, which
is King's native tongue, being from Texas. As a result, the
following loses much in my retelling.
</P>
<P>
   This was in the 1970s. Playboy magazine was hosting a writer's
conference in Chicago. King and Dickey met for the first time while
occupying adjacent bar stools in the hotel lounge.
</P>
<P>
   King knew something of Dickey's disposition. Fellow author
Willie Morris had warned him that the man was nice enough sober,
but in the course of boozing could become mean and dangerous, more
so in the fact that he was big and strong.
</P>
<P>
   Morris's advice: ``Get in the first punch.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was after countless rounds of toasting one another's
genius as literary giants, Dickey's eyes turned suddenly cold and,
just as suddenly, he turned on King.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever gave you the idea that you could write, you
blankety-blank,'' he snarled.
</P>
<P>
   ``For one thing, you double-blankety-blank,'' King responded,
``that's exactly what you've been telling me for the last two
hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Dickey could react, King punctuated his remark with a
roundhouse right, knocking Dickey off his stool and onto the floor,
then leaped upon him and proceeded to pummel him sufficiently.
</P>
<P>
   As he fled the bar just before the cops arrived, his departing
words were, ``Thank you, Willie!''
</P>
<P>
   King laid low in his room until he figured he was safe from
arrest, then, noting on the agenda of hotel events that Dickey had
a poetry reading scheduled at that hour, headed to the gathering,
where he commenced to heckle Dickey relentlessly from the back of
the room. Finally a Playboy representative had to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime later, feeling he had put in a full day and deserved a
bit of relaxation, King made his way to the conference hospitality
suite where drinks were available. Better if hospitalization had
been available as well.
</P>
<P>
   Great turmoil greeted him at the door. A pie-eyed, cold-eyed
Dickey, in his usual challenge to a colleague's credentials as a
writer, had backed Michael Crichton into a corner and, with a rage
akin to a T-Rex from Crichton's ``Jurassic Park,'' was slapping and
cursing the terrified novelist.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of onlookers, well-read but ill-prepared for violence,
could do nothing but cry for someone to do something to stop him.
</P>
<P>
   King did something.
</P>
<P>
   Coming up from behind, King got Dickey by the neck in a strangle
hold, choked him to the floor and held him there until, at King's
prompting, Dickey squeaked surrender.
</P>
<P>
   The villain was vanquished. Ladies swooned. Maybe some of the
writers did, too. Such are the great moments of lesser-known
literatary history.
</P>
<P>
   You can read more of King's adventures, unexpurgated, in his
upcoming book, ``A Writer's Life in Letters, Or Reflections in a
Bloodshot Eye,'' TCU Press, set for publication this fall.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The recent encounter in the House of Representatives between gun
control and religion was, depending on your politics, well intended
or set new standards for applied cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Littleton, the National Rifle Association and its
House allies faced gun control Armageddon in the form of a
developing consensus against too casually mixing criminals,
teenagers and guns. The nation seemed dangerously close to agreeing
that something, if only marginally, needed to be done. One can only
imagine what might have been said or done if Congress had debated
faith-based strangler's cloths instead of faith-based handguns.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans and the NRA did not disagree. Their
conclusion, however, was astonishing in its audacity. What was
needed was not more gun control but a more ubiquitous display of
the Ten Commandments. The thought became a scriptural poison pill.
An argument about hardware had transmogrified into a test of faith.
</P>
<P>
   In suggesting that public policy must submit to particularized
faith, the gun lobby has placed us on an amazingly smooth slope,
debating all the while how many angels can dance on the pointy end
of a bullet.

BOOK REVIVES HISTORY OF FAMOUS MURDER TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MIKE HUREWITZ  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCHUYLERVILLE, N.Y. _ In the small canal hamlet once known as
Fort Miller's Bridge, a bullet crashed through the window in the
home of one of the wealthiest families in town 120 years ago this
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Mary Eliza Billings was seated with her daughter and
maid, when without any sound except the discharge of the gun and
the shattering of the window pane, her head drooped to her left
shoulder,'' writes Hollis Palmer, assistant superintendent of the
Cohoes school district.
</P>
<P>
   The grisly end of Mrs. Billings' life marked the beginning of a
true tale of intrigue, mystery and wealth told in a self-published
book, ``To Spend Eternity Alone,'' released by Palmer on June 4 on
the anniversary of the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   The story, according to Palmer, pits the eyewitness daughter,
Jennie Billings, against her father, Jesse Billings Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The woman's death divided the hamlet, two miles north of
Schuylerville, into warring camps, and ultimately led to the trial
in nearby Ballston Spa of Jesse Billings Jr., a speculator, boat
builder, merchant and farmer who had amassed a fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were newspapers from the whole country covering the
case,'' Palmer said. ``New York papers were here, Chicago papers,
San Francisco papers. It was the biggest trial of the 19th
century.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer, 52, a resident of Saratoga Springs, said he developed a
love for history hearing tales of the region's past at his
grandfather's knee. Reading about the history of this area in
upstate New York, he stumbled on the subject of his first book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was reading a book called `The Early Settlers of Eastern
Saratoga County,''' he said. There was one sentence that referred
to the Billings tragedy of 1878.
</P>
<P>
   His curiosity piqued, he looked for a book on the subject and
found none. He began his own research.
</P>
<P>
   ``I collected eight different newspaper accounts, I visited
local historians. I checked out wills. If you can think about the
range of research you have to do, I think I did it,'' Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   There were 199 witnesses, so many that the defense commandeered
the Eagle Hotel, now the site of the post office in Ballston Spa.
The trial's five judges stayed at the Medbery Hotel, which still
stands, although no longer as a lodging. The jury stayed at the
American Hotel, now a newspaper bureau. The prosecution stayed at
the Sans Souci Hotel, which no longer exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turned out to be the longest, most expensive criminal trial
in U.S. history until the 1930s,'' Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   In today's dollars, defense costs alone were more than $3
million, Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   He began the project a year ago, and with no particular
background in writing. He said he chose a chronological approach,
which made the organization simple. He hired four people to edit
his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only sleep four hours a night, so I literally have four
hours nobody else has,'' Palmer said. ``I would get up around 4
a.m. and write until I left for the gym every morning. I would try
and get at least four pages roughed a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer sought to maintain a cycle in which he would re-read his
last four pages, try to type two pages and outline two more. ``Once
I started it was like my doctoral dissertation. I really flew
through it,'' said Palmer, who has an advanced degree in
educational administration and political science.
</P>
<P>
   He chose to self-publish rather than look for a publishing
house, he said, because he anticipated trouble selling the work as
a first-time author without a recognizable name. In addition, he
wanted to maintain editorial control and to speed the timetable
between writing and publishing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Using a book on the process as his guide, he invested about
$20,000 and has printed 5,022 copies.
</P>
<P>
   He is hoping the book will attract a market for those interested
in the region and the broader market for aficionados of true crime.
</P>
<P>
   The title of the book, ``To Spend Eternity Alone,'' is based on
the circumstances surrounding Jesse Billings Jr.'s burial in the
family plot, one of the largest in Prospect Hill Cemetery adjacent
to the Saratoga Monument in Schuylerville. His is the plot's only
grave.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Palmer chuckles and says, ``Read the book.''

   ARGENTINA-BUDWEISER (Undated) _ When Anheuser-Busch decided to
go full throttle into Argentina, it turned to Marcelo Tinelli,
Argentina's answer to Jay Leno, who tells jokes, interviews guests
_ and sips Budweiser from a can in front of 3.2 million viewers.
Thanks largely to Tinelli's endorsement, Budweiser's sales in
Argentina soared 61 percent in the first quarter of this year. And
Argentina is one of many overseas markets where Anheuser is pouring
it on with its flagship brand. Through aggressive marketing to a
younger, more upscale and better educated slice of the world's
population, the company is hoping to turn Budweiser into a truly
global brand. By Constance L. Hays.

scoring more consistently than he has been in this series. Without

it's hurting them. By Mike Wise.

<P>
   BKN-KNICKS (New York) _ Folo on the Knicks' Game 3 victory in
the NBA finals, which puts New York back in the series, although
still trailing, 2 games to 1. The Knicks had three key players on
Monday night _ Allan Houston, Latrell Sprewell and Larry Johnson _
all of whom played over 40 minutes. With only day off before Game
4, the question for the Knicks is whether these same three players
will run of gas on Wednesday night. By Selena Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   BKN-SPURS (New York) _ Having lost Game 3, the Spurs have to
regroup for Game 4 on Wednesday night. They know that both Games 4
and 5 will be played in New York and that there is the danger they
will find themselves trailing, 3 games to 2, by the time the
weekend rolls around. To avoid that scenario, they have to find a
way to better defend Allan Houston, even though the Spurs are
likely to get more fouls called on them in New York than they will
in San Antonio. By Chris Broussard.

   &UR; Something is troubling America's boys. Is it confusion over
male roles? A violent culture? The Globe sent writers across
America to find some answers. The project, which reveals a common
struggle among Americans to raise healthy boys in a sometimes
confused and angry world, is reported in a six-part package,
accompanied by photos by staff photographer John Blanding. &LR;

   MEN-OUTCAST (Booneville, Ark.) _ As Bill Wagner stood watching
the sun set over his small, beloved farm at the southern edge of
the Ozark Mountains, he made an announcement of his own: To protect
his homosexual son the family would move away. By Mitchell Zuckoff.

   MEN-GUNS (Rapid City, S.D.) _ In the West children learn to

the good hunt, and about their love for one another. By Wil
Haygood. (2 takes) PHOTO

<P>
   MEN-MOTHERS (Middlesex, N.J.) _ Jeff Taylor's brain cancer and
death three years ago, when he was 41, clearly left a huge hole in
the family's heart. It also launched his wife, Karen Sumski Taylor,
on a difficult journey to find the stamina, means, faith, and humor

watched him thrive. By Bob Hohler. (2 takes) PHOTO

   MEN-BULLY (Newton, Mass.) _ Ted Harrington was not a classic

initiate taunts rather than stand to the side or take the heat
themselves. By Irene Sege. (2 takes) PHOTO

   NUDE-CHEFS (Undated) _ The ads are titled, ``famous chefs naked

Food Arts, a glossy trade magazine. In moody black and white,
Jean-Louis Palladin wears nothing but some jewelry, his glasses and
a strategically placed Vita-Prep blender. Coming models in the
naked series promise to draw even closer scrutiny: Eric Ripert, of
Le Bernardin and Aquavit's Marcus Samuelsson, two of the food
world's four-star heartthrobs. Success for the modern chef can
demand much more than just high-level cooking skills. Charm and
glamor are prerequisites. And now, so is good looks: The chef as

venture capitalist from Wall Street? The winery is Williams Selyem,
whose pinot noirs have moved to the head of the table in the years
since the first was made in a garage in 1981. Fewer than 8,000
cases a year are produced. Almost all go directly to people on the
Williams Selyem mailing list, which is as hard to crack as the

THE MANY SPLENDORS OF PAELLA 
</HEADLINE>

 By FLORENCE FABRICANT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Paella! Spectacular Rice Dishes From Spain'' (Henry Holt,
$27.50), Penelope Casas gives nearly 50 recipes for this single
dish.
</P>
<P>
   Why not 100? The variations are infinite, once you grasp the
basic method. It's as easily mastered as risotto: saute seasonings,
add the seafood, meat or vegetables, then rice and liquid, cook
uncovered, then finish in the oven. After adding the rice, it takes
about 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Casas, who has traveled all over Spain and written many
books on Spanish cooking, explains that paella is judged by the
rice, the way the Japanese judge sushi. The other ingredients are
garnishes. Like risotto, successful paella requires short-grain
rice, with its ability to swell and absorb a flavorful liquid.
Spanish short-grain rice, especially the bomba rice of Valencia,
the home of paella, is preferable, but Italian arborio rice works
fine.
</P>
<P>
   Paella is traditionally cooked in a shallow, uncovered pan on
top of the stove or over a wood-burning fire on an outdoor grill.
In her flawless recipes, Ms. Casas has developed a combination
stove-top and oven cooking method for home kitchens, including
variations for electric and gas ovens. A traditional paella pan is
not necessary.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the recipes are made with seafood, as you
would expect since paella is said to have originated in coastal
Valencia. The mixed version with pork sausage, chicken and seafood,
commonly called paella a la Valenciana in America, is reserved for
tourists in Spain, Ms. Casas says: it's not authentic. But there's
a fine recipe for this crowd-pleaser.
</P>
<P>
   In many classic paellas, one main ingredient is featured, like
an assortment of earthy mushrooms, or several kinds of shrimp, or
salt cod. Ms. Casas also branches out with combinations like a
delicious lamb and red pepper paella, salmon and asparagus paella,
and others seasoned with pesto.

saffron, shallots, \ teaspoon salt, parsley and garlic. Heat broth
in large pot over lowest heat. Preheat gas oven to 400 degrees,
electric to 450 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   2. Heat oil in paella pan or other shallow casserole 17 to 18
inches in diameter, using two burners if necessary. Saute leeks and
onions over medium heat until softened. Add ham, cook 1 minute, add
tomatoes, cook 2 minutes. Add wine and let it boil away.
</P>
<P>
   3. Add mushrooms and cook 1 to 2 minutes to soften. Stir in rice
to coat with ingredients in pan. Pour in broth and bring to a boil.
Add saffron mixture and salt to taste and continue to boil about 5
minutes, occasionally stirring and rotating pan, until rice is no
longer soupy but still has some liquid.
</P>
<P>
   4. Transfer to oven _ 10 to 12 minutes for gas, 15 to 20 minutes
for electric _ until rice is almost tender. Remove from oven, put
in a warm place (on top of stove on unlighted burner, for example),
cover with foil and let rest 5 to 10 minutes, until rice is fully
cooked. Serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 to 8 servings.

FENNEL-STEAMED MUSSELS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MARK BITTMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   My craving for fennel-scented steamed mussels stems from a day
in southern France more than 20 years ago, when I sat in a bistro
and was planning rather timidly to order a salade nicoise. Just
then, a huge bowl of powerfully fragrant mussels was delivered to a
man at the next table, and I boldly changed my mind. The hot
mussels were essentially tossed with fennel and fennel seeds, which
I could see, but the licorice bouquet and flavor were far stronger
than that combination alone could provide.
</P>
<P>
   Later, I realized that there had to be a secret ingredient:
anise liqueur, either Pernod or Ricard. (There was a time when
absinthe, made from wormwood, was used, but it was declared a
harmful drug in France in 1915.) I've since discovered that there
is indeed another ingredient _ star anise _ that will yield the
same intensity provided by the liqueurs, but I prefer to reserve it
for anise mussels with an Asian flavor.
</P>
<P>
   You can decide for yourself which method to choose to get your
anise taste, and indeed just how strong that taste should be. There
are many, many other herbs, spices, vegetables and other seasonings
you can use for a licorice flavor. Think of aniseseed or ground
anise; five-spice powder; ouzo or raki, the anise-scented liqueurs
of the eastern Mediterranean; tarragon, chervil, even basil _
especially Thai basil. (You could probably throw in a few pieces of
Good &AMP; Plenty while you're at it.)
</P>
<P>
   Fresh fennel works especially well here because you can add it
in a large enough quantity that it becomes an essential component
of the dish _ not just a flavoring, but a vegetable as well. And
the timing is perfect: in the short time it takes to steam the
mussels, the fennel becomes tender but not mushy. I like fennel
seeds, too, not only for their flavor but also for their satisfying
crunch.
</P>
<P>
   As for the mussels, there are increasing amounts of the
cultivated kind on the market, most often from Prince Edward
Island, which is fast becoming the mussel farming capital of the
East. These are easy to clean (almost clean enough to eat without
washing, but still worth a quick going over), with plump meat and
very few rejects.
</P>
<P>
   They are, however, quite bland. There is no better-tasting
mussel than a good wild one. Unfortunately, they're usually harder
to clean, with a higher percentage of broken shells and
occasionally shriveled, small meat. When you're buying mussels,
check the shells carefully, and even ask for one to be opened if
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Soaking is really not necessary with any mussels, but thorough
scrubbing is. (This is much easier with the farm-raised ones
because they are often grown on ropes.) You also must remove the
``beard,'' the vegetative growth on the flat side of the shell. Any
mussels that don't close when tapped lightly against a hard surface
(the counter or sink, another mussel, or a spoon) are dead and must
be discarded, along with any that have broken shells.
</P>
<P>
   FENNEL-STEAMED MUSSELS PROVENCAL
</P>
<P>
   Time: 15 to 30 minutes, depending on cleaning time
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   4 cloves garlic, smashed and peeled
</P>
<P>
   1 fennel bulb (about 1 pound), trimmed and thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons fennel seeds
</P>
<P>
   { cup Pernod or Ricard (or 4 star anise)
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chopped tomatoes, if desired (canned are fine, drained
first)
</P>
<P>
   1 sprig tarragon, if desired
</P>
<P>
   At least 4 pounds large mussels, well washed.
</P>
<P>
   1. Place the oil in a large pot and turn the heat to medium; 1
minute later, add the garlic, fennel, fennel seeds, liqueur, and
tomatoes and tarragon if you're using them. Bring to a boil, cook
for about 1 minute. Add the mussels, cover the pot, and turn the
heat to high.
</P>
<P>
   2. Cook, shaking the pot occasionally, until the mussels open, 5
to 10 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove the mussels and fennel
to a serving bowl, then strain any liquid over them and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   Variation: To make the dish Asian style, combine the mussels in
a cold pot with 1 cinnamon stick, 4 star anise, 2 tablespoons soy
sauce and 2 tablespoons water. Cover and cook as above in Step 2.
If possible, toss with about { cup of torn Thai basil leaves.  &QL;

<P>
   A single vegetable brought to its essence _ that's the meaning
of summer soup. Winter soups, with their soothing richness and
warmth, tend to be a composition of ingredients _ beef-vegetable,
chicken-noodle, chowder, minestrone.
</P>
<P>
   But summer soups refresh rather than soothe. And with so many
vegetables hitting their peak of freshness, my first urge for
summer soups is to isolate each one and make it more than what it
is on the vine, to refine it to its purest form. (An exception is a
bright gazpacho, whose many flavors blend into a single taste.)
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of summer soups _ one main ingredient served hot or
cold _ is that they're so easy. Zucchini, spinach, tomato, bell
pepper: the less you change them, the better.
</P>
<P>
   The technique for all vegetables is the same; learn it and you
can transform any vegetable into an extraordinary summer soup,
whether it's pea or fennel, watercress or artichoke, tomato,
carrot, haricots verts or even a soup of fine herbs, tarragon,
chive, parsley and chervil.
</P>
<P>
   It's just a matter of cooking your vegetable, pureeing it in a
blender, adjusting the consistency with stock or water, seasoning
it, and straining. Some vegetables, like tomatoes and cucumbers,
don't need to be cooked.
</P>
<P>
   The principle is simple: separate the flavor and color from what
contains it, the cellulose. The tool that separates it is the
chinois.
</P>
<P>
   The chinois, a fine-meshed conical sieve, is critical to these
soups. It creates the texture of luxury. The chinois combines
layers of fine mesh that catch even the smallest particles of
fiber, producing a finely textured liquid that feels like silk or
satin. Certainly, you could heat your puree and serve it without
straining, or you might pass it through a food mill and then
through a strainer. But again, when you're looking for an essence
of something, you must remove all the extraneous vegetable fiber
that has no flavor.
</P>
<P>
   My thinking about soups is so similar to my approach to sauces
that I always wonder, is sauce a soup or is soup a sauce? Which
came first? If it's a great summer soup, it can be a great sauce,
too. And vice versa. Sometimes we'll make a sauce that tastes so
good, we decide to put it in a cup and call it soup.
</P>
<P>
   Soups are the most chameleonlike dishes. They can be served at
any point during the meal _ as a canape, a first course, the
perfect intermezzo, a dessert canape, the dessert or a sauce.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite way is as opening canapes _ two or three spoonfuls
of intense flavor presented in small white bowls before the meal
begins. A canape soup excites the senses and prepares you for the
meal ahead. And these summer soups make the very best canapes,
because they focus on a single flavor. One sip of carrot soup
should be as powerful in flavor as a mouthful of carrots.
</P>
<P>
   Elements of finesse make a big difference. And cooking the
vegetable well is one of them. All green vegetables should be
cooked in so much water that the water does not lose its boil,
water that has a cup of salt for every gallon, and the cooked
vegetable must immediately be shocked in ice water. This big-pot
blanching and chilling insures the brightest green possible.
</P>
<P>
   Root vegetables and red and yellow bell peppers are simmered in
a small amount of stock or cream, then blended.
</P>
<P>
   Another element of finesse is introducing some sort of fat _
cream or oil _ to enrich the flavor and add body, although some
vegetables, like cucumber and sorrel, require no fat. Perhaps
you'll also want an acid like sherry or balsamic vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   Some vegetables benefit from a secondary component (add a little
blanched dill to the cucumber puree for cucumber soup, for
instance). But ultimately, the great summer soup is a single cooked
vegetable pureed and strained through a chinois.
</P>
<P>
   Gazpacho is the perfect warm-weather soup, and the
interpretation I offer here is intense, and easy. The main
technique is turning on your blender, and then straining the
liquid. The flavor is extraordinary because you're using fresh
ingredients _ cucumbers, onion, bell pepper, tomatoes _ and
overnight marination develops and blends flavors. Serve in a
chilled shot glass.
</P>
<P>
   Or serve it hot. Or think of it as gazpacho sauce: it goes
perfectly with grilled chicken or fish, and I serve it at the
restaurant as the sauce for an artichoke salad. (Put a little vodka
in your gazpacho sauce and it becomes the world's best Bloody
Mary.)
</P>
<P>
   The yellow pepper soup uses the simmering method; the peppers
and the cooking liquid are blended and strained. This soup can be
served hot or cold.
</P>
<P>
   The pea soup is extraordinary for its color. If you cook your
peas properly, you'll never see such a beautiful shade of green.
Put an ounce of it on a plate and it becomes an equally beautiful
sauce for sweetbreads. The menu will call it a coulis. But we all
know it's really summer soup.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   PUREE OF ENGLISH PEA SOUP WITH WHITE TRUFFLE OIL
</P>
<P>
   Time: 45 minutes
</P>
<P>
   3 cups shelled English (green) peas, from about 3 pounds of pea
pods
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1{ cups salt
</P>
<P>
   \ to { cup vegetable stock or canned vegetable broth
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt and freshly ground white pepper
</P>
<P>
   \ cup white truffle oil.
</P>
<P>
   1. To help peas retain bright color during cooking, place them
in a bowl, cover surface with ice, and toss peas and ice together
to chill.
</P>
<P>
   2. Fill a large stockpot with 6 to 7 quarts of water, and bring
to a boil. Add sugar and salt. Lift a small batch of peas with a
strainer, letting the ice fall back into the bowl. To keep the
peas' vivid green color, it is important that the water return to a
boil almost immediately, so add the peas in small quantities. Cook
peas until completely tender, 7 to 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   3. While the peas cook, fill a large bowl with ice water and
submerge a colander in it When peas are tender, transfer to
colander as quickly as possible. Lift the colander from the ice
bath, and drain the peas well. Using a food processor, puree the
peas, then scrape the puree through a tami (for best results) or
fine mesh strainer. There should be about 2 cups of puree.
</P>
<P>
   4. Transfer to a blender, and add \ cup vegetable stock and \
cup water. Blend the mixture until smooth; the color may lighten
from the air blended into it but will darken after it sits. Check
the consistency of the soup; if desired, add more stock or water.
Add a pinch of Kosher salt and white pepper to taste, and blend
again. Pour soup through a chinois or fine mesh strainer. To serve
cold, stir in the truffle oil and refrigerate in a covered
container until serving. To serve hot, reheat gently over low heat,
and stir in truffle oil just before serving.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: about 3 cups (6 to 12 servings)
</P>
<P>
   YELLOW PEPPER SOUP WITH PAPRIKA MOUSSE
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   3 large yellow (or red) bell peppers, seeded and cut into
one-inch pieces
</P>
<P>
   1} cups heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   \ cup creme fraiche
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon paprika, or to taste.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Prepare soup: In medium pot over medium-low heat, simmer
peppers gently in 1{ cups of heavy cream until they are tender and
cooked through, 15 minutes. Puree cream and peppers in a blender
for 2 to 3 minutes. Strain through a chinois; season with salt.
Press to release all liquid. Set aside, or refrigerate up to two
days.
</P>
<P>
   2. Prepare mousse: In small bowl, whip creme fraiche and paprika
until paprika is blended and mixture stiff. Add salt to taste.
Refrigerate till ready to use, up to two days.
</P>
<P>
   3. To serve: Whip remaining cream until it forms peaks. In a
medium sauce pan over medium-high heat, bring soup to a boil.
Remove from heat, and vigorously whisk in whipped cream to create a
frothy consistency. Pour the soup into hot soup cups, and garnish
with the paprika mousse.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 first-course servings.
</P>
<P>
   Gazpacho  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 10 minutes, plus chilling time  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chopped peeled tomatoes (see note)
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chopped peeled red onions
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chopped green pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chopped English (seedless) cucumber
</P>
<P>
   1{ teaspoons chopped peeled garlic
</P>
<P>
   1{ teaspoons kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   \ teaspoon cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   \ cup tomato paste
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   \ cup plus 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   3 cups tomato juice
</P>
<P>
   Sprig of thyme.
</P>
<P>
   1. In a large nonreactive mixing bowl, combine all ingredients.
Cover, and refrigerate overnight.
</P>
<P>
   2. The next day, remove sprig of thyme. Using a blender, puree
remaining ingredients until smooth. For a smoother texture, the
soup may be strained (this will reduce the quantity). Refrigerate
gazpacho until well chilled. Ladle soup into bowls, and serve cold.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 2 quarts (8 to 16 servings).
</P>
<P>
   Note: To peel fresh tomatoes, cut a shallow X on the bottom of
each tomato, and submerge in boiling water for 5 to 10 seconds to
loosen the skin. Remove and chill under cold water. The skins will
slip off easily.

WINE TRADE GATHERS TO SIP AND SELL

<P>
   BORDEAUX, France _ Every two years, representatives of the wine
business from all over the world gather here at a weeklong
convention called Vinexpo to meet, gossip, buy and sell, make deals
and, of course, party. In many ways, Vinexpo, which ended on June
18, is just another trade show. But it's different in one important
way.
</P>
<P>
   Entertaining is a part of all conventions, but if the subject is
selling airplanes or plumbing supplies, it's usually very separate
from the work. But wine is inseparable from entertainment, and over
two or three centuries, Bordeaux winemakers have made entertaining
a fine art. It's always been the way to sell wine here, where
chateaus are private homes and their cellars are open only by
invitation. Vinexpo, which began 20 years ago and this year drew
55,000 visitors from 125 countries, has only turned up the volume.
</P>
<P>
   Vinexpo draws together the whole range of wine professionals,
from winery sales and marketing representatives to buyers for
liquor stores to auctioneers and writers. Vinitaly, in Verona, is
similar, but it focuses on Italian wines. Vinexpo is international,
making it the place to see and be seen. (In off years, there's a
smaller version in Tokyo.)
</P>
<P>
   Consider the party given for the news media by the most famous
Bordeaux wine chateaus, organized as the Union of Great Classified
Growths. The dinner, for about 200, including nonmedia types like
sports figures, entertainers and restaurateurs who had wangled
invitations, was held in the courtyard of the wine cellars at
Chateau Latour. The chef was Pierre Gagnaire, whose eponymous
restaurant in Paris has three Michelin stars. The wines were
supplied by the hosts, and even for Bordeaux they were remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   At the reception, the aperitif was Krug Grande Annee champagne
in magnums. At my table the wines started with the 1982 vintages of
Chateaux Lascombes, Lafon-Rochet, Montrose, Gruaud-Larose and
Latour. Then came the 1961 Lascombes, the 1970 Lafon-Rochet, the
1979 Gruaud-Larose and the 1970 Montrose. They were followed by two
more from Chateau Latour, the 1966 and the star of the evening, the
1959. Two sweet Sauternes were served with the dessert: Chateau
Suduiraut 1975 and Chateau Rieussec 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Lavish as it was, this dinner was only one of many that evening
and merely one of the seemingly endless round all week long.
</P>
<P>
   Vinexpo is based in a convention center just north of here. The
main exhibition hall, about a mile long, houses most of the 2,400
exhibitors, grouped loosely by country. This year Eastern Europe
and Latin America were better represented than in the past.
Exhibitors from the United States included giants like E.&AMP; J.
Gallo, Canandaigua, Kendall Jackson and Robert Mondavi , along with
smaller producers like Duckhorn, Clos de Val and Bonny Doon.
</P>
<P>
   During Vinexpo, a social hierarchy quickly develops. At the top
are the fortunate few invited to stay at the most famous chateaus.
The best answer to the perennial question ``Did you have trouble
getting hotel rooms?'' is ``Well, actually, we're old friends of
Philippine'' _ de Rothschild, that is _ ``and we always stay at
Mouton.'' (``Old friends'' usually include some good customers.)
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, much of the time at dinners is spent discussing
other dinners and here, too, the hierarchy closely follows that of
the chateaus themselves. At the pinnacle are the five so-called
first growth chateaus, Haut-Brion, Latour, Lafite-Rothschild,
Margaux and Mouton-Rothschild. Then come the best-known of the
second growths, like Chateau Pichon-Lalande. An invitation from its
owner, May-Elaine de Lencquesaing, is as prized as one from a first
growth chateau. So, too, is one from Jean-Michel Cazes, the owner
of Chateau Lynch-Bages.
</P>
<P>
   The Gendarmerie is out patrolling in force for Vinexpo, trying
to rescue non-French-speaking visitors lost on the back roads. A
fortunate few use helicopters, the ultimate perk, to get from
Vinexpo to the chateau where they're staying and then to the
chateau where they're having dinner. The trick is to arrive a bit
late and say, ``My pilot got lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Vinexpo, deal-making in the guise of entertaining in
Bordeaux was a discreet, almost secretive phenomenon. Buyers and
potential buyers were met at the train station in Bordeaux and
whisked off to the chateaus before competitors could get to them.
There are stories of wine merchants' bribing bellhops and
concierges learn which buyers were in town and where they were
staying.
</P>
<P>
   Bordeaux has changed greatly in the past three decades, but the
tradition of lavish and stylish entertainment has survived.
Television crews come to the big parties and the best-known chateau
owners appear on talk shows to promote their wines.
</P>
<P>
   The region is still a bit starchy compared with Burgundy and
California. But the big parties here make it very clear that the
wine trade will never be like the plumbing supply business.

`LITTLE PAX' BANKS ON THE MILLENNIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Pax President Jeff Sagansky tells the story of
talking to a fellow airplane passenger, a guy who knew nothing
about the television business, and explaining that his nascent
network had a 1 rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who that one person is who is watching, but you
better keep him happy,'' the passenger replied.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so Pax has closer to 1 million viewers, and the story is
almost assuredly apocryphal, but you get the point.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year old, the seventh network is desperate for
attention, any kind of attention, as it weaves in more original
``family friendly'' programming to its lineup. It is rarely
mentioned in discussions on the state of television, an
afterthought, the home of CBS reruns like ``Touched by an Angel''
and ``Diagnosis Murder.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when many publications wrote last month about the
upcoming network fall lineups, Pax wasn't even included.
</P>
<P>
   But let's say that for one day, one stinkin', lousy, solitary
day, the network _ 30 or so channels removed from the rest of the
pack _ suddenly moved into the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   It would have to be something big, really big, and Pax has an
idea what it has to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pax TV, little Pax TV,'' spokesman Steve Sohmer said, ``is
going to own the millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe not all 1,000 years of it, but how about a day, 25
hours actually, with broadcast networks from around the world
linked to welcome in the year 2000 as it enters East to West?
</P>
<P>
   Pax TV, little Pax TV, would be the U.S. outlet.
</P>
<P>
   Now in addition to the networks, throw in some Internet
interaction, where people can soon start e-mailing in their hopes,
dreams, poems _ whatever _ for the next 1,000 years. What do you
have?
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be the first-ever global, live, interactive
broadcast,'' David McGuigan said.
</P>
<P>
   McGuigan knows big; the producer for the project was also
involved in the landmark 1985 Live Aid concert. It's a smart
gambit. After coming into being, the biggest headlines Pax received
were for an initial advertising campaign that was viewed as
anti-gay. After that ... nothing. Meanwhile, the network is
building a schedule of original programming in a unique way, by
time slots rather than days. This coming season, for example,
features all new 8 p.m. shows.
</P>
<P>
   Right now Pax is touting its growth. Then again, starting out
with zero viewers there had better be some. The network needs a
jump-start. Just one day, one really good day, would be a nice for
openers.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The advertisements are titled, ``famous chefs naked with their
blender.'' The first one appeared in the June issue of Food Arts, a
glossy trade magazine: Jean-Louis Palladin wearing nothing but some
jewelry, his glasses and a strategically placed Vita-Prep blender.
</P>
<P>
   The respected French-born chef at Palladin in Manhattan and Napa
in Las Vegas looks so sinewy and buff, a rumor spread that his
53-year-old head had been grafted onto a younger body. (Not true.)
The next models in the series may draw even closer scrutiny: Eric
Ripert of Le Bernardin and Aquavit's Marcus Samuelsson, two of the
food world's four-star heartthrobs.
</P>
<P>
   Ripert, for his part, is no stranger to the provocative pose. On
the cover of the Bernardin cookbook, published last year, he and
the restaurant's owner, Maguy Le Coze, smile mischievously behind a
table set with wineglasses and an ice bucket. Back to back, their
trim bodies are bent in a position known in the disco era as ``the
bump.''
</P>
<P>
   Cookbooks, television shows, magazines, personal appearances and
demonstrations, the whole business of ``branding'' _ success for
modern chefs can demand much more than just high-level cooking
skills. They need charm and glamor. And now, good looks: the chef
as hunk. It's a development that some chefs clearly revel in,
others tolerate and still others find silly and trivializing.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, chefs  &UR; are &LR;  hot, in celebrity terms, and cooking
has never been more cool. That combination has led to a power shift
in the culinary pantheon. Dionysus is out; Apollo is in. The portly
middle-aged epicures who would never be seen out of the kitchen
during service have been replaced by pretty-boy wonders who work
out, ride motorcycles and accessorize their whites with the
occasional piercing or tattoo.
</P>
<P>
   The chef-hunk _ ``chunk,'' if you will _ is visible on almost
every other page of Bobby Flay's latest cookbook, ``Boy Meets
Grill'' (Hyperion, $32.50). For every five recipes, the reader gets
one picture of Flay, a generous ratio by cookbook standards.
</P>
<P>
   When Jean-Christophe Novelli flew to New York from London last
month to promote the American edition of his titillatingly titled
cookbook, ``Your Place or Mine'' (Clarkson N. Potter, $35), his
arrival was heralded by a barrage of smoldering head shots _
forelock dangling, dark eyes burning _ and news that the British
magazine Harper's &AMP; Queen had voted him the world's fifth sexiest
man: ``Tall, dark, and delicious,'' it gushed.
</P>
<P>
   An article in the June issue of Food &AMP; Wine on ``Sex and the
Single Chef'' goes even further, likening chefs to groupie-plagued
rock stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of women think chefs are hot,'' the article reports.
``And that's just where the trouble starts.''
</P>
<P>
   Still dominated by men, the profession is being aggressively
marketed to its female following. Dana Cowin, Food &AMP; Wine's editor
in chief, said she published this breathless display of chef
idolatry because ``there's a buzz out there about how attractive
they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Palladin has been a respected New York chef for 30 years, but
welcomes the attention from the Vita-Prep ad. In fact, over coffee
one morning last week at the Time Hotel, which houses his
restaurant, he seemed to be basking in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are a chef, you are a sex symbol,'' he said, good-humored
irony inflecting his thick French accent. ``It is a part of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there have always been sexy chefs. The difference nowadays
is that the ones blessed with looks as good as their soufflees are
being packaged and sold for both attributes.
</P>
<P>
   In August, both Vogue and P.O.V. magazine will feature chefs in
fashion spreads. Anthony Giglio, a senior editor at P.O.V., a
monthly manual for ambitious twentysomethings, said that the chefs'
publicity people were more than eager to place their clients in the
spread.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must have called 20 reps for this story,'' he said. ``And
every single one of them had head shots ready to send overnight.
They ranged from straightforward, in whites with toque, to surreal
fashion poses, like the one of John Villa'' of Park View at the
Boathouse in Central Park. He was, Giglio recalled, ``in black
jeans and a black muscle T-shirt walking his Doberman _ the women
on the staff were swooning.''
</P>
<P>
   Vogue employed one of its top fashion photographers, Steven
Meisel, to shoot Matthew Kenney, 30, in the kitchen of his SoHo
restaurant, Monzu. The concept of the article, Kenney said, was
``urban chic'' _ models posing with an architect, a writer, him.
``The fact that a chef would appear in that group is pretty cool,''
Kenney said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenney is also the subject of ``Life With a Side of Fries,'' a
film in production that has been likened to the fashion documentary
``Unzipped,'' with Kenney as its Isaac Mizrahi. The director and
producer of the documentary, Matthew Pestorius, said he chose
Kenney because he ``makes a great main character _ he's sort of
brooding.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when trying to get a documentary made, it helps to
have a leading man as handsome as any Hollywood actor. ``In the
course of going around getting financing for the film, we can throw
down a picture of Matthew and say, `Look, here's the star,' and
both women and men are, like, `Wow!' It's definitely a selling
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Many chefs reluctantly acknowledge that glamour has become a
necessity in their business. ``We don't have any choice,'' Kenney
said, ``if we want to compete in the market.''

 &HT;    SENATE PANEL VOTES TO EXPAND CARIBBEAN TRADE PREFERENCES
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Responding to last year's hurricanes and the threat
of increased competition from Asia, a Senate panel Tuesday agreed
to expand the Caribbean Basin trade initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous action in the Senate Finance Committee came as the
panel considered a package of bills to reauthorize trade laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Caribbean trade bill would expand the 1983 program to give
tariff preferences to formerly excluded items such as certain
textile and apparel products, footwear, canned tuna, petroleum and
watches and watch parts through 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., who sponsored the Caribbean trade bill,
said its purpose has evolved from giving the 25 CBI countries in
the Caribbean and Central America parity with Mexico to offering
humanitarian assistance following last fall's hurricanes Georges
and Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   But Graham said a new rationale for expanding Caribbean trade
looms in the near future when the international multi-fiber
agreement, which limits the quantity of apparel goods that each
country may sell, lapses in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Holding up two nearly identical sport shirts _ one made in
Nicaragua, one in China _ Graham said there was one important
difference. The shirt made in Nicaragua was assembled from textiles
and thread from the United States, while the shirt made in China
was produced from fabric and thread from China.
</P>
<P>
   Once the multi-fiber agreement lapses, cheaper apparel made in
China and elsewhere in Asia could flood U.S. markets, driving out
apparel made from U.S. textiles, Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   In other action, the committee rejected, 11-9, a proposal that
would have extended up to $10,000 a year in assistance to farmers
hurt by foreign imports.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., who offered the amendment with Sen.
Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said it would ``put farmers at a level
playing field'' with other workers who receive such benefits if
they lose their jobs because of foreign imports.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman William Roth, R-Del., urged committee members to
address the issue next fall but not to adopt the amendment now.

 UNDATED: the market.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is no longer desirable for a chef aspiring to superstardom to
look like a Wagnerian baritone in a toque. Karine Bakhoum, a
publicist for many New York chefs, including Kenney, often advises
her clients to indulge less in their own art. ``Some of them,
they're fat and it's OK,'' she said. ``But others, they want to be
the next Bobby Flay and we're, like, forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Murphy, 30, the chef at La Forchette, is also in the P.O.V.
fashion spread, looking fit in a form-fitting leather coat. He said
he ``doesn't have time'' to go to a gym, but stretches every
morning and hits a heavy bag at home, ``instead of beating up on
the sous-chef.''
</P>
<P>
   He also rides his Ducati motorcycle to and from work every day.
``Riding a bike is a workout,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs can hardly be blamed for being more appearance conscious.
They're far more visible than ever before, in this era of the open
kitchen and, especially, the TV Food Network. One indicator of the
changing nature of chefs' fame is the volume of fan mail the
network receives. Recipes aren't the only things viewers request,
said Heidi Diamond, its senior vice president of marketing.
``Indecent proposals'' are not uncommon, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're passionate about these cute-boy chefs for a variety of
reasons,'' she said. ``Food is so sensual. There's something magic
about these people's hands and the way that they caress a knife or
handle a naked potato.''
</P>
<P>
   They are also accessible in a way that few stars are anymore. A
smitten fan can visit a chef's restaurant, eat his food, meet him,
perhaps even touch him.
</P>
<P>
   For publicity-shy chefs, this accessibility can be a
distraction. Floyd Cardoz, the soft-spoken chef at Tabla, is as
acclaimed as any of his high-profile contemporaries but an almost
invisible presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't, as a rule, just walk the dining room,'' he said.
``Unless I know the person or it's a good friend.'' Cardoz, who has
no personal publicist, added, ``I'm happy I don't get recognized
outside the restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   In the chef-eat-chef world of New York restaurants, does the
camera-ready hunk stand a better chance of survival or success than
the quiet craftsman? ``I don't think it's easier to get a good
job,'' said Michael Batterberry, the editor of Food Arts magazine.
``I think it's easier to get media coverage. But if the talent is
equal, the better-looking guy has the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   And many aspiring chefs entering the business know it. Graduates
of the New York Restaurant School are ``hungry for attention,''
said Brendan Keenan, a program director at the school for eight
years. ``Previous generations of chefs let the food talk for
itself,'' he said. ``Now they want to be recognized by face and
name, as well as the food.''
</P>
<P>
   Recognized they are. Even hard-core foodies now inspect chefs'
8-by-10 glossies almost as closely as their menus. Jane Miller,
associate editor of publications at the James Beard Foundation,
said, ``We get pictures of chefs coming to cook at the Beard House
and we're always on the lookout for cute ones.''
</P>
<P>
   She said one member of the publications staff has a picture of
Samuelsson as her screen saver. This weekend, Samuelsson, the chef
at Aquavit, posed naked for the third ad in Vita-Prep's blender
series.
</P>
<P>
   When, a concerned diner might wonder, do chefs find time to
cook?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another example of how chefs are being spread thin, with
fashion shoots and everything,'' Ms. Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   The topic makes many chefs, and their editors, uncomfortable.
Neither Ripert nor Miss Le Coze would comment on their frisky
cookbook cover shot. And Judy Kern, editor of ``Le Bernardin Cook
Book: Four-Star Simplicity'' (Doubleday, $35), played it down. ``I
don't know if it's because they're good-looking or not
good-looking,'' she said. ``We could have put fish on the cover,
but we thought this would be a more interesting and inviting
image.''
</P>
<P>
   Flay, 34, hesitatingly agreed that his title, ``Boy Meets
Grill,'' was ``obviously a play on boy-meets-girl.'' And he
acknowledged the link between sex and fine food. ``I think that
cooking is a very sexy thing,'' he said. ``It's the old cliche that
the way to a girl's heart is through her stomach. And if you're a
professional chef, you have that ace in the hole.'' But when it
comes to the exploitation of his looks as a marketing tool, ``I'm
not that comfortable with it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask my publisher why they put all those pictures of me in the
book,'' he suggested. His publisher declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many ``Baywatch'' stars yearning to be taken seriously,
today's chefs want to be appreciated as artists, not beefcake. As
they should be. But they might want to keep in mind that when James
Beard endorsed Cuisinart, he kept his apron on.

WHITE WINES OF MEDOC 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Les Arums de Lagrange 1997, Chateau Lagrange, Bordeaux, France.
About $22. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For many years, the only important Bordeaux white wines were the
sweet wines of Sauternes and the dry whites made in the Graves
region, led by the white of the Chateau Haut-Brion. North of the
city, in the Medoc region, the only significant white wine was
Pavillon Blanc, from Chateau Margaux.
</P>
<P>
   According to the tough Bordeaux wine regulations, the Medoc is
red wine country and no white wine can carry any of the prestigious
appellations like Pauillac, St.-Julien or Margaux. Even Pavillon
Blanc can use only a Bordeaux appellation.
</P>
<P>
   Now a few other Medoc chateaus are putting out white wines,
gambling that their own reputations will outweigh the lack of a
prestigious appellation. The latest of these is Chateau Lagrange,
in St.-Julien. Les Arums de Lagrange is a blend of 60 percent
sauvignon blanc, 30 percent semillon and 10 percent muscadelle.
</P>
<P>
   The wine is elegant, harmonious and, unlike many sauvignon
blancs, it is not overly acidic. It will appeal to those who like
the Bordeaux style in white wines, and might even lure away some
committed chardonnay fans.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, les arums means the calla lilies in French.

AN ANCIENT GRAIN, NEWLY AU COURANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cachet of peasant food in this country and in Italy just
keeps growing. Farro is one of the more recent examples. As
Americans have been discovering this whole-grain variety of wheat,
Italians have been rediscovering it.
</P>
<P>
   It's now found in the best Italian restaurants, both here and in
the mother country. And when it's cooked like risotto and served as
farrotto, it may eventually displace arborio rice because it is not
just ``new,'' but also a good source of fiber.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is a whole grain it is perfect for all the current
diets that forbid white carbohydrates like white flour, white rice
and, of course, white sugar.
</P>
<P>
   After eating farrotto at Le Madri last week, I vowed to make it
part of my culinary repertory. Farro is a bit like barley but much
firmer, and slightly nutty like brown rice. It can be used like
barley in soups, but it is most appealing in risotto mode.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a lot of personality,'' said Marta Pulini, a consultant
to Le Madri and all the rest of Pino Luongo's restaurants. ``Serve
it with something strong, like morels or butternut squash or
dandelions.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pulini remembers farro from her childhood because her mother
came from Umbria, where farro is commonly used. ``It was food for
country people,'' she said. ``Even in Italy it was not so well
known, but in recent years there has been much more interest in
country food because it is healthy and it is made by artisans.''
</P>
<P>
   By that Ms. Pulini means that the farro is grown organically on
small farms. (At least so far.) As for its healthfulness, farro has
about the same nutritional value as the whole wheat in breads: high
in B vitamins, vitamin E, magnesium, selenium and, of course,
fiber.
</P>
<P>
   Farro was one of the first grains used in the Mediterranean
region. It has been found in ancient Egyptian tombs, but after
ancient times, it was gradually replaced in the Middle Ages when
new varieties of wheat were cultivated.
</P>
<P>
   In this country farro is sometimes confused with spelt, another
ancient type of wheat, and spelt is sometimes sold as farro, but
they cannot be used interchangeably.
</P>
<P>
   Farro has to be soaked before cooking in farrotto; the time
depends on its age and therefore hardness. Soaking overnight is
best; the farro will then cook in about 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Farro prices vary radically, from $4.60 to $13 for 17 ounces. It
is available in Manhattan at Agata &AMP; Valentina, 1505 First Avenue
(79th Street), 212-452-0690; Buon Italia in the Chelsea Market, 75
Ninth Avenue (15th Street), 212-633-9090; Dean &AMP; DeLuca, 560
Broadway (Prince Street), 212-431-1691; Fairway, 2127 Broadway
(74th Streets), 212-595-1888, and Grace's Marketplace, 1237 Third
Avenue (71st Street), 212-737-0600. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FARROTTO WITH FAVA BEANS, TOMATO AND MARJORAM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Le Madri &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 45 minutes plus soaking overnight &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 cups farro
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons minced shallots
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, smashed
</P>
<P>
   1 cup peeled and diced ripe tomato (1 large)
</P>
<P>
   { cup blanched and peeled fava beans
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fresh marjoram leaves, washed and torn
</P>
<P>
   { cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. In a bowl filled with warm water, soak farro overnight at
room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a large, shallow pan over medium heat, add 1{ tablespoons
of the olive oil, the butter, shallots and garlic. Simmer 2 to 3
minutes, stirring continuously with a wooden spoon.
</P>
<P>
   3. Drain farro, and add to pan. When the grains are well coated
with oil and butter, start adding hot water little by little, just
enough to cover the farro. Stir often, and continue adding hot
water if needed.
</P>
<P>
   4. After about 10 minutes of cooking, add the tomato. Keep
stirring to prevent grains from sticking to pan. At this point the
farro should be just about cooked, its texture al dente. Add fava
beans; remove from heat.
</P>
<P>
   5. Add marjoram, cheese and remaining oil. Season with salt and
pepper. Stir, and serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 servings as an appetizer or side dish. &QL;

   BELGRADE _ NATO killed far more Serb civilians than soldiers
during its 11-week bombardment of the country and most of the
Yugoslav Third Army emerged unscathed from the massive air attacks
on its forces in Kosovo, according to evidence emerging in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officers have been astonished that thousands of Yugoslav
battle tanks, missile launchers, artillery batteries, personnel
carriers and trucks have been withdrawn from the province with
barely a scratch on their armor.
</P>
<P>
   At least 60,000 Yugoslav troops rather than the 40,000 estimated
by NATO _ were waiting to fight the Western armies in Kosovo if
NATO had mounted a land campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav military sources say that more than half the 600 or so
soldiers who died in Serbia were killed in guerrilla fighting with
the Kosovo Liberation Army rather than by NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   They added that military preparations for war began a year ago
when military intelligence in Belgrade learned that the United
States was building a secret satellite targeting navigation station
at a remote airfield in Bulgaria, close to the Serbian border.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it has also become clear that the entry of Russian
forces into Kosovo _ far from being the act of ``renegade
soldiers'' or a ``misunderstanding,'' as the White House would have
it _ was organized a week before NATO troops entered the province.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry of defense in Moscow sent a coded message to
Russian troops at Uglevik in Bosnia _ not far from the
American-controlled air base at Tuzla _ ordering them to take
Pristina airport in advance of British forces; the Russian name for
their troops' arrival in Kosovo was ``Operation Shield.''
</P>
<P>
   Wartime statistics are notoriously unreliable _ and they are
still slippery in the immediate aftermath of war _ but
investigation of NATO bombing incidents during the bombardment by
western correspondents and humanitarian agencies appear to confirm
the official civilian casualty toll of around 1,500.
</P>
<P>
   At least 450 of these died in NATO's repeated ``mistakes,'' when
alliance aircraft bombed a train at Grdelica, a road bridge at
Varvarin, housing blocks at Surdulica, Aleksinac and Cuprija, a bus
at Luzane, an Albanian refugee convoy in Kosovo and other attacks
on civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Many others died in what NATO referred to as ``collateral
damage'' _ in attacks around Belgrade, Kraljevo, Kragujevac, Nis
and Novi Sad.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures given to ``The Independent'' by a Yugoslav
military source, only 132 members of the armed forces here were
killed in NATO attacks. General Nebojsa Pavkovic, the commander of
the Yugoslav Third Army has given a different figure: 169 soldiers
killed in Kosovo under NATO assault and 299 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic says that 462 members of
the Yugoslav army and 112 police (including the MUP, the interior
ministry forces) were killed during the war.
</P>
<P>
   But more than 300 soldiers are thought to have died in guerrilla
attacks, several in explosions following the theft of two trucks
loaded with Yugoslav army land mines by the KLA in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Enquiries by ``The Independent'' in Kosovo suggest that Serbian
troops died at KLA hands in Djakovica, Stimlje, Pudujevo and
Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation this weekend of military fatalities among
soldiers whose homes were in the center of Novi Sad _ Yugoslavia's
third largest city _ turned up only two names: that of a reservist
who was murdered by the KLA in Pristina after the peace agreement
was announced and the commander of a SAM-6 missile battery who was
killed in action by NATO planes 20 miles from the city on June 1. &QL;

   Many others died in what NATO referred to as ``collateral
damage'' _ in attacks around Belgrade, Kraljevo, Kragujevac, Nis
and Novi Sad.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures given to ``The Independent'' by a Yugoslav
military source, only 132 members of the armed forces here were
killed in NATO attacks. General Nebojsa Pavkovic, the commander of
the Yugoslav Third Army has given a different figure: 169 soldiers
killed in Kosovo under NATO assault and 299 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic says that 462 members of
the Yugoslav army and 112 police (including the MUP, the interior
ministry forces) were killed during the war.
</P>
<P>
   But more than 300 soldiers are thought to have died in guerrilla
attacks, several in explosions following the theft of two trucks
loaded with Yugoslav army land mines by the KLA in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Enquiries by ``The Independent'' in Kosovo suggest that Serbian
troops died at KLA hands in Djakovica, Stimlje, Pudujevo and
Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation this weekend of military fatalities among
soldiers whose homes were in the center of Novi Sad _ Yugoslavia's
third largest city _ turned up only two names: that of a reservist
who was murdered by the KLA in Pristina after the peace agreement
was announced and the commander of a SAM-6 missile battery who was
killed in action by NATO planes 20 miles from the city on June 1. &QL;

HEALTH CARE BECOMES TWO-WAY STREET FOR HUMANS, PETS 
</HEADLINE>

 By MARINA PISANO  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The squirming shock of bright-orange fur looks
like an ordinary house cat, purrs like a cat, sheds like a cat. But
this 10-year-old tabby is far from ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, O.J. (named for the breakfast drink, not that
trial-of-the-century guy) is a veterinary marvel and something of a
pet celeb. Nine years out from surgery, he is, according to the
pioneer in the field, the longest living feline kidney transplant
recipient in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Extraordinary, yes. But beyond the medical landmark, this San
Antonio cat's tale reflects something frequently seen in millions
of American homes these days _ a human/pet bond so strong that the
health and quality of life of dogs, cats and other companion
animals have become central concerns in family life.
</P>
<P>
   Many factors are driving this human/pet bond. Scientific studies
reveal the blood-pressure-reducing power of an affectionate
animal's greeting after a harried, stressful work day.
</P>
<P>
   Animals ranging from parakeets to ponies have a proven
therapeutic effect on elderly nursing home residents and physically
disabled or emotionally troubled adults and children. But larger
demographic factors come into play as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are fewer and fewer traditional families,'' said Dr.
John August, professor of small-animal medicine at Texas A&AMP;M
University's College of Veterinary Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Middle-age empty-nesters, lonely older Americans with
geographically scattered families, two-career couples delaying
childbirth and single-parent families seeking added companionship _
millions lavish love on their pets and get back unshakable
devotion. August points to discussion in the profession about
actually merging human and pet health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the next 20 years or so, you will see practices
composed of both physicians and veterinarians working together
because pets will have become so closely integrated into the
family. That's speculation, but all the indicators are pointing in
that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not far-fetched when you consider that 60 percent of U.S.
households, more than 58 million, have a cat or dog in residence,
according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. And these
are not all backyard dogs. For a growing number of people, pets are
more than four-footed diversions. They are cherished family
members.
</P>
<P>
   The American Animal Hospital Association says Americans spend
$20 billion every year on care for pets. Pet health insurance,
which makes high-tech procedures for animals more affordable, is
yet another aspect of the strong human-pet bond. You insure the
family. You insure your dog or cat. The Veterinary Pet Insurance
company has some 850,000 pet policyholders.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, stories like O.J.'s are common, said San Antonio
veterinarian Robert Wilbanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In veterinary medicine, we perform procedures on a daily basis
that are not much different than those performed for a human being
_ for a child. Pets are part of the family unit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O.J., who weighs in at a chunky 14 pounds and grrrs with
annoyance when you rub his tummy _ pat the head, please _ surprised
a lot of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never expected him to live this long,'' said Nancy Norris,
O.J.'s owner. ``We thought we were going to add maybe three or four
more years to his life with the transplant. And we would have been
happy with that. Now we hope he'll live a normal life, maybe until
he's 15 or 20.''
</P>
<P>
   Death appeared imminent in March 1990, when O.J., then a scrappy
kitten who showed up one day in Norris' back yard, lapped up some
sweet-tasting antifreeze from the garage floor. The cat looked and
acted sick, but it was hours before Norris and her husband, Paul,
made the connection to antifreeze from a leaky radiator hose. They
rushed O.J. to ``Dr. Bob,'' as they call Wilbanks.
</P>
<P>
   Antifreeze is ethylene glycol, and it metabolizes into oxalate
crystals in the kidneys. Simply put, it plugs up the filtering
tubules, so the animal can't produce urine. Toxic waste stays in
the bloodstream, kidneys shut down and cardiovascular failure,
convulsions, coma and death can follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``All tests indicated he was in renal failure,'' Wilbanks
recounted.
</P>
<P>
   The veterinarian immediately began diuresis, intravenously
pumping large amounts of liquid into the cat to flush out the toxic
substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as he was on an IV, he was OK. He wouldn't have lived
off the IV,'' Wilbanks said.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor got on the phone to his old surgery professor at
Auburn University, who told him of the feline kidney transplant
work of Dr. Clare Gregory at the University of California at Davis
veterinary teaching hospital. A day later, O.J. was on a plane to
Sacramento, where Paul Norris rented a car and drove the patient to
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``People thought we were crazy doing all this for a cat,'' Nancy
Norris said. ``But we loved O.J. so, and the kids (sons then 3 and
4) loved him so much, we couldn't let him die.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Gregory's center was involved in developing the use of
cyclosporine, the immunosuppressant that fights rejection of
transplanted organs. That work in animals led to use of the drug in
humans.
</P>
<P>
   By 1990, he was the only person doing kidney transplants on
cats. Like humans, animals can live with only one healthy kidney.
And, like humans, they can take cyclosporine to battle transplant
rejection.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon's policy was _ and has remained over about 130 such
operations _ not to kill one cat to save another. After testing for
blood-group compatibility, a healthy female lab cat named Rocky was
chosen to provide a kidney for O.J. Two weeks after surgery, O.J.
was back home chasing butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason he did so well is he was so young and healthy,''
Gregory said. ``Most of the cats we see are an average of 12 years
old, and they have deterioration of kidney function.''
</P>
<P>
   At Davis, 90 percent of transplanted cats go home with a
functioning kidney. A year after transplant, 65 percent to 75
percent of the cats are alive with a working kidney.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment is not cheap. Today, the feline kidney transplant
package at Davis runs $2,500 to $4,500, depending on the animal's
general health and any complications. The Norris family spent
$2,000.
</P>
<P>
   But money was just part of the commitment. Twice a day, the
Norrises give O.J. a gel capsule that they have filled with a tiny
dose of cyclosporine. He also gets prednisone, a steroid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't even leave him for a few days with a neighbor,''
Nancy Norris said. ``We have to board him because he needs to get
the medication. And, he's an indoor cat, so he's not subject to
diseases or fights with other cats.''
</P>
<P>
   The cat leads a protected, cushy life, generally ignoring the
family's playful Doberman pinscher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our friends say that when they die, they want to come back as
O.J.,'' Norris said.

   BELGRADE _ NATO officers began to realize the discrepancy
between their own claims and reality within hours of the start of
the Yugoslav military withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   In just the first stage of the Serbian retreat, they logged 250
tanks moving out of Kosovo _ all undamaged _ and at least 40,000
men. This was supposed to be the troop strength of the entire Third
Army; thousands more soldiers left in the next three days.
</P>
<P>
   All of which casts serious doubt on NATO's wartime propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   On April 17, for example, NATO spokesman James Shea was boasting
that the alliance was ``knocking the stuffing out of Milosevic''
while General Wesley Clark, the NATO commander, said on May 27 that
after 27,000 NATO sorties, his pilots had conducted ``the most
accurate bombing campaign in history.''
</P>
<P>
   Although NATO repeatedly struck power stations and
radio-television repeater stations _ and suggested that it had
killed more than 500 Yugoslav soldiers in a B-52 raid on Kosovo in
the last week of bombing _ it seems to have caused little damage to
Serbian military equipment.
</P>
<P>
   General Nebojsa Pavkovic's claim that his Third Army lost seven
tanks, three transporters, 13 antitank guns and other artillery
could not be disputed after a 400-mile tour of some of the most
heavily-bombed areas of Kosovo last week.
</P>
<P>
   During my entire journey, I saw only four damaged Yugoslav army
trucks, two abandoned trucks and a destroyed Serbian military jeep.
Numerous barracks had been totally destroyed by Cruise missiles _
but the buildings appeared to have been empty when they were
struck.
</P>
<P>
   A Yugoslav military official in Belgrade claimed that Third Army
troops had discovered how to avoid attack. ``They fired their
missiles and then replaced the batteries with mock-ups,'' the
source said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time it took NATO's photo reconnaissance people to
identify the point of fire and the vehicle location and return to
bomb the mock-up was a minimum of 12 hours. So we knew when we had
to move our equipment _ every 12 hours.``
</P>
<P>
   The same source also said that army missile technicians had
taken apart an unexploded U.S. Tomahawk missile and concluded that
its targeting partly depended on a chip that guided the rocket to
its target by heat sources rather than imagery.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Yugoslav reservists were set to work burning tires
beside major road and rail bridges that would emit greater heat
than the surface of the bridges themselves, and also painting the
road on Kosovo bridges in many different colors _ because the
colors emit different degrees of heat.
</P>
<P>
   The tarmac of many bridges in southern Kosovo are in fact still
colored in red, yellow, purple and green rectangles. &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav air force was meanwhile hidden from view. Although
a number of its machines were destroyed _ including three that were
shot down _ several Mig-29s were moved around the country,
sometimes secreted at night in the trees off the roadway west of
Belgrade, surrounded by farm machinery and metal sheeting so that
NATO's photo reconnaissance officers would not recognize their
``signature.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't enough room for the Mig-29s to fly in,'' an
official here said. ``The sooner you take off, you're approaching
your own border. We quickly realized that flying was out and that
combat was hopeless. The order was to sit and protect the aircraft,
to save the lives of our pilots.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So why did Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic agree to the
entry of international troops into Kosovo when his army was still
ready to fight?
</P>
<P>
   Some say he feared that a ground war would lead NATO troops all
the way to Belgrade _ and his own dispatch to the Hague on
war-crimes charges.
</P>
<P>
   But another source suggests that Victor Chernomyrdin, Moscow's
Balkan peace envoy and the head of Russia's multimillion dollar
Gasprom project, threatened to cut off all gas to Yugoslavia if
Belgrade did not accept the NATO-EU-Russian ``peace'' terms. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 225 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 675) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military is known to have been angered by
Chernomyrdin's activities_ indeed, a Russian general publicly
denounced the agreement as ``confused'' in the envoy's presence on
his return to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   And the Russian military clearly acted in defiance of its
political leadership when it sent the first Russian contingent into
Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   The officers involved had learned of NATO's desire to make their
headquarters at Slatina when they heard NATO radio transmissions
referring to Slatina as ``Tuzla 2'' _ Tuzla being the NATO airstrip
in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, according to the Yugoslavs, decided to move into Slatina
while NATO commanders were arguing over whether British or U.S.
troops should enter Kosovo first.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being an insignificant Balkan airfield _ as British
General Sir Michael Jackson has portrayed Pristina airport _ the
military air base is one of the most sophisticated in ex-Yugoslavia
with an underground runway and nuclear-proof bunkers.
</P>
<P>
   At least six Yugoslav Mig-21 jets spent the war there _
undamaged by NATO bombing _ and flew out of the air base before
NATO troops arrived in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians reportedly want to transport into Kosovo Russian
troops from the 106th Guards Division at Tula (two of whose
regiments fought in Afghanistan) and from the 76th Guards Division
based at Pskoff near St. Petersburg. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade's first suspicions that the Americans might be planning
a military campaign against them were aroused last summer when
Yugoslav military intelligence officers learned that U.S. forces
were building a MASH-type hospital in Bulgaria close to the River
Yerma.
</P>
<P>
   These suspicions, according to one official, were increased when
Belgrade heard that the Americans were constructing a reserve
military air base at Kustendil in Bulgaria _ a base which they say
was used during NATO's war as a targeting navigation station for
B-52s and a transport base for C-130 transport aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the war, the army realized they could survive when NATO
started bombing civilian targets,'' the Yugoslav source said. ``We
came to the conclusion that NATO knew it couldn't find our vehicles
concealed in the hills and forests so it deliberately targeted
civilians and civilian infrastructure. That's when we knew we could
maintain our battle readiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bombing of dozens of civilian targets, NATO
repeatedly stated that it never intended to cause civilian
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   What has not, predictably, emerged here are the grim statistics
of ``ethnic cleansing'' and the degree to which the regular
Yugoslav army did _ or did not _ have a hand in the assault on
Kosovo's Albanian population.
</P>
<P>
   Most eyewitness reports of massacres over the past two months
suggest that paramilitary or interior ministry forces rather than
regular troops were principally involved.
</P>
<P>
   But last month's indictments against Yugoslav leaders by the
International War Crimes Tribunal include the name of General
Dragoljub Ojdanic, the Yugoslav army chief of staff. &QL;

Gasprom project, threatened to cut off all gas to Yugoslavia if
Belgrade did not accept the NATO-EU-Russian ``peace'' terms. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 225 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 675) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military is known to have been angered by
Chernomyrdin's activities_ indeed, a Russian general publicly
denounced the agreement as ``confused'' in the envoy's presence on
his return to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   And the Russian military clearly acted in defiance of its
political leadership when it sent the first Russian contingent into
Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   The officers involved had learned of NATO's desire to make their
headquarters at Slatina when they heard NATO radio transmissions
referring to Slatina as ``Tuzla 2'' _ Tuzla being the NATO airstrip
in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, according to the Yugoslavs, decided to move into Slatina
while NATO commanders were arguing over whether British or U.S.
troops should enter Kosovo first.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being an insignificant Balkan airfield _ as British
General Sir Michael Jackson has portrayed Pristina airport _ the
military air base is one of the most sophisticated in ex-Yugoslavia
with an underground runway and nuclear-proof bunkers.
</P>
<P>
   At least six Yugoslav Mig-21 jets spent the war there _
undamaged by NATO bombing _ and flew out of the air base before
NATO troops arrived in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians reportedly want to transport into Kosovo Russian
troops from the 106th Guards Division at Tula (two of whose
regiments fought in Afghanistan) and from the 76th Guards Division
based at Pskoff near St. Petersburg. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade's first suspicions that the Americans might be planning
a military campaign against them were aroused last summer when
Yugoslav military intelligence officers learned that U.S. forces
were building a MASH-type hospital in Bulgaria close to the River
Yerma.
</P>
<P>
   These suspicions, according to one official, were increased when
Belgrade heard that the Americans were constructing a reserve
military air base at Kustendil in Bulgaria _ a base which they say
was used during NATO's war as a targeting navigation station for
B-52s and a transport base for C-130 transport aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the war, the army realized they could survive when NATO
started bombing civilian targets,'' the Yugoslav source said. ``We
came to the conclusion that NATO knew it couldn't find our vehicles
concealed in the hills and forests so it deliberately targeted
civilians and civilian infrastructure. That's when we knew we could
maintain our battle readiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bombing of dozens of civilian targets, NATO
repeatedly stated that it never intended to cause civilian
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   What has not, predictably, emerged here are the grim statistics
of ``ethnic cleansing'' and the degree to which the regular
Yugoslav army did _ or did not _ have a hand in the assault on
Kosovo's Albanian population.
</P>
<P>
   Most eyewitness reports of massacres over the past two months
suggest that paramilitary or interior ministry forces rather than
regular troops were principally involved.
</P>
<P>
   But last month's indictments against Yugoslav leaders by the
International War Crimes Tribunal include the name of General
Dragoljub Ojdanic, the Yugoslav army chief of staff. &QL;

<P>
   The Earl of Wessex had a royal photographer digitally manipulate
his official wedding photographs to make Prince William look more
cheerful, it emerged Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Geoffrey Shakerley, who took the photographs at Saturday's
wedding in Windsor, admitted he had replaced the figure of William
in the shot released to the Press, with a shot from a different
frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prince Edward said he didn't think Prince William looked
absolutely his best, so digitally we were able to put in another
picture of Prince William from one of the other shots where he is
smiling and laughing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Geoffrey also revealed that a new ``alternative'' official
photograph of the wedding couple is to be released, showing them
superimposed against a ``cleaner background'' than the cabinet now
behind them.
</P>
<P>
   The moves were condemned by Horst Faas, European photo editor of
the Associated Press news agency and a legendary photojournalist.
He said it was a ``terrible precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``How can we trust the official handout photographs
from the Palace if something like this is happening? To change a
picture is against the very basic rules of photojournalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``All our editors are permitted to do is improve the quality by
cropping or removing specks of dust. You can't make the sky blue
when it was a grey, rainy day. A photo is a photo, is a photo and
you shouldn't tamper with it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sir Geoffrey said Monday night: ``I'm sure Prince William
would like the best picture of himself. I hope I haven't in any way
erred. I feel very strongly that poor Prince William has a hard
enough time as it is so I don't want to bring him into the picture
by doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not the first experience the Royals have had of
photographic manipulation, but it is the first time that they have
approved it.
</P>
<P>
   A recent example was before the death of Diana, Princess of
Wales, when a tabloid newspaper rotated Dodi Fayed's head to make
it look as if he was about to kiss her. &QL;

BILL TO STRANGLE ANTIQUITIES ACT WILL HURT GOP

 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   
 c.1999 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rep. James Hansen, R-Utah, is still smarting over President
Clinton's
</P>
<P>
   use of the Antiquities Act of 1906 to create the Grand
</P>
<P>
   Staircase-Escalante National Monument in southeastern Utah in
1996. So
</P>
<P>
   Hansen, who is a member of the House Resources Committee and
chairs the
</P>
<P>
   Subcommittee on National Parks and Public Lands, has introduced
a bill
</P>
<P>
   to limit the president's power under the Antiquities Act.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen's bill is called the `National Monument NEPA Compliance
Act`
</P>
<P>
   (H.R. 1487). NEPA stands for the National Environmental Policy
Act,
</P>
<P>
   which became law in 1969. On the surface, the bill simply
requires that
</P>
<P>
   any designation of a national monument must first comply with
NEPA. But
</P>
<P>
   it does much more than that.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also requires that any designated monument skip over
the
</P>
<P>
   environmental assessment required by NEPA and jump to the more
rigorous
</P>
<P>
   environmental impact statement (EIS). An environmental
assessment is an
</P>
<P>
   analysis to see if an EIS is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   H.R. 1487 demands more than NEPA. It requires formal hearings
during all
</P>
<P>
   phases of the development of the EIS, requires an additional six
months
</P>
<P>
   of public review on the draft EIS, then four more months of
public
</P>
<P>
   hearings on the final EIS.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before Hansen's subcommittee on June 17, John
Leshy,
</P>
<P>
   solicitor of the Department of Interior, stated: `None of these
steps is
</P>
<P>
   currently required under NEPA or the NEPA regulations. Mandating
all
</P>
<P>
   these procedural barriers for every national monument
designation, no
</P>
<P>
   matter how small or how urgent, would be contrary to both
protective
</P>
<P>
   purposes of the Antiquities Act and the flexible approach of the
NEPA
</P>
<P>
   regulations. In addition, the bill would delay Antiquities Act
</P>
<P>
   protection still further by preventing the president from
designating a
</P>
<P>
   national monument for at least 30 days after the record of
decision [for
</P>
<P>
   the EIS) is approved.`
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Hansen wants to stall the designation of any new
national
</P>
<P>
   monuments. It's a misguided jab at Clinton -- and a colossal
waste of
</P>
<P>
   time and taxpayer dollars. If the bill were to pass in the House
and the
</P>
<P>
   Senate, it is likely that Clinton would veto it. Leshy told the
</P>
<P>
   subcommittee that if the bill is `presented to the president,
the
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of the Interior will recommend that he veto the bill.`
</P>
<P>
   Hansen introduced a bill (H.R. 1127) attacking the Antiquities
Act in
</P>
<P>
   the last session of Congress. It passed in the House, but never
got out
</P>
<P>
   of committee in the Senate. Hansen has an ax to grind -- against
the
</P>
<P>
   crown jewels of this nation's heritage.
</P>
<P>
   The Antiquities Act, as Leshy pointed out, is one of this
nation's most
</P>
<P>
   successful environmental laws. Fourteen of the 17 presidents
since the
</P>
<P>
   act was passed have set aside over 100 national monuments, most
of which
</P>
<P>
   were subsequently endorsed by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Roosevelt, a Republican, started the move to preserve
historic,
</P>
<P>
   scientific and precious wilderness by naming Devils Tower (Wyo.)
the
</P>
<P>
   first national monument on Sept. 24, 1906. By the conclusion of
his
</P>
<P>
   presidential tenure, Roosevelt had designated 18 national
monuments,
</P>
<P>
   ending with the designation of Mount Olympus (Wash.) in 1909, a
few
</P>
<P>
   hours before he left office.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those monuments, like Mount Olympus, later became
national
</P>
<P>
   parks. Some monuments became national historic sites (Ft.
Laramie,
</P>
<P>
   Wyo.), national historic parks (Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, Md.)
or
</P>
<P>
   national battlefields (Big Hole Battlefield, Mont.).
</P>
<P>
   Utah is a shining example of the success of the Antiquities Act:
Zion
</P>
<P>
   National Park, Bryce Canyon National Park, Timpanogos Cave
National
</P>
<P>
   Monument, Capitol Reef National Park, Arches National Park,
Natural
</P>
<P>
   Bridges National Monument, and Cedar Breaks National Monument.
The
</P>
<P>
   communities surrounding these preserves understand their
commercial
</P>
<P>
   value, as well as their significance to the Americans and the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists come to Utah from every continent to spend time in
these
</P>
<P>
   special landscapes. Hansen would do well to remember his own
state's
</P>
<P>
   precious natural heritage that has been saved by presidential
</P>
<P>
   designation.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has the power to cancel the designation of any
monument, and
</P>
<P>
   has done so. Congress can also withhold funding for the
management of a
</P>
<P>
   monument. Although Hansen may smart at Clinton's designation of
Grand
</P>
<P>
   Staircase-Escalante National Monument; truth is, Congress
expanded the
</P>
<P>
   boundaries of the monument, ratified the president's designation
and
</P>
<P>
   funded its management.
</P>
<P>
   Fran Hunt of the Wilderness Society points out that the Hansen
bill
</P>
<P>
   would interfere with the emergency powers of a president to act
swiftly
</P>
<P>
   to address an imminent threat to important historic or
wilderness area.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the bill, Hunt commented, `It's an attack on what is
a very
</P>
<P>
   important tool in the conservation tool box.`
</P>
<P>
   Hunt noted that it's only recently that the environment has
become a
</P>
<P>
   partisan issue. Of the 14 presidents who set aside national
monuments,
</P>
<P>
   half were Republican. The three presidents who did not use the
</P>
<P>
   Antiquities Act were Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George
Bush -- all
</P>
<P>
   Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   It would be fair to say that it was during Reagan's
administration, with
</P>
<P>
   the appointment of James Watt as Secretary of the Interior, that
</P>
<P>
   environmental issues began to split Republicans from Democrats.
Sadly,
</P>
<P>
   the partisanship continues.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen's bill is an example of that partisanship. It seems
strange that
</P>
<P>
   a congressman from a state where so much beauty has been
protected by
</P>
<P>
   the Antiquities Act would blindly attack that act in the service
of
</P>
<P>
   manipulative and selfish politics.
</P>
<P>
   The American people won't buy it. This kind of
anti-environmental
</P>
<P>
   politics will be the downfall of the Republican goal to keep
control of
</P>
<P>
   Congress.

TEST KITCHEN: THE RIGHT TONGS: HANDS YOU CAN COUNT ON   (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just a few years ago, kitchen tongs were practically
unknown to home cooks. Now, no one can live without a pair. But as
useful as tongs can be, they are not the perfect tool for all
tasks. Tongs can tear delicate foods, and the shape can make
picking up thin slices of food maddeningly difficult.
</P>
<P>
   I tried five pairs to see which worked the best all around. For
such a simple tool, there were surprisingly great differences among
them. A good pair of tongs should not open too widely. If they
expand more than about six inches, you will have to keep them
partially contracted rather than let them lay comfortably in your
palm. The tongs must also move fluidly, and the tension of the
springs should not be too great, to avoid muscle strain.
</P>
<P>
   A pair by Hoffritz demonstrated all that tongs should not be:
They did not open and close easily, and the spoon-shaped ends were
so concave that the edges pierced every piece of food I tried to
lift _ slices of roasted eggplant, sauteed baby zucchini and
poached white peaches. They are $9.99 at Zabar's, 2245 Broadway
(80th Street), (212) 787-2000.
</P>
<P>
   Edlund tongs open too widely, but worse, the ends are squared
off and rimmed with sharp, pointy teeth that tear up whatever they
touch. They are $12.99 at Broadway Panhandler, 477 Broome Street
(Wooster Street), (212) 966-3434.
</P>
<P>
   A pair with flat, plastic spatula ends from Gracious Home _ 1220
Third Avenue (70th Street), (212) 517-6300, for $8.99 _ were a
failure with small pieces of food and round shapes like potatoes
and peaches. But they were fantastic with broad, flat foods like
eggplant. The spatula ends were gentle and took hold from both
sides, giving me plenty of control.
</P>
<P>
   Amco stainless steel tongs, the brand many chefs use, were
sturdy, and gave you a sense of dexterity _ I felt I could flip a
pin if I needed to. My only complaint about these tongs _ $4.98 at
Zabar's _ is that the spring mechanism is a bit tight.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen tongs by Oxo were by far the best. They moved
fluidly, the spoon-shaped ends were nearly flat and softly edged so
they did not damage food, and I could make extremely precise
movements _ from picking up a sprig of thyme to moving a soft-shell
crab claw back into place. They are $9.95 at a Cook's Companion,
152 Atlantic Avenue (Clinton Street), Brooklyn, (718) 852-6641.
</P>
<P>
   A final but important consideration is length. Most models are
available in 8-, 10-, and 12-inch lengths. When sauteeing at a high
temperature, a 12-inch pair may seem best, but with every extra
inch you lose some control. Generally, 8-inch tongs are best.

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Suspended in liquid nitrogen vapors, at an
unimaginably cold minus 156 Celsius, is the possibility of
parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   In vials, stored in cryogenic tanks, is the frozen sperm of
young men who have had to plan for future fatherhood even as
they've fought life-threatening illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Men, some as young as adolescents, rely on an underused,
somewhat unknown sperm bank. The Assisted Reproductive Technology
Laboratory at Albany Medical College stores the sperm of men
risking reproductive damage from chemotherapy or radiation during
cancer treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Here, lab director Charlene A. Alouf and other embryologists
conduct the well-known stage of in vitro fertilization, when a
petri dish, awash in a couple's sperm and eggs, substitutes for a
woman's fallopian tube. If science sometimes provides the
possibility of biological parenthood, so too does the faith and
determination of the couples involved, particularly the prospective
fathers who have had to confront cancer, treatment and life,
interrupted.
</P>
<P>
   One father, George, relied on the sperm bank to have a son, now
almost 4, with his second wife. Another married couple, Carl and
Sandra, are just starting to plan a family. Because they wanted to
preserve some privacy in this highly personal subject, they
requested that their last names not be used.
</P>
<P>
   George, who had testicular cancer, hopes to alert men to this
disease, and to the foresight of banking sperm in the event of
illness. Now chasing a preschooler around, George is awestruck by
his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so amazing that someone could come from something in a
frozen state, and become this little man,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carl, treated for Hodgkin's disease, also wants to sound
optimistic by stressing the importance of family support and
looking forward when fighting illness. ``It was one year of my
life, and I've lived nearly 35. I don't let that one year of life
consume me.''
</P>
<P>
   George's story begins as many Americans': Married for the second
time, with two young children from his first marriage, George and
his wife of two years had just started planning to have children.
</P>
<P>
   Then he was diagnosed with testicular cancer in August 1994.
</P>
<P>
   One doctor missed the diagnosis, but, bothered by a heavy,
uncomfortable sensation, George consulted a second urologist, who
found a quarter-sized tumor and recommended the subsequent surgery
to remove the testicle.
</P>
<P>
   Before George elected to have precautionary radiation, a nurse
who is a family friend advised him and his wife that the treatments
could cause sterility. He says the urologist who treated him never
mentioned the option of banking sperm.
</P>
<P>
   George, then 35, was out of surgery five days when he started
collecting his sperm to store at the Albany Medical College lab.
The step did not necessarily ease the anxiety that he might have
missed the chance to be a father, a second time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me feel like I would never be able to have children
again. That was a big fear I had with the cancer, and the
radiation.''
</P>
<P>
   Timing, and time, became critical factors in prompting the
couple, in the early months of 1996, to use George's banked sperm
to help them conceive: The radiation had in fact lowered his sperm
count, and his wife was then 38, said George.
</P>
<P>
   George's stored sperm, analysis showed, contained two key
components of fertility: sufficient numbers and movement. This
allowed George and his wife to choose artificial insemination. His
wife took Pergonal, the powerful fertility medication that
stimulates egg production. They sweated out the possibility of
multiple births, realizing the often attendant medical problems
such children can have.
</P>
<P>
   Their first attempt at conception failed. ``Naturally, the first
time was a letdown, and the second time, we were very reluctant,
because we didn't think it was going to happen again. Then, when it
did, we were very excited and so happy about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple's health insurance paid for the procedures. Coverage
for assisted reproductive technologies, which cost thousands of
dollars, differs from plan to plan, but remains rare, according to
doctors. One cycle of in vitro, for example, can cost $4,000 to
$5,000.
</P>
<P>
   George views the conception as ``more of a miracle than
anything.'' The couple's son was born Nov. 2, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   George is approaching the five-year benchmark since diagnosis,
which medically defines a cancer survivor, and his interim tests
have shown no signs of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   He has moved on to savor late fatherhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I would have a 3-year-old at 40 years old. I
think it's better to have children when you're older, because you
can appreciate them more, rather than when you're younger.''
</P>
<P>
   George's sperm count has regenerated, though he is keeping his
banked sperm in storage. ``We'd like to have another one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids,'' he said, ``are great.''

</P>
<P>
   Carl and Sandra had been engaged a mere 11 days when he was
diagnosed Oct. 25, 1995, with Hodgkin's disease, the form of
lymphoma that is more responsive to treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Carl had just entered his freshman year at Albany Medical
College, beginning his plan to specialize in family practice.
Sandra was well into her career as a graphic designer.
</P>
<P>
   The desire to have children came up on their first date, most
likely because both come from big families: Carl's has 15 children
and Sandra has four siblings. As their relationship progressed, the
number six became a somewhat playful hint about the size of their
future family.
</P>
<P>
   Once, Sandra, who is not big on hospitals, said she'd be willing
to return to a hospital six times in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The couple married June 27, 1997, a year later than they
originally planned so that Carl could finish his treatment. Carl
also took a leave from medical school. Chemotherapy, administered
in eight cycles from November 1995 until July 1996, was causing
nausea that forced Carl to lose class time.
</P>
<P>
   Medical school ``deserves your full attention. ... My disease
deserved my full attention, too.''
</P>
<P>
   A surgeon friend referred Carl to the sperm bank at Albany
Medical College; after discussing with his oncologist the
possibility that chemotherapy could cause sterility, Carl opted to
bank six samples before beginning treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Carl was a medical student, Sandra said, ``I don't
know if we would have thought about going to the lab, had we not
been informed.''
</P>
<P>
   Both come from Roman Catholic families _ the church objects to
reproductive technology _ but the use of the sperm bank and
possible subsequent help to conceive did not pose for them an
impossible moral dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understood that if we're going to have a family, this was
our only option. We thought it was appropriate to go ahead and make
the donation,'' Carl said. ``From our standpoint, we practice our
faith every day, we're good honest people and we thought the good
Lord wouldn't object to this.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the harsh chemotherapy has lived up to its billing.
Tests showed that Carl was sterile immediately after treatment,
and, two years later, analysis showed only one viable sperm.
</P>
<P>
   The two feel the timing is right to begin planning a family,
particularly since Carl shows no recurrence of cancer and is
finishing the second of two study-intensive years of medical
school. Sandra is beginning fertility testing, which will help
determine the method they'll choose to conceive.
</P>
<P>
   They've ruled out no options, from having one child, to six, to
adopting a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would be blessed if we just have one. If we have six,
great,'' said Carl. And, if they cannot conceive, ``that's just
fine, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple, Carl pointed out, is at the threshold they had hoped
for just a few years ago, when they predicted they'd be paying a
visit to the sperm bank, saying, ``Here we are, we're ready to
start.''

TEXAS GRAIN AND CORN GROWERS ANTICIPATE A HEALTHY HARVEST 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Just for pleasure, Rodney Mowery likes to stand in the
bed of his pickup truck and look out across an expanse of tall corn
in one of his fields just south of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   It has been years since Mowery has seen corn this good. He won't
know if it will be a bumper crop until he starts harvesting in a
few weeks, but one of his fields, located on rich bottom land, is a
good candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many Texas growers, this member of a farming family from
Rosharon is enjoying one of those rare periods of high yields.
</P>
<P>
   A series of agricultural plagues _ droughts and floods during
the planting season, soaring temperatures, crop-devouring insects
and a toxic fungus known as aflatoxin _ have meant bad crops for
many Texas farmers since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But the latest estimates of potential yields for the two biggest
feed grains range from ``near-record'' for corn in the Central
Texas Blacklands to ``awesome'' for grain sorghum in the Coastal
Bend.
</P>
<P>
   This year's rains have come in the nick of time all the way from
the Lower Rio Grande Valley, where some crops already are being
harvested, to the later-planted upper portion of the Texas
Panhandle, where corn plants are only about a foot tall.
</P>
<P>
   Wharton County agricultural agent Johnnie Cosper sees the
best-looking crop of grain sorghum in years and ``some excellent
looking corn.'' The rice crop is beginning to head, and there have
yet to be major problems with disease or insects.
</P>
<P>
   While it may be a little early in the growing season to be
bragging about the prospects for cotton, observers say, this most
important of Texas crops is off to a good start. The same is true
for rice and soybeans.
</P>
<P>
   This year's promise of good yields won't dispel the storm clouds
on the horizon for the struggling farm economy.
</P>
<P>
   The selling price for milo in the Valley _ a low-lying area that
borders Mexico _ is approximately $3.50 per 100 pounds, ``way below
anything that could possibly be considered a profitable price,''
said John Norman, a Texas A&AMP;M Extension Service entomologist
stationed in Weslaco.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the milo from the Valley, where the harvest is well
under way, goes into Mexico to feed poultry there.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of corn, the current national market price is only
about $2.25 per bushel, compared with near &UR;  &LR; $3 per bushel during
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Crop prospects are equally good in Central Texas, which was hit
hard by last year's drought.
</P>
<P>
   With just one more rain, the farmers in Central Texas could see
near-record yields on corn and milo, said Williamson County
agricultural agent Ronald Leps of Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I fear is that even if we have above-average yields, with
commodity prices being as low as they are, it will be tough to make
the debt carried forward from 1996 and 1998. The agriculture
picture is not really good,'' Leps said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mowery family grows rice and soybeans in addition to corn,
in an effort to weather the ups and downs.
</P>
<P>
   Their tall corn at Rosharon is in stark contrast to 1998 and
1996, when the Mowery fields were withered by drought. Out of 250
acres last year, about 160 acres were so ``horrible'' they didn't
warrant running a combine through, Mowery said.
</P>
<P>
   Too much rain also is a threat. Between the 1996 and 1998
droughts, it rained so much in the Houston area during the early
months of 1997 that Mowery's corn crop never got planted.
</P>
<P>
   Rainfall since the start of this year hasn't been heavy.
Rosharon was running eight inches below normal through a week ago,
Mowery said, but showers have come just in time.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny dents in the kernels of corn are evidence that the crop is
past the stage where it could be damaged by lack of rain or searing
heat, always a threat during Texas summers. Growers were able to
plant early this year, a big help in getting ahead of hostile
weather.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true in Central Texas. Even without another drop of
rain, the corn crop around Waxahachie will be above average, said
county agent Gary Stanford. ``What a difference a year makes,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, last year's corn was so poor the dried-up stalks
were baled for cow feed.
</P>
<P>
   Soybean acres have pulled ahead of corn in Ellis County, and the
beans look as impressive as the corn, Stanford said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really proud of the crop, from the Blacklands to the
Coastal Bend,'' said Jerry Don Glover of Dimmitt, executive
director of the Texas Corn Producers Board. Panhandle fields were
hammered by terrible storms, but corn can take it, Glover said.

<P>
   A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; BELOVED SISTERS AND LOVING FRIENDS &QL; 
 &UR; Edited by Farah Jasmine Griffin (Knopf, $26)
</P>
<P>
   ``My Darling Sister: I'm alone all the inmates of the family
gone to Church. O no Aunt Chaty is not gone she feel rather
indispose to day. The reason I'm home I did not get my Shoes last
night Mother gave me some money this AM so of course that was to
late then so I will have to remain in the house this lovely
weather.'' The words are simple, but they offer a remarkable
glimpse of something about which we know too little. Addie Brown
was a domestic servant, a young, Black woman of ordinary
circumstances who wrote more than 150 letters to her friend,
Rebecca Primus, in the years surrounding the Civil War. Primus was
the daughter of a prominent Black New England family, one of many
women who went South after the war to start schools and teach freed
men and women. Addie loved Rebecca, and her letters _ the one
excerpted above was written on April 13, 1861 _ were found among
Primus' papers at the Connecticut Historical Society, along with 60
written by Primus to members of her family. Both sets of letters _
sadly, Primus' answers to Addie have not been found _ reflect the
interests, ambitions and struggles of Black women during a time for
which there is very little historical documentation. We've been led
to believe, Griffin says, ``that ordinary black women left no
evidence of their historical existence. We were told that they did
not keep diaries or journals and that they did not write letters.
(But) it is not that the women weren't there, as older generations
of scholars had told us. No, it was that no one had made the effort
to find them.'' Here, then, are Rebecca Primus and Addie Brown _
one who was blessed, the other who made her living under precarious
economic circumstances _ bright, committed women whose letters
reflected their personal and public lives and the times into which
they were born. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; WHITE HUNTERS &QL; 
 &UR; Brian Herne (Holt, $35)
</P>
<P>
   Herne provides anecdotes from the golden days of African
safaris, when the ``white hunter'' traversed the continent in
search of trophies and a good time was had by all except for the
beasts he left in his wake. This book is not particularly
well-written, but its stories are chatty and unfailingly
interesting. Familiar names appear: Karen Blixen (who wrote ``Out
of Africa'' as Isak Dinesen) and her husband, Bror (and her lover,
Denys Finch Hatton); aviatrix (and lover to Finch Hatton and Bror
Blixen _ things got dicey in Africa) Beryl Markham; legendary
hunters Jorge Alves DeLima Filho, Alan Black and R.J. Cunninghame;
Ernest Hemingway, who made The Great White Hunter an American hero;
and Clark Gable, Stewart Granger, Ava Gardner and Grace Kelly, who
made movies to prove it. Early safari clients included Teddy
Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and the Duke and Duchess of York
(later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother). Herne
also tells true stories of the hunt, set against the grandeur and
abundance of Africa. They are as irresistible as they are
foretelling. He ends with the social and political changes that
drove even the old-guard White hunters away, and acknowledges what
has happened to Africa's animal populations due to poachers and
massive habitat destruction. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; THE WILDER SISTERS &QL; 
 &UR; Jo-Ann Mapson (HarperFlamingo, $24)
</P>
<P>
   ``While her sister pulled at a thread on her sweater, Lily
unwound the cinnamon bun's snail-like spiral. Sugar, nuts and
butter oozed onto her fingers. When it came to grief, all dieting
rules were suspended. Once broken, the female heart reverted to
survival mode, and saturated fat provided the closest thing to
Valium without a doctor's prescription.'' Lily is 35, her sister,
Rose, is 40, and they're about to have a heart-to-heart about the
men in their lives. Rose is a good, homespun woman who looks and
acts her age. Lily has a lucrative career and a trendy life in
Southern California, and looks ``like Audrey Hepburn, if Hepburn
had fancied tattoos and had sex partners that approached the triple
digits.'' Rose, whose husband was killed two years earlier by a
drunken driver, is in love with her boss, Austin, an alcoholic
veterinarian. Lily has struck up a romance with Tres, an old
high-school flame. Both women have come home to their parents'
ranch in New Mexico, prodigal daughters reunited after a five-year
silence, and of course they find solace in each other and romance
(and good sex) with men who are charming but flawed. We always hear
from Mapson's fans _ and there are many of them _ after we mention
one of her novels, because they like her trademark folksy cuteness
(cute sex, cute dialogue, cute relationships, cute stories all
around) and we don't. We'll admit that the sisters are appealing in
this one, but that's all you get from us. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; A YOUNG PERSON'S GUIDE TO PHILOSOPHY &QL; 
 &UR; Jeremy Weate (DK, $16.95)
</P>
<P>
   For those of you who like to push the envelope, here's a summer
goal: Get your kids to think of something deeper than the last
episode of ``Dawson's Creek.'' This is a companion volume to Bryan
Magee's ``The Story of Philosophy: The Essential Guide to the
History of Western Philosophy'' (DK, $29.95). Look through it, and
you'll be struck by how suited to the young mind philosophical
thought really is. There's the rebellion factor, always a winner _
Socrates himself dressed like a bum and mocked the status quo. And
Weate poses questions that challenge young people: Is a computer
virus alive? Could I be an android? What is the mind doing when it
dreams? Do we have the right to use animals for our own purposes?
When are we playing God? Weate follows up with an overview of the
men and women who have puzzled over our existence through the
centuries, exploring the frontiers of human thought and belief. &QL;

<P>
   Jesse Jackson's driver pulls up in front of a U.S. Airways sign
at Washington National Airport when Amy Dupree of Addison, Texas,
recognizes him. Jackson, sitting in the front seat, continues a
conversation on his cellular telephone as Dupree and her husband,
Kyle, wait patiently to take a photograph with him.
</P>
<P>
   As Jackson emerges from the sedan several moments later, Amy
Dupree says, ``We're very proud of what you did.'' She tells
Jackson of her work getting women out of the ``adult
entertainment'' business _ she is a former topless dancer _ and how
God has changed her life.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson says, ``God bless you,'' poses for a photo, and with
Yirgalem ``Yuri'' Tadesse, national director of international
affairs for Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, and this journalist
in tow, he heads for U.S. Airways Flight 6480, the 3 p.m. shuttle
bound for New York's La Guardia Airport.
</P>
<P>
   After appearing on ``The Late Show with David Letterman'' the
previous night, Jackson is returning for a second-straight
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Louis Jackson, fresh from securing the release of three
U.S. soldiers imprisoned for little more than a month in
Yugoslavia, is being heralded as an American hero. This was not the
first time Jackson had gone on a successful mercy mission.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, he obtained the freedom of Navy flier Lt. Robert O.
Goodman Jr., who had been shot down over Lebanon. Later in the
year, he got Fidel Castro to release 22 Americans (most of them
held on drug charges) and 26 Cubans from prisons. Jackson also
persuaded Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to release 500 foreign
nationals being held against their will.
</P>
<P>
   The trip to Yugoslavia, however, provided Jackson with the
brightest spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks for bringing our boys back home,'' says a middle-age
man with a middle-age middle. ``You're a real American hero.'' At
Legal Sea Foods, a restaurant in the airport, a group of women
pound on a window, wave and smile broadly as Jackson waves back. An
airline employee wants an autograph for his mother _ at least
that's what he says _ and two giddy teen-agers want to pose with
the world's best-known human rights leader.
</P>
<P>
   On the plane, it's more of the same. ``America thanks you ...
Good going, Jesse ... I just want to shake your hand.'' As he
settles in an aisle seat 20 rows back for an overdue interview, an
exhausted Jackson speaks for a few minutes and then suspends the
conversation to take a nap.
</P>
<P>
   When the plane lands in New York, he is refreshed and picks up
the conversation exactly where he left off. ``I always thought that
if we got close enough to touch them, we would leave with them,''
he recalls, referring to the soldiers. ``But it was strictly a
faith mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite what Jackson says, these are not strictly faith
missions, though faith plays an intricate role. Nor are they merely
publicity stunts in which Jackson is used by unpopular foreign
leaders to manipulate U.S. public opinion. And despite the howls
from the State Department, he goes on these missions with their
tacit approval. After all, they made no effort to lift his
passport. How does he do it?
</P>
<P>
   First, Jackson is brash enough to think that he and only he can
pull off these feats. And so far, he has been right. Generally, he
has obtained the release of prisoners after the State Department
has failed, after back-channel negotiations through third parties
have failed and, in some cases, after U.S. or international
military intervention has failed, as was the case in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   In each case Jackson knew when to make his move. Whether it's
securing the release of Goodman or the three Army soldiers _ Staff
Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles; Staff Sgt. Christopher
J. Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich.; and Spc. Steven M. Gonzales,
22, of Huntsville, Texas _ Jackson picks the right moment.
</P>
<P>
   Rev. M. William Howard Jr., president of the New York
Theological Seminary and a former president of the National Council
of Churches, remembers when Jackson decided to seek Goodman's
release. A group of ministers were huddling with tax attorneys in
Memphis to see how they could assist Jackson's 1984 presidential
bid without jeopardizing their federal tax-exempt status.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesse was bored out of his mind,'' Howard recalls. ``We broke
for lunch and went up to his suite. Wherever he is, he sends out
for this greasy fried chicken. He had sent somebody out to a
Popeye's, I believe it was. They brought in these buckets of
chicken. We were sitting around watching TV at lunchtime. I kid you
not, there was a news flash about how Donald H. Rumsfeld (NATO
ambassador under President Richard M. Nixon) had gone to Syria and
they were talking about the war in Lebanon and tensions with
Israel. They said nothing about Goodman.''
</P>
<P>
   It was at that point, Howard says, that Jackson sat up and
resolved to get a delegation of religious leaders together to go
and get Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   On his recent trip to Yugoslavia, Jackson followed that same
pattern of assembling a list of high-level religious leaders to
accompany him, including Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, general
secretary of the National Council of Churches; an American rabbi; a
priest of the Orthodox Church in America; a Greek bishop; a Serbian
Orthodox bishop; a Baptist minister; an Islamic leader; and a
Methodist bishop. Also with them was Rep. Rod R. Blagojevich
(D-Ill.), the only Serbian-American member of Congress, and other
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   The Jackson delegation received a formal invitation to visit
their religious counterparts in Yugoslavia. However, just before
departing, they were urged by National Security Council adviser
Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger to call off the trip, reminding them that
their safety could not be assured and that the bombing would not
halt just because they were in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made it clear that if we were to get killed going in a
bombing zone, it would represent the ultimate PR coup for
Milosevic,'' Jackson says. ``That was their fear. But they could
have ended that fear just by stopping the bombing while we were
there.'' But they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   On the night the delegation arrived at the Belgrade Hyatt hotel,
the NATO bombing was among the heaviest of the war up to that time,
with some bombs landing just blocks away. ``They never stopped
bombing,'' Jackson says, clearly angry. ``They never stopped
bombing next to us. I think it aroused in us the fires of
determination. I was mentally prepared, spiritually fortified,
psyched, pumped, ready. War was so wrong, and our cause was so
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavian officials promised Jackson protection once he was in
the country. They took him and Western reporters on a tour of a
residential area that they said had been hit by NATO's bombs.
During his trip, Jackson told the Yugoslavs that until there was a
peace agreement, the bombs would continue falling. He also repeated
NATO's requirements before there could be a cessation of bombing.
When it was time to meet the young men, only Jackson and
Blagojevich were allowed to visit, even then under the watchful
eyes of a military judge.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers were brought in separately and left separately.
Stone, who had bruises healing on the left side of his forehead,
spoke with the visitors first and for the longest amount of time.
The U.S. delegation had brought the soldiers Bibles, small
religious icons, candy, a tape recorder and separate tape-recorded
messages from their families.
</P>
<P>
   The military judge denied Jackson's request to give the gifts
directly to the captive men, saying they had to be inspected. Each
soldier reported that he had been treated well and was feeling
good, considering the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   During the visit, air-raid sirens sounded and the military judge
called for an end to the visit. But Jackson pressed on, asking that
the three soldiers be brought in together. His request was granted
and the men were reunited for the first time since they were
captured along the Yugoslav-Macedonian border on March 31.
Together, they prayed. ``Help is on the way and hope is in the
air,'' Jackson said. ``Soon, very soon, you will know peace and
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Five of the delegates were allowed to meet with President
Slobodan Milosevic for three hours. In that meeting, they urged
Milosevic to free the soldiers. Bishop Dimitrios of Xanthos of the
Greek Orthodox Church says, ``(Jackson) was persuasive and just
would not let up. He kept saying, 'It's in your power. You can do
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the meeting, Milosevic portrayed NATO as the
aggressor in the conflict, just as the White House had feared. In
Milosevic's view, he was the victim. But when he asked who was
responsible for the bombings, Dr. Nazir Uddin Khaja, a California
physician and president of the American Muslim Council, replied,
``You are responsible.'' According to Khaja, Milosevic seemed
surprised. ``The whole group said that in one way or another. Maybe
I was more direct.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson met privately with Milosevic for about 20 minutes.
Milosevic promised to think about the request for freedom. Jackson
had been back at the hotel for 15 minutes when the delegation
received a call to meet with Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic at
his private residence. When they arrived, he told them, ``I am
pleased to tell you that President Milosevic has issued a decree
today releasing the three soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, there was a formal signing ceremony, which was broadcast
on U.S. television. With cameras rolling, Jackson had the soldiers
sounding more like civil rights workers than military men. They
chanted, ``'Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we're
free at last!''
</P>
<P>
   The Jackson delegation left with the freed prisoners in a
Yugoslav bus. Under police escort, they were driven to the Croatian
border. From there, the soldiers were transferred to a Croatian
tourist bus rented by the U.S. Embassy and were driven to the Pleso
airstrip in Zagreb. Then they were flown to Ramstein Air Base in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, the soldiers were whisked away to the Landstuhl
Regional Medical Center for a couple of days of testing before
their families arrived. So the Jackson group proceeded to
Washington, without the fruits of their labor.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, when Jackson had obtained the release of Goodman,
the pilot was not delayed by military authorities in Europe;
instead, the group was flown home aboard Air Force One and treated
to a ceremony in the Rose Garden. That was under Ronald Reagan, a
Republican president viewed as hostile to civil rights. Under
Clinton, who prides himself as a friend of African-Americans,
Jackson did not receive the red-carpet treatment, causing Jackson
to view the administration as ingrates.
</P>
<P>
   While saying he was ``very pleased'' that the soldiers were
coming home, Clinton said that nearly 1.5 million Kosovars could
not enjoy similar freedom. The president said conditions for ending
the bombing were simple: ``The Kosovars must be able to go home
with security and self-government, Serbian security forces must
leave Kosovo. An international security force must deploy with the
power not just to monitor but to protect all the people of Kosovo,
Albanians and Serbs alike.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who was carrying a private letter to Clinton from
Milosevic, strongly urged the president to release two Serb
soldiers held by U.S. military as a reciprocal peace gesture.
Several weeks later, the administration did just that, denying the
release represented a quid pro quo.
</P>
<P>
   When asked by David Letterman how he could be civil to such an
international outlaw, Jackson's answer was simple: ``He had the
power to keep our guys or let them go.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after he returned from Yugoslavia, ``Jetstream Jesse,''
as he is sometimes called, was off to Africa, successfully
brokering a cease-fire in the Sierra Leone civil war.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no budgetary commitment to rebuilding this
war-torn nation as we heard in Europe,'' Jackson said, after taking
credit for securing the release of 2,000 prisoners of war, most of
them children and soldiers from bordering countries. ``When the
Yugoslavia war is over, there will be billions spent on rebuilding
the cities. The same kind of security and stability and democracy
in Kosovo and Yugoslavia must apply to Sierra Leone and to Africa
as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's exploits aren't likely to stop with Yugoslavia and
Sierra Leone. After all, this is the same person who crashed the
1985 Geneva Summit that was supposed to feature only Ronald Reagan
and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Jackson confronted
Gorbachev in a crowded lobby, asking about the treatment of Soviet
Jews. Where he shows up next is anybody's guess.

<P>
   Jesse Jackson's driver pulls up in front of a U.S. Airways sign
at Washington National Airport when Amy Dupree of Addison, Texas,
recognizes him. Jackson, sitting in the front seat, continues a
conversation on his cellular telephone as Dupree and her husband,
Kyle, wait patiently to take a photograph with him.
</P>
<P>
   As Jackson emerges from the sedan several moments later, Amy
Dupree says, ``We're very proud of what you did.'' She tells
Jackson of her work getting women out of the ``adult
entertainment'' business _ she is a former topless dancer _ and how
God has changed her life.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson says, ``God bless you,'' poses for a photo, and with
Yirgalem ``Yuri'' Tadesse, national director of international
affairs for Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, and this journalist
in tow, he heads for U.S. Airways Flight 6480, the 3 p.m. shuttle
bound for New York's La Guardia Airport.
</P>
<P>
   After appearing on ``The Late Show with David Letterman'' the
previous night, Jackson is returning for a second-straight
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Louis Jackson, fresh from securing the release of three
U.S. soldiers imprisoned for little more than a month in
Yugoslavia, is being heralded as an American hero. This was not the
first time Jackson had gone on a successful mercy mission.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, he obtained the freedom of Navy flier Lt. Robert O.
Goodman Jr., who had been shot down over Lebanon. Later in the
year, he got Fidel Castro to release 22 Americans (most of them
held on drug charges) and 26 Cubans from prisons. Jackson also
persuaded Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to release 500 foreign
nationals being held against their will.
</P>
<P>
   The trip to Yugoslavia, however, provided Jackson with the
brightest spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks for bringing our boys back home,'' says a middle-age
man with a middle-age middle. ``You're a real American hero.'' At
Legal Sea Foods, a restaurant in the airport, a group of women
pound on a window, wave and smile broadly as Jackson waves back. An
airline employee wants an autograph for his mother _ at least
that's what he says _ and two giddy teen-agers want to pose with
the world's best-known human rights leader.
</P>
<P>
   On the plane, it's more of the same. ``America thanks you ...
Good going, Jesse ... I just want to shake your hand.'' As he
settles in an aisle seat 20 rows back for an overdue interview, an
exhausted Jackson speaks for a few minutes and then suspends the
conversation to take a nap.
</P>
<P>
   When the plane lands in New York, he is refreshed and picks up
the conversation exactly where he left off. ``I always thought that
if we got close enough to touch them, we would leave with them,''
he recalls, referring to the soldiers. ``But it was strictly a
faith mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite what Jackson says, these are not strictly faith
missions, though faith plays an intricate role. Nor are they merely
publicity stunts in which Jackson is used by unpopular foreign
leaders to manipulate U.S. public opinion. And despite the howls
from the State Department, he goes on these missions with their
tacit approval. After all, they made no effort to lift his
passport. How does he do it?
</P>
<P>
   First, Jackson is brash enough to think that he and only he can
pull off these feats. And so far, he has been right. Generally, he
has obtained the release of prisoners after the State Department
has failed, after back-channel negotiations through third parties
have failed and, in some cases, after U.S. or international
military intervention has failed, as was the case in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   In each case Jackson knew when to make his move. Whether it's
securing the release of Goodman or the three Army soldiers _ Staff
Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles; Staff Sgt. Christopher
J. Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich.; and Spc. Steven M. Gonzales,
22, of Huntsville, Texas _ Jackson picks the right moment.
</P>
<P>
   Rev. M. William Howard Jr., president of the New York
Theological Seminary and a former president of the National Council
of Churches, remembers when Jackson decided to seek Goodman's
release. A group of ministers were huddling with tax attorneys in
Memphis to see how they could assist Jackson's 1984 presidential
bid without jeopardizing their federal tax-exempt status.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesse was bored out of his mind,'' Howard recalls. ``We broke
for lunch and went up to his suite. Wherever he is, he sends out
for this greasy fried chicken. He had sent somebody out to a
Popeye's, I believe it was. They brought in these buckets of
chicken. We were sitting around watching TV at lunchtime. I kid you
not, there was a news flash about how Donald H. Rumsfeld (NATO
ambassador under President Richard M. Nixon) had gone to Syria and
they were talking about the war in Lebanon and tensions with
Israel. They said nothing about Goodman.''
</P>
<P>
   It was at that point, Howard says, that Jackson sat up and
resolved to get a delegation of religious leaders together to go
and get Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   On his recent trip to Yugoslavia, Jackson followed that same
pattern of assembling a list of high-level religious leaders to
accompany him, including Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, general
secretary of the National Council of Churches; an American rabbi; a

HOUSTON: Glover said.
<TEXT>
<P>
   This year's grain sorghum looks like an awesome crop in the
Coastal Bend area around Corpus Christi, said Jeff Nunley,
executive director of the South Texas Cotton and Grain Association
in Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   San Patricio, one of the major counties for grain sorghum,
probably will average 5,000 pounds per acre or better, estimates
County Agent Jeff Stapper of Sinton.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Lower Rio Grande Valley, combines are working to
harvest a grain sorghum crop covering perhaps 450,000 acres, said
Norman of Texas A&AMP;M. The acreage appears to be up sharply, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers who raise these crops have pinched pennies, trying to
eke out a profit in a year when they knew prices would be low.
</P>
<P>
   Mowery, for instance, chose to do without a fertilizer test,
applying just a little nitrogen and hoping there would be enough of
the other plant nutrients carried over in the soil from past years.
</P>
<P>
   To save on fuel, his cornfields weren't cultivated. Resulting
weeds and grasses were held back using the cheapest herbicide on
the market.
</P>
<P>
   Up the coast in San Patricio County, there are cornfields
containing what appear to be 100 bushels per acre, said Robert Box,
general manager of the Planters Grain elevator in Odem.
</P>
<P>
   There will be as much corn produced in the county this year as
there was in 1998, he predicts, although the acres planted are off
by 45 percent. Aflatoxin, not expected to be much of a problem this
year, takes the blame for the cutback in acreage.
</P>
<P>
   But the majority of grain sorghum from the sprawling, flat
fields there will be placed into storage unless prices improve,
according to the manager of the cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, prices at the start of harvest were at least 60 to 70
cents per 100 pounds higher than now, Box said. Only one time since
he started with the co-op in 1983 have prices been lower than now,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending upon demand and price, there is a very strong
possibility that from 80 to 95 percent will be stored,'' Box said.
Farmers who need cash flow will put their harvest into the
government loan program.
</P>
<P>
   The sorghum will be stored in hopes of getting a better price in
the future. The only thing that could cause a price rally would be
problems with the corn crop in the Midwest, according to Box. At
latest report, the crops there were doing fine.
</P>
<P>
   Corn and grain sorghum are virtually interchangeable for feeding
livestock, although historically the sorghum sells for less.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons that sorghum prices are way down is a poor
outlook for exports, Box explained. In past years, Japan was a big
buyer, but it apparently has looked elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   With the U.S. cotton crop being pegged at a possible 18 million
to 19 million bales, ``I don't see much hope for prices,'' said
Texas A&AMP;M economist Carl Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley farmer who picked this year's first bale of cotton in
Texas, Thomas Zdansky of Lyford, complains about the current
50-cent-per-pound price.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-five cents a pound or more is needed to make growing
cotton worthwhile, according to Zdansky. ``When I was a kid, it was
50 cents,'' said the farmer, who started growing cotton in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of his bales, the first one, brought a good price,
which was picked in late May and was auctioned for a whopping
$3,000. A 477-pound bale, it would have been worth only $238 at
current prices.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Insects weren't bad this growing season, and agricultural agents
expect to harvest a very satisfactory bale per acre or slightly
more from this year's fields. The Valley was the site of the beet
army worm invasion in 1995, when the plant-eating pests spread up
the coast and north to San Angelo.
</P>
<P>
   The acres planted to cotton are up, and just within the area
from South Texas to Uvalde to Fort Bend County, 1 million bales
could be produced.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. crop will be larger than can be sold at a price higher
than the federal loan, Anderson said, and farm-level prices could
drop into the mid-40-cent range.
</P>
<P>
   There have been severe storms in the Lubbock area, but on the
other side of the coin, he said, that is an area where rain always
is welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Huge swaths of fields were hammered by hail, but cotton is grown
on millions of acres there. Most hail-damaged fields have been
replanted.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook there remains good. ``We are light-years ahead of
where we were at this time last year,'' said A&AMP;M agronomist Randy
Bowman of Lubbock. ``The moisture is outstanding, and the planting
was very successful. There was good, warm soil, and it seemed to
click.''

COVER GIRLS (AND BOYS) ON THE REMAKE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget ``The X-Files'' _ nothing on the radio is what it seems.
</P>
<P>
   Ya know that new song by Pearl Jam, ``Last Kiss?'' That's really
an old song by J. Frank Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   How 'bout Jo Dee Messina's ``Lesson in Leavin'''? Not hers.
Dottie West had a No. 1 hit with that in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto for ``Players Holiday,'' currently being sung by a rap
army made up of T.W.D.Y., Too Short and Mac Mall. That's really
Bill Withers' ``Lovely Day'' in disguise.
</P>
<P>
   Remakes in pop music are, obviously, nothing new. Right now,
though, the radio waves and music charts are inundated with them.
</P>
<P>
   No fewer than 10 remakes are currently on Billboard's country,
R&AMP;B, modern rock or pop charts; several others are getting serious
airplay.
</P>
<P>
   So in case you thought Lenny Kravitz wrote ``American Woman,''
here's our remake guide, with the song, current artist, original
artist, chart action and our verdict on whether the new song does
the old one any justice.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Song: ``Last Kiss''
</P>
<P>
   Currently being done by: Pearl Jam
</P>
<P>
   Current chart position: No. 2 on Modern Rock Tracks, 55 on Hot
100
</P>
<P>
   Original artist: J. Frank Wilson, born in Lufkin
</P>
<P>
   Highest original charted: No. 10 in 1964
</P>
<P>
   Verdict: Pearl Jam's upgrade of Wilson's sad tale of a couple's
last kiss amid a car accident is stunning. It's far more
melancholic and effective than Wilson's campy, very-'60s version.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Song: ``American Woman''
</P>
<P>
   Currently being done by: Retro rocker Lenny Kravitz
</P>
<P>
   Current chart position: No. 7 on Mainstream Rock Tracks
</P>
<P>
   Original artist: The Guess Who
</P>
<P>
   Highest original charted: No. 4 in 1970
</P>
<P>
   Verdict: Most of what Kravitz does sounds like remakes from the
'70s anyway, so what's the difference?
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Song: ``Lesson in Leavin'''
</P>
<P>
   Currently being done by: Country star Jo Dee Messina
</P>
<P>
   Current chart position: No. 12 on Hot Country Singles, 61 on Hot
100
</P>
<P>
   Original artist: Dottie West
</P>
<P>
   Highest original charted: No. 1 in 1980
</P>
<P>
   Verdict: Way cool. Messina's one of country music's few
hopefuls, and her take on West's
you're-gonna-get-what's-coming-to-you anthem ranks as one of this
year's best country songs.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Song: ``Can't Take My Eyes Off You''
</P>
<P>
   Currently being done by: R&AMP;B goddess Lauryn Hill
</P>
<P>
   Current chart position: Has yet to be released as a single, but
local pop radio station KISS/106.1 has already put it in heavy
rotation
</P>
<P>
   Original artist: Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons
</P>
<P>
   Highest original charted: No. 6 in 1967
</P>
<P>
   Verdict: Here, the usually despotic and opinionated Hill is
romantic and tender; it's nice to hear this other side of her.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Song: ``Crazy Little Thing Called Love''
</P>
<P>
   Currently being done by: Country great Dwight Yoakam
</P>
<P>
   Current chart position: No. 25 on Hot Country Singles
</P>
<P>
   Original artist: Queen
</P>
<P>
   Highest original charted: No. 1 in 1980
</P>
<P>
   Verdict: Dwight Yoakam may be one of country music's greatest
singers, but his soft spot for sap like this _ and various Elvis
covers _ is embarrassing. Please make it go away.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Song: ``Players Holiday''
</P>
<P>
   Currently being done by: Rap team T.W.D.Y., Too Short and Mac
Mall
</P>
<P>
   Current chart position: No. 40 on Hot R&AMP;B
</P>
<P>
   Original artist: This is really Bill Withers' ``Lovely Day''
</P>
<P>
   Highest original charted: Reached No. 1 in the UK in 1978, but
never cracked the Top 20 over here
</P>
<P>
   Verdict: The perfect example of what's wrong with rap today: Too
many remakes and samples, not enough originality. We could do a
separate story on all the samples and remakes rappers have borrowed
to make their own songs.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Song: ``God Must Have Spent a Little More Time on You''
</P>
<P>
   Currently being done by: Country vets Alabama
</P>
<P>
   Current chart position: No. 14 on Hot Country, 38 on Hot 100
</P>
<P>
   Original artist: 'N Sync
</P>
<P>
   Highest original charted: No. 3 on Adult Contemporary
</P>
<P>
   Verdict: Alabama pulled a Mark Chesnutt here, remaking this 'N
Sync ballad as fast as Chesnutt did up the recent Dionne
Warwick-penned Aerosmith hit, ``I Don't Wanna Miss a Thing.'' Whose
``God'' is better? Major toss-up _ it's both the perfect pop
``and'' country song: sweet and memorable. Let the fans fight it
out.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Song: ``Blue Monday''
</P>
<P>
   Currently being done by: Industrial-music headache-inducers Orgy
</P>
<P>
   Current chart position: No. 17 on Modern Rock Tracks
</P>
<P>
   Original artist: Groundbreaking English techno band New Order
</P>
<P>
   Highest original charted: No. 4 in 1983 on the UK charts
</P>
<P>
   Verdict: Easily one of the worst covers this side of Limp
Bizkit's recent thrashing of George Michael's ``Faith.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Song: ``Cars''
</P>
<P>
   Currently being done by: Metal dudes Fear Factory
</P>
<P>
   Current chart position: No. 21 on Mainstream Rock Tracks
</P>
<P>
   Original artist: New Wave pioneer Gary Numan
</P>
<P>
   Highest original charted: No. 5 in 1980
</P>
<P>
   Verdict: Funny, this actually sounds very true to original. One
reason: Numan sings on it. Fear Factory's trademark layer of
brick-wall-falling-loud guitars makes it even cooler. Good stuff.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Song: ``Sweet Child O' Mine''
</P>
<P>
   Currently being done by: Pop singer Sheryl Crow
</P>
<P>
   Current chart position: Has yet to chart. Pray it won't.
</P>
<P>
   Original artist: Guns N' Roses
</P>
<P>
   Highest original charted: No. 8 in 1988
</P>
<P>
   Verdict: Sorry, Sheryl. No one can do Axl better than Axl.

During World War II, an explosion on a segregated naval base here
killed 320 men. After the accident, black sailors were ordered to
resume loading ammunition onto ships. Fifty of them refused, were
court-martialed by an all-white panel, found guilty of mutiny and
imprisoned. Now, in an extraordinary legal battle, lawyers for one
black veteran have filed for a presidential pardon arguing that the
black sailors failed to follow orders out of legitimate fear and
had no intent to mutiny. The petition pits the racial symbolism of

By EVERETT EVANS 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ There are a few things in life that you can count on.
Death and taxes. The rich get richer, the poor get poorer. And, as
time goes by, ticket prices for performing-arts events go up.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the increases usually have been gradual _ a few
dollars every couple of years _ may explain why so many arts
patrons seem to take them in stride.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, Broadway ticket prices have jumped from the
1989-90 season's range of $35-$55 for musicals and $25-$42 for
plays to the current range of $40-$85 (musicals) and $25-$60
(plays).
</P>
<P>
   In Broadway circles, a mild reaction usually follows the first
show whose top ticket price hits a new plateau _ ``The Act,'' the
first with a $25 ticket, in 1977; ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway,''
hitting $60 in 1989; ``Show Boat,'' becoming the first production
with a $75 ticket in 1994. The 1998 Tony-winning ``The Lion King''
topped out at $85, while all tickets to the current revival of
``The Iceman Cometh'' are $100. Yet these milestone price hikes
usually are just a notch above their competitors, which soon follow
suit. Customers bite the bullet and buy the tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are instances when an event carries such an exorbitant
price tag that it backfires.
</P>
<P>
   The textbook case was a concert by Three Tenors Jose Carreras,
Placido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti, planned for March 1997 at
the Houston Astrodome by Dur United Entertainment, a promoter out
of West Palm Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   It was asking for $1,000-$2,500 for floor seating in the Dome,
$350-$1,500 for most other seats in the stadium. A small number of
$50-$250 seats in the ``nosebleed'' sector disappeared quickly,
leaving $350 the best price available. Needless to say, tickets did
not sell like hotcakes. After several price reductions, the concert
was canceled. Though the promoter blamed a ``faulty sound system,''
sluggish sales were to blame. Maybe the promoter should have been
named Duh! Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the long view of Broadway tickets through the years, one
sees just how much prices have risen. In 1949, the top price for
orchestra seats to a musical was $6.60. Today, the top price for
musicals is $85. Even the cheapest balcony seats for today's
Broadway musicals cost $35 or $40. The range for plays is $25-$60.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing a Broadway show on its road tour in Houston is less
expensive. That's appropriate, since tours generally are scaled
down and play in halls twice the size of the Broadway theaters,
with more customers per performance.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, most touring shows in the Houston Broadway Series
charged $22-$35, with $38 the most expensive ticket for ``Les
Miserables.'' In the current Broadway Series, prices are $25-$50 _
except for ``Ragtime,'' with a $58 top ticket, and ``Riverdance''
at $69.50.
</P>
<P>
   That seems the general trend of price increases, with the cost
of orchestra seats rising more sharply than those in the balcony.
For Broadway productions or tours, it's useful to remember that
most theaters have comparatively few balcony seats, so most patrons
wind up paying the top price, which applies for orchestra seats and
front mezzanine as well.
</P>
<P>
   At Theater Under The Stars, Houston's homegrown producer of
musicals, prices have risen from the 1989 range of $15-$35 to
today's $15-$56. The cheapest seats stayed the same, while the cost
of prime orchestra seats went up 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Single-ticket prices for a show in the Alley Theater's
subscription season have increased from $10-$29 during the 1989-90
season to $19-$49 for the upcoming 1999-2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing the top ticket prices of Houston's largest resident
producers of plays and musicals, national tours and Broadway
prices, the increase during the past decade is fairly uniform. But
it's more than the overall cost-of-living increase, which the
consumer price index says rose 37.8 percent from 1988 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Scanning the rest of Houston's performing arts to see what
companies charge and how much the cost has increased in the past
decade is a case of mixing apples and oranges _ or perhaps, grapes
and watermelons.
</P>
<P>
   The opera, ballet and symphony are the big-ticket items of the
performing arts, because of the high cost of presentation and the
limited number of performances of most programs.
</P>
<P>
   Single tickets for a production at Houston Grand Opera cost
$10-$95 in 1989-90. They've nearly doubled for 1999-2000 _ to
$22-$182.
</P>
<P>
   Why is opera the most costly ticket of all performing arts? HGO
imports the world's top singers, directors and conductors _ the
same talents who perform in New York, London and Paris. The
productions are elaborate, expensive and play a limited number of
performances. Even at those prices, the box office does not begin
to pay the cost of production, which must be heavily underwritten
by philanthropic sources.
</P>
<P>
   Single tickets for a production by Houston Ballet cost $11-$84,
up from 1989's $8-$65. The company's annual run of ``The
Nutcracker'' has a top price of $65, however, because of its longer
run and larger attendance.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Symphony's ticket range for single concerts in its
upcoming 1999-2000 season is $16-$69 (classical series), $20-$69
(pops series). This is a jump from the 1989-90 prices of $7-$50
(classical), $10-$44 (pops series).
</P>
<P>
   Society for the Performing Arts presents a divergent array of
artists, from orchestras and dance troupes to solo musicians. SPA
estimates its average ticket price for music or dance events today
at $15-$38, an increase from 1989's $12-$23.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, intermediate-sized theaters such as Stages Repertory
Theater and Main Street Theater charge less than HGO, the Alley or
Broadway tours. Small and/or newly established theaters charge the
least of all. But even some of the funky pioneer troupes are
beginning to raise their prices as production standards improve.
</P>
<P>
   Stages' top prices have more than doubled in a decade, from
1989's $16.50 to the current $37. Cheaper seats went up by only
$3.50, from $13.50 10 years ago to today's $17.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Main Street Theater's increase has been scarcely
noticeable, from $10-$15 in 1989 to $13-$18 today.
</P>
<P>
   Although Houston's small non-Equity companies usually stay in
the $15-$18 range, some are breaking the $20 ceiling. While the
Little Room Downstairs Theater charges $16 for all seats to its
current ``The Last Session,'' New Heights Theater's prices for its
current ``Pageant'' are $18-$20, and Theater LaB Houston's recent
``Blood Brothers'' charged $20-$22. (None of these companies were
around in 1989.)
</P>
<P>
   While ticket costs have gone up enough to be prohibitive for
some patrons, there are ways to attend less expensively. Virtually
anyone can still afford to attend the performing arts _ at least
some of the time.
</P>
<P>
   As far as overall ticket prices are concerned, however, history
has shown that what goes up will keep going up. Ticket pricing is a
realm where the law of gravity does not apply. &QL;

<P>
   FAVIGNANA, Italy _ For more than 900 years, the fishermen of
this little island off Sicily have gone after bluefin tuna in the
same ritualistic way. For the four weeks when the huge fish migrate
through these waters, the men await a signal from their leader to
begin the mattanza, a highly choreographed communal hunt with
prayers and songs and rigid rules that is seldom seen around Sicily
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the fishermen, called tonnoretti, were waiting for
the signal, as they had been every day since late May. The island
community's head fisherman and de facto leader, called the rais,
watched the sea, to decide if it was calm enough for them to set
out in their long wooden boats. On Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday
he just shook his head slowly and uttered hopefully, ``Tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the weather relented and the mattanza began: six
wooden boats headed out to sea, the fishermen joining in
traditional song.
</P>
<P>
   Over three to four hours, the boats surrounded a huge web of
nets set up to trap the tuna as they swam past, corralling them
into successively smaller holding pens until they were tightly
surrounded in a final section _ the camera della morte, or chamber
of death. The thrashing fish were then confined closely enough to
let the tonnoretti gaff them and haul them aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The ritual, which on this day netted 38 tuna, is the antithesis
of large-scale commercial fishing. But after a stop at the fish
processing plant in nearby Trapani, about 70 percent of the tuna
were destined for the same place so many bluefin land today: the
sushi bars and fish markets of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   For hundreds of years, the fishermen of Favignana could live off
the sea. But the cannery on the island, the largest building there,
closed 16 years ago for lack of product.
</P>
<P>
   With each year, the fish have become smaller and fewer. The
tonnoretti are not sure why, and the only finger they uncertainly
point is at the factory ships of the Japanese that prowl the ocean
beyond Gibraltar. In the last 25 years, fish as large as 1,154
pounds have been caught, but the average weight of this year's tuna
has been only 140 pounds. In the mid-1800s, it was possible to pull
14,000 tuna from the sea each season, but by 1987 the number
reached a low of 285. This year, the fishermen will feel lucky if
the mattanzas take a thousand.
</P>
<P>
   The plant pays only about $2.25 a pound for the fish, which is
barely enough for the tonnoretti to rent their nets. As a result,
almost none of the sons of the tonnoretti work at sea. Instead,
they find jobs catering for the island's tourists, or they head to
the mainland. The sea no longer holds the work of the future. And
each time they head out in those wooden boats, a way of life ebbs
further away.

   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Tuesday narrowed the scope of
a federal law banning discrimination against people with
disabilities, saying it does not apply to such conditions as poor
eyesight that can be corrected medically.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling on three related cases, the court dismissed lawsuits by
two nearsighted pilots, a truck driver who is almost blind in one
eye and a mechanic with high blood pressure _ all of whom were
either fired or denied employment.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the lawsuits was brought under the 1990 American with
Disabilities Act (ADA), which was designed to end discrimination on
the job, in housing and at medical facilities and other places that
serve the public. The court's dismissal of the suits means that the
ADA did not protect those plaintiffs and others like them.
</P>
<P>
   Before the decisions, the number of people covered by the ADA
was estimated to be as high as 160 million people, more than half
the 272 million population of the United States. As a result of the
court's action Monday, the law covers about 43 million, according
to Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who wrote two of the court's three
opinions.
</P>
<P>
   The ADA defines disability as ``a physical or mental impairment
that substantially limits one or more major life activities'' or a
condition where a person is ``being regarded as having such
impairment.''
</P>
<P>
   In her opinion in the case of the two nearsighted pilots,
O'Connor said, ``We hold that determination of whether an
individual is disabled should be made with reference to measures
that mitigate the individual's impairment, including, in this
instance, eyeglasses and contact lenses.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the poor eyesight of the two pilots, Karen Sutton and
Kimberly Hinton, failed to ``substantially limit a major life
activity'' for them, and therefore they were not covered under the
ADA. In the court's 7-2 decision, the dissenters were Justices John
Paul Stevens and Stephen Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   The court reached the same conclusion in the other two cases,
ruling unanimously that truck driver Haille Kirkingburg and, by a
7-2 vote, that mechanic Vaughn Murphy should not be considered
disabled under the ADA.
</P>
<P>
   In each of the cases, the court also ruled that the plaintiffs
failed to show that the companies they sued had banned them from an
entire class of jobs, such as pilot or driver. Instead, the court
said, the companies refused to consider each person for a specific
job because of strict, reasonable criteria that the plaintiffs
failed to meet. Stevens and Breyer also dissented in the Murphy
case.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Sutton and Hinton, twin sisters who were regional
airline pilots from Spokane, Wash., applied for jobs as commercial
pilots at United Airlines in Colorado. Although they met basic age,
education, experience and Federal Aviation Administration
qualifications, United turned them down for employment because
their uncorrected vision was worse than the airline's requirement
of 20/100.
</P>
<P>
   In Kirkingburg's case, his employer, Albertsons Inc., a
supermarket chain, hired him as a truck driver in 1990 based in
Portland, Ore. Kirkingburg had more than a decade's experience and
performed well when on a road test for the company. But two years
later, he took another exam and failed to meet Department of
Transportation standards for drivers. As a result, the company
fired him.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to meet Transportation Department standards also led to
Murphy's dismissal. Murphy, who suffers from high blood pressure,
was hired by United Parcel Service in Manhattan, Kan., as a
mechanic, a job that required him to drive to different locations
around the city.
</P>
<P>
   A month after being hired, the company discovered Murphy's high
blood pressure, which disqualified him from driving under
government regulations, and fired him.
</P>
<P>
   In its rulings Tuesday, the court said that under the ADA, a
company can prefer certain physical characteristics over others.
For instance, it can favor people with perfect vision over
near-sighted people.
</P>
<P>
   ``An employer is free to decide that physical characteristics or
medical conditions that are not impairments are preferable to
others, just as it is free to decide that some limiting impairments
make individuals less than ideally suited for a job,'' O'Connor
said in the pilots' case.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Fay, spokesman for the American Association of People with
Disabilities, a Washington-based group, called the court's
decisions a ``terrible setback.'' He added, ``The law now excludes
people it was meant to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Chai Feldblum, a Georgetown University law professor, said,
``These decisions create the absurd result of a person being
disabled enough to be fired from a job but not disabled enough to
challenge the firing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stephen Bokat, general counsel of the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, called the rulings ``extremely important'' for American
business. ``It means that those with true disabilities will
continue to be covered, but people with easily correctable
conditions will not be considered disabled.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years employers have won 92 percent of the 700 ADA
cases resolved in court from 1992 to 1997, according to the
American Bar Association. Lower courts had split over how far the
law's protections extend in the cases decided Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate ruling that also centered on the ADA, the high
court held 6-3 in a Georgia case that states may have to place
people with mental disabilities in homelike settings if they can
fare just as well there as in state hospitals. In a narrow
decision, the court said the ADA requires such community placement
of the mentally disabled whenever appropriate. The dissenters were
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Clarence Thomas and
Antonin Scalia
</P>
<P>
   Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, writing for the court majority,
said, ``We confront the question whether the proscription of
discrimination may require placement of persons with mental
disabilities in community settings, rather than in institutions.
The answer, we hold, is a qualified yes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case, Lois Curtis and Elaine Wilson, two mentally
disabled women, challenged the state of Georgia's insistence that
they remain in a state hospital in Atlanta until places in a less
restrictive community care center opened up.
</P>
<P>
   They argued that the state should make places for them at the
care center because they could interact with more people there who
are not disabled and that forcing them to wait amounted to
isolating and segregating them from mainstream American life.
</P>
<P>
   The court said the 1990 law requires states to place the
mentally disabled in the ``most integrated setting'' appropriate,
but only after ``taking into account the resources available to the
state and the needs of others with mental disabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how many of the 70,000 mentally disabled people
living in state hospitals nationwide might be affected by the
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ADAPT, a national disability rights group based in Denver,
praised the ruling for reinforcing ``the fundamental intent of the
ADA, which is to prevent discrimination and promote the integration
of people with disabilities into our communities,'' according to
the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Downing, a Georgia assistant attorney general, said the
ruling ``doesn't appear to be too burdensome.'' She noted that the
court did not condemn the state's practice of keeping eligible
people on a community-placement waiting list.

POP ACTS TAKING TICKET PRICES TO THE LIMIT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICK MITCHELL 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Quick, which is more important? Two premium tickets to
Neil Young or your monthly car payment?
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, that's the kind of choice pop music fans must face
as concert ticket prices keep going up, up, up.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the average cost of a ticket for the year's 50
top-grossing concert tours was $19.02. In 1998, the average cost
had gone up to $33.59, according to figures tallied by Pollstar,
the trade magazine of the pop-concert industry.
</P>
<P>
   That's an increase of 76.6 percent. By comparison, the overall
consumer price index as measured by the federal Bureau of Labor
Statistics has increased 37.8 percent in that same time frame.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the cost of concert tickets has gone up at more
than double the rate for all consumer items in the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   By far the greatest increase has been the cost of premium seats.
When the Eagles broke the $100 ticket barrier in some markets on
their 1994 tour, fans willingly forked over the dough because it
was viewed as a once-in-a-lifetime reunion.
</P>
<P>
   But now, triple-digit ticket prices are becoming more the rule
than the exception for aging rock icons on the road. Rod Stewart
had a top price of $100 for his spring date at The Woodlands
Pavilion just outside of Houston. Young sold a limited number of
$125 V.I.P. tickets to his recent solo shows at the Aerial Theater
in Houston; all other seats were ``only'' $75.
</P>
<P>
   The Bob Dylan-Paul Simon arena double-bill is getting $125 in
some cities, as is Cher's comeback tour with Cyndi Lauper. Last
year, the Rolling Stones charged up to $350 a ticket _ the kind of
high-roller tariff previously reserved for Frank Sinatra or Barbra
Streisand on New Year's Eve in Las Vegas _ for the band's first
arena tour in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Although the tour didn't sell out in many cities, the Stones
carried home enough loot to feel the unprecedented prices were
justified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Artists have given up the illusion that they're not in it for
the money,'' says Pollstar editor Gary Bongiovanni.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-five years ago, a lot of rock artists wanted to
maintain their countercultural credentials. That's not as important
now. The truth is, the artist sets the price. If Garth Brooks
charges $20 a ticket and Rod Stewart charges $70, it's because
that's how much money they wanted to make that night.''
</P>
<P>
   Even bands and artists that haven't had a hit record in decades
are getting in on the action. The double-bill of Journey and
Foreigner has a top asking price of $76 for a July date at The
Woodlands Pavilion. The Allman Brothers want $65 for the best seats
in the house, and the Motown revue of the Temptations and the Four
Tops commands $61.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to these shows, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers'
Sept. 19 date at The Woodlands Pavilion seems almost underpriced at
$60.50 for all reserved seats, until you realize that general
admission lawn tickets for Petty are going for $30.50, while a seat
on the hill costs only $18.75 for the Allmans, $16.50 for the
Tempts/Tops and $13.50 for Journey/Foreigner.
</P>
<P>
   For Friday's Houston date at The Woodlands Pavilion, Cher
switched to a simplified pricing plan of $35 general admission and
$75 reserved, rather than the original plan starting at $25 and
topping out at $125. The sold-out take added up to the same amount
either way.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Roux, the talent buyer for Houston-based Pace Concerts, says
the trend in the concert tour business has been toward multitiered
pricing structures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always felt that the seats up front are worth more than
the seats in the back,'' says Roux, who is responsible for booking
the pop-music season at The Woodlands Pavilion, as well as
overseeing Pace operations in several Southern and Southwestern
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in 1995, we decided we wanted to try to hold all the lawn
seats to $15. In order to compensate for that, we pushed the front
price up. I think that type of pricing structure has probably
become more prevalent as we went along, because it's working.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 42 pop concerts that played the Pavilion last year, Roux
estimates that 38 were profitable; 13 of those were sell-outs. For
most shows, a relatively small number of seats are priced in the
highest tier, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are about four or five ways we scale The Woodlands, but
in some cases, we only have 329 seats at the highest price (out of
13,000 capacity). In most cases, it's only 160 people buying two
tickets making that decision.''
</P>
<P>
   As Bongiovanni points out, these are the same hard-core fans who
would be tempted to pay a scalper even more money for a front-row
seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many years, the top artists have been watching the people
sitting down front paying much more money than the face value of a
ticket. It got to the point where the artist was starting to feel
stupid. If people were willing to dictate that a $30 ticket was
worth $130, why not?''
</P>
<P>
   In December 1997, Pace Concerts was purchased by SFX
Entertainment. Since divesting itself of its radio broadcasting
empire, SFX has spent more than $1 billion in the past 18 months
purchasing regional concert promotion companies and sports
management firms.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Pace, SFX has swallowed up such respected
operations as Delsener-Slater in New York, Bill Graham Presents in
San Francisco and Cellar Door International, which ruled the
Southeast. As a result of its spending spree, SFX has acquired full
or partial ownership of 82 concert venues, including at least one
amphitheater in each of the top 10 U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
   Independent promoters have accused SFX of using its newly
acquired national dominance to outbid competitors for national
tours such as Dylan/Simon and Petty.
</P>
<P>
   Pollstar's Bongiovanni doesn't hold SFX solely responsible for
escalating ticket prices. But he observes that the company has
clearly embraced the trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got at least 20 national tours out this year.
Competitors have accused them of bumping up the cost of the tours
they've acquired, like the Petty tour, because that's what they
needed to do. Ultimately, that will result in higher ticket prices,
because the artists don't say no to more money.''
</P>
<P>
   In a standard concert performance contract, Roux says, about 85
percent of the net profit after expenses goes to the artist, with
the promoter collecting the remaining 15 percent for assuming the
risk of putting the show on. In some cases, the artist might reap
as much as 95 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While greed remains a powerful motivational force for driving up
prices, Bongiovanni and Roux agree that, ultimately, the buying
public determines how high the prices will go.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Eagles' tour had not been wildly successful, with fans
supporting the price structure, it might not have led to the
Fleetwood Mac tour. From there, it started to build upon itself,''
Roux says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we've got the Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young tour coming
out this summer. These superstar reunion tours are motivated mostly
by money. These are wealthy guys. At the end of the day, they want
to know how much they can expect to make by getting back out on the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for the Eagles' 1994 concert at Rice Stadium topped out
at $85. The first pop act to break the $100 barrier at The
Woodlands Pavilion was Bette Midler. Generally, it's veteran
artists appealing to middle-aged baby-boomers who charge the most
for tickets. But the Spice Girls got a top price of $75 from their
pre-teen fans _ and their boomer parents.
</P>
<P>
   For many people, the idea of spending $50-$100 for a concert
ticket seems extravagant. Jerry Smith, an Internet salesman in
Houston, took his 14-year-old daughter to see the Backstreet Boys
at The Woodlands Pavilion last year. He paid about $25 per ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like it was a reasonable price,'' he said. ``But I
would definitely freeze at $50 a ticket. I look at the ads on TV
now, you see these concerts, they're all $75.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the face value of the tickets, patrons also must
pay a service charge to the ticket outlet. Ticketmaster uses a
sliding scale for service charges, says Chris Doss, director of
promotions and marketing. Other variables include cash vs. credit
and whether you buy your ticket in person or via phone or the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more expensive the ticket the higher the service charge,''
Doss says. ``The least expensive way is to pay cash at a ticket
center.''
</P>
<P>
   But some avid music fans from the baby-boom generation indicate
they are still willing to pay top dollar for acts they really want
to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a lot of people who really trip the switch for
us,'' says Doug Darrow, a Houston attorney. ``But I think we'd pay
$200 to see Springsteen again. I think we're emotionally prepared
for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Darrow's wife, Susan Darrow, a marketing manager for a Texas
bank, said the couple used to go to more national concerts before
Rockefeller's closed two years ago. Now, she says, they prefer to
support regional artists who appear regularly in local clubs.
</P>
<P>
   But, she added, ``If it's someone we really want to see _ Dylan,
Springsteen _ price is not the issue for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett Elliott, a copywriter for a local advertising agency, says
he spends a ``disproportionate'' amount of his discretionary income
on concert tickets. He recently paid $75 to see Young at the Aerial
Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, that was too much, especially when you consider that he
had the quintessential low overhead _ two microphones, a harmonica,
eight guitars,'' he says. ``At the same time, I'd do it again. It
was a high-quality show.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott says he resents scalpers and wonders how they manage to
obtain so many good seats. But he admits he that he will go to a
scalper for certain shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember one time, I was in a scalper's office, and there
were these young girls _ like, too young to drive _ and they were
just agonizing over whether to spend that much money to see Prince.
</P>
<P>
   ``I turned to them and said, `Go ahead and spend the money. When
all is said and done, you'll be glad you did. Six months from now,
you won't miss the money. But you might regret not getting a better
seat to a great show.'''
</P>
<P>
   Pace's Roux believes it's in the best interest of the concert
industry to try to hold the line on prices whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``My No. 1 goal is to try to make deals that will allow the
ticket prices to be set at a level where they are accessible to the
vast majority of fans who have an interest in seeing the
attraction. That's how we sustain and grow our business.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, with the economy strong and many baby boomers enjoying
their peak earning years, Bongiovanni forecasts that ticket prices
will continue to rise. He adds that artists who play against the
trend could be doing themselves a big favor in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Garth Brooks has made a big thing about his populist image by
setting his prices low,'' Bongiovanni says.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Brooks, Garth's brother and co-manager, says Brooks'
insistence on holding prices down stems from his own experience as
a teen-ager going to rock concerts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some shows that he wanted to go to, but he couldn't
afford it. The main thing was, he wanted to make price not an
issue. If you don't go see someone, it should be because you don't
want to, not because you can't afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he could easily be charging three or four times as
much, Brooks has held the line at $20-$25 a ticket. He also insists
that tickets to his shows have the base price listed separately
from service fees and other add-on costs.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks' populist stand has resulted in a fanatical audience
loyalty that has carried over into his phenomenal album sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people appreciate it,'' says Kelly. ``I know I
would.''

A GREAT AMERICAN WINE SWIRLS IN TURMOIL 
</HEADLINE>

 (af)  
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEALDSBURG, Calif. _ The question sounds like a line from an old
radio script:
</P>
<P>
   Can a minuscule winery, started by a couple of ornery,
rough-hewn rural Californians, find continuing happiness as part of
an international combine owned by a big-time venture capitalist
from Wall Street?
</P>
<P>
   The winery is Williams Selyem, whose pinot noirs have moved to
the head of the table in the years since the first was made in a
garage in 1981. Fewer than 8,000 cases a year are produced. Almost
all go directly to people on the Williams Selyem mailing list,
which is as hard to crack as the guest list for a royal wedding.
(Two of the winery's seven full-time employees are officially
designated as ``keepers of the list.'')
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of us, happily, the stuff shows up from time to
time on top restaurant wine lists, like Montrachet in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Smoky, voluptuous, intensely flavored, Williams Selyem pinot
noir is among the most coveted American wines. Part of its cachet
is scarcity, but by no means all; it is surely one of the best of
its type, along with Calera and Domaine Drouhin and a few others.
Now the winery has been sold, and the wine world is watching
intently to see if standards will be maintained. Nobody knows the
answer, because no outsider has tasted the new Williams Selyem yet.
</P>
<P>
   The new owner is John Dyson, a scion of the Hudson River
squirearchy. A former New York state agriculture commissioner and a
former deputy mayor for finance and economic development under
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Dyson is often credited with creating the I
New York advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he paid Burt Williams and Ed Selyem $9.5 million for
the operation, which came onto the market because Selyem developed
a serious back problem after years of hefting wine cases. One of
the unsuccessful bidders was Joe Montana, the onetime San Francisco
'49ers quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson said he sees Williams Selyem as ``a job of stewardship, to
be enhanced, not exploited.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dyson's big bucks bought him no vineyards; Williams Selyem
has always been made from grapes purchased under handshake
agreements. Many of those agreements continue, but not the most
important one, which covered the grapes produced on Joe Rochioli's
prize plot in the Russian River Valley, his so-called West Block.
</P>
<P>
   Those grapes went into Williams Selyem's Rochioli pinot noir,
one of the wines produced under the ancien regime from grapes of
single vineyards. It usually commanded the highest ratings and
prices, and it was the winery's benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Dyson get the long-term services of Williams, the
winery's gruff winemaker, who once told a visiting Canadian
journalist: ``We were friends with most of the growers, so I knew
we could get great fruit. Then it's just a matter of not messing it
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams agreed to a continuing role after the winery sale, and
Bob Cabral, the new winemaker, says he made the 1998 vintage
``under Burt's direction.'' That wine _ only 4,200 cases, owing to
sparse fruit production _ rests in oak barrels, awaiting release
next year. So far, it seems promising.
</P>
<P>
   But the two men came from different generations and different
cultures. Williams, 57, is self-taught, for example, and Cabral
taught winemaking at Santa Rosa Junior College. People who worked
with them both say that they didn't mesh very well.
</P>
<P>
   So for this year's vintage, Cabral, a heavyset, unassuming
37-year-old, is more or less on his own. Williams ``has kind of
backed out,'' Cabral said, spending most of his time on his fishing
boat in Santa Barbara. Selyem spends summers in Alaska, winters in
Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson installed Jean L. Arnold, a respected wine executive who
helped put Jordan Vineyards on the viticultural map, as president
of Williams Selyem, but she, too, found it a difficult place to
work and left. The conflicts between Ms. Arnold and Dyson
reportedly centered on questions of marketing strategy for Dyson's
wines.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the turmoil, a 20-year-old winery worker, Taylor J.
Atkins, was accidentally asphyxiated on Jan. 7 in a bottling tank
full of deadly nitrogen. It was as if some kind of curse hung over
Williams Selyem.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, rumors began flying that Dyson planned to double,
triple or quadruple Williams Selyem's output to recoup his
investment _ rumors that Cabral denies. The present winery, he
said, will never produce more than 15,000 cases a year, which is
the target for the 2005 vintage, and ``anyway, the place is very
profitable as is.''
</P>
<P>
   At its best, pinot noir can be a captivating wine: rich, complex
and sensuous, with the scent of cherries and chocolate and
sometimes leather. But the grape that makes it is capricious and
demanding, so much so that Marq de Villiers called his book about
the Calera Wine Co., a California pinot noir specialist,
``Heartbreak Grape'' (HarperCollins West, 1994).
</P>
<P>
   Even in France, its homeland, it reaches greatness only in a few
small plots in Burgundy, and there only in the hands of gifted
winemakers like Henri Jayer and Armand Rousseau. For decades, New
World winemakers tried with limited luck to duplicate the subtlety
and silkiness of fine Burgundy.
</P>
<P>
   The key, as it turned out, was a cool climate, and it is in such
climates that pinot noir has finally succeeded in the United States
_ in Oregon, in certain areas near Santa Barbara, in the Carneros
district, between the Napa and Sonoma valleys, and in the Russian
River Valley, northwest of Santa Rosa in Sonoma County.
</P>
<P>
   In most of them, coastal breezes and fogs keep the temperatures
down; other successful pinot noir vineyards are cool because they
are planted at high altitudes, like Chalone, founded by Richard
Graff near Pinnacles National Park in central California in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Williams-Selyem was a leader in developing and perfecting
California pinot noirs with Burgundian characteristics. Its best
wines have always been made from cool-climate grapes. Some have
come from the Russian River Valley _ the Rochioli West Block,
identified as Rochioli on the label, and the Rochioli River Block,
identified as River Block on the label, and the Allen vineyard,
also farmed by the Rochioli family.
</P>
<P>
   Some have come from nearby lowland vineyards, like Olivet Lane.
And some have come from the coastal mountains near Fort Ross, west
of here, including the Hirsch, Precious Mountain and Summa
vineyards.
</P>
<P>
   Other suppliers are Ferrington Vineyards in the Anderson Valley,
near Ukiah, and the Coastlands vineyards of Diane and David Cobb,
east-facing plots well above the fog line.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Neither Summa nor Olivet Lane will be available to Williams
Selyem in the future. But the loss of the West Block, which was
planted in 1969 and 1970, hurts most of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was faithful,'' said Joe Rochioli, sitting on a terrace
overlooking his vines and a tree line that blocked the meandering
Russian River from view. ``I gave Williams and Selyem grapes from
the West Block even after my son, Tom, joined me and started making
wine, even when Tom ran short. But when Burt sold out, it was our
chance to get back the fruit we needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Relaxed and genial as he may appear, Rochioli is a man possessed
in the vineyard, determined, as he said, ``to grow better grapes
than anyone.'' He and his workers painstakingly thin the vines and
discard less-than-perfect clusters, concentrating all the plant's
energy on a small amount of fruit. The results are yields of two to
three tons an acre, against eight for some rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' he said. ``I'm up at 4 a.m., then out in the
vineyard. I don't owe anybody anything. I built my own house,
plumbing, electricity, everything. I don't own a suit. I hate
vacations. For me, farming is all about pride, not money.''
</P>
<P>
   Rochioli is stocky and vigorous at 65, with forearms the size of
fireplace logs. His father grew hops on this land; now he is
considered one of the world's best grape-growers by his peers. He
is careful to praise both Dyson and Cabral as ``good men,'' but he
has serious doubts about expanding Williams Selyem's output and
especially about bringing pinot noir grapes from other areas to the
Russian River Valley to make wine. ``Different nose, different
flavors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Just down Westside Road from the glamorous Rochioli spread, the
Williams Selyem winery occupies a cluster of small,
utilitarian-looking buildings, including a modest new office. There
is no visitor center and no tasting room on the dusty site. Nor is
there any elaborate landscaping or any sign out front, only a
discreet street number, 6575.
</P>
<P>
   There are 10,000 customers on the Williams Selyem mailing list,
including the White House, but not many make their way here.
</P>
<P>
   Cabral, the son of grape-growing parents, worked for seven years
at De Loach Vineyards, another well-regarded Russian River Valley
operation. He greeted me warily, well aware, as he put it, that
``everything I do here is under a microscope.'' Before joining
Dyson he worried, he said, about whether he could maintain Williams
Selyem's reputation for quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my doubts,'' Cabral said. ``I still do, sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   So do others.
</P>
<P>
   Robert M. Parker Jr., the wine critic, said recently that he
feared the new owners might try to make money by living off the
winery's name.
</P>
<P>
   One of California's leading sommeliers, Larry Stone of Rubicon,
a San Francisco restaurant, has been a Williams Selyem fan for
years. The 1991's and 1992's were brilliant, he told me, ``complete
wines, fleshy and complex, way beyond anything seen in California
before.'' The 1996's are fine as well, he added, ``really masterful
products of intuitive artisans.''
</P>
<P>
   But the future, Stone argues, is an unmapped road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who's in charge,'' he said. ``Dyson has paid a
long price, and it remains to be seen whether he can deliver. He
bought a lot of good will, but that will evaporate if he can't put
the goods in the bottle. What kind of enterprise is this going to
be? How big?''
</P>
<P>
   Absentee owners are not necessarily bad, especially if they have
deep pockets. When a wealthy Japanese group bought Ridge Vineyards
in 1986, a renowned specialist in powerful zinfandels and cabernet
sauvignons, it pumped money into the property and permitted its
winemaker, Paul Draper, to do exactly as he wished. Ridge has gone
from strength to strength.
</P>
<P>
   Cabral is no Paul Draper, but he has developed a formula that he
hopes will produce both quality and quantity in years to come.
</P>
<P>
   He envisages making as much of the single-vineyard wines, the
top of the line, as he can, ``and trying to keep them
extraordinary.'' The grapes for those will come from the longtime
suppliers that remain on the Williams Selyem roster, plus the first
vineyard the winery has ever owned, a 38-acre tract near
Guerneville it bought several months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the growth will come in less expensive blends labeled
Russian River Valley, if all the grapes come from vineyards in this
area, or Sonoma Coast or Sonoma County, if the grapes come from
broader areas. Will those bottlings dilute the value of the
carefully nurtured Williams Selyem brand?
</P>
<P>
   And what if Dyson decides to put the Williams Selyem label on
wines made from grapes grown elsewhere? His Pebble Ridge Vineyards
&AMP; Wine Estates owns Milbrook Vineyards in upstate New York, which
produces some of the best wines east of the Mississippi; Villa
Pillo Estate in Tuscany, and Mistral and Vista Verde Vineyards on
the central California coast.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he brought grapes from the Hollister area, south of
San Francisco, to the winery here and made wine from them. But
Cabral said that no decision had been made yet about releasing the
wine.
</P>
<P>
   If Williams Selyem stumbles, plenty of able competitors are
waiting to lure its customers. Some are newcomers, relatively
speaking, like the ambitious Walt and Joan Flowers and the tiny
Quail Hill Vineyard. A bottle of Quail Hill's emphatic Lynmar
reserve pinot noir impressed several of us at dinner in Santa Rosa
recently when tasted against a group of Russian River rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are well established figures like Tom Dehlinger and
Gary Farrell, as well as our old friend Tom Rochioli, to whom it
will now fall to make his father's prized West Block grapes into
pinor noir. Will he be the next pinor noir superstar?

(ATTN: N.C.)  
 CBS GOLF ANALYST WHO FELL FROM GRACE WILL TELL HIS SIDE OF STORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RON WAGNER   
 Times-News, Hendersonville, N.C.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAT ROCK, N.C. _ Ben Wright is writing back.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since that fateful interview with Valerie Helmbreck of the
Wilmington (Del.) News Journal on May 11, 1995, the former CBS golf
analyst has had to sit back at his home here and helplessly take
shot after shot from the print media.
</P>
<P>
   For four years, he took hits that drove him to depression. Hits
that took away the job he loved dearly.
</P>
<P>
   But now Wright is firing back, in the form of an autobiography
he finished this month entitled ``Good Bounces and Bad Lies.''
</P>
<P>
   It's due out in August, and with it Wright hopes to tell his
story. In his own words. No reporters, no blaring headlines, no
surprise angles.
</P>
<P>
   And then, he doesn't want to talk about it anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book will, I hope, lay it all to rest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'' would be the firestorm that erupted after Helmbreck
quoted Wright as saying that lesbians were hurting the corporate
sponsorships of the Ladies Professional Golf Association and that
women generally have a more difficult time with golf because
certain gender-unique parts of their anatomy get in the way of a
good swing.
</P>
<P>
   Wright was roundly roasted and he issued a staunch denial _ with
CBS' backing _ before later retracting the denial and admitting to
Sports Illustrated in its ``Golf Plus'' section in May 1998 that he
had indeed made the comments.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, he's been suspended by CBS and blocked from
working in television unless someone buys out his CBS contract,
which expires Nov. 1. Wright says he has reconciled with Helmbreck,
and he's ready to move on with his life, with or without
television.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's all behind me. I'm trying to persuade people, let's go
on,'' he said. ``Why the hell do I have to keep looking back?''
</P>
<P>
   Wright takes particular exception to the beating he took from
journalists he knew personally. Even the generally positive Sports
Illustrated piece written by Jamie Diaz draws his ire, primarily
because of the headline: ``By declaring war on CBS, Ben Wright was
finally able to make peace with Valerie Helmbreck.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I never said that. That was their headline ... CBS took grave
exception to that, and I said `I'm not going to wage war with the
people who pay me my money. They're doing me a favor.' That's just
a pure invention of these people,'' he said of the headline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It caused me a lot of grief, with CBS saying, `Why the hell do
we need to pay you if you're at war with us?' I never said it. It
was just a pure Sports Illustrated ploy. I don't care for that too
much.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did me no favors. Nobody has done me any favors, but in
my book I'm going to outline most of the truth as I see it, but
without bitterness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wright's relationship with CBS, despite the fact that he still
draws a salary, has been icy since the story. In it, Wright says
the network encouraged him to lie, which is something CBS denies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports Illustrated screwed me twice, so they won't get another
chance,'' he said. ``I'm not exactly in love with the print media.
I'm a print media man myself. I was trained that way. I started in
the print business in 1954. So I was really surprised at how many
guys turned on me and savaged me. Guys that I knew, that I thought
were friends. But that's the way it is today. It's a dog-eat-dog
world.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wright was quick to point out that telling his side of this
particular tale is a small part of the book, which will be
published by Sleeping Bear Press. The motivation, he said, is to
``tell a lot of funny stories, which is what I like to do,'' as
well as some not-so-funny ones, like the six years he and his
sister spent sleeping underground while his native England took
bomb after bomb from Germany during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Wright was hired by CBS in 1972, when he moved to the United
States. In 1982 he settled in western North Carolina, first in
Asheville and then moved in 1988 to Flat Rock, which he said
reminds him of Scotland, his mother's homeland. All the while, he
was making a name for himself as perhaps television's most popular
golf analyst, with a rich voice that eloquently carried an
extensive, poetic vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   Wright says that people tell him every day how much they miss
him on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss it, but at the same time you have to move on. There's
no point sitting and feeling sorry for myself,'' he said. ``I did
that for a while and it didn't get anywhere, so I just decided to
get on with my life and go do what I'm going to do ... I find
myself damn busy.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright disputes the notion that he's seen as insensitive or, at
worst, a sexist homophobe.
</P>
<P>
   ''Absolute rubbish. It's not a perception of the general public.
It's a perception of the media, if it's a perception at all,'' he
said. ``I have more friends than I ever had before, because people
think that I was screwed or shafted or whatever you like to call
it. I don't give a damn about perceptions. I go on about my life
and I do what I have to do.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people who really know me, know me for what I am. And
they're the people who matter. The people who want to put me down,
get on with it. But the people who really matter, don't. Because
they know I'm not a bad guy ... I don't have to listen to the
people who want to put me down four years later.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright said the best part of life after CBS is the time he
spends playing golf. Golf-course design, documentaries,
commercials, writing, speaking engagements and, of course, golf
tournaments take up Wright's time these days.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't know if he will even try to get back into television
once his contract expires.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll be 67 by the end of the contract, and I think I'm going
to do what a lot of people do when they get to be my age _ go and
play golf,'' he said. ``I'm downsizing. I've lived a grand
lifestyle on the CBS expense account, and now I'm living a much
quieter life. And quite frankly, I enjoy it. Enormously.''

 &HT;    Bush cites 'government intrusion' in decision to veto
accountability bill
 &HT;    By Jerry Graham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush has vetoed a bill that
would have ensured public accountability by groups spending tax
dollars on programs designed to help the poor, the disabled and the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was introduced by state Rep. Bob Glaze to require that
the 55 community action agencies in Texas open their records to the
public and hold public meetings when they decide how they will use
tax dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said in a veto memorandum that the bill could subject
``faith-based organizations in Texas to unnecessary government
intrusion'' if they get state or federal grants of tax dollars to
provide the services.
</P>
<P>
   Glaze (D-Gilmer) introduced the bill because of years of
financial irregularities by the East Texas Human Development Co.,
known as HUDCO.
</P>
<P>
   Glaze was baffled and disappointed that Bush vetoed the bill
under the rationale that it would intrude upon faith-based
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just doesn't make sense that something should be vetoed
that simply exposes the record of where taxpayers' dollars go,''
Glaze said. ``You can draw a lot of nonsense from that. Him running
for president, it is hard for me to believe he would veto a bill
that does that.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaze said his bill was narrowly drafted to apply to HUDCO and
the other 54 community action agencies that receive federal grants
funneled through the state.
</P>
<P>
   It would not apply to faith-based organizations unless they
received a federal contract to operate as a community action
agency. And even then it would open up to the public just those
funds the organization receives in tax dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
   HUDCO has operated Head Start and programs providing housing,
weatherization, energy assistance and emergency services in Gregg
and four surrounding counties. HUDCO received some $3 million in
Head Start education funds annually.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1996, the Longview News-Journal reported HUDCO spent
$900,000 in Head Start education funds that included $17,000 to pay
for a parent-staff banquet. About $12,500 of that money was spent
on gifts for board and staff members, the newspaper reported. Other
funds went for snow cone and popcorn machines, cameras, sewing
machines, microcassette recorders and similar items. At that time,
less than one-fourth of Longview's eligible children were being
served by the local Head Start program and that continues to be the
case.
</P>
<P>
   HUDCO was forced to give up its Head Start contract earlier this
year and bids to take over the local program are being considered
now.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal auditors have criticized HUDCO for a
``pervasive misapplication of grant funds,'' financial and
management problems, failure to follow state and federal
regulations in spending grant funds, substandard or nonexistent
record keeping, violating federal contract terms, failure to seek
competitive bids and improperly shifting funds from one program to
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever the tax dollars go, that is where we have the right
to see. That argument did not sell,'' Glaze said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush vetoed more than 30 bills and two concurrent resolutions
that were passed by lawmakers during the 1999 legislative session,
according to the Associated Press. He handed most of the vetoes
late Sunday, hours before a midnight deadline for him to take
action on legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg County Clerk Laurie Woloszyn, upon learning of Bush's
veto, expressed concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow! I am disappointed, I am really disappointed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Woloszyn, a Republican like Bush, served two months on the HUDCO
board of directors and then quit in disgust over the way the agency
handles public funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe it. In my mind, he obviously was not familiar
with our local problems. I am disappointed,'' Woloszyn said of the
veto.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone, any entity that is entitled to governmental funds
needs to be open to the public. That is the only way you are going
to ensure the most proper spending of those funds,'' Woloszyn said.
</P>
<P>
   She disagreed with Bush's assertion the bill would unnecessarily
intrude upon faith-based organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The organizations' main purpose is to help those people, and,
``When it comes to spending those funds, even a faith-based
organization needs to allow public access to them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine. I just don't comprehend that kind of logic as
far as opposition from a faith-based organization,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is a genuine, true, faith-based organization, it should
not matter to them if the public is allowed to attend those
meetings where they discuss the public funds, the distribution and
whatever guidelines they have to follow,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Glaze said he will introduce the bill again in the next
legislative session two years from now, and Woloszyn said she would
join him in trying to push it through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Glaze is to be commended for committing to do it again,
because it needs to be done,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Glaze said Bush's second objection to the bill was that any
future problems such as those with HUDCO would be dealt with
promptly by the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs,
which supervises the grant programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't do that, as we have witnessed over the last five
years with HUDCO,'' Glaze said.
</P>
<P>
   Glaze said officials with TDHCA and the federal Department of
Health and Human Services told him that when they try to deal with
problem agencies such as HUDCO, they find they cannot shut down a
federal program without a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lawsuit requires a lot of time, and their history on winning
those is very bad,'' Glaze said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If HUDCO wanted to sue now on one of the programs they lost,
TDHCA tells me it is almost impossible to beat the thing. You are
talking about a two- to five-year court battle before it is
complete with a verdict,'' Glaze said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they stay in charge of the program until the court battle
is over. That is the sad part about it. And they can even continue
to get funds appropriated,'' Glaze said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the governor's staff called him Saturday night to tell
him of Bush's objections. He said he warned that Bush should avoid
such a stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, 'You don't understand. This is not a good thing for
the governor. This puts him in the position of saying he doesn't
want to ensure that all tax dollars be exposed to public scrutiny,'
`` Glaze said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a right everyone should have. None of this should be
in the dark or kept quiet. We should have an opportunity to know
where these dollars go, particularly whenever the services are
delivered to people who are as vulnerable as this group of people
are, and in such important programs as Head Start,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand his rationale at all. And I think this
thing will not play well nationally whenever we look at it in terms
where the governor is not agreeable to federal dollars being
exposed to public scrutiny,'' Glaze said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Bush's position is especially puzzling because the bill
passed out of committee and off the floor in both the House of
Representatives and the state Senate without a single dissenting
vote. And no one mounted a concentrated lobbying effort against it,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just doesn't make sense that something that simply exposes
the record of where taxpayers dollars go should be vetoed,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Glaze said the only way officials started correcting the problem
with HUDCO was in ``the opening of what records we did get. The
press got involved and created the situation where we changed it
dramatically.''

HOW TO KEEP NASCAR IN CRUISE CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BOB PADECKY   
 Santa Rose (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ The sound and the fury, signifying
everything, is coming to town. NASCAR will be in town this weekend
at Sears Point, and when it comes to making all the right moves,
NASCAR is Magic Johnson in the open court.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, this sport knows how, all right: How to do it the right
way. How to keep its athletes clean. How to attract fans.
</P>
<P>
   But how does NASCAR keep it that way? How does it stay ahead of
the curve? How does it not fall victim to its own success? How does
it head into the next millennium flat-out down the backstretch?
</P>
<P>
   This is how.
</P>
<P>
   DO A BOSTON TEA PARTY AND DUMP TOBACCO _ If NASCAR truly wants
to walk down Main Street, U.S.A., and appeal to every corner of
America, it must sever its 29-year-old relationship with R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco Co. NASCAR is expert at projecting wholesome
family entertainment, but taking a drag on a cigarette is hardly a
popular American pastime anymore, especially with the tobacco
companies getting roundly tagged in lawsuit after lawsuit. NASCAR
is cool; smoking is not. Time after time, NASCAR has instinctively
made the right decision to back winners. Tobacco, however, is a
loser. Tobacco is a dead-end. Snuff it.
</P>
<P>
   AMERICANS HATE A MONOPOLY _ Of the top 25 drivers in the points
standings, only three come from single-car owners. The growing
trend in NASCAR is for multicar ownership, such as Jack Roush with
his five drivers. Conflict-of-interest questions immediately
surface. Can Roush pay as much attention to Johnny Benson, who is
23rd in points and has not won in 77 career starts, as opposed to
Jeff Burton, who is third in points and has a fair chance to win
every week? Specifically, can Roush give equal treatment to all
five of his drivers, no matter how they finish? Human nature would
say not. The little guy, the maverick with the Junior Johnson
attitude, is being squeezed out, but it was the maverick who
sustained NASCAR, kept it alive in its infancy and still
contributes to the image NASCAR likes to think of itself. That the
sport represents America at its best: tough, independent, free
thinking, swashbuckling, not afraid to buck a trend. Not anymore,
not if you have to join your competition in order to race with it.
</P>
<P>
   CELEBRATE JEFF GORDON, DON'T TRASH HIM _ There is much
resentment and jealousy in the NASCAR community toward this
27-year-old wonder who has been so successful. It's as if Gordon is
a detriment to the sport. No more than Gretzky was to hockey, Babe
Ruth was to baseball, Michael Jordan was to basketball. Like all of
those superstars, Gordon has raised the bar. NASCAR should feel
fortunate Gordon has come along. It can _ er, it should _ make
everyone try harder, which then elevates the quality of
competition. Find a way to beat Gordon, not a way to whine about
him. That's the way John Wayne, I mean Junior Johnson, would have
done it. Damn straight.
</P>
<P>
   BE GOOD TO THE PEOPLE WHO BRUNG YA _ Letters by the bushel
arrive constantly at ``Winston Cup Scene,'' the sport's trade
journal, complaining about traffic congestion, ticket prices and
tighter security around drivers. Most of this is a by-product of
the growing popularity of NASCAR. Once a small, sleepy Southern
town could handle a crowd of 20,000, but not 120,000. Once a NASCAR
ticket was a convenient and inexpensive purchase; but it's two
months before the Goody's 500 in Bristol, Tenn., and the event is
already sold out, at $80 a pop. Once Richard Petty would stand for
two hours after a race signing autographs when the garage area was
opened to anyone; but that doesn't happen anymore. Drivers rush
out, trying to beat the traffic along with everyone else, grabbing
a few precious minutes of down-time before the next sponsorship

 &HT;    Park landlord gives residents shelter from storms
 &HT;    (EDS: WITH PHOTO.)
 &HT;    By Wes Ferguson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLSVILLE, Texas _ Duane West wanted a little bit more
protection than his mobile home had to offer the next time a
tornado came through East Texas. West, the landlord of Tall Pines
Mobile Home Park, kept his tenants in mind when he decided to buy a
tornado shelter.
</P>
<P>
   West settled for three underground shelters, spread out among
the 24 mobile homes and about 75 people in his park.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted a shelter, but we wanted one for all the people,''
West said. ``It wouldn't be fair for just the landlord to have
one.''
</P>
<P>
   West spent $17,000 for the three shelters. Each holds 25 to 30
people comfortably, but about 50 people could squeeze into one if
need be, he said. He owns 17 of the 24 homes in the park, but he's
not going to raise the rent for the shelter services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized we didn't have anywhere for people to go in the
park, or anywhere else in Hallsville,'' West said of the community
of 3,000 5 miles
</P>
<P>
   east of Longview.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a service I feel most landlords should provide their
tenants.''
</P>
<P>
   West worked for the Red Cross in Tulsa, Okla., before he moved
to Hallsville five years ago. He saw the destruction tornadoes
could leave there, so he wanted to make sure he and his tenants
were safe here.
</P>
<P>
   Tall Pines tenant Roszetta Shores' parents live near Oklahoma
City, so she heard the horror stories of the tornadoes that tore
through Oklahoma and Kansas in early May.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very surprised. Nobody in Arkansas would ever do
anything like this,'' said Shores, who moved to Hallsville from
Mena, Ark., about a week
</P>
<P>
   ago. ``This is the first I've heard of a landlord doing
something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you feel safer,'' Shores said. ``I've got three kids,
and I feel better and more at ease with the shelter there.''
</P>
<P>
   After tornadoes passed through East Texas in late April, West
searched the Web and found Texas Tornado Shelters, based in Tyler.
The company built, delivered and was almost finished installing the
solid steel shelters by Monday afternoon. R.C. Nelson, co-owner of
the Texas Tornado Shelters, said he expected them to be ready for
action by Monday night or this morning. The Tall Pines job was one
of a kind, Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first park owner we've had to pay for this,'' said
Nelson, whose customers range from owners of mobile homes to brick
houses in town or in the country. ``With the number of tornadoes
getting worse, I expect more and more park owners to start.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said he lives in a mobile home park and owns two tornado
shelters.

COMMENTARY: SIBLING CLASHES _ DON'T AUTOMATICALLY FOCUS ON THE
OLDEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Tuesday, June 29)  
(bl) 
 By MARY J. LOFTUS   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   My 8-year-old son and I were curled on the couch with popcorn
and soda, watching a rented video about a gooey green killer fungus
that had taken over a town.
</P>
<P>
   With my husband on a business trip and our 2-year-old daughter
visiting grandparents for a few days, my son and I were enjoying a
peaceful weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know you haven't been in trouble all day?'' I asked
him, suddenly realizing that there hadn't been any threats, yelling
or time outs in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep telling you it's always Sarah who gets me in trouble,''
he said, barely looking away from the movie.
</P>
<P>
   He was right, and I had known this months ago on one level.
Sarah, being the temperamental toddler, could scream louder, throw
longer tantrums and cry more tears.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to determine the instigator of every brother-sister
conflict was often too much trouble, so the older kid always got
the blame, or at least the responsibility of fixing the situation.
</P>
<P>
   It was always easier to tell Adam to ``let your little sister
have the toy,'' or ``leave her alone, she's in a bad mood,'' or
``if she cries one more time, you're going to your room.''
</P>
<P>
   But was it fair? Probably not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sarah really does stir things up, doesn't she?'' I said to
Adam.
</P>
<P>
   He turned his whole attention toward me then, and said the most
insightful thing I've ever heard him say about our family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' he said. ``It's like she's a puzzle piece that doesn't
quite fit in yet.''
</P>
<P>
   My friends, through our parenting e-mails that tumble back and
forth across states and modems, are saying the same things: Their
children are mixing together about as well as water and Desenex.
</P>
<P>
   ``My children are so different they astound me,'' says Kristin.
``They torture me in completely different ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``My oldest, with his fiery temperament, is the tough one on the
surface, but I have come to realize he is all bark and very little
bite. He complains loudly as he does whatever you are asking. He
never once tried to climb out of his crib, climb over a baby gate,
color on walls or in books. He always liked his high chair, and
never tried to push a chair up to the front door to unlock the
chain so he could get out. He threw temper tantrums, but he
followed the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``BEWARE THE QUIET ONES! My youngest is much more mild-mannered.
He does not throw fits when you tell him no. He simply waits for
you to leave the room, and then he does what he wants anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   And he doesn't like any of the hand-me-down toys that used to be
his big brother's favorites, showing nothing but disdain for the
hammering toys, dump trucks or Duplos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having my first son did NOTHING to prepare me for my second,''
Kristin says. ``I am starting from scratch again.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm beginning to sense a conspiracy among the second-borns. They
want to make absolutely sure no one mistakes them for their older
siblings. And, by golly, they'll fit in when and where they're
ready.

 &HT;    FOR COKE, LATIN AMERICA PROVING A SAFE HARBOR IN A GLOBAL STORM
 &HT;    325&AMP;ADDS
 &HT;    With COKE-BOX-0622.

<P>
   MIAMI _ It's been a bumpy ride for Coca-Cola Co. in the global
markets the last two years. The Asian economic crisis. The collapse
of the Russian ruble. And now, a health scare crisis in Europe that
threatens Coke's most valuable asset: it's image.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this turmoil, however, the primary foreign market
that remains a constant source stability for the Atlanta-based
company is Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   According to analysts, the fizzy drink's outlook south of the
border is anything but flat. Although the region has suffered
economic turmoil this year, it still accounts for a fourth of
Coke's global sales volume.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, known simply as ``Coca'' in many Latin cities,
analysts say Coke's image would be hard to tarnish in countries
such as Mexico, where -- in many households -- the ubiquitous soft
drink has become as much a staple as the tortilla.
</P>
<P>
   The company's unshakable grip is due to a variety of factors:
the region's hot climate, the product's popularity with a growing
middle class, and the company's vast, highly polished network of
bottlers and distributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coke is so entrenched in Latin America and the brand is so
well-known, it's hard to beat,'' said John Sicher, editor of
Beverage Digest, an industry newsletter based in New York. ``Latin
America is a terrific market for Coke, and should remain that way
for years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say the picture's been completely rosy for Coke in
Latin America, which has felt the ripple effect of the Asian
financial crisis on its own economies over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Retail sales in Latin America grew only 7 percent in 1998, after
shooting up 12 percent the year before. In the first quarter of
1999, sales actually fell 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Coke has experienced big declines this year in Chile, Colombia,
and Venezuela -- all countries hard-hit by the global economic
crisis -- which have been offset somewhat by slight gains in
Argentina, the Caribbean, and Central America.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil, where the soft-drink giant invested $1.4 billion
between 1995 and 1997, the recession has forced many thirsty people
to migrate to cheaper brands.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the company has lost more than one-tenth of its
market share in recent months to low-cost local drinks produced by
family-owned bottlers.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the company's bottler in Brazil lowered prices on some
Coke products by as much as 20 percent in order to fight the
growing competition.
</P>
<P>
   But economists these days are almost buoyant when it comes to
Brazil, which bodes well for Coke.
</P>
<P>
   The country's stock market has bounced back, as has its
currency, after investors bailed out of emerging markets like
Brazil following the crisis that began in Southeast Asia in the
summer of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   In general, Coke is a significant leader when it comes to market
share in most Latin American countries, and analysts say the
company has plenty of room to grow.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Americans consume 890 servings carbonated
soft drinks per person a year, compared with only 259 servings in
Brazil and 332 in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question Coke has had to contend with some
difficult economic troubles in certain Latin countries, but the
potential to build consumption in this region is high, despite
what's happening in Europe,'' said Marc Cohen, a beverage analyst
for Goldman Sachs in New York.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows).
</P>
<P>
   Coke's dominance south of the Rio Grande -- where it enjoys 60
percent of the carbonated soft drink business -- is
long-established.
</P>
<P>
   But Coke had an enormous jump on its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Created in 1886, Coca-Cola opened bottling operations in Cuba,
Panama and Puerto Rico just after the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, where Coke was introduced in 1926, Mexicans today
consume some 412 Coca-Cola products per person a year, outstripping
even U.S. per capita consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials point to Mexico as an example of the strength
and success of their long-term strategy.
</P>
<P>
   During that country's peso crisis in the early 1990s, Mexican
managers decided to invest in even more new production plants --
and it paid off.
</P>
<P>
   Market share jumped from 53 percent to 68 percent. Even this
year, as sales have declined elsewhere in Latin America, they've
increased 6 percent in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coke is a symbol of purity in a lot of these places,''
Coca-Cola spokesman Bill Hensel said. ``Whenever you're in a
country and you can't safely drink the water, you drink
Coca-Cola.''

   Sifting through the many Web sites that offer tourists
information about foreign cities can be fascinating or frustrating.
How can first-time, English-speaking travelers planning a trip to
Tokyo, for instance, know if a Web site is steering them in the
right direction?
</P>
<P>
   Eight New York Times correspondents offer their views of
selected Web sites for cities they know well: Rio de Janeiro,
Tokyo, London, Paris, New Delhi, Cape Town, Vancouver and Sydney.

   RIO DE JANEIRO: The Site From Ipanema, And Lots of Carioca
Spirit
</P>
<P>
   By LARRY ROHTER
</P>
<P>
   As befits a city that ranks as one of the most beautiful and
fascinating in the world, Rio de Janeiro is the focus of numerous
Web sites in English, more than I anticipated. Many are of high
quality in terms of text and visual content, with sharp graphics
and even snatches of the music that defines Rio. Three sites in
particular stand out, each for a different reason.
</P>
<P>
   I found that the Brazilian Incentive and Tourism home page at
www.bitourism.com, for instance, contained the most detailed
information on hotels, offering small but clear photos of the
exteriors and interiors of the city's main hotels, as well as
information about their services and amenities.
</P>
<P>
   The Excite City Guide, citynet.excite.com, was useful mostly
because of its links to the Fodor's hotel and restaurant indexes
(which make judgments that I didn't always agree with).
</P>
<P>
   But probably the most entertaining site is that at
www.ipanema.com. Somehow it manages to be funny and cheeky while
also being comprehensive: there is a ``Rio Gay Guide,'' ``Rio for
Beginners'' and a section called ``Dogs From Ipanema,'' which
offers a walking tour. The site also has pictures of the city's
most famous neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Some other sites with fancy graphics and interesting concepts
seemed sloppy on content, however. Looking at a site devoted to
Rio's golf courses at www.activelifestyle.com/gt/riogolf.html, I
was distracted by the consistent misspelling of the city's name. If
they can't get that right, I wondered, what does that say about the
reliability of the rest of the information?
</P>
<P>
   It was much easier to forgive deficiencies in the homemade Web
sites created by Rio residents. Even though the spelling and
grammar may occasionally be wobbly, a passion for the city shines
through and there are plenty of tips about restaurants, nightclubs
and other amusements.
</P>
<P>
   In this category, I found the sites at www.riowithlove.com and
www.123-rio.com to be especially useful and imbued with Carioca
spirit.
</P>
<P>
   One last recommendation: if you're thinking of going to Rio at
Carnival time, or even if you're not, it's worth paying a visit to
the Rio de Janeiro Samba Home Page, at love-rio.com/samba. Here you
will find a thorough history of Carnival and a guide to the samba
schools that compete for honors in the parade that is the highlight
of the annual bacchanal.
</P>
<P>
   The photographs of dancers and musicians in their extravagant
but skimpy costumes were taken at this February's contest and are
stunning.

   TOKYO: An Internet Miracle: A $21 Hotel Room
</P>
<P>
   By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF
</P>
<P>
   A hotel room in Tokyo for $21? It seems incredible, but the
Hotel New Koyo charges just 2,500 yen for its smallest single
rooms, including service charge and tax. In a city where a fine
melon can cost more than $100, that is an extraordinary find, and I
turned it up through a Web site called Planet Tokyo at
www.pandemic.com/tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Information about Tokyo abounds on the Internet, but Planet
Tokyo is perhaps the best Web site for visitors. It offers a range
of information about restaurants and hotels _ the $300-a-night
variety and the $21 kind _ as well as temples and shrines and even
the Japanese language. The information is mostly timely and
accurate and ranges from the serious to the whimsical: this is the
only Web site I know of that tutors people in expressions like
``mapputatsuni hiki sakuwayo,'' which means ``I will tear you in
half.''
</P>
<P>
   Planet Tokyo has separate sections for restaurants, hotels,
sightseeing, general trip planning and travelers' tales. It does
not have a site index, but it is easy to navigate. Under
sightseeing, for example, it offers a four-paragraph introduction
and then a list of 19 possibilities, from amusement parks to the
Ueno Zoo, which is more than 100 years old. Click on any of them,
and you get the information.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a general section of ``culture notes,'' such as
how to bow and when to give gifts and take off your shoes. One of
the very few mistakes is in the language section, suggesting that
``moshi moshi'' can be used as a greeting when entering a room.
Moshi moshi is used only on the phone or when you call out to a
stranger _ for instance, a passer-by who has dropped his wallet.
</P>
<P>
   While Planet Tokyo is the best place to start, it is a bit short
on history. So turn also to Exploring Old Tokyo at
www.twics.com/eds/oldtokyo. It has information about museums,
shrines and temples, even about a historic Edo Period public
toilet.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one of the problems of these Web sites is their inability
to be helpful with directions: Tokyo is so huge that location
matters enormously. Perhaps it will take 10 minutes to get some
place, or perhaps two hours, but there is not much guidance.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the larger question of whether these sites,
however rich in information, are any better than a guidebook. A
guidebook is easier to consult on an airplane, or to browse through
on a subway, and the fact-checking may be a bit more thorough. But
these sites are good resources for someone making a quick business
trip without much time for sightseeing.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, many Tokyo places have their own Web sites as well
(some are linked to Planet Tokyo). When I read about Hotel New
Koyo, I was skeptical that it really had rooms for 2,500 yen. So I
telephoned, and the clerk confirmed the price and referred me to
its English language Web site: www &QC; .tctv.ne.jp/members/new-koyo. It
popped out in a moment, with all the information I could want,
including photos.

   LONDON: So Many Choices, So Many Glitches
</P>
<P>
   By SARAH LYALL
</P>
<P>
   There are so many Web sites about London that it should be easy
to find one that satisfies basic tourist needs: clear, concise
information about where to stay, what to do and the like. But I
tried three, and was beset with frustration at every turn. They
were either too commercial, too sparse on information, or too full
of glitches to make the cybertrip worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   The first, www.tourist.co.uk, certainly looked encouraging,
promising a comprehensive guide to the city. But something was
strange. In the hotel category, for instance, the site asked for my
desired location and price range but then listed only a fraction of
the hotels that met the criteria. When I asked for hotels in
central London that were under $70 (40 pounds) a night, I got only
seven names (none with addresses or phone numbers, or Web links,
another annoyance). When I asked for ones that cost over $210 a
night, I got only four (one, the Savoy, had a Web link).
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the restaurant list was patchy and haphazard, and it
soon became clear that only some establishments (presumably those
that had paid a fee) had been included. All along, I was exhorted
to call different numbers _ one for a tourist information service,
and another offering help with reservations _ rather than being
given the basic information I needed.
</P>
<P>
   My next stop was www.a-london-guide.co.uk, which proclaims
itself the guide to ``virtual London.'' It started off very
promisingly, with a forecast of the day's weather in London and
some good, well-written advice about arriving in the city (such as
where the airports are). But the site appeared to have one aim: to
get you to buy its guides to London, on CD-ROM ($39.99) or video
($24.99). No thanks!
</P>
<P>
   That left the most promising of all, www.londontown.com, the
official site of the London Tourist Board. The board is usually
extremely helpful and thorough, and its Web site looked that way,
too. Not only did it offer guides to the London's popular sights,
but it also included an extensive list of millennium events and
attractions scheduled to open (or to be renovated) this year and in
the first few years of the next century. They ranged from the
Vinopolis, an all-about-wine attraction scheduled to open next
month, to a spiral-like extension of the Victoria and Albert Museum
planned for 2004.
</P>
<P>
   I was delighted by its opening graphic, inviting you to click on
to the section of a spinning globe that represents where you'll be
traveling from (when I clicked on to New York, I was told about a
special deal being offered for departures from there by British
Airways and the Forte hotel chain).
</P>
<P>
   But then it all went wrong. I tried my standard test again:
Could I use the site to find a hotel that I wanted to stay in? The
site listed types of hotels, ranging from inns to youth hostels,
and invited me to choose a neighborhood, amenities and a host of
other options. The list was clearly comprehensive. In central
London, for instance, the site promised to list 150 hotels.
</P>
<P>
   When I went further, however, trying to get a list of the actual
items, my computer began to emit a horrible grating noise and
froze. I thought I was having a bad computer day, but when I got
our office's computer expert involved, he had the same problem.
Perhaps it was the Web site that was having a bad day (colleagues
had better luck a couple of weeks later.) By this time, though, I
was thoroughly disillusioned. All I wanted was a nice,
old-fashioned guide in the shape of an actual book.

   PARIS: From the Louvre, To the Sewers
</P>
<P>
   By ALAN RIDING
</P>
<P>
   France was slow to join the cyberworld, but all the basic
information that a visitor to Paris needs can now be found on the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   Paris Tourisme, at www.paris-tourisme &QC; .com, is a good place to
start. A click on ``Welcome'' calls up an menu in English divided
into nine chapters, among them: Museums, Hotels, City Tours,
detailed maps of Paris and its suburbs; Paris Airports and Paris
for Kids. Each chapter heading leads to a wide range of options. In
the museums listing, for instance, there is lively information on
no fewer than 42 museums.
</P>
<P>
   The Paris for Kids section includes attractions, parks and zoos,
and even suggests where to find baby sitters at night. Under the
heading Paris From A . . . to Z is a range of practical information
like where to rent bicycles, how to find philatelists and which is
the best flea market. This site offers a limited selection of
hotels and has no information on restaurants, but it has a good
search engine. The site promotes the Touringscope bus trips around
Paris in addition to walking tours.
</P>
<P>
   The French government sponsors two sites. The Paris Convention
and Visitors Bureau site, www.paris-touristoffice.com, switches
into English by clicking on a Union Jack. It offers 10 chapters,
including some not listed by Paris Tourisme. Paris night life
covers everything from cabarets and opera houses to jazz clubs and
trendy cafes (it notes, for example, that Le Flore in
St.-Germain-des-Pres is host to philosophical discussions in
English at 7 p.m. on the first Wednesday of the month). The
restaurants section even includes where to find dining spots with,
say, terraces or views, while the hotel information offers a broad
choice, from student hostels to luxury hotels (in picking a price
range, be sure to use French francs). Although this site does not
have a search function, it does offer links to other Paris Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   The French Tourist Office, www.fgtousa.org/regional/paris.htm,
is another source of extensive information about Paris _ offering
numerous links to other sites. An example: a click on general
information leads to ``wines,'' which in turn leads to tips on
wine-tasting classes, including those that are held in English. The
site even offers pen portraits of close to 100 famous French men
and women.
</P>
<P>
   Some other useful Web sites are maintained by entities outside
of France. The (AT)Paris Traveler's Guide, at infocities.com, is
lively, though I noticed its information about museums was limited.
I enjoyed the Lonely Planet site,
lonelyplanet.com/dest/eur/par.htm, if only because it starts with
an introduction to French history and its recommended reading list
ranges from Rousseau and Voltaire to Marguerite Duras and Michel
Foucault. For the off-the-beaten-track visit, it even proposes the
Paris sewers (I have been there: they are interesting and not too
smelly).
</P>
<P>
   A site that seems particularly informative on hotels is
www.france.com/travel/hotels. It is run by the French Hotel
Reservation Center and covers just about everywhere _ Paris and
throughout the country. Hotels can be chosen by district and by
price, and there is a useful box indicating how convenient
different parts of town are for getting to museums, shopping,
businesses and the like.
</P>
<P>
   The information includes room prices as well as address,
telephone and a photograph of each hotel. The site even offers to
find hotels at the lowest possible rates.

<P>
   NEW DELHI: A Warm Welcome, But It's All Relative
</P>
<P>
   By BARRY BEARAK
</P>
<P>
   New Delhi's summer weather is ``warm,'' according to the Web
site of the government of India Ministry of Tourism,
www.tourism &QC; inindia.com. ``Warm,'' of course, is a relative term.
Boiling water could be said to be warm. So, too, could a forest
fire, a spewing volcano and smelted iron. The summer temperature in
India's capital often hits 115, which, for me, is a bit hotter than
warm.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the government-related Web sites that include New Delhi
are short on reliable information and long on hyperbole. The
tourism ministry says the city offers ``an unceasing range of
activity, a million ways of saying, `You are welcome.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lonely Planet's Destination Delhi site,
www.lonelyplanet.com/dest/ind/del.htm, more accurately lets you
know what you're in for: ``You'll most likely notice the pollution,
the crowds, the smell, the noise and the ceaseless hassles before
you notice the city's charms.''
</P>
<P>
   Lonely Planet's site is no substitute for a thick guidebook, but
it does a good job of labeling most of the bare bones. India's
5,000-year history is rendered in four paragraphs. The more popular
sightseeing destinations rate about 100 words each and are
accompanied by photos and a small map.
</P>
<P>
   Fodor's site, www.fodors.com, contains a restaurant and hotel
guide, which Lonely Planet does not. Unlike many other listings,
Fodor is willing to go out on a limb and actually make food and
lodging recommendations. The site's authors have good taste; their
faults are mainly in what they omit rather than in what they
commend. For example, they focus on the high-end restaurants and
neglect very popular and less costly ones, like Nirula's.
</P>
<P>
   For the largest variety of links, the place to go is
www.indiaa2z.com. This is essentially a search engine that, when
you search ``Delhi,'' divides into categories like arts and
culture, business and economy, and news and media. It can take you
to some fairly arcane places, like the Amateur Astronomers
Association of Delhi. But it also contains some meat-and-potatoes
information (in India, the meat must be mutton, not beef), the best
of which is the Delhi City Guide, www.allindia.com/cities/delhi.
</P>
<P>
   While the Delhi City Guide also has a very abbreviated history
section, its listings of museums, galleries, markets and historical
sites are far more complete than most. The information (with
photos) about hotels and restaurants is quite reliable.
</P>
<P>
   CAPE TOWN: Pretty as a Picture, Though the Details Are Fuzzy
</P>
<P>
   By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect that if I could read German better (it's slipped away
since high school, and learning to read road signs in Afrikaans has
helped only a little), I would think the best Web site about Cape
Town was one produced in Germany, www.kapstadt.de/allgem.htm. It
seems remarkably thorough. For English-speakers, I'm afraid, the
choices are a bit frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   One problem is that many South African Web sites seem to have a
fundamental weakness: they give nice write-ups to people who buy
ads. I could find several sites with beautiful pictures of the
city, beaches, botanical gardens, the Victoria and Alfred
Waterfront and the Cape of Good Hope, which Sir Francis Drake wrote
was ``the most stately thing, and the fairest cape we saw in the
whole circumference of the earth.'' I couldn't find any with the
kind of independently verified helpful list of restaurants and
hotels that a good guidebook has.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, the prettiest and most comprehensive site was
www &QC; .nelsonsguides.co.za, which is produced by a Cape Town company
that publishes pocket guides handed out free in hotels. Its opening
picture of Table Mountain, which dominates the city even more
imposingly than skyscrapers dominate New York, is stunning.
Browsing its pretty picture gallery brought up links to other Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Cape Town has the largest aquarium in the Southern
Hemisphere, and there was a link to the Two Oceans Aquarium site.
Some choices were odd _ the picture of the three-hour scenic drive
around Cape Point is of a baboon by the road.
</P>
<P>
   The maps, reproduced from the pocket guide, are detailed. Its
pages of local history go well back and put Cape Town in its
context as part of South Africa's bloody past. But the
accommodation and restaurant pages are woefully skimpy _
presumably, only those that paid to be listed.
</P>
<P>
   Another site, www.doorway.co.za, can be slow to respond but has
the best-known restaurants and hotels. Its listings are free, but
limited to a few mostly saccharine words chosen by the lister.
</P>
<P>
   An excellent site for South Africa in general is the one
maintained by Lonely Planet guides which puts out what I think is
the best guide to the country. This site, www.lonelyplanet.com, has
a section on Cape Town and has links to a forum (Traveler's
Reports) where travelers _ mostly backpackers _ send their latest
advice about places to stay, things to do and dangers to avoid. It
doesn't give details about hotels and restaurants. For that, you
have to buy the book.

   VANCOUVER: Guides to Famous People And Family Fun
</P>
<P>
   By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver, much like Seattle, its near-neighbor to the south,
likes to boast that it is its nation's most tech-hip city. So it's
no surprise that a prospective visitor to Canada's great western
metropolis can find a ton of useful, interesting and quirky
information about the city on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   A good place to start is discovervancouver.com, a site full of
colorful images, including maps, weather charts and ``postcards''
from the country's western edge. It also includes links to the
Vancouver phone book and lots of trivia, including a list of famous
entertainers who hail from British Columbia (Michael J. Fox,
Raymond Burr and Pamela Anderson, among others).
</P>
<P>
   The site's funny American Page explains that Canada has a
one-dollar coin nicknamed the ``loonie'' because it has a loon on
one side, and a two-dollar coin that is sometimes called a
``toonie.'' And there is a helpful guide on dealing with an
all-too-common occurrence: How to Be Happy in Vancouver Even When
It Rains.
</P>
<P>
   The site maintained by Vancouver's convention and visitors
bureau, www.tourism-vancouver.com, has daily updates and excellent
links to information on outdoor activities like kayaking and
skiing.
</P>
<P>
   At the site www.4vancouver.com, part of the 4anything.com
network of community sites, a cybervisitor can find links to
restaurants, attractions, shopping centers and local newspapers and
magazines. For those who want to book all or part of the trip on
line, www.discoverbc.com has an excellent search engine with links
to hotels and tours.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the quirkier links. A wonderful guide for
families with children, maintained by a Vancouver family that
consists of ``Mom, Dad, Nathan and Jenavieve,'' is
www.findfamilyfun.com. It has information on everything from berry
picking to watching bald eagles _ all written in a chatty way, and
the search for activities can be sorted by cost or location.
</P>
<P>
   A good place to see vivid images of Vancouver and the
surrounding area is www.beautifulbc.ca, created by a 40-year-old
magazine, Beautiful British Columbia. The Vancouver Art Gallery,
www.vanartgallery.bc.ca, has a wealth of images (not large ones,
though) from both temporary exhibits and its permanent collection.
The works of Emily Carr (1871-1945), probably the province's
best-known artist, are part of this cyberdisplay, including the
fanciful ``Zunoqua of the Cat Village'' (1931) and the colorful
``Young Pines and Sky'' (c. 1935). After that cultural tour, why
not go whale watching? For a ``virtual tour,'' I suggest the Web
site www.vancouver-whale-watch.com.

<P>
   SYDNEY: You Can Go Home Again, And to the Beaches
</P>
<P>
   By JANE PERLEZ
</P>
<P>
   As a onetime resident of Sydney who sneaks back annually during
the down-under summer, I found surfing the Web to explore my former
city as a vacation place a revelation. On Yahoo's Sydney Web site,
travel.yahoo.com/destinations (click on the Oceania heading or
search for ``Sydney''), I found solid, sometimes imaginative
information, on sightseeing, restaurants, transportation, hotels
and best of all, the beaches.
</P>
<P>
   The site opens with a refreshing essay by Mary Ann Harrell, a
writer who once lived in the city and who describes how the place
has changed. This is a fine mood-setting piece (originally printed
in National Geographic Traveler).
</P>
<P>
   A travel advisory from Knoll Travel Watch reminds would-be
visitors that Sydney is the host city for next summer's Olympic
Games: in September and October 2000, the city will be packed. But
the good news in the travel advisory is that street crime is not a
serious problem, except for late at night in King's Cross, an area
replete with strip joints and bars.
</P>
<P>
   The Where to Eat in Sydney guide on Yahoo, seemed accurate and
up to date. I clicked on my old neighborhood in Lane Cove and found
28 restaurants _ 27 more than when I lived there _ including a
Chinese takeout called Tow Yin. More seriously, the guide also
mentioned Doyle's on the Beach, a wonderful seafood place on the
harbor shore. A main course and appetizer (known as an entree in
Australia) would cost the equivalent of about $26, it was reported,
which sounds about right. At the top end of the scale, the guide
listed Rockpool, perhaps Sydney's finest seafood restaurant, where
main course and appetizer cost about $76.
</P>
<P>
   One of the weaker points of the site was the accommodations
listing. There are links to the major hotels, but some don't give
room rates. For example, the site for the Inter-Continental, a
luxury hotel built atop a colonial structure, offers a photo of its
building and panoramic harbor views, and gives the number of rooms
_ 498 _ and suites, but you have to fill out a reservation form to
get a rate. The hotel section does list less expensive choices,
including bed-and-breakfasts and corporate apartments in Sydney and
its suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   I was encouraged to see that the opera house, Sydney's principal
venue for contemporary dance, concerts and opera, is described in
all its glory. Ferry services on the harbor _ one of the city's
strong points _ were all listed, with schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most innovative for the visitor interested in the beach
is www.realsurf.com. On the site's Northern Beaches Tour, I viewed
a photo of the waves at North Palmy, the local jargon for North
Palm Beach, one of my favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Larry's Report that day on realsurf.com said that ``Palm Beach
and the joey were the pick this morning, about a meter and glassy
waves, the peaks shifting about.'' However bizarre that sounds
(``barren joey'' is local slang for the peninsula at Palm Beach),
it is authentic Sydney beach talk, and a fair testament to the
sense of variety of city life that a Web site can give.  &QL;

<P>
   FAVIGNANA, Italy _ For more than 900 years, the fishermen of
this little island off Sicily have gone after bluefin tuna in the
same ritualistic way. For the four weeks when the huge fish migrate
through these waters, the men await a signal from their leader to
begin the mattanza, a highly choreographed communal hunt with
prayers and songs and rigid rules that is seldom seen around Sicily
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the fishermen, called tonnoretti, were waiting for
the signal, as they had been every day since late May. The island
community's head fisherman and de facto leader, called the rais,
watched the sea, to decide if it was calm enough for them to set
out in their long wooden boats. On Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday
he just shook his head slowly and uttered hopefully, ``Tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the weather relented and the mattanza began: six
wooden boats headed out to sea, the fishermen joining in
traditional song.
</P>
<P>
   Over three to four hours, the boats surrounded a huge web of
nets set up to trap the tuna as they swam past, corralling them
into successively smaller holding pens until they were tightly
surrounded in a final section _ the camera della morte, or chamber
of death. The thrashing fish were then confined closely enough to
let the tonnoretti gaff them and haul them aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The ritual, which on this day netted 38 tuna, is the antithesis
of large-scale commercial fishing. But after a stop at the fish
processing plant in nearby Trapani, about 70 percent of the tuna
were destined for the same place so many bluefin land today: the
sushi bars and fish markets of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   For hundreds of years, the fishermen of Favignana could live off
the sea. But the cannery on the island, the largest building there,
closed 16 years ago for lack of product.
</P>
<P>
   With each year, the fish have become smaller and fewer. The
tonnoretti are not sure why, and the only finger they uncertainly
point is at the factory ships of the Japanese that prowl the ocean
beyond Gibraltar. In the last 25 years, fish as large as 1,154
pounds have been caught, but the average weight of this year's tuna
has been only 140 pounds. In the mid-1800s, it was possible to pull
14,000 tuna from the sea each season, but by 1987 the number
reached a low of 285. This year, the fishermen will feel lucky if
the mattanzas take a thousand.
</P>
<P>
   The plant pays only about $2.25 a pound for the fish, which is
barely enough for the tonnoretti to rent their nets. As a result,
almost none of the sons of the tonnoretti work at sea. Instead,
they find jobs catering for the island's tourists, or they head to
the mainland. The sea no longer holds the work of the future. And
each time they head out in those wooden boats, a way of life ebbs
further away.

HARVARD GETS DUTCH-MASTER DRAWINGS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A trove of 17th-century Dutch drawings _ including works by
Rembrandt, Pieter Bruegel, Adriaen van Ostade and Jacques de Gheyn
II _ has been given to the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University by
Maida and George Abrams of Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The 110 drawings, which experts said are worth as much as $20
million, are the core of a huge collection the Abramses began
building 40 years ago that is considered the finest of its kind in
private hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theirs is probably the most remarkable collection of Dutch Old
Master drawings put together ever in America,'' said Martin
Royalton-Kisch, the curator of Dutch and Flemish drawings at the
British Museum. ``It's remarkable for its breadth as well as its
out-and-out masterpieces and a selection of pieces that are just
charming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any museum would have wanted it,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The Fogg got it because it has long been a center of study for
Old Master drawings. ``The reason this is going to a teaching
museum rather than a repository is so students can hold these
drawings in their hands and get the magic feeling from that,'' said
Abrams, who graduated from Harvard College in 1954 and Harvard Law
School in 1957. ``The idea of perhaps turning them into Dutch art
scholars is exciting to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fogg's Old Master drawing collection has until now been
stronger in French and Italian works. ``By their gift, the Abramses
have profoundly strengthened our very mission,'' said James Cuno,
the director of Harvard's museums. ``We will be able to teach and
encourage further research in Dutch Old Master drawings by offering
students and scholars a collection of the greatest importance and
highest quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Abrams is a member of two committees of the Harvard University
Art Museums, a trustee of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and a
fellow of the Pierpont Morgan Library. Mrs. Abrams, a graduate of
Sarah Lawrence College, is president of Very Special Arts
Massachusetts, a nonprofit organization that develops arts programs
for people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the couple have lent many drawings to museums,
and in 1991-92 an exhibition called ``Seventeenth-Century Dutch
Drawings: A Selection from the Maida and George Abrams
Collection,'' which was organized by the Fogg, was shown there and
at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, the Morgan Library in New York,
and the Albertina in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   John Russell, writing in The New York Times, called the show a
``must see.'' It ``burns small, and it burns slowly,'' he wrote.
``But in the memory it blazes up.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 100 drawings in that exhibition, 65 are going to the
Fogg. ``We've added another 45 to give it additional strength and
completeness,'' Abrams said. Royalton-Kisch said: ``The gift is a
choice selection without necessarily having all the high points.
It's a good cross-section.''
</P>
<P>
   The gift contains works of many styles and subjects by artists
active in the Netherlands between 1580 and 1700, when Dutch artists
had their greatest impact on the development of European art. Among
them are Rembrandt's ``Landscape With a Farmstead,'' once part of
the renowned collection at Chatsworth; a singular landscape by
Bruegel in white gouache on blue paper; one of the few works by
Cornelius Vroom still in private hands; three drawings by Willem
Buytewech, an early practitioner of ``merry company'' genre
pictures, and a rare ``friendship album'' in its original binding
that consists of 41 drawings made between 1628 and 1641 by at least
28 artists, including the only known drawing by Emanuel de Witte, a
painter of church interiors.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams' interest in Dutch art began when, as a law student, he
worked in the Netherlands for two summers, visiting Dutch museums
and spending time in Leiden, Rembrant's birthplace. The couple
began collecting drawings in 1960, soon after they married.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, French and Italian works were popular, so the
Abramses, in their early 20s, focused on more affordable Dutch
drawings. Over the years, they gave nearly 100 drawings to the Fogg
and also donated works to several other museums.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams said he and his wife decided to make their big gift to
the Fogg now to encourage research.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Old Master drawings become rarer, the number of collectors
will be thinning,'' he said. ``And when that happens, there can be
a lessening of interest and involvement in the field by museum
people and scholars.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after transferring these 110 works to the Fogg, the
Abramses will still own several hundred drawings and many paintings
by Dutch Old Masters. And they have not stopped collecting.

   ARGENTINA-BUDWEISER (Undated) _ When Anheuser-Busch decided to
go full throttle into Argentina, it turned to Marcelo Tinelli,
Argentina's answer to Jay Leno, who tells jokes, interviews guests
_ and sips Budweiser from a can in front of 3.2 million viewers.
Thanks largely to Tinelli's endorsement, Budweiser's sales in
Argentina soared 61 percent in the first quarter of this year. And
Argentina is one of many overseas markets where Anheuser is pouring
it on with its flagship brand. Through aggressive marketing to a

demand much more than just high-level cooking skills. Charm and

&HT;        LEAGUE AND PLAYER OFFICIALS OPPOSE SPECTER'S STADIUM
FINANCING BILL
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, -- Football league and player officials played
defense yesterday against Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter's
proposal that would require the NFL and Major League Baseball to
pay for half the cost of new stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue traveled to Specter's home
field, a Senate Judiciary hearing Tuesday, to speak out against the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bill is not only unnecessary,'' Tagliabue said, ``but
would have serious and negative consequences for local communities,
for state and local governments, for sports fans, and for sports
teams, themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The hearing featured opponents of the measure that would tie the
NFL's limited anti-trust exemption and Major League Baseball's
anti-trust exemption to the condition that the leagues put 10
percent of their television revenue in a fund to pay for stadium
costs and renovations.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the league's power to deny a franchise team's
decision to move.
</P>
<P>
   Without the measure, Specter said the leagues are involved in
``legalized extortion'' -- when cities and states are forced to
pony up millions to build new stadiums in order to keep their teams
from leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Specter used as an example of the high costs of stadiums the
situation in Pennsylvania, where four projects are being eyed at a
price tag of more than $1 billion. Two-thirds of the cost for these
stadiums will come from the taxpayers, through state and local
funding.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies and Eagles want to build sites in Philadelphia, and
two other stadiums are under construction in Western Pennsylvania
for the Steelers and Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue said smaller market teams would be hurt if they were
forced to use a set percentage of television revenues for stadium
costs. He said it would hurt their ability to compete for the best
players and worsen their situations.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Judiciary Committee member Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis.,
agreed. Television revenue makes up 60 percent of the Green Bay
Packers' operating revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold said the bill would hurt the existing television
revenue sharing arrangement that has allowed the Green Bay Packers
to survive and develop into a better team.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Klein, an economics professor at the University of
California at Los Angeles, said the bill would be harmful because
it would encourage state and local governments to build more and
more stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   Klein said it would go against the principles of a market
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Upshaw, executive director of the NFL Players Association,
said the group opposed the bill because it threatened the
collective bargaining agreement in place. He said if leagues had to
use 10 percent of television revenue for construction, it would
effect the determination of player salary caps.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Richardson, owner and founder of the Carolina Panthers
said the issue is a local one and shouldn't be decided by lawmakers
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot understand why the members of this Committee would
feel they need to impose a uniform federal approach to what is
clearly a local issue,'' Richardson said. ``This bill tells mayors,
city councils, and even voters that they do not known what they are
doing..''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NASHVILLE _ A CD or book with the imprint of the Rock-and-Roll
Hall of Fame has always seemed like nothing more than merchandise,
a souvenir. But a CD or book with the yellow circular logo of the
Country Music Hall of Fame, a museum here that predates the opening
of the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland by more than 25
years, has always been an object of cultural value, a necessity in
the collection of anyone who appreciates American music. The
museum's output ranges from its impressively exhaustive
Encyclopedia of Country Music to its CD of early Johnny Paycheck
recordings, featuring some of country's greatest parentheses songs,
like ``(Pardon Me) While I Go Murder Somebody'' and ``It Won't Be
Long (and I'll Be Hating You).''
</P>
<P>
   So it was with the typical class of a museum and the down-home
casualness of country music that the Country Music Hall of Fame
celebrated the groundbreaking of its new $37 million museum
building in downtown Nashville on June 17. Lined up in the front
row at the outdoor ceremony were the voices, faces and fingers of
country legend: Chet Atkins, Brenda Lee, Eddy Arnold, Little Jimmy
Dickens, Kitty Wells and Earl Scruggs. Performing onstage were the
younger inheritors to Nashville: Bryan White, Randy Travis, Kathy
Mattea (a former tour guide at the museum) and Vince Gill, who _
inspired by a speech in the ceremony by Garrison Keillor _ deviated
from his planned performance of ``I Still Believe In You'' to strum
a moving tribute to his late father called ``Key of Life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was authentic,'' the hall's director, Kyle Young, said of
Gill's song change. ``As I sat up there and I saw that happen, I
thought, `That's it.' If we could operate like that all the time we
would be up there. He made such a real connection, and that's part
of our job, to connect the present with the past. And if we want to
be real pompous, we can say we want to affect the future too.''
</P>
<P>
   Marty Stuart, the musician and president of the Country Music
Foundation, said of the hall: ``It's holy ground. As an artist it's
where we all want to end up. Every note of music I play is aimed at
this building.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Hall of Fame, designed by Ralph Applebaum and scheduled
to open in May 2001, was built at the behest of Nashville Mayor
Phil Bredesen. It is a complicated structure: From the air it looks
like a treble clef, from one side it looks like a piano keyboard,
and from another angle it is a Cadillac fin. Besides creating room
for newer and splashier exhibitions, the museum's main purpose is
to house the Hall of Fame's collection of one million artifacts
(from photographs to albums to mandolins), which are stuffed in
cabinets, on crude shelves and in lockers in the basement of the
current museum off Music Row in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Gathered in the basement are also some of country's most
enthusiastic supporters, revivalists and resuscitators. In a room
off the library sits Alan Stoker (whose father led Elvis Presley's
backing band the Jordanaires). Most of the day Stoker hunches over
the desiccated grooves of old records and transcription disks; his
current project is to restore Hank Thompson's earliest recordings.
His video collection holds many rarities, including a Hank Williams
television appearance on ``The Kate Smith Evening Hour.'' As he
shows it to a visitor he enthusiastically points out every lanky
move and subtlety, down to the final smirk and nervous head nod
that ends Williams' performance of ``Cold, Cold Heart.''
</P>
<P>
   In the archive room nearby is Mark Medley, an archivist who sees
the material world as one inhabited by ghosts and accordingly
spends his time looking for objects that have come in contact with
country legends, whether they be favorite instruments or napkins
with a soup stain. Locked away in his small office are Jimmie
Rodgers' guitar, a chair that Elvis may have sat on once, a classic
Lefty Frizell outfit and a boot made from painted macaroni given by
a fan to Little Jimmy Dickens. On display upstairs are many of the
Hall of Fame's greatest possessions, a highlight being Webb
Pierce's personalized Pontiac with horseshoe-shaped pedals, a
saddle-shaped gearshift, pistol door handles and rifle hood and
trunk ornaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw that driving around town when I grew up here,'' said
Young, whose first job at the museum was as a ticket collector 20
years ago. ``I didn't know what to think of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Hall of Fame announced which performers it planned
to induct in September. They are Dolly Parton, Conway Twitty and
the cowboy actor and songwriter Johnny Bond. ``What a great honor;
I really am surprised,'' Ms. Parton said in a statement, adding,
``I thought I'd have to be as old as Roy Acuff or as ugly as Willie
Nelson to get in the Hall of Fame.''

<P>
   There are several exceptional books devoted to the art of Henri
Matisse, from Alfred Barr Jr.'s classic ``Matisse: His Art and His
Public,'' first published in 1951, to ``The Unknown Matisse,''
Hilary Spurling's detailed biography of the artist's early years,
published last fall. Now the picture of this remarkable colorist is
rounded out further by John Russell's splendid ``Matisse: Father &AMP;
Son,'' an account of the artist, his son Pierre and their dealings
with other painters and sculptors, based on letters between the
father and son and between the son and the modernist innovators he
represented in his eponymous gallery on East 57th Street in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Russell, the former chief art critic for The New York Times, has
written a page turner, a quality setting it apart from most other
volumes on art. He has fashioned an absorbing tale about the
ordinary life of an extraordinary painter, sculptor, draftsman and
printmaker. And he has advanced his narrative with an ingenious yet
understated literary style.
</P>
<P>
   In alternating chapters, he traces Henri Matisse's development
as artist, husband, father and friend; the business career of his
son, and the studio life and exhibition history of the European
artists who showed with Pierre Matisse in New York before and after
World War II. By selectively excerpting correspondence _ over 825
letters between father and son, more than 150 from Jean Dubuffet
alone _ Russell achieves a special immediacy.
</P>
<P>
   After situating each artist Russell steps aside to allow
forthright and illuminating remarks by all the painters and
sculptors to make the reader feel as if they are sharing their
confidences and perspectives with you and no one else. For this,
Pierre Matisse's gifts as a correspondent must also be
acknowledged. Those who wrote to him seem to speak straight from
the heart, an attribute of their art as well.
</P>
<P>
   To an inquiry from his dealer in the United States, Joan Miro
revealingly says: ``You ask me about the objects, and how I come to
make them. ... I feel myself magnetized by a particular object.
There is nothing premeditated about it. After that, I feel myself
drawn toward another object. When the two are put together, their
contact produces a poetical shock, a mutual and immediate
infatuation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My work has nothing whatever to do with Freud, or with the
theoretical,'' he added. ``It has nothing to do with `literature'
or `intellectuality.' Work of that sort is born dead, already
rotting and destined to disappear in short order.''
</P>
<P>
   Much as Henri Matisse, at 76, started to arrange cut and colored
paper shapes into exhilarating pictures, Russell has taken the
innermost thoughts put down on paper by the Matisses and
personalities like Miro, Balthus and Alberto Giacometti and woven
them together into an emotion-packed volume. Over and over, the
elder Matisse tells his son that he finds it possible to express
thoughts and feelings in his letters that are impossible for him to
discuss in person.
</P>
<P>
   In 1924, as a concerned parent, Henri advised Pierre, who was
newly installed in New York: ``Keep in constant touch with me, and
above all don't do anything without telling me.'' To his son, the
father also once declared, ``Of course, one never knows what other
people are really like.'' The letters allow Russell to partly
circumvent this truth.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the book, Russell introduces a range of previously
unfamiliar material: from Matisse's feelings concerning Ballets
Russe's 1920 production of ``Chant du Rossignol'' with his decor
and costumes, to invitations he and Picasso received in 1931 to
paint murals for Radio City Music Hall, to the genesis of pictures
like ``Interior With a Dog'' and ``Still Life With Oysters.''
</P>
<P>
   Movingly, on several occasions the father reports on his mental
state to his son. ``I need complete calm,'' Henri notes. ``I have
lived for a long time now _haunted by a mortal disquiet that
pursues me day and night.'' And he added, ``Your mother is better,
in certain respects, but she is in a state of total nervous
exhaustion.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell's approach makes it seem as if the artists themselves,
rather than art historians, are explaining what they do. Henri
Matisse refers to problems getting a series of still lifes started,
while Giacometti writes that ``heads are the most important thing
for the moment, in spite of my longing to go back to the figures.''
And some of the artists' comments also arouse one's sympathy as
they talk about their need to be paid and about aging and illness.
Just before an operation for an intestinal disorder Henri tells
Pierre: ``My eyes are better. But my inside isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The letters also present intriguing expressions of confidence,
and insecurity, as well as responses to compliments. While Miro
seems constantly to be asserting that whatever is currently at hand
surpasses his previous efforts, Giacometti does the opposite. ``A
lot of people think that it may be the best thing that I've ever
done,'' he writes about a particular work. ``But I see its defects
so clearly.'' And there are poignant notes of anxiety, as when
Giacometti broods: ``I wonder how I shall look beside Maillol and
Despiau. They are two big men, after all.''
</P>
<P>
   If Pierre Matisse seems less compelling than the other
personalities in the book, Russell says that is not the case at
all. These pages mirror the way Pierre conducted himself in life as
well as business. Russell writes: ``Pierre the dealer had an air of
reserve, and sometimes almost of severity. In private, he had
stores of wit, irony and deadpan high spirits.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Matisse was willing to let others shine. As he himself
once put it: ``I did not `make' my artists. My artists made me.''
Nevertheless, he had the talent to get their paintings and
sculptures placed in the finest museums. And now the thoughts he
exchanged with them have finally been brought together by Russell,
who has produced an important record of the way European art of the
20th century entered the hearts and minds of Americans.

BUSH ATTACKS GORE AS A `WASHINGTON, D.C. PERSON' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va._ Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the leading Republican
presidential candidate, took aim at Vice President Al Gore Tuesday,
saying the leading Democratic contender ``thinks Washington has all
the answers. I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning here in this reliably Republican state, Bush also
sought to strike a contrast between himself and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Without mentioning the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal that nearly
cost Clinton his presidency, Bush told some 300 wealthy GOP
contributors at a lunch that if he becomes president, he will
``swear to uphold the dignity of the office to which I have been
elected.''
</P>
<P>
   He collected $300,000 at the luncheon and planned to be the
featured guest at a blue-chip Republican gathering in Washington
Tuesday night. Karen Hughes, Bush's press secretary, said the
Washington gathering would yield $1.5 million in contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the Republican field in fundraising and in the polls,
Bush started the day by attending a story-telling session at a
library in the predominantly black East End section of this city.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia has supported Republican presidential candidates in
every election since 1964 when voters here sided with Democrat
Lyndon Johnson in his landslide victory over Sen. Barry Goldwater,
R-Ariz. Virginia also has moved up its primary date to Feb. 29,
2000, making it an important state in the Bush campaign strategy to
sew up the nomination early.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's wife Laura, who has worked as a librarian, read to a
day-care group of 23 children ages three to five, as did Roxanne
Gilmore, wife of Virginia's Republican governor, James Gilmore.
Bush did not read but he presented a children's book, ``Hank, the
Cowdog,'' to the library as a gift.
</P>
<P>
   After the library appearance Bush was asked about Gore. ``He's a
Washington, D.C., person,'' Bush told reporters. ``He thinks
Washington has got all the answers. I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   As the presidential race unfolds, he added, voters will notice
``a huge difference between (Gore) and me.''
</P>
<P>
   In his own campaign tour last week, Gore fired a potshot at Bush
by saying he would continue economic prosperity ``the right way,
not by letting people fend for themselves or hoping for crumbs of
compassion.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the implied criticism, Bush, who calls himself a
``compassionate conservative,'' responded that ``there are no such
things as crumbs of compassion as far as I'm concerned. There are
people who show compassion for a neighbor. That act ought to be
lauded. That act ought to be praised.''
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that laws and government are not the key to
improving peoples' lives. ``Societies change when neighbor helps
neighbor, when a person in need gets a helping hand. I don't view
that as crumbs. I view that as the greatness of America, the soul
of America. ... My job as president, should I be fortunate enough
to win, is to elevate our spirit, so that America continues to
perform the common-day miracles of life.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited the East End library employees as an example of ``the
armies of compassion staffed by people who care as to whether or
not children in this neighborhood learn how to read.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also argued that injecting a higher level of morality into
the American culture has been a theme of his since his first race
for governor in 1994. ``This isn't something I just discovered.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the library, several young Democrats held aloft protest
signs saying ``Robertson + Falwell  &QC;  Bush'' (a reference to
christian conservatives Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell) and ``Bush
_ conservative, not compassionate.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Bieber, executive director of the Virginia Democratic
Party, who was standing nearby, said of Bush, ``I'm not sure really
what he is or what he stands for. All we have to go on are these
feel-good slogans and these photo opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rosa Whiting, an East End resident who attended the reading
with her 10-year-old daughter Tara, said Bush had impressed her.
``I enjoyed everything he had to say,'' she said, adding that she
planned to him if he wins the Republican nomination.

   MADRID, Spain _ Few places in Madrid are more exclusive than an
austere mansion on Ruiz de Alarcon Street, just above the rambling
Prado Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Loftiness is exuded from its marble halls, plush salons and
shelves stacked with outsized books clad in fading vellum. All the
portraits are of famous writers, here Lope de Vega, there
Cervantes. This, the inner sanctum of the Spanish Royal Academy, is
seldom seen by ordinary citizens.
</P>
<P>
   But for all its elitist aura, it is the people's business that
goes on here, the business of the 400 million or so speakers of
Spanish, which developed a millennium ago on the high plains of
Castile and now ranks among the world's most widely spoken
languages.
</P>
<P>
   Every Thursday, the 46-member Academy meets to ``cleanse, fix
and give splendor'' to the Spanish language, as its motto promises,
and to carry out its mandate to give awards, settle points of
grammar and spelling and prepare the latest authoritative
dictionary. It has done so since 1713.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Academy once ruled with absolute authority over the
vast Spanish empire, the Americas now have their own language
academies that propose home-grown changes. Disputes have even led
to threats of linguistic schisms. So, with 9 out of 10 Spanish
speakers now living outside Spain, the Royal Spanish Academy has
learned to consult and negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stern matriarch in Madrid has become more like a benign
grandmother,'' said an Argentine diplomat here. ``She keeps an eye
on her adventurous offspring, but she gives advice, not orders.''
</P>
<P>
   Preserving the unity of the language through a universal
spelling is currently the institution's first objective, said
Victor Garcia de la Concha, director of the Academy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wonderful that our language, which is so dispersed, has
kept a single set of spelling rules,'' he said. ``In fact, it's a
miracle.'' It has been helped, he said, by the fact that ``Spanish
has one of the most phonetic spellings of the great languages.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other most widely spoken languages, Hindi and Arabic
have become diverse and English spelling is not uniform, the
director lamented. His voice rose as he pondered danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you allow lots of variants or reforms, you create division,
even chaos!'' he exclaimed. ``Spelling is a very serious matter.
It's the instrument to defend the unity of the language.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Thursday, the Academy had barely opened its session
with the traditional invocation ``Come, Holy Spirit'' in Latin when
the gathering around the great oval table was confronted with
different views over the use of accents in Spain and in Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   On the agenda was a new guide to spelling, to replace a 1958
version later this year. There were questions: should a word like
guion (meaning, among other things, screenplay) have an accent on
the second syllable? Usage said yes. But some Latin American
linguists had argued that they pronounced the word as one syllable,
so no accent was required.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any change will be discussed and approved word for word
together with the other 21 academies,'' said Gregorio Salvador, a
member of the spelling commission. ``So the new guide will not be a
Spanish but a pan-Hispanic version.''
</P>
<P>
   The drafting committee, he said, had been mindful of criticisms
from the Americas, among them that the Madrid Academy is too
Spain-centric. At one point in the draft text, the Academy used the
phrase driver's license, which in Spain is permiso de conducir.
</P>
<P>
   Protests arrived from the Americas noting that in Peru and
Ecuador it was called a brevete and elsewhere a licencia. The
example was dropped.
</P>
<P>
   This search for consensus among 22 academies (two are in
countries where Spanish is not the first language, the United
States and the Philippines) may seem cumbersome, but Salvador sees
safety in numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Changes have become very rare now,'' he said. ``If someone
proposes a change and others are against, it does not happen. We
need at least a three-quarter majority to make important decisions.
Keeping unity is even more important than accuracy.''
</P>
<P>
   While written Spanish may be closely monitored, the spoken
language continues to diversify. In Spain, Catalan, Basque, and
Galician all affect Castilian. In the Americas, the distinct speech
of, say, Mexicans, Argentines, Cubans or Chileans can quickly be
spotted.
</P>
<P>
   Salvador said it was the accent of the Andalusians, the
easygoing southerners who lengthen their vowels and swallow their
consonants, that was first exported to Spain's colonies and set the
tone for the softer Spanish of the Caribbean. In the New World,
Spanish was enriched by the vocabulary of the continent's Indians
and by waves of immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   It took time and pressure for the remote Academy in Madrid to
adjust and accept widely-used Indian words. But its latest official
dictionary, published in 1992, added hundreds of words from the
Quechua language of Peru, from Araucano of Chile, from Guarani of
Paraguay, and from Nahua of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Some Nahua words, of course, were adopted long ago, even in
English: xocoatl became chocolate; ahuacatl turned into aguacate
and avocado; tomatl is now the ubiquitous tomato.
</P>
<P>
   The Academy director insists that protecting the language does
not mean closing it off. Outside words have always percolated into
the Latin dialect that became Castilian: In the Middle Ages, it
absorbed some 5,000 Arabic words from the Moorish rulers (many
starting with al, like alcatraz), followed by myriad Italian and
French words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we are getting hundreds of Anglicisms, but the language
will absorb and digest them,'' he said. He cited mitin (meeting),
futbol, and, of course, there is guisqui (whisky).
</P>
<P>
   But will they enter the Academy dictionary? ``It may take a
little while,'' the director said with a laugh, adding that the
Academy did not believe in the line taken in France, which a few
years ago tried to legislate against Anglicisms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can seal a language anyway,'' he mused. ``The Romans
already said that in matters of language, usage is more powerful
than Caesar.''

   ACTORS TAKING TO THE STAGE
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Actors in television series usually have three months
off in the summer. Some use the time to earn money, making a movie;
some use it to spend money, taking a vacation. And then there are
those intrepid few who tread somewhere in the middle, on the stages
of Manhattan, taking their chances with the New York theater
critics and paying public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did turn down a movie, and I thought of taking time off
because our `NYPD Blue' schedule is pretty brutal,'' Bill
Brochtrup, who plays the homosexual station-house administrative
aide in that ABC police drama, said on Tuesday. ``But I'd never
done theater in New York before and it was something I always
wanted to do. And it was the best script I'd seen in a long time,
far better than most movie things I'd read.''
</P>
<P>
   So Brochtrup is now acting in ``Snakebit,'' the Off Broadway
play by David Marshall Grant. He joined the cast on June 8 but will
have to leave the first week in August to resume his television
duties.
</P>
<P>
   Although making a movie would have earned him more money,
``probably by a factor of 10,'' he said, ``This play was, by a
factor of much more than 10, the best choice I could make as an
actor.''
</P>
<P>
   Brochtrup is rare but not alone; this summer, New York theater
has attracted a small flock of television actors. The most
celebrated among them is Calista Flockhart, star of the Fox
network's ``Ally McBeal,'' who is appearing Off Broadway in a
limited run of ``Bash, Latterday Plays'' three separate monologues
by Neil LaBute about murder and other evils.
</P>
<P>
   On Broadway, two NBC sitcom stars, George Segal (``Just Shoot
Me'') and Wayne Knight (``Third Rock From the Sun'') leapt into the
three-man play ``Art'' almost as soon as their shows stopped
shooting. Their run, starring with Buck Henry, began on May 11 and
is to end on Aug. 15.
</P>
<P>
   And Scott Wolf of ``Party of Five,'' the Fox family drama, has
taken over as Clifford, the son, in ``Side Man'' until July 17.
</P>
<P>
   At least one writer has also made the theater switch this
summer. Julia Dahl, one of six main writers on ``Party of Five,''
wrote ``Wonderland'' four years ago, when she was 24. Last week,
she saw it open at the American Place Theater Off Broadway. (Wolf
was in the audience; she had watched him in ``Side Man'' the
previous night.)
</P>
<P>
   ``You grow up loving theater, from the first play you did in
second grade,'' Ms. Dahl said. ``However you end up making a
living, you do it, but there's nothing like live theater, so that's
why you see people gravitating back to New York.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is always the chance of a siren song calling. Thursday
was opening night Off Broadway for Lisa Gay Hamilton, a regular
cast member in the ABC legal drama ``The Practice.'' Playing the
lead in ``Angelique,'' a drama about an 18th-century Canadian
slave, Ms. Hamilton was called ``luminous'' and her performance
``gallant'' by The New York Times reviewer on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday night will be her final performance. She has
resigned from the cast _ to make a movie.
</P>

<P>
   THE WEDDING BEAT
</P>
<P>
   It may not have been the wedding of the century, but the latest
royal marriage involving the British royal family still proved to
be a potent draw for several cable networks that carried it on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, thanks to the wedding of Prince Edward to Sophie
Rhys-Jones, NBC's all-news channel, MSNBC, was able to beat CNN in
the ratings for a full day for the first time in its history.
</P>
<P>
   For the three-hour period the wedding was shown, both MSNBC and
Fox News, which also carried the wedding live, easily beat CNN,
which did not. MSNBC totaled just over 1 million homes for those
three hours, Fox had about 800,000 homes, and CNN trailed with
about 600,000.
</P>
<P>
   That raises the question about why CNN chose not to cover the
wedding live. The answer, at least partly, is that it was too
expensive, though CNN executives also objected to a fee that was
being charged for coverage of a state event.
</P>
<P>
   The television rights to the wedding were held by the BBC, which
was able to sublease them to any other broadcaster for a fee
determined by the channel's reach. MSNBC and Fox, which reach about
two-thirds as many homes in America, thus had to pay less than CNN.
</P>
<P>
   The fee that would have been imposed on CNN would have included
its worldwide reach, which is what made it untenable, a CNN
executive said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC and Fox News each paid $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   All the fees are going to the Bagshot Trust, a collection of
charities organized by Prince Edward.
</P>
<P>
   The wedding was also carried live on BBC America, the BBC's
service on American cable systems, which reaches only about 10
million homes, and on one non-news channel, the Learning Channel.
That channel does have a special connection to the prince, however:
Several of the programs produced by his documentary company, Ardent
Productions, have appeared on that channel.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   SNAGGING `AUSTIN'
</P>
<P>
   Continuing its efforts to corral many of the biggest box office
movies for their first broadcast run, TBS announced on Tuesday that
it had acquired initial broadcast rights to this summer's huge hit,
``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.''
</P>
<P>
   The film joins other hits recently acquired by the cable
channel, including ``The Mummy,'' ``The Matrix,'' ``Analyze This''
and ``You've Got Mail.''
</P>
<P>
   TBS usually markets a separate rights deal to a broadcast
network for the films, which means that the movies will be shown
six or eight times on TBS before going to say, CBS for a run or
two, before reverting to TBS.

   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Jim Turner, D-Texas, wants to bring relief to
Frances Staley and all Americans like her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a lovely senior citizen,'' Turner said of Staley, 85,
who he met last year in Orange, Texas. Staley spends her entire
Social Security check trying to pay for 12 prescriptions but still
doesn't have enough money. Like many of her friends, she found a
practical solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got a prescription for 30 days and you don't have
the money ... well, you buy half of it,'' she said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Turner described Staley's predicament at a Tuesday press
conference on Capitol Hill where Democratic lawmakers touted a
measure designed to lower the price of prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, sponsored by Turner, would require drug
companies to sell their products to pharmacies at the lowest price
paid by the federal government, which by law can command a lower
price than hospitals or health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   It would result in a 30 to 40 percent discount in prescription
drug prices at no significant cost to the federal government,
Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No senior citizen in this country should have to take half of
their medication,'' said Turner.
</P>
<P>
   Large pharmaceutical companies have conducted a lobbying and
media blitz against the measure, saying that it would eventually
drive up prices for everyone and stifle drug research and
development.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most profitable industry in the country is charging the
highest prices in the world to seniors who have no coverage,'' said
Rep. Tom Allen, D-Maine. ``This is bad medicine, bad economics and
bad public policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The relief can't come soon enough for Staley, who is blind and
needs a dozen prescriptions to treat ailments including a heart
condition and high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Staley said many politicians in Washington don't realize the
hardships of senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they know the half of what the common people are
having to contend with,'' she said. ``Our Social Security wouldn't
pay for one of their meals.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have embraced the issue in an effort to court senior
citizens, a group that could be vital to a Democratic hopes of
regaining control of the House in next year's elections. Recent
polls show senior citizens tending to prefer Republican policies to
those of the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The prescription drug issue is part of a larger Democratic
health care plan that includes adding a prescription drug benefit
to Medicare and creating a ``patients' bill of rights'' that would
impose new regulations on health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Turner said Democratic efforts to end the ``exorbitant'' cost of
prescription drugs will
</P>
<P>
   resonate with the public throughout next year's election.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question about it. This is a kitchen table issue,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The expense of prescription drugs and the stress and hardship it
causes senior citizens has been a focus for Turner, who sits on a
congressional task force on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Turner commissioned a study last year that found that some
senior citizens in his district are paying twice as much as drug
companies charge large customers such as health maintenance
organizations.

CLINTON URGES REFUGEES TO DELAY RETURN TO KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   STENKOVEC REFUGEE CAMP, Macedonia _ President Clinton implored
ethnic Albanian refugees Tuesday to delay their rush home to Kosovo
so that peacekeeping forces can clear land mines, stockpiles of
Serbian ammunition and unexploded allied bombs that could
jeopardize their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's appeal had a secondary goal of trying to keep clogged
roads into Kosovo clear of returning refugees to speed the
deployment of the 50,000-strong allied security force. Barely half
of the force of British, French, German, Italian and U.S. soldiers
had moved into Kosovo by Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have suffered enough. I don't want any child hurt,''
Clinton told several hundred cheering, chanting refugees squeezed
into a fenced enclosure in a sprawling tent city that shelters
10,000 refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I ask you, please be patient with us, give us a couple of
more weeks to take land mines up,'' the president said. ``I want to
make sure it is a happy return.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 20,000 camp residents already have returned to
Kosovo, a province of Serbia. Serbia is the dominant state of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's caution came one day after two Nepalese Gurkhas in the
British Army and two civilians died as they prepared to dispose of
unexploded munitions found in a school in Negrovce, 20 miles from
Kosovo's capital of Pristina. Clinton spoke by phone with British
Prime Minister Tony Blair after the accident.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials estimate that Yugoslav forces sowed one million
mines across the largely agrarian province, an area the size of
greater Los Angeles. A United Nations' survey found mines, booby
traps and unexploded bombs lurking in almost 800 separate areas.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, accompanied by first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and
their daughter Chelsea, addressed the refugees after an emotional
rendezvous with refugee children.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons met Idriz Magastena, 29, his wife Nerimane, and
their son Besart, 4. The father told the Clintons the family fled
their village and sheltered in Pristina for five weeks until
Serbian troops broke in. A soldier seized their son, put a knife to
one side of his throat and a lighted cigarette to the other side,
and demanded money from the boy's frightened family.
</P>
<P>
   The father told the Clintons the family joined a caravan of
civilian vehicles headed toward Macedonia. Armed Serbs intercepted
the convoy, seized one person from each vehicle, and shot or
stabbed the victim to death.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's mother told the Clintons that her son is ``still very
much afraid. He has seen people killed and wounded.''
</P>
<P>
   The president replied, ``We have to make sure families get help
for their children. There are some things children should never
see.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, after meeting with the Magastena family, told
reporters: ``Many of the children have a glazed-over look. It's the
children that don't cry that you worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   After his meeting, the three Clintons walked hand-in-hand with
refugee children toward a plain flat platform set before the
assembled refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton moved deliberately, without exuberance or an air of
triumph. It was only well into his remarks that Clinton struck a
note of pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're proud of what we did (in Kosovo) because we think it is
what America stands for,'' he said, as a crowd chanted ``U-S-A,''
``Billy'' or ``Clinton'' at different points.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said the president chose not to appeal
directly to the refugees to surrender their own hatreds of the
Serbs when they return to their homes. Clinton privately conceded
that he had detected ``some bitterness'' among refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Weary refugees interviewed at random in the camp said they were
so wounded by their upheaval, the loss of relatives, the
destruction of their homes and their fruitless search for loved
ones that it may take generations before their families can live in
harmony with the Serbs, who are the minority ethnic group in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Some refugees clutched a telephone-book style listing of 19,658
families, representing 130,000 refugees, who had registered with
the International Rescue Committee's ``Kosovar Family Finder
Project'' in an effort to track down missing relatives.

<P>
   Aroh Hysehi, 30, a barber who escaped the Serb enclave of Kovo
Polg, said his trusted Serbian neighbors turned on his family the
night allied bombing began March 24. ``Living with Serbs is not
possible now,'' Hysehi said. ``I know this in my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Ismeti Cerkiki, 54, clutching his 23 month-old son Granit, said
he is only willing to return to his home in Ferizaj because Serbs
have been driven out by fear of reprisals.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the Serbs are gone and I'm glad they're gone,'' he said.
``I can live there now.''
</P>
<P>
   Fatmir Berisha, 27, of Pristina, who took his wife and two
children, ages 4 and 3, to the camp a month ago, said thoughts of
reconciliation have withered after returning to Pristina to see
what was left of his family home. Berisha returned to the camp
Monday from Pristina to tell his wife and children that their home
was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was terrible,'' he said. ``I would like to go back home but
I have nothing to go home to.''
</P>
<P>
   Berisha said he would remain in the camp to see if the allied
security force or international relief agencies might help him
rebuild. But if they cannot, Berisha said he would look into the
possibility of emigrating to another country with his family,
possibly to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to start where it is safe,'' Berisha said.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees welcomed Clinton's visit to the camp even though they
said they expected little immediate relief from their day-to-day
plight _ or the challenges ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Florent Kqiku told the Clintons through an interpreter: ``The
Albanian people will never forget, you brought the most precious
gift of all _ freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Vjolca Demiri, a refugee from Gilan who was holding her
eight-month-old nephew Florent Basija on her chest as she spoke
with a reporter, called Clinton a hero. ``The president saved us _
2 million people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit to a refugee camp and a subsequent stopover to
thank allied pilots based in Aviano, Italy, capped a seven-day trip
to Europe to launch a Balkan reconstruction effort. The president
hopes to substitute prosperity and tolerance for the ethnic hatreds
and rivalries that enabled Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to
carry out a murderous rampage across Kosovo that killed an
estimated 10,000 civilians and uprooted 1.6 million others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must create real opportunities for ordinary citizens
throughout Southeastern Europe,'' Clinton told President Kiro
Gligorov of Macedonia, which absorbed an estimated 300,000 refugees
from Kosovo. Some 50,000 of them have already returned home.

   Before joining her husband for the visit to the refugee camp,
Mrs. Clinton took part in a ceremony in Skopje where New York-based
Liz Claiborne Inc., announced the donation of fabric and components
for Macedonian suppliers to produce more than 200,000 shirts and
trousers for Kosovars in Macedonia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is expected to announce preparations for a Senate
campaign from New York in early July.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Agency for International Development donated $881,000
to Mercy Corps International, which in turn will purchase the
finished clothing form Macedonian suppliers who will employ up to
3,000 workers for the project.
</P>
<P>
   Liz Claiborne Chairman Paul Charron told the first lady and
others attending the ceremony: ``We hope to make a small but real
difference in Macedonia.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   A plume of moist air will stream north through the Mississippi
Valley to the central Great Lakes as breezes from the south quicken
ahead of a weak cool front. Clouds and clusters of showers and
thunderstorms will be common in these regions. Sultry air will
combine with a jet stream disturbance over the southern Mississippi
Valley to cause a concentrated cluster of thundershowers that will
produce locally heavy rain in parts of Arkansas southern Missouri
and western Tennessee. Farther north, a few strong thunderstorms
will develop as the cool front lifts the increasingly humid air
over the northern Mississippi Valley. In the wake of the front,
drier air will sweep from the northern Rockies to the northern
Plains.
</P>
<P>
   The Northeast and Middle Atlantic States will become warmer and
slightly more humid. Sunshine will be plentiful in most areas,
however, some puffy cumulus clouds will develop during the
afternoon, especially over interior sections. Sea breezes will cool
the shoreline during the midday and afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Florida will have fewer showers than recent days as an offshore
front drifts farther east. Elsewhere in the Southeast, there will
be a mixture of sunshine and clouds with isolated afternoon
thundershowers, particularly near the southern Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, clouds and a few showers will cling to the coast
from Washington to central Oregon. Meanwhile, the Southwest will
continue to be very warm with ample sunshine. Clouds and a few
thunderstorms will form over the Rockies in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Abnormal Warmth
</P>
<P>
   A period of persistent warmth at Madison, Wis., has reached a
record-setting 18 months. Every month since December 1997 has been
warmer than normal. For climatological record keeping, ``normal''
is defined as the average for the most recent complete three
decades. The period 1961-1990 is currently used. Regional climates
display complex rhythms of warmth and chill that span many time
scales from years to decades to centuries. The 30-year period is
used to help even out some of the peaks and valleys that represent
the constantly changing climate of the earth.

with prayers and songs and rigid rules that is seldom seen around

Ted Harrington, left, with his father, Wesley Edward Harrington IV.
Ted was not a classic bully who used hostility to vent his anger
and insecurity. Rather, as a player in the often confusing,
socially uneasy, sometimes cruel culture of American boyhood, he
was one of those kids who initiate taunts rather than stand to the
side or take the heat themselves. ``It took being the victim to
realize it wasn't as fun as I thought it had been,'' he says. (John

   For more than 900 years, the fishermen of Favignana, a small
island off Sicily, have gone after bluefin tuna in the same
ritualistic way. For the four weeks when the huge fish migrate
through the surrounding waters, the men await a signal from their
leader to begin the mattanza, a highly choreographed communal hunt
with prayers and songs and rigid rules that is seldom seen around
Sicily anymore.

SPANISH-LANGUAGE TV'S CRISTINA SARALEGUI: LATIN FLAIR (AND FLARE) 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIREYA NAVARRO    c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The subject was ``I have the worst husband in the
world,'' and the three couples dug into it with relish. The women
complained that their husbands never took them out and were too
jealous or boring; the men retorted that their wives denied them
sex and would rather go out than take care of the children.
</P>
<P>
   The standard talk show fare droned on for a while when a
confrontation erupted from an unexpected corner. A man in the
studio audience, speaking up to side with one of the husbands,
referred to the man's wife as ``vieja.'' In Colombia, where the man
was from, vieja means woman, but in Mexico, where the wife was
from, it means  &UR; old &LR;  woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``For starters, do not call me `vieja,' because you don't know
me and you have no reason to be disrespectful to me!'' the
aggrieved woman said angrily as the audience clapped and hollered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm calling you `vieja' in the most affectionate sense of the
word,'' the man stammered nervously, ``not because of age.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, be specific,'' the woman snapped.
</P>
<P>
   Semantics is just one of the pitfalls with which Cristina
Saralegui contends in ``El Show de Cristina,'' the highest-rated
talk show on Spanish-language television. It is celebrating its
10th anniversary this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Saralegui, a Cuban-American with sparkling green eyes and
dyed platinum blond hair, has often been described as the Hispanic
Oprah Winfrey. (They have the same birthday, Jan. 29.) But Ms.
Winfrey has not had to juggle the slang of dozens of countries or
faced a boycott for hurting national sensitivities or gone to
Mexico to face a scandalized audience accusing her of corrupting
the whole country.
</P>
<P>
   Many viewers were shocked in 1996 when Ms. Saralegui told two
gay couples, ``I'm marrying you here because I don't have any type
of prejudice and because I think that what you're doing is
correct,'' and had the ceremony broadcast. That show cost her bomb
threats and pickets.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was there widespread understanding when she had a doctor
demonstrate proper condom use on a large cucumber. To this day the
show, a five-days-a-week program (with one night special edition)
that is taped in Miami and broadcast to the United States and as
many as 18 countries, is shown only at night in many Latin American
markets because of its risque content.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our audience is a lot more traditional than your
general-market American audience,'' Ms. Saralegui (pronounced
sah-rah-LEG-ee) said over lunch recently at her Miami Beach mansion
in one of the exclusive islands that dot Biscayne Bay. ``Hispanics
in the United States were not used to talk about incest,
homosexuality, AIDS, domestic violence or child abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   That was before Ms. Saralegui contributed to linguistic common
ground with words like heterosexual.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Saralegui, 51, was editor-in-chief of the Spanish-language
edition of Cosmopolitan when she was tapped to do her own talk show
in April 1989 by Univision, the country's largest Spanish-language
television network. The network promoted her as ``the Oprah Winfrey
with salsa.'' The term made Ms. Saralegui wince, but she joked that
she preferred it to being called ``Donahue in drag.''
</P>
<P>
   While Phil Donahue, Ms. Winfrey, Sally Jessy Raphael and Geraldo
Rivera dominated the talk-show format on English-language
television, Ms. Saralegui was among the first to try it in Spanish.
And while she borrowed from the other shows, she was all alone in
trying to tame that multi-headed beast, the Hispanic-American mass
market.
</P>
<P>
   This meant that before she tackled issues like cheating husbands
and lesbian mothers, there was the business of Ms. Saralegui's
accent. As a writer for magazines that sold all over Latin America,
Ms. Saralegui said she was mindful of using what she calls ``a
Pan-American vocabulary'' to avoid words that are common in one
country but are considered obscene in another, and to be sensitive
to colloquialisms and the many terms that Hispanic people can use
to refer to something like beans, depending on nationality.
</P>
<P>
   But she was insulted when the network suggested diction classes
to neutralize her Cuban accent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said no because I was 41,'' Ms. Saralegui said, too old for
such a drastic change, and because ``I'm really proud of being a
Cuban.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came the hate mail after the first few shows, criticizing
her as ``too white'' to represent Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they were as prejudiced with me as others were with
them,'' Ms. Saralegui said.
</P>
<P>
   Although she has long won acceptance, the balancing act required
to appeal to dozens of subgroups was underscored again last year
when several Dominican organizations in the United States accused
her of distorting the image of Dominicans by having a
disproportionate number of them on shows with sordid themes. The
groups managed to get some advertisers to cancel ads and brought a
television news magazine expose in the Dominican Republic, where
some panelists admitted having invented their stories to get a free
trip to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``The part in which she has experts counseling people lasts two
minutes,'' complained Nuria Piera, the producer who did the expose.
``The rest of the show is people applauding anti-values _ vices,
our garbage. What is highlighted is the bad.''
</P>
<P>
   In full-page newspaper ads in the Dominican Republic, Ms.
Saralegui called the charges absurd. Her own investigation, she
said, turned up only one panelist who admitted to lying to get on
the show, and she denied that nationality played any role in the
selection of her guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are chosen based on their eloquence, the emotion they
project and, of course, the journalistic importance of their
story,'' she wrote, ``never because of their nationality.''
</P>
<P>
   Her ratings and her audience of 1.1 million households daily and
1.9 million on Monday night in the United States and millions more
in Latin America have held up through the controversies. Even the
most horrified Hispanic viewers, it seems, appreciate watching
their particular idiosyncrasies and dysfunctions on television
through debates on subjects like bigamist immigrants and surgically
restored virgins.
</P>
<P>
   And they have embraced a host who is opinionated and so
unmercifully blunt that sometimes she is the one bleeped out, who
admits her age (and that of her husband, who is younger, at 40),
her plastic surgeries, her cellulite and her weakness for tequila,
who has become a forceful advocate of causes like AIDS prevention
and who has assumed the parts of cheerleader, teacher, role model
and mother hen to Hispanic viewers in the United States, whether
they like it or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has opened up avenues of communication, she has shed light
on a lot of issues that needed to have light shed on them,'' said
Lisa Navarrete, a spokeswoman for the National Council of La Raza,
a Hispanic civil rights group. ``She helps in the education and
assimilation process in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Saralegui, who is called Mati by relatives, close friends
and staff, has also become a millionaire, parlaying her show into a
multimedia empire she owns with her husband and manager, Marcos
Avila. The couple have three children.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Cristina Saralegui Enterprises Inc. produces her show and
``Cristina Opina,'' a syndicated radio program, and publishes
``Cristina,'' a monthly magazine. She has a Web site, commercial
endorsements and even her own line of fashion eyewear.
</P>
<P>
   This year the company plans to move all its operations into a
$3.1 million, two-story building here, with another $3 million for
renovations in the works, Avila said. The building will have three
studios to produce other shows.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Saralegui just signed a three-year contract for her
show, she said that even she, ``a work mule with menopause,'' was
tiring of the grind of doing 220 shows a year and was looking for
other endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have to be compared to somebody, it is to Martha
Stewart,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But before Martha or Oprah, her model was Helen Gurley Brown,
the longtime editor of Cosmopolitan. In a book published last year,
``Cristina! My Life as a Blonde'' (Warner Books), Ms. Saralegui
described her as mentor and ``the person I admire most in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   The 10 years Ms. Saralegui served as guru to ``la chica Cosmo''
as editor in chief of Cosmopolitan en Espanol was the culmination
of a long career in Spanish-language magazines before her move to
television. (Ms. Saralegui was born into a wealthy publishing
family that owned Cuba's leading magazines before Fidel Castro took
power, and it went into exile in 1960, when she was 12.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 Ms. Saralegui tried a crossover into English with a
trial run of her show on 25 CBS stations. She and Avila said they
dropped the idea despite encouraging ratings because they could not
settle on financial terms for future shows.
</P>
<P>
   Back in her Spanish-language habitat, Ms. Saralegui is totally
at ease, whether urging a quarreling couple to get a divorce or
scolding an audience member for vulgarity. The show fills several
niches _ it can be as raunchy as Jerry Springer's and as
soul-baring as Oprah's, a mixture of sex and confrontations,
celebrity interviews and educational debate _ and Ms. Saralegui
herself can be all over the place. She is irreverent and
foul-mouthed, immodest and self-effacing, ruthless and nurturing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you something,'' she told a woman in between takes
during the recent taping of a show about orphans of natural
disasters and the infertile couples who want to adopt them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I married my second husband, I wanted to have a child,
and I had the same condition as yours and lost a baby just like
you. The doctor told me `Take out your uterus,' and I told him:
`You know what? This uterus is mine, not yours.' I changed doctors
and now I have a 13-year-old son.''
</P>
<P>
   Call her Oprah-Martha-Helen with a dash of Judge Judy.
</P>
<P>
   ``She speaks her mind,'' said Enrique Rivas, 48, a Colombian in
the audience who has lived in the United States for 12 years. ``She
makes us laugh and cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Saralegui said she also strives to uplift; her trademark
signoff is a flickering thumbs-up. After a decade on the air, she
said, her goal remains ``raising my people's self-esteem and
knowledge quotient so they can succeed in this very competitive
country, and making them feel that they are supported in their
efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   She also insists on ``translating'' Hispanics for one another
and pursuing their elusive unity, saying common denominators such
as the value that Hispanics place on family, spirituality and
tradition, and being hobbled by the same problems, far outweigh the
differences and prejudices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The common denominator all Latinos have is that we want some
respect,'' she said. ``That's what we're all fighting for.''

A FILMMAKER'S FAITH IN GOD, IF NOT IN MEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Ind., Wash., Utah)  (mk) 
 By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For many moviegoers there is almost nothing like
sitting through a Neil LaBute film. Nothing more depressing on
screen. Nothing more likely to induce despair, or more frightening,
perhaps, for what it shows us about human beings. Sexual cruelty.
Domination. Hatred. LaBute shoves them in your face.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meanest movies in Hollywood,'' Details magazine has said
of LaBute's work.
</P>
<P>
   And now with ``Bash, Latterday Plays,'' which opens Thursday at
the Douglas Fairbanks Theater in New York and is to continue
through July 24, LaBute has done it again, for the stage this time,
in three separate monologues starring Ron Eldard, Calista Flockhart
and Paul Rudd. The first two are about infanticide and the third is
a brutal account of a gay bashing.
</P>
<P>
   And yet here sits LaBute, a Mormon convert, father of two, who
lives in a pleasant suburb north of Chicago, a big teddy bear of a
man in an unironed shirt over a T-shirt, politely answering
questions in a midtown restaurant. ``You're the last person in
charge of what you write,'' LaBute, who is 36, said in his soft
voice. The dark stories seem to pour out despite himself. In
creating the monologues he said he consciously borrowed the
techniques of Greek tragedy, like characters telling of horrific
events that have occurred offstage.
</P>
<P>
   He is also drawn to the monologue form because it allows the
character to be ``as personal as possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   LaBute is best known for his film ``In the Company of Men,''
about two men who deliberately set out to destroy a young deaf
woman by seducing and then brutally rejecting her. In his second
film, ``Your Friends and Neighbors,'' about emotional violence and
sexual failure among a group of friends, a character announces that
the best sex he ever had was when he participated in the gang rape
of a boy in high school.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Bash, Latterday Plays,'' which is directed by Joe Mantello,
the characters are all associated to varying degrees with
Mormonism, a first in LaBute's work.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Medea Redux,'' one of the play's monologues, Ms. Flockhart,
on hiatus from the television show ``Ally McBeal,'' plays a
teen-ager who has been seduced by her teacher and becomes pregnant.
When he abandons her, she exacts a terrible revenge. Ms. Flockart
does not portray the teen-ager as a victim, she said. ``She's
betrayed, but strong and capable and smart and hurt. She's Medea.''
</P>
<P>
   In the evening's second segment, ``Iphegenia in Orem,'' Eldard
plays a young executive who recounts two stories, one about being
told he is going to lose his job and the other about his baby
daughter's sudden death.
</P>
<P>
   The final segment of the play, ``A Gaggle of Saints,'' is a dual
monologue with Rudd and Ms. Flockhart. Rudd portrays a handsome,
initially charming college student who, during a night on the town
with his girlfriend, beats a gay man in a bathroom in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   The trick of playing such a brutal figure, said Rudd, whose most
recent stage role was Orsino in the Lincoln Center Theater
production of ``Twelfth Night,'' ``is getting the audience on your
side'' so that it will stay with the character.
</P>
<P>
   Rudd's monologue is interwoven with that of Ms. Flockhart. She
plays his girlfriend, describing a wonderful weekend in New York,
blissfully ignoring whatever knowledge of his behavior she might
carry in her heart. ``I view her as somebody in denial,'' Ms.
Flockhart said, ``able to shut out the dark, ugly truth, but she
knows the truth fully.''
</P>
<P>
   LaBute said he chose Ms. Flockhart for the play because ``she
comes in with a great deal of good will,'' because of her role on
``Ally McBeal.'' ``A lot of people put a certain kind of trust in
her,'' LaBute said. ``I want to see how that works when you lead
them into a place they may not want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Flockhart has performed on Broadway in ``Three Sisters'' and
``The Glass Menagerie,'' but she said she had never acted in
anything like ``Bash,'' reciting for 35 minutes straight before an
audience without cues or interaction with other actors.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the play's Mormon subtext, LaBute said he does not
intend ``Bash'' to be a commentary on Mormonism. He uses Mormonism
because he is familiar with it, he said. In the play it is ``a
universal for characters brought up under a religious authority.
You would imagine they would know better. But just being part of a
religion doesn't make you good.''
</P>
<P>
   But where does the preoccupation with violence and evil come
from? LaBute, who was raised in Spokane, Wash., hints at a
difficult relationship with his father, who was a truck driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a reaction to my father in terms of the severity of
my male characters,'' he said. ``I found my father to be a
difficult character to grow up with.'' When his mother saw ``In the
Company of Men,'' with its sadistic male characters, LaBute
recounts, she said, ```Oh, that was his father.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was gregarious, quite charming, very handsome,'' LaBute
said of his father. ``He had lots of great qualities from afar. But
on closer examination the painting did not hold its light.'' His
parents are now divorced, and he and his father are ``pretty much
estranged,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   LaBute, who has an older brother, a businessman, attended a
nondenominational Protestant church with his family, though they
were not deeply religious. He accepted a scholarship to Brigham
Young University in Provo, Utah, a Mormon institution, because it
had a good theater program and a film studio.
</P>
<P>
   Brigham Young ``was a very refreshing change'' from his home
life, LaBute said. He was ``surrounded by very nice, helpful, kind
people, so driven by a passion for religion.'' He fell in love with
a Mormon student, Lisa Gore, and they married. His wife is now a
family therapist. Their children are Lily, 11, and Spencer, 8.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At Brigham Young he was required to study the Book of Mormon. He
found himself drawn to the religion's ethical and spiritual stance,
and he converted. ``The great thing about it, you can say
definitely, `This is what it is,''' said LaBute, who accepts the
basic Mormon belief that the angel Moroni appeared to the
religion's founder, Joseph Smith, in Palmyra, N.Y. ``The idea of
modern prophecy makes people very nervous,'' LaBute said. ``I have
little difficulty acknowledging the possibility of modern prophecy
by an inherent faith.''
</P>
<P>
   After he graduated from college, he got a master of fine arts in
dramatic writing at New York University, and while he was there his
first play, ``Filthy Talk for Troubled Times,'' a series of
explicit and sometimes profane monologues set in a bar, was
produced in 1992 Off Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to Brigham Young to study for a Ph.D. in theater.
There he was barred from staging one of his productions, but gained
access to the campus theater and the show went on. The play,
``Lepers,'' was about ``some disagreements between the men and
women,'' he said with a smile. Otherwise, there has been
``fortunately, precious little reaction'' to his work from church
elders. ``I always liked things that had parameters, demarcation
lines,'' LaBute said of Mormonism's strict teachings. ``And to see
how far I can travel within those lines.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a professor of theater at St. Francis College in Fort
Wayne, Ind., when he made ``In the Company of Men'' on $25,000
borrowed from a friend. Like most of his work, it provoked praise
and outrage. At one screening, an audience member even punched the
film's publicist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here all we are dealing with is sociopathic behavior that has
no real-world resonance,'' Richard Schickel wrote in Time magazine.
``The movie's sheer grimness militates against anyone other than a
masochist volunteering to pay money to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it won the Filmmaker's Trophy at the Sundance Film
Festival and the award for best first feature from the New York
Film Critics Circle. The New York Times critic Janet Maslin praised
it as a ``tremendously gutsy first feature.''
</P>
<P>
   Today LaBute's home near Chicago is ``equidistant from
everything,'' he said. ``Besides, there's a lot of good theater''
in Chicago, he added. LaBute said he had written several
full-length plays that are not monologues. But there are no
immediate plans to produce them.
</P>
<P>
   He is editing his first big-budget feature film, ``Nurse
Betty,'' with Chris Rock, Morgan Freeman, Renee Zellweger and Greg
Kinnear. In the movie, written by James Flamberg and John Richards,
Ms. Zellweger is a woman who witnesses her husband's murder and
becomes delusional, convinced that she has jilted her favorite soap
opera star, played by Kinnear. Rock and Freeman are hit men sent to
kill her.
</P>
<P>
   ``People may look at it at first as more upbeat'' than his other
work, LaBute said. ``It has both light and dark in it. In the past
my work was mostly black or dark gray. This one broaches into the
territory of beige or eggshell.''

 &HT;    AFRICAN REFUGEES SHORTED ON AID, CARTER SAYS
 &HT;    By RAVEN HILL
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Va. _ Former President Jimmy Carter said Tuesday he
is increasingly disturbed by the disproportionate media coverage
and financial aid given to war victims of European nations compared
to those from Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said that while he was pleased with the assistance given
to Kosovo refugees, those from Third World nations are equally
deserving of help. You could travel a sizable portion of Africa and
``never set foot on peaceful ground,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the great progress that has been made in
globalization, we still have a long way to go in terms of
comprehending the lives of those who are much different from us,''
Carter said. ``We know about it, but we don't do much about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter spoke at the Global Health Council's annual conference,
``Global Health, Poverty and Development.''
</P>
<P>
   The former president's comments reflect his recent reply to a
question about the greatest challenge facing people in the coming
millennium. Carter replied that he believes it is the ``existing
and growing chasm between rich people and poor people,'' and
suggested that increasing poverty is the cause of more wars today
than ever before in history.

survey on how Americans are dealing with a much broader range of
tasks that go into building a prosperous retirement. The 1999
Retirement Confidence Survey shows we have a high degree of
confidence things will come out right. The study also indicates a
high degree of self-reliance. Nearly half the respondents said
their personal savings will be their most important source of
retirement income. Only one in eight said they look to Social
Security or other government programs. It sure does sound good. But
the study also points out specific actions that many people haven't
taken. (Ezell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

survey on how Americans are dealing with a much broader range of
tasks that go into building a prosperous retirement. The 1999
Retirement Confidence Survey shows we have a high degree of
confidence things will come out right. The study also indicates a
high degree of self-reliance. Nearly half the respondents said
their personal savings will be their most important source of
retirement income. Only one in eight said they look to Social
Security or other government programs. It sure does sound good. But
the study also points out specific actions that many people haven't
taken. (Ezell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

ABBOTT LABS TO BUY DRUGMAKER ALZA FOR $7.3 BILLION
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     and CAROL EMERT 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Alza Corp., the Palo Alto drug company that
developed the NicoDerm anti-smoking patch, said Monday it has
agreed to be acquired by Abbott Laboratories for $7.3 billion in
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Alza is one of the Bay Area's oldest and biggest pharmaceutical
companies and one of the few profitable ones. Monday's deal is the
latest in a recent string of buyouts of local biomedical firms.
</P>
<P>
   Alza Chief Executive Ernest Mario announced the acquisition
Monday afternoon to several hundred employees at a hastily arranged
meeting on the lawn of the company's headquarters. Mario then
jumped on a plane to join Abbott Chief Executive Miles White in New
York, where they will explain the deal to Wall Street investors.
</P>
<P>
   According to Alza Vice President Jim Young, Mario told employees
that he would leave the company once the deal is complete.
</P>
<P>
   White said Alza will keep its name and operate as a division of
Abbott. He said it would be premature to name a successor to Mario.
</P>
<P>
   Alza employs about 2,000 people, including 1,300 in the Bay
Area. White said any layoffs would be ``incidental,'' because
Abbott, a drug industry giant based in Illinois, is acquiring Alza
for its research and development expertise and its brand name in
drug delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Alza was founded in 1968 by Alejandro Zaffaroni, who named the
company using the first two letters of his first and last names.
Zaffaroni wanted to find ways to deliver drugs to the body other
than pills and shots. Alza's early products included a glaucoma
patch inserted under the eyelid and an intrauterine device.
</P>
<P>
   The company lost money for 14 years, but an anti-motion-sickness
skin patch introduced in 1984 helped turn around its fortunes. In
1991, it released the first anti-smoking patch, marketed by
SmithKline Beecham under the name NicoDerm.
</P>
<P>
   Ciba-Geigy, the Swiss drug company, bought about 80 percent of
Alza stock in 1978, and Alza bought back all but 10 percent of that
in 1982. It went public in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Zaffaroni, who founded several other Bay Area biomedical firms,
retired as Alza's chairman at the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Alza concentrated on drug delivery and relied
mainly on royalties from the companies that sold the actual drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But now Alza has begun developing its own pharmaceuticals,
specializing in urology and oncology. In February, it started
selling Ditropan XL, a new one-a-day formula to control weak
bladders that competes with Detrol, an incontinence medicine from
Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Although Alza had grown into one of the Bay Area's few
profitable bio-pharmaceutical companies, with several promising new
products in the wings, the company's shares had fallen in recent
months as Wall Street soured on biotech.
</P>
<P>
   Alza stock hit a 52-week high of $53.31 in March before falling
to almost $33 in April. Its shares had started to rise in recent
weeks as news leaked out that Alza might be in merger talks with
Abbott.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal announced Monday, Abbott will exchange 1.2 of its
shares for each Alza share. Based on Monday's closing prices for
the two firms, Alza shareholders would get a 15 percent premium
over Alza's closing price of $46.25 Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The buyout was announced after the market closed, so the actual
value of the deal could rise or fall depending on what happens to
the companies' shares as investors digest the news.
</P>
<P>
   June has been an extraordinary month for local biotech deals.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, South San Francisco-based Sugen was purchased by
Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn for $650 million in stock.
</P>
<P>
   On June 3, Roche Holdings of Switzerland said it would buy the
third of Genentech stock that it did not already own and resell
some stock in a public offering. That deal was worth more than $3.7
billion.

<P>
   Jim McCamant, editor of the Medical Technology Stock Letter in
Berkeley, said the Alza acquisition illustrates a recent trend in
which drug companies have been acquiring mid-size biotech firms to
get access to their research into new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The biotech firms need to sell out, he said, to get access to
the global sales forces of the large drug companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Alza acquisition, which is subject to approval by Alza
shareholders and regulators, is expected to close by year-end.

 OFF THE WALL: Heavens, the Carpet Glows!  
   
   
 By Terry Nagel  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Reggie Glow leads a double life: subtle and hardly
noticeable during the day, but a real standout when the lights go
down.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reggie Glow is not anyone you'll ever meet, however. It's a
carpet made by Shaw Industries that glows in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   In natural or incandescent light, it looks like a traditional
carpet. But when the lights are turned off, patterns in the rug pop
out and keep glowing for hours.
</P>
<P>
   Three patterns are available: one with stars, moons and planets
called ``Galactic''; another with sports figures called
``Champions''; and a simple diamond pattern called ``Night
Vision.'' The carpet comes in five colors _ deep blue, burgundy and
three neutral shades _ and costs about $25 per square yard,
installed.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw Industries figures the carpet is ideal for children's rooms
and playrooms.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't need to worry about your kids starting to glow.
George Davies, marketing communications manager of Shaw Industries,
says the carpet isn't radioactive. ``We use an inert mineral that's
environmentally safe. We've actually found a way to extrude it into
the fibers.''
</P>
<P>
   Scotchguard protection is also embedded in the polypropylene
fibers, so you can shampoo the carpet and it won't lose its
luminescence. ``As far as stains goes, this is just about the most
bulletproof fiber you can get,'' says Davies.
</P>
<P>
   And if your child is afraid of the dark, there's an added bonus:
You won't have to buy a night light.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  &QL; 
WHERE TO FIND IT
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; To find the closest store selling Reggie Glow carpet, call Shaw
Industries of Dalton, Ga., at (800) 441-7429. &QL;

`AN AMERICAN LOVE STORY': A SUCCESSFUL BUT UNORTHODOX MARRIAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Ohio)   (bl)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   What is the secret of a happy marriage, especially one that
flies in the face of social convention and is fraught with personal
turmoil? The mysterious emotional chemistry that unites spouses
from disparate backgrounds is a major subject of Jennifer Fox's
absorbing 10-hour documentary, ``An American Love Story.''
</P>
<P>
   The courageous partners who opened their personal lives to Ms.
Fox's camera crew are Bill Sims and Karen Wilson, an interracial
couple who met in 1967 in Ohio, married in 1979, and have two
daughters. Because Sims is black and Ms. Wilson white, ``An
American Love Story'' is much more than an exploration of ties that
bind. It is a sustained meditation on race relations and
opportunity in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary opens Wednesday in New York at the Film Forum
with showings of blocks of three hourlong episodes, three times a
day over the next two weeks. The 10th hour, Episode 6, will be
added when the film is shown on PBS later this year.
</P>
<P>
   While portraying the union as fortified by a
you-and-me-against-the-world attitude, it reveals the price paid by
the children of an interracial marriage. As wonderful as it may be
to grow up in a color-blind household, an idyllic home life can
make encountering racism outside all the more distressing.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the documentary was filmed at the couple's apartment in
Flushing, Queens, where a crew moved in during the mid-'90s
(exactly when isn't clear) and chronicled a year and a half. Sims,
a blues musician, was then 43, Ms. Wilson, a corporate
businesswoman, 42, and their daughters, Cicily and Chaney, 20 and
12 respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The completed documentary was whittled down from more than 1,000
hours of film. The daily rhythms of domestic life are much the same
as those of the Loud family, examined in the groundbreaking 1970s
PBS documentary ``An American Family,'' which ``An American Love
Story'' emulates without apology.
</P>
<P>
   A lot happens during that year and a half. Sims, a talented
singer and guitarist, experiences the jagged ups and downs of a
career that takes him on the road, where he admits he becomes a
different person from the family man we see throughout much of the
film. Near the end he admits he's an alcoholic and seeks treatment.
He also makes a trip to his hometown, Marion, Ohio, to visit his
parents and see his son and daughter from a previous marriage to a
black woman (shown only in a snapshot).
</P>
<P>
   During the same period, Ms. Wilson becomes seriously ill with
fibroid tumors that drain much of the blood from her body, and she
ends up having a hysterectomy. The camera goes to the hospital to
show her in an alarmingly weakened, almost catatonic post-operative
state. It's not until the final episode that the series returns to
Ohio with Ms. Wilson for her 25th high school reunion. Only then,
in the reminiscences of her friends, do we learn the vicious extent
of the community's disapproval of her relationship with Sims.
</P>
<P>
   Cicily, a junior at Colgate University, travels to Nigeria with
a group of fellow students to study for several months. While
there, she meets her first serious boyfriend. Upon returning, she
graduates from Colgate and begins looking for a job. Chaney, who
remains largely in the background of the series, is the center of
only one rather dull episode in which she has her first, carefully
monitored date with a boy her own age.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all that ``An American Love Story'' shows of the lives
of the Wilson-Sims family, certain crucial elements are missing.
The film seems deliberately to avoid looking at Ms. Wilson's
professional life. Since she is the family's chief breadwinner, its
refusal to visit her workplace and explore what she does eight
hours a day is a significant gap. And in a documentary that relies
heavily on interviews dubbed over scenes of the family's domestic
life, Ms. Wilson is so guarded and clipped in her remarks that we
never get a complete picture of her.
</P>
<P>
   By far the richest characters are Sims and Cicily. Sims, with
minimal education, is certain that he would have ended up, like
other men in his family, in a life of petty crime, were it not for
his music. The scenes of him performing in clubs around the country
suggest that the series might not have been made if it hadn't
offered Sims, who still dreams of a major musical career, a potent
national showcase.
</P>
<P>
   He not only bares his soul in his music but in numerous
monologues that lend the series much of its emotional depth. Again
and again he reiterates what becomes the series' mantra: Family is
the only thing in life that really matters, and family members are
the only people in the world you can really trust. By the end he
has emerged as a noble but flawed individual whose thoughts and
feelings about family, music and black history cohere into a
compelling portrait of a man who has chosen values based on his
experience.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary's saddest moments belong to Cicily, who because
of her racially mixed background finds herself in a kind of social
limbo. She is rejected by the black students at Colgate, and while
accepted into a mostly white sorority, still feels alienated among
the polite middle-class students she calls ``Stepfords.'' Even in
Nigeria, she experiences a similar alienation. What holds her
together is the same thing that keeps her father from falling
apart: the unconditional love of her parents and shared family
values.
</P>
<P>
   That's finally what makes ``An American Love Story'' quite
moving in spite of its sometimes sluggish pace, occasional
vagueness and overall demureness in asking tough questions. In
every scene in which the family members are together, you can feel
the love bursting out of them. Their vibrant, nurturing home is a
refuge from an outside world that still tends to see things (and
people) in terms of black and white.

 SHOPPING EXPERIENCE: Discover More Than a Store in Sony Center  
 
SAN FRANCISCO _ The new Discovery Channel Store in San Francisco
isn't really a store _ it's an experience.
<TEXT>
<P>
   As you walk into the enormous space on the ground floor of the
Sony Metreon Entertainment Center, your senses are bombarded by
lights, colors and action.
</P>
<P>
   Suspended from the ceiling is a sporty Pitts S-1S biplane and a
400 million-year-old, 20-foot-long whale skeleton. A telescopic
ceiling gives you views of the night sky at the stargazing
pavilion, while images of cheetahs sprint across a 110-foot-long
video screen.
</P>
<P>
   Interactive stations invite you to see underwater through the
eyes of a fish, take a visit to outer space and create a souvenir
photo cube, and test your airplane-identification skills.
</P>
<P>
   There are also plenty of home accessories for sale. The store
``has a host of one-of-a kind objects for the home that were
selected from around the globe,'' says publicist Kim Airhart. These
include Russian spirit carvings, meditation fountains and frames
inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Also among the merchandise: assorted masks from West Africa used
during tribal ceremonies, from $130 to $345; children's furniture
and accessories, including a height-measuring giraffe, at $20 to
$345; and even a Wurlitzer jukebox for $7,995.
</P>
<P>
   The parent company, Discovery Communications Inc., plans to have
200 stores by the year 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The Discovery Channel Store is open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. &LR; 
 &LR; daily in the Sony Metreon Entertainment Center, 101 Fourth St. &LR; 
 &LR; (at Mission Street), San Francisco; (415) 442-0706. &LR;

 &UR; MULTIPLE PURPOSES: Designing Furniture to Fit Right In &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
SAN FRANCISCO _ The design world is always aiming to merge fun and
functionality, and a new furniture line from a San Francisco
company actually does it.
</P>
<P>
   Blank and Cables, which designs and fabricates furnishings for
other companies, including the Gap, now has its own collection, and
it's a winner. The pieces are both practical and whimsical: Tables
transform into chairs; boxes climb up ladders; leather pouches
serve as drawers.
</P>
<P>
   Usability was a big factor in designing the collection. ``It
solves a lot of problems that San Franciscans have with smaller
living spaces,'' says owner/designer Walter Craven. ``We're trying
to redefine our relationship to furniture.''
</P>
<P>
   He cites the company's Hingetable as a space-saving example: It
serves as your desk if you work at home, and when guests come, you
lift up a leaf and have a full, beautiful dining table.
</P>
<P>
   The collection includes the Box Chair (around $800), a simple
wooden box with stainless steel legs and an aluminum top. You lift
the lid up to form a chair back, and you get an upholstered seat
into the bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Want a stylish filing or storage system? A series of wood veneer
and aluminum boxes slip into place in a steel ladder that can move
around the house (around $1,300). If you need a side table with
pizzazz, Blank &AMP; Cables makes a handsome piece (pictured, $1,700)
with a polished glass top, steel base, wood box, and fun sloping
leather pouch in place of a drawer.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; For more information, or to make an appointment to view the &LR; 
 &LR; collection, call Blank and Cables at (415) 648-3842. &LR;

 &QL; 
 &UR; A FIND: Wide Array of Gifts Makes This Store Tick &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
LAFAYETTE, Calif. _ A wonderful sound fills your ears when you walk
into &UR; Clocks Etc. &LR;  in Lafayette.
</P>
<P>
   Every kind of instrument to measure time is here, from
wristwatches to alarm clocks to grandfather clocks. There are
clocks for kids, clocks that tell you it's time to go fishing,
clocks that tell you to wake up and clocks that chime, ring,
whistle, cuckoo and cluck.
</P>
<P>
   The store also features barometers, thermometers, fountains,
hourglasses, small pieces of furniture and home and garden
accessories.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Hampton founded Clocks Etc. more than 22 years ago in
another Lafayette location. He and his wife, co-owner Wendy Tamis,
recently moved to the new Lafayette Square shopping center in a
custom-designed, 2,600-square-foot space complete with a huge clock
face suspended from the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Top-quality manufacturers are represented, from Seth Thomas to
Howard Miler to Sligh to Linden, and grandfather clocks are a store
specialty.
</P>
<P>
   Prices range from less than $10 to $8,800 for a ``Legend''
grandfather clock _ only 1,000 of these clocks were made.
</P>
<P>
   This is the perfect place to shop for the person who has
everything. As Tamis likes to point out, ``Nobody ever has enough
clocks.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Clocks Etc. is open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through &LR; 
 &LR; Saturday, and Sunday and evenings by appointment at 971 Moraga &LR; 
 &LR; Road (near Mount Diablo Boulevard), Lafayette; (925) 284-4720. &LR;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For many moviegoers there is almost nothing like
sitting through a Neil LaBute film. Nothing more depressing on
screen. Nothing more likely to induce despair, or more frightening,
perhaps, for what it shows us about human beings. Sexual cruelty.
Domination. Hatred. LaBute shoves them in your face.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meanest movies in Hollywood,'' Details magazine has said
of LaBute's work.
</P>
<P>
   And now with ``Bash, Latterday Plays,'' which opens Thursday at
the Douglas Fairbanks Theater in New York and is to continue
through July 24, LaBute has done it again, for the stage this time,
in three separate monologues starring Ron Eldard, Calista Flockhart
and Paul Rudd. The first two are about infanticide and the third is
a brutal account of a gay bashing.
</P>
<P>
   And yet here sits LaBute, a Mormon convert, father of two, who
lives in a pleasant suburb north of Chicago, a big teddy bear of a
man in an unironed shirt over a T-shirt, politely answering
questions in a midtown restaurant. ``You're the last person in
charge of what you write,'' LaBute, who is 36, said in his soft
voice. The dark stories seem to pour out despite himself. In
creating the monologues he said he consciously borrowed the
techniques of Greek tragedy, like characters telling of horrific
events that have occurred offstage.
</P>
<P>
   He is also drawn to the monologue form because it allows the
character to be ``as personal as possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   LaBute is best known for his film ``In the Company of Men,''
about two men who deliberately set out to destroy a young deaf
woman by seducing and then brutally rejecting her. In his second
film, ``Your Friends and Neighbors,'' about emotional violence and
sexual failure among a group of friends, a character announces that
the best sex he ever had was when he participated in the gang rape
of a boy in high school.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Bash, Latterday Plays,'' which is directed by Joe Mantello,
the characters are all associated to varying degrees with
Mormonism, a first in LaBute's work.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Medea Redux,'' one of the play's monologues, Ms. Flockhart,
on hiatus from the television show ``Ally McBeal,'' plays a
teen-ager who has been seduced by her teacher and becomes pregnant.
When he abandons her, she exacts a terrible revenge. Ms. Flockart
does not portray the teen-ager as a victim, she said. ``She's
betrayed, but strong and capable and smart and hurt. She's Medea.''
</P>
<P>
   In the evening's second segment, ``Iphegenia in Orem,'' Eldard
plays a young executive who recounts two stories, one about being
told he is going to lose his job and the other about his baby
daughter's sudden death.
</P>
<P>
   The final segment of the play, ``A Gaggle of Saints,'' is a dual
monologue with Rudd and Ms. Flockhart. Rudd portrays a handsome,
initially charming college student who, during a night on the town
with his girlfriend, beats a gay man in a bathroom in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   The trick of playing such a brutal figure, said Rudd, whose most
recent stage role was Orsino in the Lincoln Center Theater
production of ``Twelfth Night,'' ``is getting the audience on your
side'' so that it will stay with the character.
</P>
<P>
   Rudd's monologue is interwoven with that of Ms. Flockhart. She
plays his girlfriend, describing a wonderful weekend in New York,
blissfully ignoring whatever knowledge of his behavior she might
carry in her heart. ``I view her as somebody in denial,'' Ms.
Flockhart said, ``able to shut out the dark, ugly truth, but she
knows the truth fully.''
</P>
<P>
   LaBute said he chose Ms. Flockhart for the play because ``she
comes in with a great deal of good will,'' because of her role on
``Ally McBeal.'' ``A lot of people put a certain kind of trust in
her,'' LaBute said. ``I want to see how that works when you lead
them into a place they may not want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Flockhart has performed on Broadway in ``Three Sisters'' and
``The Glass Menagerie,'' but she said she had never acted in
anything like ``Bash,'' reciting for 35 minutes straight before an
audience without cues or interaction with other actors.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the play's Mormon subtext, LaBute said he does not
intend ``Bash'' to be a commentary on Mormonism. He uses Mormonism
because he is familiar with it, he said. In the play it is ``a
universal for characters brought up under a religious authority.
You would imagine they would know better. But just being part of a
religion doesn't make you good.''
</P>
<P>
   But where does the preoccupation with violence and evil come
from? LaBute, who was raised in Spokane, Wash., hints at a
difficult relationship with his father, who was a truck driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a reaction to my father in terms of the severity of
my male characters,'' he said. ``I found my father to be a
difficult character to grow up with.'' When his mother saw ``In the
Company of Men,'' with its sadistic male characters, LaBute
recounts, she said, ```Oh, that was his father.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was gregarious, quite charming, very handsome,'' LaBute
said of his father. ``He had lots of great qualities from afar. But
on closer examination the painting did not hold its light.'' His
parents are now divorced, and he and his father are ``pretty much
estranged,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   LaBute, who has an older brother, a businessman, attended a
nondenominational Protestant church with his family, though they
were not deeply religious. He accepted a scholarship to Brigham
Young University in Provo, Utah, a Mormon institution, because it
had a good theater program and a film studio.
</P>
<P>
   Brigham Young ``was a very refreshing change'' from his home
life, LaBute said. He was ``surrounded by very nice, helpful, kind
people, so driven by a passion for religion.'' He fell in love with
a Mormon student, Lisa Gore, and they married. His wife is now a
family therapist. Their children are Lily, 11, and Spencer, 8.

   At Brigham Young he was required to study the Book of Mormon. He
found himself drawn to the religion's ethical and spiritual stance,
and he converted. ``The great thing about it, you can say
definitely, `This is what it is,''' said LaBute, who accepts the
basic Mormon belief that the angel Moroni appeared to the
religion's founder, Joseph Smith, in Palmyra, N.Y. ``The idea of
modern prophecy makes people very nervous,'' LaBute said. ``I have
little difficulty acknowledging the possibility of modern prophecy
by an inherent faith.''
</P>
<P>
   After he graduated from college, he got a master of fine arts in
dramatic writing at New York University, and while he was there his
first play, ``Filthy Talk for Troubled Times,'' a series of
explicit and sometimes profane monologues set in a bar, was
produced in 1992 Off Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to Brigham Young to study for a Ph.D. in theater.
There he was barred from staging one of his productions, but gained
access to the campus theater and the show went on. The play,
``Lepers,'' was about ``some disagreements between the men and
women,'' he said with a smile. Otherwise, there has been
``fortunately, precious little reaction'' to his work from church
elders. ``I always liked things that had parameters, demarcation
lines,'' LaBute said of Mormonism's strict teachings. ``And to see
how far I can travel within those lines.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a professor of theater at St. Francis College in Fort
Wayne, Ind., when he made ``In the Company of Men'' on $25,000
borrowed from a friend. Like most of his work, it provoked praise
and outrage. At one screening, an audience member even punched the
film's publicist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here all we are dealing with is sociopathic behavior that has
no real-world resonance,'' Richard Schickel wrote in Time magazine.
``The movie's sheer grimness militates against anyone other than a
masochist volunteering to pay money to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it won the Filmmaker's Trophy at the Sundance Film
Festival and the award for best first feature from the New York
Film Critics Circle. The New York Times critic Janet Maslin praised
it as a ``tremendously gutsy first feature.''
</P>
<P>
   Today LaBute's home near Chicago is ``equidistant from
everything,'' he said. ``Besides, there's a lot of good theater''
in Chicago, he added. LaBute said he had written several
full-length plays that are not monologues. But there are no
immediate plans to produce them.
</P>
<P>
   He is editing his first big-budget feature film, ``Nurse
Betty,'' with Chris Rock, Morgan Freeman, Renee Zellweger and Greg
Kinnear. In the movie, written by James Flamberg and John Richards,
Ms. Zellweger is a woman who witnesses her husband's murder and
becomes delusional, convinced that she has jilted her favorite soap
opera star, played by Kinnear. Rock and Freeman are hit men sent to
kill her.
</P>
<P>
   ``People may look at it at first as more upbeat'' than his other
work, LaBute said. ``It has both light and dark in it. In the past
my work was mostly black or dark gray. This one broaches into the
territory of beige or eggshell.''

 Garden Hideaway: A pergola offers a room for dining and relaxing   By Janet Fletcher 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO  &LR; _ Call it a pergola, call it an arbor, call it _ if
you must _ a shade structure. By any name, a vine-covered outdoor
dining area is an appealing feature of many gardens. With filtered
sunlight dappling the table and the scent of jasmine wafting down,
a summer lunch under a pergola can be a sensual feast.
<P>
   Especially in warmer areas, homeowners consider these shady
outdoor rooms an extension of their home: a place to have weekend
brunch, an aperitif before dinner or a summer dinner alfresco. From
rustic do-it-yourself designs to engineered creations with
cast-stone pillars, pergolas support the California habit of living
much of life outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use one per garden probably,'' says Jack Chandler, a Napa
Valley landscape architect. ``If you're going to use the garden,
you want an outside room _ a place to sit and entertain friends and
hang your hammock.''
</P>
<P>
   You can plant a lot of trees and wait for them to grow, Chandler
says, or you can build a pergola.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to have a structure that's an intermediary between
the natural world and the totally enclosed world of the house,''
says Jennifer Chandler, Jack's daughter and a landscape architect
with her own Napa Valley practice.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Chandler says she installs pergolas on about 70 percent
of her jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another way to extend the house into the landscape, to
make another room,'' she says. ``And that sense of enclosure makes
people feel comfortable in their garden.''
</P>
<P>
   Pergolas also provide height and the chance to plant in layers,
with plant material at the base, up the posts and on top, Oakland
landscape designer Bob Clark says. With or without plants, a
pergola can provide architectural interest in a garden.
</P>
<P>
   Because a pergola can be costly _ figure $12 to $25 a square
foot _ designers recommend careful consideration of all aspects of
its design, from site selection to the choice of vines.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; View From the House
</P>
<P>
   For a freestanding pergola, choose a site where you like to sit
and spend time, advises Martina Ladova, a garden designer for Magic
Gardens in Berkeley. The view from the house should be part of the
planning, she says. How will the pergola look from the kitchen
window or a second-story window? From the house, a pergola should
serve as an alluring focal point.
</P>
<P>
   Also consider access. The path to the pergola will need to be
integrated with the rest of your garden and should be part of the
overall design.
</P>
<P>
   A pergola attached to the house raises structural issues that
may require professional engineering. An engineer will make sure
your design is stable and doesn't create places where water can
enter the house walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's freestanding and you don't have tons of weight on top,
it's probably not that big of a deal to build your own,'' Jennifer
Chandler says. ``But if it will be attached to the house or has
heavy beams on top, or if you have expansive soil, you definitely
should get it engineered.''
</P>
<P>
   Before you design, have your soil tested to learn its potential
for expansion, Chandler recommends. Clay soil, for example, expands
and contracts a lot. In yards with heavy clay, pergola posts should
be set in large concrete footings to keep the structure from
moving.
</P>
<P>
   Less-expansive rocky soil requires smaller footings. After soil
analysis, a structural engineer can tell you how large your
footings should be.
</P>
<P>
   When choosing materials for your pergola, designers recommend
taking cues from the house or garden. For pergolas attached to the
house, Ladova says, ``it's definitely best if some of the materials
and structural themes found on the house are repeated.'' To match
the home exterior, a pergola's columns might be stuccoed, shingled
or made of painted wood.
</P>
<P>
   A freestanding pergola removed from the house is better treated
as part of the garden, Ladova says. If you have lots of large
redwood or oak trees, consider a rustic design, perhaps with
branches as cross beams. In an English garden, a more romantic
approach would work, such as painting the structure white and
adding lattice detail. If you have stone walls or wrought iron in
your garden, consider incorporating those materials into your
pergola.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Chandler's stunning pergola for Long Meadow Ranch in St.
Helena includes cast-stone columns that mimic the columns on the
house, and a roof of recycled railroad timber.
</P>
<P>
   For a contemporary look and unmatched durability, consider steel
for posts and beams. Jennifer Chandler created a simple arbor on
one house by attaching sturdy brackets to the wall and stringing
heavy wire between the brackets' five-foot arms.
</P>
<P>
   Wood for pergolas can be painted or stained, pressure-treated or
untreated. Never put untreated wood posts directly in the ground,
designers say; the wood will rot without a concrete footing. For
the budget-minded, wood that has been pressure-treated with
chemicals can go straight into the ground, but Danville designer
Jill Appenzeller has safety concerns. Who wants chemical-laced
splinters?
</P>
<P>
   Redwood is a popular choice for unpainted posts and beams. Fir
and pine are better choices if you intend to paint or stain.
Appenzeller prefers stain to paint because paint needs occasional
retouching. For a painted structure, it's easier to paint first,
then build, says Jennifer Chandler, although you may want to do one
final coat in place.
</P>
<P>
   Good designers also select a pergola's floor material carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``One rule we try to stick to is not to use too many different
materials,'' Ladova says. ``If there already is brick or flagstone
around the house, we try to repeat that wherever pavement is
needed.'' When a pergola is attached to the house, it's even more
important to aesthetically link the flooring to the main structure.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever material you choose, make the pergola tall enough and
large enough to be comfortable. Jack Chandler suggests making the
posts at least eight to nine feet high, so vines don't dangle in
your face.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to feel good in this space,'' he says. ``You don't
want the room falling on your head.''
</P>
<P>
   Pergolas should be a minimum of eight feet square to accommodate
a table and chairs, Appenzeller says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything gets smaller outdoors,'' she says. That's because
outdoor furniture needs to be substantial, with at least three feet
behind each chair (and four feet is better). Decide how much
seating you want and how you'll arrange it before you decide on
pergola size.
</P>
<P>
   To create mass and architectural interest, Jack Chandler likes a
multilayer roof. One new Chandler-designed pergola in Yountville
has four tiers: two 8-by-12 cross beams topped with a layer of
6-by-8 beams, then 3-by-3 beams, then 2-by-2 beams. The layering
creates shade and a handsome appearance even without a vine cover.
</P>
<P>
   During the design phase, consider whether you want illumination.
Chandler hides electrical conduit in fascia boards that cover the
posts; these molding-like boards also give the posts more mass and
importance.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget to leave room for planting vines to climb the
pergola posts. If you intend to have container plants under your
pergola, determine your irrigation needs before you build. Ladova
recommends installing PVC pipe under the pergola floor if you
intend to drip-irrigate your pots.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, before you start any pergola project, check with your
local building department. Many may require a permit; others may
insist that your pergola be a minimum distance from the property
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just, on a whim, get a pile of wood and put some
vines on it and live happily ever after,'' says Jack Chandler. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
SIDEBAR: Plants Make It Perfect &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
When deciding what to plant on a pergola, consider exposure first.
Is the roof in sun or shade? Even on a pergola shaded by trees or a
house, you may want to plant a vine to soften the look. Choose a
shade-tolerant vine such as climbing hydrangea.
</P>
<P>
   Do you want an evergreen vine for year-round shade or a
deciduous vine that lets winter light through? To provide interest
all year, designer Jill Appenzeller recommends mixing vines _
evergreen star jasmine with deciduous wisteria or clematis, or the
evergreen  &LR; Clematis Armandii cq  &LR; with a climbing rose.
</P>
<P>
   How dense a vine cover do you want? In hot areas, you might
welcome an aggressive grower like  &LR; Jasminum polyanthum, &LR;  which can
form a thick mat on the pergola roof. In cooler areas, you might
want to let more sun through.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Several designers say they avoid ``thugs'' such as potato vine,
a vigorous plant that needs constant pruning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want tracery and some shade, but I don't want it like
night in there,'' says Oakland landscape designer Bob Clark.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  However, be sure to plant a vine vigorous enough to cover
the top eventually, if you want it to. Some clematis and climbing
roses may not make it across the roof of an eight-foot pergola,
says Napa Valley landscape architect Jennifer Chandler, but their
shorter size can be used to advantage: She uses them to make the
planting beautiful from the inside. ``What happens with many
pergolas is that it's pretty above but you have an unsightly tangle
underneath.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Vines with hanging flower or fruit clusters &LR; , such as
wisteria, kiwi or grapes, &LR;  can make the pergola as attractive to
those people under it as it is to those outside.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; With plants such as climbing roses that want to go straight to
the top to perform, Clark covers their ``bare legs'' on the pergola
posts with clematis or pots of abutilon. Wisteria also has bare
legs, but its thick, twisting trunk is part of its beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Choose vining plants suited to your climate. Some vines are
frost-sensitive and won't make it through a difficult winter.
Landscape architect Jack Chandler says he regularly battles Napa
Valley clients who want to plant bougainvillea, usually after a
visit to Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``So they plant one,'' says Jack Chandler, ``and two years
later, they say, `Chandler's wrong. It's grown like a champ.' Then
God comes along and, poof, it's gone.'' &LR;  Be aware that  &LR; heavy
vines &LR; , &LR;  such as &LR;  wisteria, need considerable support. Also ask
yourself whether you mind sharing your pergola; wisteria and
honeysuckle are bee favorites.

SENATOR WANTS PROFESSIONAL SPORTS TEAMS TO PAY FOR STADIUMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Also filed in the sports, ``s,'' category.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Professional football and baseball teams would be
required to pay for at least 50 percent of the costs of
constructing and renovating stadiums as part of legislation pushed
Tuesday by Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Specter said the measure is aimed at stopping teams from using
the threat of relocating to prod cities to build new stadiums at
public expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's legalized exhortation,'' Specter said during a Senate
Judiciary Committee hearing on the issue, citing the Cleveland
Browns football team's 1996 move to Baltimore, lured by the promise
of a $200 million stadium financed by the state of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Specter also cited his own state's decision to contribute $320
million toward four new stadiums in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh as
an example of ``legalized exhortation.'' And he referred to the
recent bidding war between Massachusetts and Connecticut over the
New England Patriots football team.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1980s, state and local governments have spent
about $7 billion to pay for new arenas for 41 professional
football, hockey, basketball and baseball teams, according to Mark
S. Rosentraub, a professor at Indiana University who studies
stadium financing. In many of those cases, the stadiums were built
to keep teams from leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Specter's legislation _ which is unlikely to be enacted, at
least in its current form _ would compel professional football and
baseball teams to place 10 percent of their television revenues
into a construction trust fund in order to maintain their federal
antitrust status.
</P>
<P>
   The fund would be used to pay for half the costs of building and
renovating stadiums. The antitrust provisions allow the teams to
equally share television revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining half of stadium costs would be picked up by
private sources _ which could include a team owner _ and states and
cities. State and city financing would be capped at 25 percent of
the total stadium price tag.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the National Football League, who testified
at Tuesday's hearing, opposed Specter's plan.
</P>
<P>
   NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said the plan would ``establish
a rigid and misguided federal approach to a particularly local
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Richardson, owner and founder of the Carolina Panthers,
noted that last month voters in Arizona rejected a new football
stadium for the Cardinals and voters in Minnesota recently rejected
a new ballpark for the Twins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stadium proposals face a great deal of publicity and spirited
debate,'' Richardson said. ``I do not understand what national
problem requires a congressional act to override the carefully
considered judgments of state and local governments, many of which
have been the subject of direct action by the voters themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Specter said state and local officials have no choice but to
kick in public money to build or renovate a new stadium when a team
threatens to move.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hold a gun to somebody's head it's not a voluntary
decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But some lawmakers, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.,
sided with the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think each community has to settle for itself the degree to
which it wants to become a part of stadium funding,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., said he favored the bill's
premise but is opposed to using football television revenue _ which
runs about $2 billion a year _ to pay for stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   He said such a mechanism hurts small-market teams, like the
Green Bay Packers, whose budgets rely on a greater portion of
television revenues than teams in cities like New York or Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   If Specter's bill were to become law, it would require teams or
the leagues to pay significantly more for stadium costs then they
do now. The Pittsburgh Pirates are to pay $40 million toward a $211
baseball park, while the Pittsburgh Steelers are to pay $76.5
million of the $233 million for theirs. Under Specter's bill, the
baseball and football leagues would have to pick up more than $100
million for each Pittsburgh stadium.

SENATOR WANTS PROFESSIONAL SPORTS TEAMS TO PAY FOR STADIUMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Also filed in the Washington, ``w,'' category.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Professional football and baseball teams would be
required to pay for at least 50 percent of the costs of
constructing and renovating stadiums as part of legislation pushed
Tuesday by Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Specter said the measure is aimed at stopping teams from using
the threat of relocating to prod cities to build new stadiums at
public expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's legalized exhortation,'' Specter said during a Senate
Judiciary Committee hearing on the issue, citing the Cleveland
Browns football team's 1996 move to Baltimore, lured by the promise
of a $200 million stadium financed by the state of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Specter also cited his own state's decision to contribute $320
million toward four new stadiums in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh as
an example of ``legalized exhortation.'' And he referred to the
recent bidding war between Massachusetts and Connecticut over the
New England Patriots football team.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1980s, state and local governments have spent
about $7 billion to pay for new arenas for 41 professional
football, hockey, basketball and baseball teams, according to Mark
S. Rosentraub, a professor at Indiana University who studies
stadium financing. In many of those cases, the stadiums were built
to keep teams from leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Specter's legislation _ which is unlikely to be enacted, at
least in its current form _ would compel professional football and
baseball teams to place 10 percent of their television revenues
into a construction trust fund in order to maintain their federal
antitrust status.
</P>
<P>
   The fund would be used to pay for half the costs of building and
renovating stadiums. The antitrust provisions allow the teams to
equally share television revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining half of stadium costs would be picked up by
private sources _ which could include a team owner _ and states and
cities. State and city financing would be capped at 25 percent of
the total stadium price tag.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the National Football League, who testified
at Tuesday's hearing, opposed Specter's plan.
</P>
<P>
   NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said the plan would ``establish
a rigid and misguided federal approach to a particularly local
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Richardson, owner and founder of the Carolina Panthers,
noted that last month voters in Arizona rejected a new football
stadium for the Cardinals and voters in Minnesota recently rejected
a new ballpark for the Twins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stadium proposals face a great deal of publicity and spirited
debate,'' Richardson said. ``I do not understand what national
problem requires a congressional act to override the carefully
considered judgments of state and local governments, many of which
have been the subject of direct action by the voters themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Specter said state and local officials have no choice but to
kick in public money to build or renovate a new stadium when a team
threatens to move.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hold a gun to somebody's head it's not a voluntary
decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But some lawmakers, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.,
sided with the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think each community has to settle for itself the degree to
which it wants to become a part of stadium funding,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., said he favored the bill's
premise but is opposed to using football television revenue _ which
runs about $2 billion a year _ to pay for stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   He said such a mechanism hurts small-market teams, like the
Green Bay Packers, whose budgets rely on a greater portion of
television revenues than teams in cities like New York or Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   If Specter's bill were to become law, it would require teams or
the leagues to pay significantly more for stadium costs then they
do now. The Pittsburgh Pirates are to pay $40 million toward a $211
baseball park, while the Pittsburgh Steelers are to pay $76.5
million of the $233 million for theirs. Under Specter's bill, the
baseball and football leagues would have to pick up more than $100
million for each Pittsburgh stadium.

SHORT ON MONEY AND TIME, RUSSIA MAY NOT MEET YEAR 2000 COMPUTER
CHALLENGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also RUSSIA-Y2K-NUKE, U.N.-Y2K) 
(rm) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Armed with thick repair manuals and rosters of
technical experts, Russian officials have opened an all-out
campaign to expel the so-called Year 2000 bug from the nation's 8
million computers, their microchips and their programs.
</P>
<P>
   But 60 miles south of the Kremlin in the little town of Stupino,
Mike Tuffs is not waiting for the victory party. Tuffs, regional
technology manager for Mars Inc., the American candy maker, asked
the regional government and utility officials last year how they
planned to deal with the problem.
</P>
<P>
   What he found was that many did not know that their equipment
was vulnerable and that others believed _ wrongly _ that they were
already protected.
</P>
<P>
   Mars has since outfitted its two Russian factories to continue
some production during power and water breakdowns, and it is
stockpiling raw materials in anticipation of transportation and
customs problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our greatest concern is for public utilities and state
organizations,'' Tuffs said. ``It would appear that many public
organizations are not aware of the equipment that they use and how
they interact and how a failure in one area will affect another.''
</P>
<P>
   What worries Tuffs also rattles the technology chiefs of other
companies, as well as computer experts and consultants. They say
Russia has awakened to the Year 2000 threat too late, spread the
alarm too thinly, and has far too little money to perform much more
than digital triage on the government and economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a potential for major damage to the infrastructure,''
said Andrei Terekhov, a mathematician from St. Petersburg and the
general-director of Lanit-Terkom, a business that works on Year
2000 problems.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulties arise from the longtime reliance of computer
programs on two-digit date designations for any year, with 19
presumed to be the preceding digits. Computers, software and
electronic devices may malfunction if they read 00 as 1900 or do
not understand that it is a date. Many programs were written by
people who have died, have dropped out sight or are working on the
problem elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are obsolete applications on which, very often, entire
factories, banks and real-time critical systems depend,'' Terekhov
said.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the potential that not much will happen.
Government officials say they are addressing all problems in
critical areas like atomic energy and nuclear missiles. American
officials said they were confident that human safeguards would
prevent accidental launchings.
</P>
<P>
   The semiprivate companies that supply power, gas and other
essential services say they are at work, too. In addition, Russia
enjoys a peculiar advantage. Because it has been slow to adopt
computer technology, many functions like factory processes can be
run manually.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Miasnikov, a representative here of the Gartner Group,
technology consultants from Connecticut, said in an e-mail posting
that most major Russian companies would solve Year 2000 problems in
their central operations, but that ``in remote branches there can
be some problems.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The government predicted in April that even if its assault on
the Year 2000 bug proceeded as planned, up to a fifth of all
computers would malfunction in January. With 56,000 government
computer systems, 16,000 of them critical, officials worry about
everything from inoperative elevators to a freeze-up in the network
that is supposed to tabulate the vote in the parliamentary election
on Jan. 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't and shouldn't say either that something is not going
to happen or speak of catastrophic outcomes,'' said Alexander
Krupnov, the chairman of the state Committee on Telecommunications
and Information Technology, which is leading the effort on the Year
2000. ``I stick to something in the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   The government effort began in earnest last fall. Regional
centers were established to certify technicians whom businesses
could hire. A government-wide inspection of vulnerable equipment
and the drafting of backup plans were ordered. American officials
familiar with the plans said Moscow was serious and focused.
Nevertheless, the problems are huge.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated two-thirds of the desktop computers need repair.
But most owners cannot be warned. Many manufacturers are out of
business or lack sales records.
</P>
<P>
   Many programs used outside big businesses are bootlegged,
illegally copied. Hundreds of military and industrial tasks rely on
decades-old programs written by programmers who may have gone to
the United States and Western Europe. And nearly everyone is too
broke to throw money at a nebulous computer bug, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The government said its repairs would cost $1 billion to $3
billion. That is up to one-seventh of a federal budget that already
cannot pay some pensions and debts.
</P>
<P>
   Most agencies have been told to raid their own budgets to solve
the problems. One expert here said some businesses were having
trouble because the Western suppliers whose equipment needs
upgrading have yet to be paid, and they are refusing to make
repairs until they receive their money.

   Much of the nation is uninterested or unaware of the threat. An
informal survey of 50 civic leaders in Irkutsk, a city of 500,000
on the Mongolian border, showed that 20 had heard of Year 2000
defects.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Lewin, a computer consultant here who also heads the
technology committee of the American Chamber of Commerce in Russia,
said:
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, contingency planning is the most important
element, developing plans on what to do if there is no water or no
electricity. There's not a lot of time left, and there's a high
likelihood of failure for some of the utilities.''

</P>
<P>
   The one area where catastrophe seems all but impossible is in
nuclear weapons. Officials say most crucial military computers,
including those in the nuclear force, use programs that are not
date sensitive, rendering them immune to Year 2000 problems.
</P>
<P>
   Russian and American officials allow that in a worst-case
scenario early warning systems could send false signals as the
satellites on which they rely drift slowly out of alignment. But
because such errors have been anticipated, the chances that they
would lead to a nuclear strike are all but nil.
</P>
<P>
   Any remaining problems are so small, officers contend, that they
can be erased with the installation soon of a mere $4-million worth
of new computers and programs.

STUDIO GIVES `IDEAL HUSBAND' MAINSTREAM PUSH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By GLENN WHIPP 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ First they gave us Shakespeare we loved. Now
Miramax _ the studio most associated with corsets, costumes and
cleverness _ wants to make us wild about Oscar Wilde.
</P>
<P>
   Don't bet against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like having a rocket behind you,'' says filmmaker
Oliver Parker, who wrote and directed an adaptation of Wilde's
play, ``An Ideal Husband,'' which began a limited engagement in New
York City and Los Angeles last Friday. The film will then expand to
the top 20 markets this Friday and to the top 60 markets July 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're able to take what some might perceive as an art-house
movie and take it into the mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's precisely what Parker was after with ``An Ideal
Husband.'' Although the play ranks as one of Wilde's lesser-known
stage comedies, Parker thought it might be the most relevant to
modern audiences.
</P>
<P>
   The parallels are certainly obvious enough. ``An Ideal Husband''
is set at the end of a century (in this case, the 19th) and
features a popular but flawed politician who harbors a dirty secret
that threatens to ruin his career. The politician's principled wife
is kept in the dark, mostly from fear of an ethical scolding.
</P>
<P>
   Call it ``Primary Colors,'' the prequel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we had to get this movie out this year,'' Parker
says. ``It's just so pertinent. And the wonderful thing about a
period piece is you can have a bit of a comment on these
contemporary events without it becoming tiresome.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Rupert Everett, who stars in the film with Cate Blanchett,
Julianne Moore, Minnie Driver and Jeremy Northam: ``Moral
repression ... political scandal. The play is like a mirror of
what's been happening the past two years in America. It's
fascinating _ people haven't changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilde wrote ``An Ideal Husband'' in 1893, when he was at the
height of his powers but also inching near the social precipice
from which he was soon to fall. The play premiered in 1895, the
same year Wilde brought a slander suit against the Marquess of
Queensberry, who had left a note at Wilde's club accusing him of
``posing as a sodomite.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilde lost the case and was then tried and convicted of ``gross
indecency.'' The subsequent two-year prison term destroyed him both
mentally and physically. He died in 1900 while living in exile in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The plea for tolerance, which is at the heart of ``An Ideal
Husband,'' undoubtedly resonated with Wilde, who was living a
double life as a homosexual in late-Victorian England.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was asking for fairness for himself, but not
exclusively for himself,'' Parker says. ``Tolerance was a quality
he demanded for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   With Wilde's background and the present-day parallels in mind,
Parker began to fashion an adaptation of ``An Ideal Husband'' that
would break what he calls the ``British stranglehold'' on the
piece. It's the same approach he used four years ago when he
brought Shakespeare's ``Othello'' to the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a bit fed up with how I've seen Oscar Wilde's work done,''
Parker says. ``In his time, his plays were very subversive and
unusual, and now people play the words for the effect and not
what's behind them. What happens is every character ends up
sounding like Oscar Wilde. It's all very witty, but, ultimately,
rather pointless.''
</P>
<P>
   You won't get any argument on that point from the film's stellar
cast, which Parker rounded up quickly once he completed the
screenplay. Producers Barnaby Thompson of Fragile Films (they gave
us ``Spice World,'' the movie) and Bruce Davey of Mel Gibson's Icon
Productions sold the distribution rights to Miramax within a couple
of days of announcing the ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I remember it, (Miramax co-chairman) Harvey (Weinstein) did
the deal in two hours,'' Davey says. ``I don't think he believed we
could get the five actors we ended up getting. When he heard we
did, he snapped it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is standard procedure, says former Miramax acquisitions
executive Treah Hoving, who brought ``An Ideal Husband'' to
Weinstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harvey doesn't take much time to make up his mind,'' Hoving
says. ``And really, this film is such a natural for Miramax. It's
intelligent, witty and classy. It has a real elegance that they've
been able to sell successfully to audiences in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, coming as it does in a summer dominated by broadly
commercial heavyweights like ``The Phantom Menace,'' ``Austin
Powers'' and ``Tarzan,'' ``An Ideal Husband'' would seem to be a
case of right-movie, wrong-time scheduling _ were it not for
Miramax's genius at making audiences notice its films. Nobody
thought the literary sensibilities of ``The English Patient'' would
make for good box-office, nor did anyone see ``Shakespeare in
Love'' making $100 million and winning the best picture Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   For better or worse, Miramax's marketers proved them wrong. And
unlike, say, Fox Searchlight, which was unable to take its recent
version of ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' beyond the art house
ghetto, Miramax is determined to make ``An Ideal Husband'' into a
crossover hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hurdle is preconception, and Miramax seems brilliant at
getting audiences beyond that,'' Parker says. ``It would be easy to
look at `An Ideal Husband' and wonder, `Is it just a funny,
old-fashioned play about a bunch of fops where nothing much
happens?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have easily been,'' Parker continues. ``But that was
certainly the last thing I wanted to make. To me, what makes the
material so exciting is that it speaks to audiences today, people
of all ages and nationalities. And that's precisely how Miramax
wants to sell the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker, however, wasn't the only one thinking about ``An Ideal
Husband.'' Two other film productions of the play were being
readied at the same time Parker was preparing his version; one, a
British movie that sets the work in modern times, made it and is
now awaiting a distributor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me a little nervous, but at the same time I thought it
might help raise our profile a bit,'' Parker says. ``Now, I needn't
worry. Miramax is doing that just fine on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the experience _ writing, directing, post-production _
has been so pleasant that Parker is considering a return to Wildean
wit with a film version of the playwright's most famous work, ``The
Importance of Being Earnest.'' Parker has already begun to write
(or ``doodle'' as he puts it) and reveals that everyone in the
``Ideal Husband'' cast has expressed a desire to return for another
go.
</P>
<P>
   ``All he would have to do is ask,'' Everett says. ``I've done
Wilde on stage, but the cinema just lends itself to the material so
much better. In the theater, you have to project your performance
for up to 300 yards, so it automatically becomes more studied and
structured. With the cinema, you can say these wonderful barbs and
epigrams as they're meant to be said, as afterthoughts that are
thrown away and spoken naturally. So I would savor the opportunity
to do it all again.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Parker: ``You can't predict if you can do it or not. But
it's hard to resist. It's just so damn good.'' &QL;

 MOSCOW: and programs.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington and Moscow also have proposed exchanging radar
information and other figures this winter to diminish the risk of
misinterpretations. Russia has said it is suspending cooperation on
Year 2000 problems to protest the United States' role in the NATO
attack on Yugoslavia. But that seems highly unlikely to affect
seriously nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Experts appear to believe that midwinter losses of electricity
or other basic services will cause hardship in many areas, but stop
short of human catastrophe. Brownouts and other breakdowns could
cause millions of dollars in damage to industrial complexes like
smelters and steel mills. Telephone and data-transmission
disruptions could leave businesses without the basic information
that they need to compile bills and settle accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The experts also are concerned about nuclear reactors and other
highly complex sites. The fear is that workers usually adept at
handling problems could be overwhelmed by four, five or six minor
failures at once.
</P>
<P>
   Russia does not depend on technology as much as the West, so the
damage could be limited. Soviet administrators sharply restricted
the use of computers. The millions of desktops, 150,000 servers and
several thousand mainframes in use are not extensive for such a
technologically muscular country.
</P>
<P>
   Although many factories operate with 1950s-technology hand
switches and analog gauges, the industrial spine _ oil and gas
pipelines, electrical grids, telephone systems and transportation
networks _ all rely on microchips and computers.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Russia and Europe's natural gas flows through the
Siberian pipeline that belongs to Gazprom, a monopoly that the
government still largely owns. The Central Intelligence Agency says
the mainframe computers at Gazprom almost certainly require
revamping, as may be the case with microchips at hundreds of remote
pumping stations.
</P>
<P>
   Gazprom officials say they can handle any problems, perhaps by
placing workers at the remote pumping stations. But the utility has
not released details.
</P>
<P>
   The electricity monopoly, Unified Energy Systems, said this
month that 17,000 of its 50,000 computers had failed to meet Year
2000 standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that by September we will be able to replace the most
important and vital parts of the system,'' a press release said.
``We will try to renovate the rest by the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   The government says that it is renovating the only two major
air-traffic-control centers that depend on digital computers, in
Moscow and Rostov-on-Don.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the 400-odd Russian aviation companies have
computers with Year 2000 problems. The International Civil Aviation
Organization is asking the Russian airlines and plane manufacturers
for information on their preventive measures. In the meantime,
Russian insurance companies raised the rates charged airline
companies in the spring in anticipation of Year 2000 risks.
</P>
<P>
   The Gartner Group, the consultants, ranks Russia among the worst
prepared nations for the Year 2000 transition. Gartner predicts a
month of turmoil in Russian financial markets, two months for
utilities and hospital and three months for transportation and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Other American specialists, though, say they believe that the
Russians will weather whatever January brings by virtue of two
proficiencies. One is their expertise in programming and
maintaining computers, a skill honed by years of military spending.
Russia may be poor, those experts say, but it has a corps of
computer technologists deserving of any Westerner's envy.
</P>
<P>
   The other advantage is the ability to deal with adversities.
Suspensions of power, water and telephone service would cripple
most Western cities. In much of Russia, such breakdowns are a fact
of life.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But many multinational companies that have conducted their own
research _ Nestle, British Petroleum and Global One, an
international telecommunications concern _ have elected to prepare
for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Mars candy executives say they expect power and telephone
blackouts in early January, followed by weeks of scheduled
brownouts as utilities try to spread power evenly throughout the
nation. To avoid any tieup of imports and exports in customs
offices, Mars will suspend international shipments around Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has begun to educate local officials and
businesses about the problem, part of a longstanding effort to
maintain good relations with Moscow and the region. The need is
there, Tuffs said. In some cases, Mars has received written
assurances from officials outside Stupino that the area is ready
for the new year, even when the company's examination proved
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Global One said the long-distance networks were
safe, but planned to beef up emergency power supplies at their
computer center downtown. Most local calls, on the other hand, are
routed and timed by a switch whose maker no longer exists,
according to Lawrence Haw, a telecommunications consultant here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not Year 2000 compatible,'' Haw said. ``There's nobody to
work on this switch. There haven't been any software upgrades.
There's no vendor for the switch anymore. So who's going to do the
upgrades?''
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop, more than a few Russian experts bridle at
the notion that their efforts may not meet Western standards. When
a top computer specialist at the Russian Federal Aviation Service,
Boris V. Mikhailovich, was asked by a reporter whether Year 2000
preparations at air-traffic-control centers were adequate, he had a
ready response.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think I am?'' he asked, ``An enemy of my own
people?''

HINGES UPSET BY A QUALIFIER AT WIMBLEDON 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ROBIN FINN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Her face was as white as the chalk lines
traced into the grass court underfoot, drained of its normal color
by a combination of rage and disbelief and the premonition that she
had seen a ghost across the net on Court One. Jelena Dokic was the
ghost of the anxiety-free girl Martina Hingis used to be at 16.
</P>
<P>
   With a backhand return that popped out of bounds at match point
like a foul ball, Hingis, the world's No. 1 player, surrendered in
just 55 minutes, 6-2, 6-0, to Jelena Dokic, a 129th-ranked
Australian qualifier who pulled off the biggest slam upset of the
Open era. Hingis had counted herself a favorite to add this year's
Wimbledon title to her 1997 championship; instead she became just
the third top-seeded woman since 1968 to falter in the first round
of a Grand Slam tournament. And Dokic (pronounced DOE-chich) thus
joined Lori McNeil, who upset Steffi Graf at Wimbledon in 1994, and
Australia's Margaret Sawyer, who stunned Virginia Ruzici in the
1979 Australian Open.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis, the teen-age champion whose mask of invincibility
developed some unflattering cracks during her loss to Graf in the
French Open final three weeks ago, was almost unrecognizable as she
disintegrated against Dokic, the world's top junior last year. The
blonde and beaming Dokic, who arrived in Sydney seven years ago by
way of Serbia and Belgrade and is coached by her father, Damir, a
truck-driver turned tennis sage, totally dominated Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I still can't believe I've beaten her,'' said Dokic,
who earned her way into the main draw by winning three qualifying
matches. Dokic also managed to shake off the embarrassing publicity
her father engendered two weeks ago at Edgbaston, where he was
thrown off the tournament grounds for drunk and disorderly
behavior. After sobering up in the local jail, Damir Dokic was
released without being arrested, and the father and daughter came
through the Wimbledon qualifying event at Roehampton without
further incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I owe him a lot; he knows what I have to work on and what I
have to fix,'' said Dokic, who received no criticism from her
father Tuesday. ``He was out of words,'' said the player. ``But
just because I've beaten Martina doesn't mean I'll win the
tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   But she's got a better chance of it than Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Hingis floundered like an amateur and let herself be
mowed down by a stream of piercing, well-placed groundstrokes from
her understudy. Hingis won only 44 percent of her first service
points, hit just one winning return, lost her serve five times and
failed to convert two break chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens to everybody sometimes,'' said Hingis, who hadn't
had it happen to her at a slam tournament since she was 14. Hingis
attributed her loss to Dokic's ``great play.'' But she nearly burst
into tears when she disclosed that she suffered through it without
the helping hand of her mother-coach, Melanie Molitor. Hitherto
inseparable, Hingis said the mother-daughter duo came to a mutual
decision to ``distance'' themselves from each other as of this
event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just decided to have a little bit of distance and probably
work a bit more on our private lives,'' said Hingis, adding that
she had no plans of finding another coach to replace her mother.
``I wanted to be more independent, not having somebody else telling
me what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis admitted that timing the split to coincide with the start
of Wimbledon was, in retrospect, too big a dose of cold turkey.
After all, it was just a few weeks ago that she cried in her
mother's arms after failing, once again, to win a French Open. It
was her mother who dragged her back onto the court for the trophy
ceremony in Paris after reminding her that ``great champions''
aren't supposed to be dwarfed by temporary disappointments. And it
was only a few months ago that, triumphant at the Australian Open
for the third straight year, she said she couldn't have captured
any of her slams, or risen to No.1 in the world, without her
mother's constant input.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt different walking on court by myself,'' Hingis said
Tuesday. And it felt much worse when she walked off it after
sharing a cursory handshake, and a sheepish smile, with Dokic.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis never found a comfort zone Tuesday. She seemed still
unsettled by the controversy provoked by her temper tantrum in the
French final, where she was booed from center court after crossing
the net to argue a line call and defiantly delivering underhand
serves on two of Graf's match points. In essence, she seemed more
concerned with putting on a non-confrontational front than putting
Dokic out of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was probably too nervous, not much believing what I can
do,'' said Hingis. Asked what went wrong with her game plan, the
formerly unflappable Hingis confessed that she wasn't sure what, if
anything, went right. Aside from winning 9 of her 10 treks to net,
she was passive as a punching bag, and Dokic betrayed no qualms
about pummeling her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She played a great match,'' said Hingis, who noticed the crowd
seemed partial to the underdog even after Dokic took control.
``They were clapping for her great shots, not against me. I just
didn't make many winners. They had nothing to clap about.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis had routed Dokic, 6-1, 6-2, en route to her 1999
Australian Open title, but Hingis was so impressed by the
newcomer's style, which unabashedly mirrors her own, that she
invited her to Trubbach, Switzerland this spring for some practice
sessions. Tuesday, Dokic, apparently as quick a study as her
hostess, showed Hingis what she'd learned there. Dokic did no less
than deal Hingis her rudest and earliest slam exit since Graf
drummed the Swiss out of Wimbledon's first round, 6-3, 6-1, in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's got all the shots in the book,'' said Dokic, ``and she
can do anything. I mean, she's No.1 in the world, but once I got
going, I played very well. Everything worked today: I knew I had to
keep it deep, play to her forehand, hit winners. I don't think
there was any pressure at all, because she's the one who was
supposed to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Hingis abruptly withdrew from the women's doubles

 &HT;    CLINTON MEETS REFUGEES, ASKS FOR PATIENCE IN RETURNING TO KOSOVO
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   STENKOVEC REFUGEE CAMP, Macedonia _ Paying tribute to the
shattered lives and resilient dreams of the ethnic Albanians of
Kosovo, President Clinton told refugees here Tuesday that his
country took a stand for its bedrock principles in striking at the
repression that forced them to flee their native land.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, he thanked several hundred of the American pilots
and air crews who backed those ideals with might by carrying out
the 78-day NATO air war that broke the spine of the Yugoslav forces
in Kosovo and opened the door through which more than a million
refugees have begun to return home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're proud of what we did, because we think it's what America
stands for,'' Clinton told several thousand ethnic Albanian
Kosovars here at the Stenkovec Refugee Camp on the outskirts of the
Macedonian capital of Skopje.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president of the United States never acts alone,'' Clinton
said, standing atop a small platform of olive green military supply
boxes and plywood. ``It is the American people who care about you,
who believe in you, who want you to be free, who want you to be
able to go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's message, pitched time and again since the start of the
NATO air strikes against Yugoslav forces and Serb police and
paramilitary gangs last March -- but never before to an audience
quite like this -- was that this was a conflict about a brutally
simple principle.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever, ever should be punished and discriminated
against, or killed or uprooted,'' he said, ``because of their
religion or their ethnic heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton received a hero's welcome at this sprawling camp of
white and khaki tents, the temporary home to the 10,000 ethnic
Albanian refugees still here anxiously awaiting the day they may
return in safety to their homes across the mountainous Kosovo
border less than 10 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and their
daughter, Chelsea, President Clinton visited with several small
groups of refugees in tents before addressing several thousand
others, many of whom chanted vigorously, ``USA! USA! USA!'' as
Clinton stood before them in light brown chinos and a green sports
shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is an angel for peace in Kosovo,'' said Astrit Ajvazi, 17,
``and it's real, I believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Said a sturdy raven-haired woman named Vjolca, ``the president
saved us -- two million people.''
</P>
<P>
   If Kosovars like Astrit, a teen-aged boy from the town of
Kamenica and Vjolca, a young mother from Gjilan, were moved by
Clinton, so was the president taken in by what he saw and heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a beautiful boy,'' Clinton said to Nerimane
Macastena, nodding toward her blonde son, Besart, 4, as the family
gathered around the president in a billowing canvas tent.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton then listened as members of the family told of the day
in May when Serb army troops surrounded their house in Pristina,
collared young Besart and placed a knife at one side of his neck
and a lighted cigarette on the other and demanded all of the
family's money.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still very much afraid,'' his mother told Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make sure families get help for their children,''
Clinton responded. ``There are some things children should never
see. Some will need extra help.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, a triumphant but somber Clinton strode toward the
makeshift dais for his remarks, holding the hands of children who
gazed up at him and beamed, their youthful eyes and weathered faces
fixed on his every move.
</P>
<P>
   Looking on was Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel R.
``Sandy'' Berger, who monitored every frightening twist and turn of
the Kosovo conflict, helped Clinton stay the course through the
darkest moments of the risky campaign and went on talk show after
talk show to defend the mission from its critics on all sides.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, though, Berger stood astride a small pile of
crushed rock and gazed out at the throngs of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the human face of what we've been fighting for for the
last three months,'' he told a reporter. ``And to see these people,
with all they've been through, and the fact that they are going to
be going home in just a few weeks, is a very moving experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Ajvazi, in fact, is already planning his return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I go tomorrow,'' he said. ``Why not? Of course, with
my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton warned the refugees, though, of the continuing dangers
of landmines -- like the ones that killed two British peacekeeping
troops and two civilians outside of Pristina on Monday -- and asked
them to be patient.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's appeal had a secondary goal of trying to keep clogged
roads into Kosovo clear of returning refugees to speed the
deployment of the 50,000-strong allied security force. Barely half
of the force of British, French, German, Italian and U.S. soldiers
had moved into Kosovo by Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give us a couple more weeks,'' said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want any child hurt. I don't want anyone else to lose
a leg or an arm or a child because of a landmine,'' Clinton said.
``You have suffered enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's cautious tone came one day after two Nepalese
Gurkhas in the British Army and two civilians died as they prepared
to dispose of unexploded munitions found in a school in Negrovce,
20 miles from Kosovo's capital of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials estimate that Yugoslav forces sowed one million
mines across the largely agrarian province, an area the size of
greater Los Angeles. A United Nations' survey found mines, booby
traps and unexploded bombs lurking in almost 800 separate areas.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton left the camp to speak to about 300 members of the NATO
peacekeeping force for Kosovo, called KFOR. He challenged critics
of the mission to absorb the meaning behind the mounting evidence
of the Serb atrocities committed in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the people of the world, when they see these horrible,
horrible stories coming out, the mass graves and all of that, just
imagine what it would have been like if we had stepped to the side
and not done what we did for the last three months,'' Clinton said,
speaking to troops from the United States and several other NATO
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton amplified on the theme hours later before pilots and air
crews at Aviano Air Base in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you for this noble endeavor,'' Clinton said, standing
before several hundred U.S. service personnel and their families
inside a large hangar at Aviano, the base for nearly 9,000 sorties
flown in Operation Allied Force -- more than one fourth of the
total.
</P>
<P>
   ``You did prove that a sustained air campaign, under the right
conditions, can stop an army on the ground, '' said Clinton, as
U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, the supreme NATO commander, looked on
in front of a huge American flag. ``You also stopped a vicious
campaign of ethnic cleansing and made it possible for us to reverse
it . . . the refugees are going back home.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remarks at Aviano wound up a week-long tour of Europe
focused on the aftermath of the allied air war and the need to
rebuild the war-torn Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   He left Aviano Tuesday night aboard Air Force One and was
expected to return to the White House early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I did not want to leave,'' Clinton told the U.S. forces at
Aviano, ``without having the chance to thank those of you who
protect our freedom every single day, who fought for human dignity,
and won its cause, in Kosovo.''

 &HT;    FOR COKE, LATIN AMERICA PROVING A SAFE HARBOR IN A GLOBAL STORM
 &HT;    325&AMP;ADDS
 &HT;    With COKE-BOX-0622.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (f) Financial categories.
 &HT;    By SHELLEY EMLING 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ It's been a bumpy ride for Coca-Cola Co. in the global
markets the last two years. The Asian economic crisis. The collapse
of the Russian ruble. And now, a health scare crisis in Europe that
threatens Coke's most valuable asset: its image.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this turmoil, however, the primary foreign market
that remains a constant source stability for the Atlanta-based
company is Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   According to analysts, the fizzy drink's outlook south of the
border is anything but flat. Although the region has suffered
economic turmoil this year, it still accounts for a fourth of
Coke's global sales volume.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, known simply as ``Coca'' in many Latin cities,
analysts say Coke's image would be hard to tarnish in countries
such as Mexico, where -- in many households -- the ubiquitous soft
drink has become as much a staple as the tortilla.
</P>
<P>
   The company's unshakable grip is due to a variety of factors:
the region's hot climate, the product's popularity with a growing
middle class, and the company's vast, highly polished network of
bottlers and distributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coke is so entrenched in Latin America and the brand is so
well-known, it's hard to beat,'' said John Sicher, editor of
Beverage Digest, an industry newsletter based in New York. ``Latin
America is a terrific market for Coke, and should remain that way
for years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say the picture's been completely rosy for Coke in
Latin America, which has felt the ripple effect of the Asian
financial crisis on its own economies over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Retail sales in Latin America grew only 7 percent in 1998, after
shooting up 12 percent the year before. In the first quarter of
1999, sales actually fell 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Coke has experienced big declines this year in Chile, Colombia,
and Venezuela -- all countries hard-hit by the global economic
crisis -- which have been offset somewhat by slight gains in
Argentina, the Caribbean, and Central America.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil, where the soft-drink giant invested $1.4 billion
between 1995 and 1997, the recession has forced many thirsty people
to migrate to cheaper brands.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the company has lost more than one-tenth of its
market share in recent months to low-cost local drinks produced by
family-owned bottlers.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the company's bottler in Brazil lowered prices on some
Coke products by as much as 20 percent in order to fight the
growing competition.
</P>
<P>
   But economists these days are almost buoyant when it comes to
Brazil, which bodes well for Coke.
</P>
<P>
   The country's stock market has bounced back, as has its
currency, after investors bailed out of emerging markets like
Brazil following the crisis that began in Southeast Asia in the
summer of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   In general, Coke is a significant leader when it comes to market
share in most Latin American countries, and analysts say the
company has plenty of room to grow.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Americans consume 890 servings carbonated
soft drinks per person a year, compared with only 259 servings in
Brazil and 332 in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question Coke has had to contend with some
difficult economic troubles in certain Latin countries, but the
potential to build consumption in this region is high, despite
what's happening in Europe,'' said Marc Cohen, a beverage analyst
for Goldman Sachs in New York.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows).
</P>
<P>
   Coke's dominance south of the Rio Grande -- where it enjoys 60
percent of the carbonated soft drink business -- is
long-established.
</P>
<P>
   But Coke had an enormous jump on its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Created in 1886, Coca-Cola opened bottling operations in Cuba,
Panama and Puerto Rico just after the turn of the century.
</P>

ALBRIGHT TO SWEAR IN HORMEL AS U.S. AMBASSADOR

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is scheduled
to swear in gay rights advocate James C. Hormel next Tuesday as the
new U.S. ambassador to Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   For Hormel, Albright's participation in the ceremony is a double
honor. Because of her busy schedule, she only occasionally presides
over such ceremonies. Also, she happens to be a former boss of
Hormel.
</P>
<P>
   When she was America's ambassador to the United Nations in 1997,
Hormel was the alternate U.S. representative and worked for her.
</P>
<P>
   Invitations to the ceremony are being sent to members of
Congress and the administration who supported Hormel's
long-embattled nomination as well as to Hormel's family and
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Last year four conservative senators put a so-called ``hold'' on
President Clinton's nomination of the San Francisco philanthropist
to take the Luxembourg post. They said they feared he would pursue
a gay-rights agenda there, but Hormel said he would not do so. The
hold blocked a vote on the nomination, which requires Senate
approval.
</P>
<P>
   But on June 4, while Congress was on a week-long break, Clinton
announced he was giving Hormel a recess appointment, which will
allow him to serve without Senate approval until the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony is set for 4 p.m. in the seventh floor Benjamin
Franklin room of the State Department, which is used for diplomatic
functions. It will last about an hour and include an oath of
office, remarks by Albright and Hormel and a reception.
</P>
<P>
   Hormel will leave for Luxembourg soon afterward to present his
credentials to his royal highness, Grand Duke Jean of Luxembourg,
according to a State Department official.

 &HT;    FOR COKE, LATIN AMERICA PROVING A SAFE HARBOR IN A GLOBAL STORM
 &HT;    325&AMP;ADDS
 &HT;    With COKE-BOX-0622.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (f) Financial categories.

<P>
   MIAMI _ It's been a bumpy ride for Coca-Cola Co. in the global
markets the last two years. The Asian economic crisis. The collapse
of the Russian ruble. And now, a health scare crisis in Europe that
threatens Coke's most valuable asset: its image.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this turmoil, however, the primary foreign market
that remains a constant source stability for the Atlanta-based
company is Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   According to analysts, the fizzy drink's outlook south of the
border is anything but flat. Although the region has suffered
economic turmoil this year, it still accounts for a fourth of
Coke's global sales volume.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, known simply as ``Coca'' in many Latin cities,
analysts say Coke's image would be hard to tarnish in countries
such as Mexico, where -- in many households -- the ubiquitous soft
drink has become as much a staple as the tortilla.
</P>
<P>
   The company's unshakable grip is due to a variety of factors:
the region's hot climate, the product's popularity with a growing
middle class, and the company's vast, highly polished network of
bottlers and distributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coke is so entrenched in Latin America and the brand is so
well-known, it's hard to beat,'' said John Sicher, editor of
Beverage Digest, an industry newsletter based in New York. ``Latin
America is a terrific market for Coke, and should remain that way
for years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say the picture's been completely rosy for Coke in
Latin America, which has felt the ripple effect of the Asian
financial crisis on its own economies over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Retail sales in Latin America grew only 7 percent in 1998, after
shooting up 12 percent the year before. In the first quarter of
1999, sales actually fell 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Coke has experienced big declines this year in Chile, Colombia,
and Venezuela -- all countries hard-hit by the global economic
crisis -- which have been offset somewhat by slight gains in
Argentina, the Caribbean, and Central America.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil, where the soft-drink giant invested $1.4 billion
between 1995 and 1997, the recession has forced many thirsty people
to migrate to cheaper brands.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the company has lost more than one-tenth of its
market share in recent months to low-cost local drinks produced by
family-owned bottlers.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the company's bottler in Brazil lowered prices on some
Coke products by as much as 20 percent in order to fight the
growing competition.
</P>
<P>
   But economists these days are almost buoyant when it comes to
Brazil, which bodes well for Coke.
</P>
<P>
   The country's stock market has bounced back, as has its
currency, after investors bailed out of emerging markets like
Brazil following the crisis that began in Southeast Asia in the
summer of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   In general, Coke is a significant leader when it comes to market
share in most Latin American countries, and analysts say the
company has plenty of room to grow.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Americans consume 890 servings carbonated
soft drinks per person a year, compared with only 259 servings in
Brazil and 332 in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question Coke has had to contend with some
difficult economic troubles in certain Latin countries, but the
potential to build consumption in this region is high, despite
what's happening in Europe,'' said Marc Cohen, a beverage analyst
for Goldman Sachs in New York.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows).
</P>
<P>
   Coke's dominance south of the Rio Grande -- where it enjoys 60
percent of the carbonated soft drink business -- is
long-established.
</P>
<P>
   But Coke had an enormous jump on its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Created in 1886, Coca-Cola opened bottling operations in Cuba,
Panama and Puerto Rico just after the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, where Coke was introduced in 1926, Mexicans today
consume some 412 Coca-Cola products per person a year, outstripping
even U.S. per capita consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials point to Mexico as an example of the strength
and success of their long-term strategy.
</P>
<P>
   During that country's peso crisis in the early 1990s, Mexican
managers decided to invest in even more new production plants --
and it paid off.
</P>
<P>
   Market share jumped from 53 percent to 68 percent. Even this
year, as sales have declined elsewhere in Latin America, they've
increased 6 percent in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coke is a symbol of purity in a lot of these places,''
Coca-Cola spokesman Bill Hensel said. ``Whenever you're in a

   You better hurry.
</P>
<P>
   The June edition of Men's Health magazine promises ``Max Muscle
by June 21.''
</P>
<P>
   It urges men to ``Get Naked, Save Your Life'' by letting her
play doctor; tells you how to ``Build Beach Arms''; tests baldness
cures, comparing Rogaine and Propecia with toupees; and offers 54
new ways to lose weight and get in shape in an article headlined
``Burn Fat Faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Men's health issues seem to be a subject whose time has come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you're not the first to make an appointment with your
doctor when something hurts, the kind of guy who discusses the
intimate parts of your body or even the kind of guy ready to make
the drastic decision to lose a few pounds _ with us, you're at
home,'' editor Christian Maguerou promises in the first edition of
the new French version of ``Men's Health.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine, which was launched in the United States in spring
1988, has a circulation of 1,525,000 in this country, and is now
published in nine languages, in 12 editions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Men's Fitness, Muscle and Fitness and Men's Journal
were launched in recent years to focus on what men need to do to
stay healthy and take better care of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Specialty magazines like Skiing, Runner's World, Mountain Bike
and Fitness Swimmer also offer health and fitness advice.
</P>
<P>
   What could a man combing through his local newsstand learn about
his health this summer? Here's a sampling of what's out there:
</P>
<P>
   Men's Health, French edition: ``Have Sex Every Day Until You
Die,'' ``Beginner's Guide to Running,'' ``What to Eat When'' and
``The Ultimate Arm Workout'' _ with a free pullout poster.
</P>
<P>
   Exercise &AMP; Health: ``Fueling Your Physique,'' ``Growing
Younger,'' ``Feets Do Your Stuff: Building Up Ankles, Toes and

HATCH PLANS BID FOR GOP PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Utah Sen. Orrin G. Hatch said Tuesday he plans to
seek the Republican presidential nomination next year, describing
his bid as a long shot but saying the country is in need of a
``moral resurgence.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, a conservative who is chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, said he is forming an exploratory committee to raise
money and to sound out support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am planning on running,'' said Hatch, who has not yet made a
formal official declaration of his candidacy but who let his
intentions be known to congressional staff members last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not ego that's causing me to do this,'' he told
reporters. ``A lot of things are left undone. There's no question
we need a moral resurgence.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, a senator since 1977 who is up for re-election in Utah
next year, conceded he was entering the crowded field of Republican
presidential aspirants rather late.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be very much of a long shot,'' said Hatch, adding he
believes there is a need for a conservative Republican at the helm
of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our country's headed for some very difficult times,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch also said:
</P>
<P>
   _ It would take ``leadership and guts'' to keep the Social
Security system solvent.
</P>
<P>
   _ He would tackle affirmative action. ``I find that quotas are
divisive because they pit one group against another and one cause
against another.''
</P>
<P>
   _ He would ``reduce the tax code from thousands of pages to a
few hundred.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, 65, is a former Mormon bishop, father of six and song
writer who has recorded love songs to his wife, Elaine Hansen.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when Republican senators and House members met in the
Capitol with the party's early front-runner, Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, Hatch complained that other candidates haven't addressed the
issues.
</P>
<P>
   But he called Bush ``an excellent candidate. ... Right now it's
his to lose,'' Hatch said. ``He'll find me a friend not an enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said so far Bush ``has run a flawless campaign. His people
are among the best in the business. I think a lot of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would consider being a candidate for vice president,
Hatch said ``it's too early to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he'd rather
that Hatch and two other Republican senators running for president
_ John McCain of Arizona and Robert C. Smith of New Hampshire _
would remain in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather that they stay here rather than run around the
country campaigning,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   But then Lott quipped, ``I've asked some of them if they wanted
a running mate. They said yes but not me.''

HINGIS CAUGHT IN A MOUSE TRAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A two-match losing streak shouldn't be the end of the
world _ unless your name is Martina Hingis, the planetary No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   And unless the two matches are the French Open final and the
first round at Wimbledon, where a 16-year-old Serbian refugee
without credentials takes maiden steps onto the revered sod and
kicks you out of town.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, as it did stupefyingly Tuesday at the Big W,
you become the historic party of the worst part _ the 6-2, 6-0
victim of a girl so far below you that she might have come out of a
coal mine: Jelena Dokic.
</P>
<P>
   Dokic had the time of her life, a big-top baptism amounting to
54 minutes of an afternoon of sunshine and clouds. Hingis got the
clouds. They didn't drip, but Hingis's eyes did at the end, as they
had 16 days earlier in Paris when Steffi Graf jolted her.
</P>
<P>
   Then, her mother, Melanie Molitor, had come onto the court to
help an unraveled Martina pull herself together _ demanded it,
really. But Tuesday, when it was ``I want my mama!'' time, Molitor,
who had reared the child to be a champion (even presciently naming
her for a great one), was absent. Never had this mom/coach/closest
friend missed one of her offspring's jousts.
</P>
<P>
   So there was more to it than just tennis. The umbilical cord had
been severed at a late date, and a teenager decided she wanted
``more independence, some distance to make my own decisions, time
for our private lives. We, both of us, made the decision last week.
We would try it. I'm here alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis never looked more alone on a tennis court. ``I was
nervous, not believing,'' she said. ``It felt different without
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, what 19-year-old hasn't yearned to get out from under
mom's wing at one time or another, especially a world-traveling
self-assured professional? But was this the time for mom to go off
with her boyfriend? Was this a lesson in self-sufficiency from a
strong parent?
</P>
<P>
   In successive days on the job, Hingis had heard the crowds roar
lustily for her opponent, 16,000 in Paris, 11,000 here at Court 1.
It couldn't have felt very good for someone who'd been the youngest
Wimbledon champ of the century 24 months ago and had lost at the
start of a major only once before, here as a 15-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so you lose unexpectedly to Graf, the aging lioness? Graf
has been around the jungle a few times. But Dokic, a qualifier with
an Australian passport ranked No. 129 with merely 13 mainstream
professional matches in her dossier and a 7-6 record? A juvenile in
her second major, whom Hingis had beaten, 6-1, 6-2, at her first,
the Australian Open five months ago? The very same Dokic who had
failed in the qualifiers of three minor tournaments earlier in the
year?
</P>
<P>
   This adds up to just about the most outrageous form-bending in
the annals of women's tennis. No. 1, owner of five major titles,
including the 1999 Australian Open, stoops to be conquered by No.
129, a Wimbledon stranger, and at the starting gate.
</P>
<P>
   It stands with _ actually above _ two other prominent Wimbledon
first-round upsets of defending champs ranked No. 1: Graf losing to
No. 22 Lori McNeil in 1994 and Manolo Santana losing to Charlie
Pasarell in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   But as an open-and-shut, hello-goodbye case, Hingis must be
acclaimed the local queen. She took a 2-1 lead. No problem. Then
she was hit off the court through the next 11 games by her
opponent's more powerful drives. Dokic served sharply to the
corners as Hingis faded, entranced.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly Hingis was in the clutches of post-Paris syndrome as
well as Dokic, a friend with whom she'd practiced at home in
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure the people here cheered a lot for Jelena,'' Hingis said,
``but it wasn't like Paris where everybody was against me. I just
didn't give them much to cheer for today.''
</P>
<P>
   Paris was a firestorm of displeasure and abuse hurled at Hingis
in whistles and catcalls as she misbehaved during the battle with
Graf. It will take a while to exorcise that tumult and anger from
her head, time she intends to take.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need a break to recover from everything,'' said Hingis.
``Five weeks until the hardcourts in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Wise move.
</P>
<P>
   So was the Dokic family move from Belgrade to Sydney in 1994,
beating NATO bombs by five years. And before that deserting Osijek,
Croatia, to elude the previous Balkan war. Sydney meant sunshine
and tennis, and a new language.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't nervous,'' Dokic said. ``I played quite well . . .
uh, all right, I played the best match of my life. It will take a
while to come down.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether she does or not, Wimbledon has its all-time debutante.
The Dokics will be watched closely, particularly her father, Damir
Dokic.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, no, not another member of the Bad Dads Club, letting the kid
support the family in the manner of Jim Pierce, Peter Graf, Stefano
Capriati, and too many others.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks before Dokic's eviction of Hingis, her old man _
apparently overserved _ was bodily evicted from the Birmingham
(England) tournament for vocally disrupting her match and insulting
club members. Shortly thereafter he was arrested, but released, not
charged, for disturbing the peace: i.e. throwing himself in front
of autos as a self-styled protest against NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis, though shaken, remained the consummate pro. She answered
all the questions and praised her adversary: ``Jelena was good,
don't forget that.''
</P>
<P>
   She wore her Cheshire cat grin. But Tuesday the longest shot,
the mouse, won.

CHILEAN PRESIDENT ANNOUNCES ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ President Eduardo Frei of Chile
overhauled his Cabinet and announced an economic stimulus package
Monday night in response to rising unemployment and increasingly
tense relations with the military.
</P>
<P>
   With less than nine months remaining in his term, Frei and his
center-left coalition government are facing a daunting mix of
economic problems stemming from a persistent drought and low
international copper prices. In the past year, the unemployment
rate rose from 5 percent to 8.2 percent as an estimated 140,000
workers lost their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, top military officers are growing restive over the
government's inability to bring home Chile's former dictator, Gen.
Augusto Pinochet, who has been under arrest in Britain for eight
months and faces possible extradition to Spain to stand trial for
human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech to the nation Monday, Frei announced new public
works projects, housing subsidies for the poor and loan programs
for farmers and small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``How easy it would be for me to pass on our problems to a
future government, which will be elected in only six months time,''
Frei said. ``But that is not an option.'' While noting that the
Chilean economy slowed by 3.2 percent over the first four months of
the year, he predicted that it would grow by up to 5.5 percent in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   The new programs do not represent a fundamental shift in
economic policy, and Frei did not announce any changes among his
top economic advisers. But before his speech he overhauled his
political and national security team, most notably replacing his
chief of staff and returning to the post of defense minister an
official who has long had good relations with the military.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the sudden and unexpected economic and political moves
were designed to shore up the government's declining credibility
and to aid the presidential campaign of Ricardo Lagos, the
candidate of the governing Christian Democrat-Socialist coalition
to succeed Frei.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had not made the political changes, the economic changes
would have lacked credibility,'' said Ricardo Israel, a political
scientist at the University of Chile. ``People were beginning to
joke that Frei was no longer president.''
</P>
<P>
   Frei's credibility problems began to look serious in April when
Gen. Ricardo Izurieta, the Army commander-in-chief, traveled to
London to meet with Pinochet and with senior British military
officials and politicians without first consulting with the
president. Izurieta also publicly asserted that Pinochet is not
guilty of charges of torture and other crimes against humanity, a
position that did not coincide with the government's, that any
trial of the former dictator should take place in Chile, not Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Military commanders became increasingly restive earlier this
month when five retired senior army officers were indicted and
arrested for the executions of 72 leftists in northern Chile
following the American-backed military coup in 1973 against the
socialist president, Salvador Allende.
</P>
<P>
   The indictments were issued by the same judge who is considering
18 lawsuits filed against Pinochet by relatives of dissidents who
disappeared. That added to the military's fears that the
83-year-old former commander will face legal troubles for the rest
of his life.
</P>
<P>
   In a response to the judge's action, Adm. Jorge Arancibia, the
navy commander, proposed the formation of a commission to
investigate past human rights abuses ``on the basis of national
unity.'' Rights advocates expressed skepticism at the offer,
especially since it came without any consultation with Frei or
other civilian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The limits of democratic rule nine years after civilians
replaced Pinochet in the presidential palace were further
underscored last week when two executives of a Chilean publishing
house were arrested and indicted under Chile's State Security Law
for publishing a book examining abuses in the country's justice
system.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts and foreign diplomats generally agree that a
military coup is highly unlikely, even if Lagos, a member of the
same Socialist Party as Allende, is elected in December.
Nevertheless, Frei attempted to shore up his tattered relations
with the military by returning Edmundo Perez Yoma, currently
Ambassador to Argentina, to the defense minister post.
</P>
<P>
   Perez Yoma won friends in the military in 1998 when he called
for an increase in military salaries. But salaries and arms
spending were frozen when he was transferred to Buenos Aires, and
the economist who replaced him in the defense ministry never
developed a close rapport with the top brass.

COURT EASES REQUIREMENTS FOR JOB-BIAS VICTIMS TO WIN DAMAGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court made it easier Tuesday for
victims of job discrimination to win extra damages from their
employers, ruling that such workers do not need to show their
boss's conduct was ``egregious.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of a woman denied a promotion because of her gender,
the court ruled 7-2 that job-bias victims need only prove that
their employer was ``recklessly indifferent'' to
anti-discrimination laws to receive punitive damages, which are
usually large amounts of money intended to punish or deter
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have concluded that an employer's conduct need not be
independently `egregious' to satisfy requirements for a punitive
damages award, although evidence of egregious misconduct may be
used to meet the plaintiff's burden of proof,'' Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
   However, in a separate 5-4 vote in the same case, the justices
said employers cannot be forced to pay the extra damages for
managers' discriminatory decisions when that conduct is contrary to
the employers' good-faith efforts to run a bias-free workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good decision for employers, in particular the part
... that says employers' anti-discrimination policies should be
taken into account,'' said Robert E. Williams of the Equal
Employment Advisory Council, an association of about 300 large
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Ireland, president of the National Organization for
Women, said the ruling means that if employers ``know or should
know that they've violated the law in discriminating against you,
then they can be hit up for punitives.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Congress amended the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to allow
people who prove they were victims of job bias to collect punitive
damages if they can show their employer acted with ``malice or with
reckless indifference'' to their rights. The amended law also set
the limit for punitive damages at $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Civil Rights Act bars job discrimination based on race,
gender, national origin and religion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Carole Kolstad was working as the American Dental
Association's director of federal agency relations in Washington
when the association's director of legislation announced his
retirement. Kolstad and another ADA Washington office employee, Tom
Spangler, expressed interest in the job.
</P>
<P>
   Despite having a lower position and less experience, Spangler
eventually won the job, and Kolstad sued. She contended that the
ADA had chosen Spangler before a formal selection process began and
that the choice was motivated by sexual bias against her.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleged that Leonard Wheat, who headed the
association's Washington office, told sexually offensive jokes at
staff meetings and sometimes used derogatory terms to refer to
professionally prominent women. Wheat strongly denied the
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, a federal jury found that the ADA had illegally
discriminated against Kolstad and awarded her $52,718 in back pay.
</P>
<P>
   However, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson disagreed with the
verdict but could not overrule it. However, he did not allow the
jury to award Kolstad punitive damages and held that she was not
entitled to be installed in the director's position.
</P>
<P>
   Kolstad appealed, and in March 1997 a three-judge panel for the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled in her
favor, writing that the jury should have been allowed to consider
punitive damages for her.
</P>
<P>
   But later that year, the entire D.C. Court of Appeals, in a 6-5
decision, sided with the ADA, ruling that Kolstad was not entitled
to punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   To recover such damages, the appeals court said, workers must do
more than show the employer intentionally discriminated against
them. They must also prove ``egregious conduct'' by their employer.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Supreme Court rejected that standard and sent
Kolstad's case back to the District Court for reconsideration.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said the lower court must consider whether Kolstad can
show that Wheat discriminated against her knowing that he was
breaking federal law. In addition, for Kolstad to receive money
from the ADA, she must also prove that the organization did not try
hard enough to create a bias-free atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Clarence Thomas
dissented from the part of the court's ruling that said a showing
of egregious conduct was not required.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist and Thomas joined O'Connor and Justices Antonin Scalia
and Anthony M. Kennedy in ruling that employers do not always have
to pay for the discriminatory acts of their managers.
</P>
<P>
   Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg
and Stephen G. Breyer dissented from that part of the court's
ruling.

<P>
   LOD, Israel _ Azmi Bishara earned a dubious distinction when he
visited a slum neighborhood here to join a demonstration of its
Israeli Arab residents on Sunday night. He became the first member
of Parliament to be shot with a rubber-coated metal bullet by the
Israeli police.
</P>
<P>
   It resembled a scene from the West Bank, where Palestinian
youths routinely clash with Israeli troops, but the battle took
place between Israelis just miles from Ben-Gurion International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   And it took place against the backdrop of a festering social
problem here, which is the marginalization of Israeli Arabs who
live in slums in the mixed Arab-Jewish cities like Lod.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli Arab population, which was courted by and voted for
Ehud Barak for prime minister last month, is certain to accelerate
its quest for civil rights during his administration. And this
incident, considered ugly by all, is a reminder at the outset that
the atmosphere is volatile.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration was called to protest the city's demolition
early Sunday morning of an Arab family's home _ one illegal
structure in a neighborhood of illegal structures, a shantytown
that has existed for two decades in an area zoned for industry.
</P>
<P>
   Bishara, whose face is well known because he ran for prime
minister during the recent election, attended in a suit and tie. He
stood in a crowd of angry young men. The protest got out of hand;
the youths threw stones, injuring five officers, and the police
beat some with riot sticks, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Without warning, Bishara said, the police let loose a barrage of
rubber-coated bullets. He was struck in the shoulder, a light
wound. A physician friend, Dr. Ziad Muhareb, who arrived to help,
was wounded more seriously and bled profusely from the face. The
shooting did not let up, so the member of Parliament and the doctor
crawled behind a car.
</P>
<P>
   Bishara said he tried several times to call the police's
attention to the injury of Muhareb, while the youths yelled: ``He's
an MP! He's an MP!'' But the police continued to shoot in his
direction, Bishara and the other demonstrators said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very depressing,'' Bishara said Tuesday. ``The police
used a disproportionately massive quantity of rubber bullets
against the demonstrators, including me. Certainly I was not
throwing stones. I don't like to believe that they shot at me
intentionally, although the fire did follow me even when I got
behind the car.''
</P>
<P>
   A justice ministry internal affairs department Tuesday opened an
investigation into the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The regional police chief, Zeev Even-Hen, defended the use of
force as commensurate with the violence of the demonstrators. He
said that five police officers were hurt in the rain of stones.
About 16 demonstrators were hurt, with 9 requiring hospital
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Even-Hen also said, ``A member of Parliament who participates in
a violent demonstration like the one in Lod cannot serve as a
shield for demonstrators who are rioting in such a way.''
</P>
<P>
   Shimon Peres, the acting speaker of Parliament, called ``any
such injury'' to a member of Parliament ``grave and irregular.'' He
also visited City Hall here Tuesday to negotiate a temporary freeze
in house demolitions and building.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't come here to denounce,'' he said at City Hall. ``I
came here to calm down these outbursts, which I'm sure neither side
wants.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident was debated on Israel radio for much of the day.
One popular and influential radio personality, Sheli Yehimovich,
challenged Even-Hen on the air to defend what she said was a level
of force _ shooting rubber-coated bullets _ that is never used
against Jewish demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, when Jewish protesters violently attacked cars
driving on the Sabbath on a main street that transects a religious
neighborhood, the police, who were also attacked, responded by
shooting water at them.
</P>
<P>
   The police official repeated that the level of force used was
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 10 Arab party members of the Parliament visited the
scene of the disturbance Tuesday, while several Jewish members of
Parliament _ including Yossi Sarid, the head of the leftist Meretz,
and Dalia Rabin-Pelossoff of the Center Party _ called Bishara to
express regrets.
</P>
<P>
   At the scene, protesters put up a makeshift tent beside a tangle
of concrete and wires, the remains of the demolished house. The
neighborhood is one of the worst in Israel, hard by a railroad,
laced with raw sewage and dangerously jerry-rigged connections
hooking up the illegal homes to electricity and water supplies.
Drug dealers have set up shop there amid the very poor residents
who have nowhere else to go.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Pinchas Idan, elected last November, plans to demolish
every makeshift house there, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions are thick in Lod, where the Arab community, about a
quarter of the population of 70,000, has watched with frustration
as new housing was built for thousands of new immigrants from the
former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Idan proposed last week that the city be severed from two of its
Arab neighborhoods. The residents do not want to cooperate with his
efforts to help them, he said, and the national government refuses
to help develop the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``This morning, the mayor wanted to come see us here,'' said
Mahmoud Muhareb, a political scientist and brother of the doctor
who was shot. ``He said he wanted a cease-fire. I said: `We are not
at war. We are your citizens.'''

 &HT;    CLINTON MEETS REFUGEES, ASKS FOR PATIENCE IN RETURNING TO KOSOVO
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   STENKOVEC REFUGEE CAMP, Macedonia _ Paying tribute to the
shattered lives and resilient dreams of the ethnic Albanians of
Kosovo, President Clinton told refugees here Tuesday that his
country took a stand for its bedrock principles in striking at the
repression that forced them to flee their native land.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, he thanked several hundred of the American pilots
and air crews who backed those ideals with might by carrying out
the 78-day NATO air war that broke the spine of the Yugoslav forces
in Kosovo and opened the door through which more than a million
refugees have begun to return home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're proud of what we did, because we think it's what America
stands for,'' Clinton told several thousand ethnic Albanian
Kosovars here at the Stenkovec Refugee Camp on the outskirts of the
Macedonian capital of Skopje.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president of the United States never acts alone,'' Clinton
said, standing atop a small platform of olive green military supply
boxes and plywood. ``It is the American people who care about you,
who believe in you, who want you to be free, who want you to be
able to go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's message, pitched time and again since the start of the
NATO air strikes against Yugoslav forces and Serb police and
paramilitary gangs last March -- but never before to an audience
quite like this -- was that this was a conflict about a brutally
simple principle.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever, ever should be punished and discriminated
against, or killed or uprooted,'' he said, ``because of their
religion or their ethnic heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton received a hero's welcome at this sprawling camp of
white and khaki tents, the temporary home to the 10,000 ethnic
Albanian refugees still here anxiously awaiting the day they may
return in safety to their homes across the mountainous Kosovo
border less than 10 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and their
daughter, Chelsea, President Clinton visited with several small
groups of refugees in tents before addressing several thousand
others, many of whom chanted vigorously, ``USA! USA! USA!'' as
Clinton stood before them in light brown chinos and a green sports
shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is an angel for peace in Kosovo,'' said Astrit Ajvazi, 17,
``and it's real, I believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Said a sturdy raven-haired woman named Vjolca, ``the president
saved us -- two million people.''
</P>
<P>
   If Kosovars like Astrit, a teen-aged boy from the town of
Kamenica and Vjolca, a young mother from Gjilan, were moved by
Clinton, so was the president taken in by what he saw and heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a beautiful boy,'' Clinton said to Nerimane
Macastena, nodding toward her blonde son, Besart, 4, as the family
gathered around the president in a billowing canvas tent.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton then listened as members of the family told of the day
in May when Serb army troops surrounded their house in Pristina,
collared young Besart and placed a knife at one side of his neck
and a lighted cigarette on the other and demanded all of the
family's money.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still very much afraid,'' his mother told Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make sure families get help for their children,''
Clinton responded. ``There are some things children should never
see. Some will need extra help.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, a triumphant but somber Clinton strode toward the
makeshift dais for his remarks, holding the hands of children who
gazed up at him and beamed, their youthful eyes and weathered faces
fixed on his every move.
</P>
<P>
   Looking on was Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel R.
``Sandy'' Berger, who monitored every frightening twist and turn of
the Kosovo conflict, helped Clinton stay the course through the
darkest moments of the risky campaign and went on talk show after
talk show to defend the mission from its critics on all sides.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, though, Berger stood astride a small pile of
crushed rock and gazed out at the throngs of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the human face of what we've been fighting for for the
last three months,'' he told a reporter. ``And to see these people,
with all they've been through, and the fact that they are going to
be going home in just a few weeks, is a very moving experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Ajvazi, in fact, is already planning his return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I go tomorrow,'' he said. ``Why not? Of course, with
my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton warned the refugees, though, of the continuing dangers
of landmines and asked them to be patient.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's appeal had a secondary goal of trying to keep clogged
roads into Kosovo clear of returning refugees to speed the
deployment of the 50,000-strong allied security force. Barely half
of the force of British, French, German, Italian and U.S. soldiers
had moved into Kosovo by Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give us a couple more weeks,'' said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want any child hurt. I don't want anyone else to lose
a leg or an arm or a child because of a landmine,'' Clinton said.
``You have suffered enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's cautious tone came one day after two Nepalese
Gurkhas in the British Army and two civilians died as they prepared
to dispose of unexploded munitions found in a school in Negrovce,
20 miles from Kosovo's capital of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials estimate that Yugoslav forces sowed one million
mines across the largely agrarian province, an area the size of
greater Los Angeles. A United Nations' survey found mines, booby
traps and unexploded bombs lurking in almost 800 separate areas.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton left the camp to speak to about 300 members of the NATO
peacekeeping force for Kosovo, called KFOR. He challenged critics
of the mission to absorb the meaning behind the mounting evidence
of the Serb atrocities committed in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the people of the world, when they see these horrible,
horrible stories coming out, the mass graves and all of that, just
imagine what it would have been like if we had stepped to the side
and not done what we did for the last three months,'' Clinton said,
speaking to troops from the United States and several other NATO
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton amplified on the theme hours later before pilots and air
crews at Aviano Air Base in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you for this noble endeavor,'' Clinton said, standing
before several hundred U.S. service personnel and their families
inside a large hangar at Aviano, the base for nearly 9,000 sorties
flown in Operation Allied Force -- more than one fourth of the
total.
</P>
<P>
   ``You did prove that a sustained air campaign, under the right
conditions, can stop an army on the ground, '' said Clinton, as
U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, the supreme NATO commander, looked on
in front of a huge American flag. ``You also stopped a vicious
campaign of ethnic cleansing and made it possible for us to reverse
it . . . the refugees are going back home.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remarks at Aviano wound up a week-long tour of Europe
focused on the aftermath of the allied air war and the need to
rebuild the war-torn Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   He left Aviano Tuesday night aboard Air Force One and was
expected to return to the White House early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I did not want to leave,'' Clinton told the U.S. forces at
Aviano, ``without having the chance to thank those of you who
protect our freedom every single day, who fought for human dignity,
and won its cause, in Kosovo.''

CLINTON TALKS TO ETHNIC ALBANIANS AT REFUGEE CAMP 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   STENKOVICH 1 REFUGEE CAMP, Macedonia _ In a sea of tents and
eager faces, President Clinton on Tuesday offered words of both
encouragement and caution to ethnic Albanians readying to return to
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's tour of this sprawling tent city near the Macedonian
capital of Skopje provided an emotional and human finale to the
president's European trip, which largely focused on the logistics
and the finances of policing and rebuilding the war-torn Balkan
region.
</P>
<P>
   The president, who was accompanied by the first lady and their
daughter, Chelsea, was enthusiastically received by the refugees,
many of whom spoke little English but still broke into cheers of
``U-S-A, U-S-A'' and ``Clinton, Clinton'' when the first family
came into sight.
</P>
<P>
   As Apache helicopters buzzed overhead, the first family,
surrounded by children, toured a portion of the camp and spoke
personally to a handful of the 10,000 refugees who remain there.
</P>
<P>
   In brief remarks to the refugees, Clinton stressed that the
United States was committed to the reconstruction effort in Kosovo,
``to helping people rebuild their lives, rebuild their communities
and then to helping Kosovo and all the countries of the region
build a brighter, more prosperous future based on the respect for
the human rights of all people.''
</P>
<P>
   But he cautioned the refugees to be careful about rushing home
before the peacekeeping forces had cleared out dangers such as land
mines or other traps.
</P>
<P>
   The dangers remaining in Kosovo were underscored this week when
four people, including two Nepalese soldiers attached to the
British army, were killed in an explosion as they cleared
ammunition from a deserted schoolhouse in a village 20 miles west
of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I ask you, please be patient with us. Give us a couple of
more weeks to take the land mines up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO peacekeeping forces must also deal with the exodus of
Serb civilians from Kosovo. The Serbs fear retribution from the
Kosovo Liberation Army and from refugees who are returning to
burned-out homes and villages.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides had said earlier this week that the president
would use the refugee camp address to speak out on the need for
tolerance among those returning to their old enemies.
</P>
<P>
   But at the camp, facing those who had been forced from their
homes, the president was silent on the issue of revenge and the
need for acceptance of the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   And later, speaking to reporters, he said he was uncertain if
the ethnic Albanians and Serbs could get along.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't know,'' he said. ``It all depends on what kind of
message the soldiers are sending. It depends on a lot of things.''
</P>
<P>
   And at the camp there were many who said they were not prepared
to let bygones be bygones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot live with those people anymore,'' said Nezar Hidori,
who was waiting on the muddy grounds for Clinton to speak. The
55-year old Hidori, sporting a cap of the professional basketball
team Miami Heat, was forced to leave his home in Pristina two
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   But he and others interviewed gave Clinton credit for the
successful outcome of NATO's 79-day bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is a big man,'' said Agrom Husseii, a barber who
spent a month in the refugee camp with his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Mineree Rexhepi, 24, said she had so much wanted to see Clinton
that she postponed leaving the camp.
</P>
<P>
   Rexhepi said she was not angry at the average Serb for what
happened in Kosovo but instead blamed their leaders, particularly
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   During their afternoon visit to the camp,the Clintons listened
to personal accounts about the hardships suffered by the refugees.
Sitting in a tent with one family, the president held a 2-year-old
boy on his lap, as he heard the story of how the family fled from a
village where 60 people were massacred.
</P>
<P>
   The family escaped to Pristina where they were beaten and they
watched as Serb troops threatened a 4-year-old boy with a knife and
lighted cigarette until the soldiers were given money.
</P>
<P>
   The president told the mother that ``you have a beautiful boy.''
She responded that the 2-year-old on the president's lap was still
afraid because of the atrocities he has witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has suffered very much. He has seen people killed and
wounded,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The president told her, ``we have to make sure families get help
for their children. There are some things that children should
never see.''
</P>
<P>
   Before arriving at the refugee camp the president met with the
leaders of Macedonia and Albania, the two nations bordering Kosovo
that housed most of the refugees. Clinton promised the leaders of
these Balkan nations that the United States would continue to
provide economic aid as well as encourage business development in
their relatively poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady attended a ceremony in Macedonia, where the
president of Liz Claiborne announced that the New York-based
clothing company would keep open its operation in Skopje, saving
3,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with refugees, the president spoke to the
peacekeeping forces in Macedonia and then headed to Aviano Air
Force Base in Italy to thank the pilots who flew most of the
bombing missions over Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   At his last stop before returning to Washington, Clinton told
the cheering pilots and their families gathered in a hangar that
they deserved credit for stopping the Serb campaign of ethnic
cleansing. He also said that they proved wrong the critics who said
the conflict could not be won through an air war.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton also said that the peacekeeping phase will require
as much effort as the military campaign and may be as dangerous, as
evidenced by the death of soldiers this week, who were searching
for land mines when an unexploded NATO bomb detonated.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one thinks it (peace) will take hold without difficulty,''
he said. ``We have to win the peace with the same qualities with
which you won the conflict _ with determination and patience ,with
discipline and precision.''

 &HT;    BUSH GREETED AS A HERO IN FIRST CAPITAL VISIT AS A CANDIDATE
 &HT;    710&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush moved through the capital
Tuesday in an atmosphere of triumph more befitting a campaign
victor than a fledgling candidate, receiving a hero's welcome from
Republican congressional leaders before appearing at a Texas-sized
presidential fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours after deriding Vice President Al Gore as a
``Washington, D.C. man'' at another fund-raising appearance in
Richmond, Va., the Texas governor strode into private meetings with
32 senators and 100 House members with an insider's flair.
</P>
<P>
   If there was any worry in the Bush camp that the ``compassionate
conservative'' might be tainted by the hard-hearted image of the
GOP-run Congress, it was hardly apparent in the governor's
pilgrimage to the Capitol, his first since declaring his intention
to seek the GOP presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   And if there was any concern among Bush advisers about the
anti-Washington candidate being embraced by the Washington
establishment, it was lost in the scramble to join Tuesday night's
$1,000-a-person reception, the biggest presidential fund-raiser
ever held here.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told reporters after his meetings with the lawmakers, ``I
believe I'm going to be here to work with them for tomorrow. I know
I've got a long way to go, but I'm really pleased with the support
I've received inside this building. And the best way to convey my
thanks is to look each in the eye and say, 'Thank you very much.'
``
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., a longtime political ally of Bush's
father, former President George Bush, escorted the governor around
the Capitol. Coverdell told reporters that the senators with whom
the governor met share his views on cutting taxes, reforming Social
Security and education and rebuilding the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our visions of the future and the new millennium are very
homogeneous,'' Coverdell said.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen Republican senators and 114 Republican House members
have endorsed Bush's candidacy, an unprecedented showing of
congressional support this early in the nominating process with 13
other candidates, including three senators and one congressman,
seeking the party nod.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas said Republicans up and down
the ballot will have to stick together next year if they want to
recapture the White House and avoid a Democratic takeover of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it would be productive for members of Congress
to run a campaign isolated from the presidency,'' Hutchison said.
``What we have to do is convince the American people that if we
elect a Republican president and a Republican Congress, we are
going to do the things that people believe are right.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party leaders used Bush's visit to the Capitol to
link him to unpopular legislative priorities of the Republican-led
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although he hasn't said much about his ideas, when you press
him for specifics, Bush follows the far-right GOP Congress more
than he leads it,'' said Democratic National Committee General
Chair Roy Romer.
</P>
<P>
   But polling data suggests Americans like Bush more than the
Republican leadership of Congress. In the latest CNN poll, 54
percent said they preferred Bush over Gore, the Democratic
front-runner, but only 36 percent said they favored the GOP
continuing to control Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk to Bush is that he gets too close to the Republican
Congress,'' said William Schneider, CNN's senior political analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps reflecting this assessment, Bush did not pose for
photographs with the party's congressional leaders, and he stood
alone at a microphone outside a Senate hearing room for his brief
comments to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from Tuesday night's fund-raiser, however, Republicans
are not shying away from Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The 425 sponsors of the Bush reception at the Washington
included many of the city's most powerful and influential
lobbyists, as well as many former officials from the presidencies
of Bush's father and Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   The event was expected to raise more than $2 million, which
would make it the largest fund-raiser ever by a presidential
candidate, and especially a candidate who, as Bush has done
recently, derides the ``zero-sum politics'' of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, the millionaire publisher who is financing his own
campaign for the GOP nomination, criticized the Bush fund-raiser
and accused the governor of ``becoming inextricably intertwined''
with ``Washington fat cats.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush gained a new challenger Tuesday as Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah
joined the GOP contest, telling reporters that he was entering the
race even though he considers himself ``the longest of long shots''
at this ``late stage'' of the White House campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said Bush ``seems to have it all,'' but said he intended
to position himself as a viable conservative alternative if the
Texas governor should falter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something happens to George W. Bush, I don't know if we
would have an alternative who could beat Al Gore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his Richmond stop earlier Tuesday, Bush directed his
anti-Washington rhetoric Tuesday squarely at Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a Washington, D.C. person,'' Bush said in response to
reporters' questions. ``He thinks Washington has got all the
answers. I don't. I believe the answers are found in our
communities. I believe the answers are found in faith-based
institutions, in community organizations.''

   NAVAL WEAPONS STATION CONCORD, Calif. _ In the midst of World
War II, an explosion at the naval base here killed 320 men, two
thirds of them black sailors who had been loading 5,000 tons of
ammunition onto ships. The blast, on the Sacramento River northeast
of San Francisco, tore two ships to shreds and was felt as far away
as Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   It also began an extraordinary legal battle over the legacy of
segregation that is now, 55 years later, heading for the White
House. After the accident, black sailors were ordered to resume
loading ammunition onto ships bound for the Pacific theater. Fifty
refused, were court-martialed, found guilty of mutiny by an
all-white panel and imprisoned. All of the sailors who had been
doing the loading at the time of the blast, including the 50
ultimately convicted of mutiny, were black.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington on May 27, lawyers for one of the sailors, Freddie
Meeks, now 79, filed a petition for a presidential pardon, arguing
that Meeks and the others had had no intent to mutiny. The lawyers
argue that the sailors were simply afraid that they, too, would
become victims of a careless Navy that used black sailors on the
base only as laborers and gave them no training in loading
munitions.
</P>
<P>
   The pardon request is now before the Justice Department, which
will review it and make a recommendation to President Clinton. One
of Meeks' lawyers said it could be as long as 18 months before a
presidential decision is made but that he hoped it would be sooner
because of his client's poor health.
</P>
<P>
   Meeks' petition presents an awkward choice for Clinton between
the racial symbolism of a case that has been gaining attention in
recent years and the military's view that servicemen, particularly
in time of war, cannot choose which orders to obey.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the president's decision, Meeks' pardon application is
very likely to be the last legal move in a case that has threaded
through the nation's modern race history. It helped propel the
integration of the Navy and, some historians say, influenced
President Harry Truman's decision to issue an order formally
desegregating the military in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   In 1944 at the Naval Weapons Station Concord (which at that time
was known as Port Chicago), white officers directed black crews in
loading the ammunition, and black survivors of the blast said the
officers sometimes had their crews compete to see which could load
explosives faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all these years, the world should know what happened at
Port Chicago,'' Meeks said the other day in his Los Angeles living
room. ``It should be cleared up that we did not commit mutiny, and
we were charged with that because of our race.'' Meeks, a seaman
2nd class at the time of the explosion on July 17, 1944, is
believed to be one of only a few survivors among the 50 convicted
mutineers.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution gives the president the power to pardon. No
hearing is permitted and there is no appeal, which, lawyers say,
means that applications are judged subjectively. The president may
grant the pardon, deny it, or close the case without presidential
action. But few cases, some lawyers say, are as difficult to
predict as Meeks'.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is very committed on race,'' said Michael Small,
a former senior Justice Department lawyer who is now chief counsel
of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California. ``But
there could be an uproar in the military. I can imagine people
saying, `Clinton is saying it's OK to countermand orders.'''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether the Pentagon will modify the position it
expressed as recently as 1994 that the Port Chicago mutiny
convictions should stand. Navy officials did not respond to recent
requests for comment. A spokeswoman for the Justice Department said
the department would not comment on a pending case. White House
spokesman Jake Siewert also said there would be no comment on a
pending case.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, some veterans have said the Port Chicago men had
not been subjected to any greater dangers than sailors and soldiers
who fought in the war, and should have followed orders.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, after Congress directed the Pentagon to review the Port
Chicago case, the Navy concluded that ``the convictions were not
tainted by racial prejudice'' and declined to expunge the
convictions. ``Sailors are required to obey the orders of their
superiors, even if those orders subject them to life-threatening
danger,'' said Defense Secretary William Perry in a 1994 letter to
Congress on the Port Chicago case.
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 Navy review did acknowledge that racial prejudice had
influenced work assignments in World War II, when the Navy was just
beginning to change its tradition of using black sailors primarily
as laborers and mess attendants. But the Navy said the mutineers
had already been given leniency; they received sentences of up to
15 years but served only a maximum of 17 months, and they rejoined
regular Navy units afterward. All except those who committed later
offenses were eventually discharged ``under honorable conditions,''
which does not carry the recognition of an honorable discharge.
</P>
<P>
   As the war continued, the military was under growing pressure to
abandon its practice of using blacks in menial jobs. Half a century
later, some federal agencies accept that conditions at Port Chicago
were dangerous and discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1944 the Navy did not have a clear definition of how
munitions should best be loaded,'' says a National Park Service
brochure discussing the dangers the black sailors faced. The
brochure is given to visitors to a memorial at the site of the
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many people,'' the brochure adds, ``the explosion on July
17, 1944, became a symbol of what was wrong with American
society.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1944, the Port Chicago explosion was front-page news across
the country, and the mutiny trial that fall was followed closely.
After the black sailors had completed the gruesome task of removing
the unrecognizable victims of the explosion, they were assigned to
a nearby base, Mare Island, and ordered to resume loading
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   At first, 258 black sailors said the conditions remained
dangerous and they refused. Eventually, 208 of those returned to
work, leaving the 50.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am willing to be governed by the laws of the Navy and do
anything to help my country win this war,'' Meeks said in testimony
at the time. ``I will go to the front if necessary, but I am afraid
to load ammunition.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s and since, the Navy has said the refusal to obey
orders could have had a devastating effect on the war and that any
member of the armed services would have been dealt with harshly,
regardless of race. But instead of charging the black sailors with
disobeying an order, a lesser offense, the Navy brought the more
serious charge of mutiny, because it said it had evidence that they
had joined together to resist the orders of their officers.
</P>
<P>
   In an unsuccessful appeal of the convictions, Thurgood Marshall
represented the men two decades before he joined the Supreme Court.
If anything, Marshall said, the men were guilty of disobeying an
order. ``I can't understand, then, why, whenever more than one
Negro disobeys an order, it is mutiny,'' Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   An inquiry by the Navy within days of the explosion did not fix
a specific cause but suggested that rough handling or the
combustion of a super-sensitive device could have contributed. Here
on Suisun Bay, where the Sacramento River widens on its way to the
Pacific, the Navy has for decades loaded ships with everything from
small-arms ammunition to large bombs.
</P>
<P>
   In the papers they filed May 27, Meeks' current lawyers, G.
Brian Busey and Bernice Harleston of the Washington office of
Morrison &AMP; Foerster, repeated many of Marshall's assertions of
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Handling the case without fee, the lawyers have added new
evidence, including a memorandum of the commandant in charge of
Port Chicago that said many of the black sailors ``are of a low
order of mentality, and as such are particularly susceptible to
group influence and to believe wild rumors.''
</P>
<P>
   The town of Port Chicago, near the base, was razed in 1968 when
the Navy bought the land, so there are few reminders anywhere of
what happened here.
</P>
<P>
   In time, Meeks said in the recent interview, the explosion and
its aftermath were forgotten, and he was grateful for the
anonymity. His own sentence of 15 years had been reduced to 17
months, but he needed to work to support his wife and three
children and he worried about the stigma of being a convicted
mutineer.
</P>
<P>
   He worked for a time as a butler for entertainer Danny Thomas
and actress Ann Sothern, and later as a stock clerk for Los Angeles
County and a security officer. Until a few years ago, he said, he
did not mention Port Chicago to anyone, including his children. In
the 1950s he burned papers he had that mentioned the case so no one
would learn the indignities he had suffered, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But then, in the 1980s, the Port Chicago story was rediscovered.
A sociologist at the University of California, Dr. Robert L. Allen,
wrote a book, ``The Port Chicago Mutiny'' (Amistad, 1989). Rep.
George Miller, D-Calif., whose district includes the naval station,
began pressing for a review of the case.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, partly as a result of those efforts, the National Park
Service dedicated a memorial to the 320 men killed in the
explosion. Of those, 202 were black. In March, a television movie
told the Port Chicago story.
</P>
<P>
   After all the years, Meeks said, Port Chicago has become, once
again, a subject he cannot avoid. ``It hurt me so bad to talk about
it, I cried,'' he said, as his wife of 59 years, Eleanor, hovered
near him in the living room of their tidy stucco home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing you think about,'' he said in a low voice, ``is how
you were treated.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeks, now blind in one eye and suffering from heart disease and
diabetes, said he is running out of time for a review. His lawyers
say they have been able to find only one other survivor among the
50 court-martialed sailors, Jack Crittenden of Montgomery, Ala.,
who said he wanted no part of a pardon application.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Crittenden, a retired Alabama
official, said it was too late for a pardon to do anyone any good.
``I know they did me wrong,'' he said. ``I don't need them to say
that.''
</P>
<P>
   A pardon for Meeks would be a largely symbolic move to correct
the historical record.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers who have handled pardon applications say the process
requires legal arguments and supporting documents like those used
in a typical court case. At the same time, they say, the fact that
it is also a political process means the president can make his
decision on little more than a feeling about the message a pardon
would send.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the lawyers' standpoint,'' said Dennis Curtis, a
professor at Yale Law School who has handled pardon applications,
``it's like any other case, and then it's not like any other case.
The rules are, you have to have a narrative that is persuasive.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 17, Allen, whose book helped revive interest in the Port
Chicago story, visited the site of the explosion on the naval base
with a reporter. When he is here, Allen said as a breeze blew off
the Suisun Bay, he remembers the stories told to him by the black
sailors of Port Chicago, many now dead.
</P>
<P>
   The water lapped the pylons of the pier that was destroyed that
day, 55 years ago in July. ``I think about how horrible it must
have been to be here that horrible day,'' he said. ``And then,
being put back in that same situation three weeks later; and these
men _ these teen-agers _ having to decide what they were going to
do.''

WHERE'S THE BEEF? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Is it over already?
</P>
<P>
   Of course not. Not a soul has yet cast a ballot. New Hampshire
and Iowa have not spoken. So how come everybody thinks it's a done
deal?
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore have just
announced their presidential candidacies. But to hear the pundits
tell it, we might as well skip the campaign, go directly to the
conventions and then escort Bush into the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The common wisdom holds that both Bush and Gore have their
respective nominations sewed up. They are behaving that way
themselves, competing against each other for the political center,
the campaign fund-raising prize and the lead in the polls. This
election is perceived as a two-man race before the primaries and
caucuses have even been held.
</P>
<P>
   The party conventions are more than a year away, and the common
wisdom has been wrong before. Not much has happened yet.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats tell the pollsters they overwhelmingly prefer Gore
to his single primary rival, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey
_ by 59 percent to 21 percent. Since Bradley is about the only
politician in America with a reputation for being more wooden than
Gore, the ratio is unlikely to change much.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's two strongest primary challengers, Elizabeth Dole and
Arizona Sen. John McCain, are similarly far behind. Compared with
the roughly $20 million Bush is expected to raise by the end of
June, Dole and McCain expect around $4 million apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody else is even on the national radarscope. If Steve Forbes
intends to catch up, he will have to spend more of his own millions
than he has been willing to so far.
</P>
<P>
   So we are left with Bush running against Gore and we are into
the general election campaign way ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Can we sustain our interest in this dull duo for another year
and a half?
</P>
<P>
   There's a considerable, if premature, basis for the conclusion
that Bush will win. Thus far, he is outpacing Gore in centrist
moves, fund-raising and poll numbers, the big three tests of the
campaign. Gore can't seem to do anything right lately.
</P>
<P>
   A new Reuters poll has Bush with 55 percent support and Gore
with only 37 percent, roughly the same split as a couple of months
ago before both began campaigning in key states.
</P>
<P>
   The curious thing about Bush's lead is that other polls indicate
a majority of voters still say they don't know very much about
either man despite their public careers. They like what they don't
know about Bush better than what they don't know about Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's announcement came across on television better than
Gore's. Where Bush seemed genial and at ease, Gore shouted and
appeared uncomfortable. Gore had to distance himself from Clinton,
not an easy task, whereas Bush simply had to be Bush the younger.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's father, the former president, initially had Gore's
job-transition problem when he ran in 1992 after eight years in the
shadow of President Ronald Reagan. Bush was tense and uptight,
although he eventually relaxed and won the election. It cannot be
easy to shift from a low-key role in second place to the intense
scrutiny of a presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, both Gore and George W. Bush speak a bit in
Spanish, demonstrating that neither intends to concede the Hispanic
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Style, however, is only part of the story here. Both candidates
come from patrician backgrounds. They are pampered sons of the
political elite who earned their own way, Bush in business and Gore
in public service. The stylistic differences between them are
superficial.
</P>
<P>
   But the money matters a great deal, because it symbolizes the
extent to which the party establishments have signaled their
approval. It also buys a lot of television time. It puts them on
equal footing as frontrunners. In the end they are expected to
raise about $50 million each.
</P>
<P>
   The substance of what the two men are beginning to say will
matter even more.
</P>
<P>
   Bush needs to sound safe, a harbor of moderation preserving
conservative values while rejecting the extremist pressures
engulfing the Republican Party and threatening to wipe out GOP
control of Congress. Gore needs to sound dignified and truthful, a
believer in the progressive programs of President Clinton but one
who has none of his personal behavior flaws that so embarrassed the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath those general goals are basic philosophical differences
only now emerging. Bush and Gore may be middle-of-the-road captains
not eager to rock any boats, but one is clearly a conservative and
the other a progressive.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is terribly evasive. He wants to be all things to all
voters, a devious approach that got Bill Clinton elected but will
be hard for Bush to sustain.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the governor says he won't ask for an
anti-abortion pledge from any new Supreme Court nominee but will
pick those who share his philosophy _ which is anti-abortion. He
has not taken a stand on campaign finance reform, financing of
Medicare or the humanitarian foreign policy behind the NATO air
strikes in Kosovo. He will be asked.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is stuck with Clinton's policies and programs. It is easier
to be fresh, if evasive, than having to make the stale sound novel.
The best Gore can do is expand, revise or upgrade Clinton's
message. He cannot stray too far without seeming disloyal.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. The campaign begins. Surprises await.

 &HT;    Q&AMP;A: Greg Stromberg, Mindspring Biz
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Monday, MindSpring Enterprises launched a separate
division for its small-business users called MindSpring Biz. Made
up largely of staffers from the company's recent Netcom
acquisition, MindSpring Biz hopes to become a leader in
small-business Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Stromberg, executive vice president of MindSpring Biz,
talked recently about the new division.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's behind the launch of MindSpring Biz?
</P>
<P>
   A: We were thinking about MindSpring Biz before. We did have
some small-business customers, but our primary focus was always on
individual customers. Netcom was more focused on the business
customer than MindSpring had been. With their Web hosting,
dedicated access and other infrastructure, we saw an opportunity to
stake a claim in a market niche that was not being served _ the
small-business marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You're also going to offer high-speed telephone Internet
access.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Our agreement with Kovad Communications, will provide
sDSL, (synchronized digital subscriber lines), high-speed Internet
service starting in Atlanta, Dallas, Los Angeles and San Francisco.
Right now we haven't announced pricing, but we will have a product
offering that will be very affordable for small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you see the small-business Internet market right now?
</P>
<P>
   A: I really believe this is going to change the way people do
business. People are gaining confidence in the Internet. What we're
evolving to is a really focused Internet market economy. The
Internet is changing the definition of a small business. You used
to need a physical storefront to be a small business. Now your
storefront is an electric one.

TOP AGENT LOSES ROLE AT ICM TALENT AGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ For decades, Sam Cohn had been the premier film
agent in New York, a shrewd, cantankerous and somewhat eccentric
figure who represented some of the biggest movie stars and
filmmakers in the business.
</P>
<P>
   Now, International Creative Management, a top talent agency,
plans to announce that Cohn, 70, will be replaced as the head of
its New York office by Esther Newberg and Amanda ``Binky'' Urban,
who run the agency's literary division. He will continue to
represent such clients as the writers Arthur Miller, John Guare and
E.L. Doctorow and the actors Paul Newman and Vanessa Redgrave.
</P>
<P>
   During his heyday in the 1970s and '80s, Cohn's clients included
Robin Williams, Mike Nichols, Woody Allen, Meryl Streep and Whoopi
Goldberg, but except for Allen, who went to the William Morris
Agency, all have shifted to ICM's chief rival, the Creative Artists
Agency. The bulk of film agents are in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But Cohn is cut from a different cloth than most agents. He
detests Los Angeles, often refuses to respond to phone calls and
views himself more an intellectual than the kind of slick, Armanied
dealmaker now commonplace in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, Jeffrey Berg and James Wiatt, the two men who run ICM,
said the change marked, in some ways, a generational shift at ICM's
New York office. ``The appointment reflects our desire to bring in
a new group of senior executives who are also leaders in their
professional fields,'' Berg said. Privately, agents said that
relations between Berg and Cohn had turned rancorous in recent
years, partly over cost-cutting efforts in New York and Los
Angeles. By some accounts, Cohn resisted those efforts in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement with Berg and Wiatt, Cohn, a partner at the
agency and until recently a vice chairman, has sold his equity
stake, which is valued at $6 million to $7 million, people involved
in the negotiations said. He will remain a member of the board.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn said over the phone: ``Nothing's really happened. I had
sold my shares. I'm remaining with the company. I'm changing my
management role. That will be conferred on other people, namely
Binky and Esther, who'll do a fine job.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if relations with Berg had anything to do with the move,
Cohn said he would have no comment. And asked how he felt about
relinquishing his management role, he replied: ``Sic transit
gloria.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to replace Cohn with two literary agents makes
clear that ICM is responding to the fact that Los Angeles, and not
New York, dominates the movie and television landscape, while New
York is the center of the publishing business.
</P>
<P>
   And the film business is undergoing some turmoil. Like other
talent agencies, ICM has begun to cut back overhead costs, partly
because many Hollywood studios have trimmed film production.
Several ICM agents in New York and Los Angeles have been laid off.
</P>
<P>
   ICM is one of the most powerful film and television talent
agencies in Los Angeles. Its film-star clients include Mel Gibson,
Julia Roberts, Meg Ryan, Denzel Washington, Eddie Murphy and
Michelle Pfeiffer. It also represents such filmmakers as James
Brooks, Francis Ford Coppola and Nora Ephron, and television
producers like the creators of ``Friends,'' Kevin Bright, Marta
Kauffman and David Crane.
</P>
<P>
   Even New York-based actors now generally retain agents in Los
Angeles, which is a far cry from the '70s and '80s. One of the
handful of remaining New York-based film agents is ICM's Elaine
Goldsmith-Thomas, whose clients include Ms. Roberts and Spike Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Newberg, 57, who represents such writers as Patricia
Cornwell, Carl Hiaasen and Pete Hamill, said that she and Ms. Urban
would oversee a team of 50 agents in New York, involved mostly in
literary, music and television commercial work. ``Our primary
responsibility is representing our individual writers,'' Ms.
Newberg said. ``We have terrific people running each division.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Urban, 53, whose clients include the writers Toni Morrison,
Richard Ford and Cormac McCarthy, was on vacation in Europe and
unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Wiatt, the co-chairman of ICM, said that the promotion of Ms.
Newberg and Ms. Urban to run the New York office was ``a
recognition of their stature.''
</P>
<P>
   To clients, associates and studio executives, Cohn has had a
reputation for sometimes offbeat behavior that amuses some and
irritates others. He is said to be very picky about whom he speaks
to over the phone, sometimes snubbing movie executives and even
fellow ICM agents. His tendency to eat paper when nervous has been
used as a joke in film comedies of his clients.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn is also known to have an antipathy to Los Angeles that
rivals Allen's. And associates have said that he far prefers
attending the theater in New York or music recitals than going to
movies, unlike most agents in Los Angeles.

 &HT;    CISNEROS DEFENSE CHALLENGES CREDIBILITY OF EX-MISTRESS
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorneys for former Housing and Urban Development
Secretary Henry Cisneros tried Tuesday to chip away at the
credibility of his ex-mistress, Linda Jones, by suggesting she
intended to use 88 secretly recorded tapes to inflame the scandal
over their affair so she could cash in on book and movie deals.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, testifying for the second day in a pretrial hearing,
responded that she had no recollection of such plans beyond seeking
paid appearances on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really read the legal things,'' she said when defense
attorney Brendan V. Sullivan Jr. produced a contract in which Jones
agreed to give two lawyers 25 percent of any revenues from selling
her story about her seven-year affair with Cisneros.
</P>
<P>
   Looking over the contract, Jones said, ``I would sign it. I
don't know that I always read everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan then produced a book manuscript, saying, ``Do you
recognize this?'' Jones looked it over and told him that she
believed her former attorney Bruce Magness from her home town of
Lubbock, Texas, had written it from notes she jotted down. ``I've
never seen this in this form,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange came as part of the defense effort to persuade U.S.
District Judge Stanley Sporkin to suppress the recordings.
Prosecutors want to use 34 of the tapes to help prove that Cisneros
lied to the FBI and conspired to hide more than $250,000 in alleged
``hush money'' he paid to Jones _ then known as Linda Medlar _ when
he was undergoing a background check for his housing post.
</P>
<P>
   He served as housing secretary from 1993 until his indictment in
1997, which came out of an investigation by independent counsel
David Barrett.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who is currently serving a 42-month prison term in
Carswell, Texas, for bank fraud in a case involving Cisneros's
payments, testified earlier that she had secretly taped her
conversations about money with Cisneros because of her financial
worries and her desire to have a record of his promises.
</P>
<P>
   She said she had duplicated the recordings and edited out
portions of five or six of the copies while discarding the
originals. She said the conversations she deleted were chiefly
those in which she threatened to expose the truth about Cisneros's
payments to her. Her lawyers had advised her those remarks could be
construed as extortion, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys, who have charged that her tampering makes the
tapes inadmissable as evidence, are expected to continue to try to
pick away at Jones's credibility Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The judge indicated late Tuesday that the government had yet to
make its case that the tapes should be admitted as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a little imprecision here,'' Sporkin said in a
reference to the prosecution's tall stack of transcripts plus three
boxes of the tapes. ``I don't know what they want out of these
records.''

 &HT;    Fundamentals the key to a good goalie
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An NHL goalie of some note once was drafted in the
10th round, traded for one Stephane Beauregard and thought that he
had suffered the ultimate humiliation by being left unprotected in
the expansion draft _ until he proceeded to go unselected in the
same draft.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Dominik Hasek turned out OK.
</P>
<P>
   Such a career evolution, while extreme, is not atypical for many
NHL goaltenders. For that reason, the Thrashers' attempt to zero in
on worthy netminders available in Friday's expansion draft is only
slightly more scientific than a dart game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the hardest position to predict,'' Thrashers goaltending
consultant Andy Moog said. ``If you have a forward who is 6-2, 220
and is scoring 50 goals a year in the juniors, you can pretty much
project what he's going to do in the NHL. But sometimes the best
goalies are buried on team's rosters. Maybe he doesn't have great
statistics, but he's not in the best situation and he's not getting
a lot of playing time.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what you try to do,'' Moog said, ``is look for the guy with
the best fundamentals. So many things can affect a goalie's
performance, but if the fundamentals are there, then you know
eventually he'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the expansion draft ends, the Thrashers probably
will be in possession of six veteran goaltenders. They acquired
probable starter Damian Rhodes last week from Ottawa in exchange
for ``future considerations.'' In return, they agreed to draft a
Senator only from a list provided by the team.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is required to take at least three goaltenders in the
draft, but it probably will take five, the maximum allowed. Rhodes'
projected backup probably will come from Detroit, where 24-year-old
Norm Maracle is considered by some to be a future NHL star. Top
candidates for the remaining four spots are Carolina's Trevor Kidd,
San Jose's Mike Vernon, Boston's Robbie Tallas and St. Louis' Jamie
McLennan.
</P>
<P>
   Waddell, who was a business major, views players as ``assets,''
and Vernon and Kidd, in particular, are two worthy assets. The
Thrashers probably would not keep either but instead would work out
trades with the players' former teams _ or elsewhere _ for extra
players or entry-draft picks. Vernon also has a clause in his
contract allowing him to become an unrestricted free agent in July,
further clouding his status.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said all along that, if you're an average hockey team
with a good goaltender, you're going to steal games,'' Waddell
said. ``An average team with average goaltending is going to have a
hard time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goaltending is the strength of the expansion draft,'' he said.
``We're not going to get a lot of goal-scoring in the expansion
draft. That's going to have to come from the entry draft and
potentially some European players.''
</P>
<P>
   Moog, who has watched Rhodes a dozen times in the last few years
as an opponent or a scout, thinks he has the style that will enable
him to avoid prolonged slumps. He also thinks Rhodes (22-13-7, 2.44
goals-against average) was hurt last season by the Senators'
decision to rotate him with Ron Tugnutt.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a time in everyone's career where (rotating goalies)
is a good fit if it complements both players involved.'' Moog said.
``But that's not a career-long situation. I was in the same
situation (in Edmonton), and I felt I needed to be challenged and
that's what motivated me to leave (there).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see anything in Damian's past history that would lead
me to believe he can't be a No. 1 goalie.''
</P>
<P>
   Maracle is a bigger question mark for the Thrashers. He was only
a fifth-round draft pick of the Red Wings in 1993 but recorded a
2.76 goals-against average in his final year in the juniors
(Saskatoon) and made All-Star teams in his last two years in the
American Hockey League. This year, he was 6-5-2 with a 2.27
goals-against average in 16 games and a saves percentage of .918,
best among goalies available to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   McLennan, 27, was not expected to be available to the Thrashers.
But the Blues worked a last-minute deal for Dallas backup Roman
Turek and can protect only one goalie, forcing them to leave both
McLennan (2.38, .891) and Grant Fuhr (2.44, .892) unprotected.
Atlanta would not draft Fuhr, Philadelphia's Ron Hextall or the
like because of their advanced age and salary.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues thought enough of McLennan last year to trade center
Darren Turcotte and a second-round draft pick to Nashville in
exchange for the Predators' agreement not to take McLennan in the
expansion draft. But that doesn't guarantee success for McLennan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goaltenders are in a category all by themselves,'' Waddell
said. ``Look at the finals this year _ both guys (Hasek and
Dallas's Ed Belfour) are 30 and had been traded. Coaches are
impatient with goalies. Goalies tend to develop when they're
older.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes when nobody expects it.

 &HT;    BUSH GREETED AS A HERO IN FIRST CAPITAL VISIT AS A CANDIDATE
 &HT;    Eds: Restores dropped word ``Hilton'' in graf 17.
 &HT;    710&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush moved through the capital
Tuesday in an atmosphere of triumph more befitting a campaign
victor than a fledgling candidate, receiving a hero's welcome from
Republican congressional leaders before appearing at a Texas-sized
presidential fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours after deriding Vice President Al Gore as a
``Washington, D.C. man'' at another fund-raising appearance in
Richmond, Va., the Texas governor strode into private meetings with
32 senators and 100 House members with an insider's flair.
</P>
<P>
   If there was any worry in the Bush camp that the ``compassionate
conservative'' might be tainted by the hard-hearted image of the
GOP-run Congress, it was hardly apparent in the governor's
pilgrimage to the Capitol, his first since declaring his intention
to seek the GOP presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   And if there was any concern among Bush advisers about the
anti-Washington candidate being embraced by the Washington
establishment, it was lost in the scramble to join Tuesday night's
$1,000-a-person reception, the biggest presidential fund-raiser
ever held here.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told reporters after his meetings with the lawmakers, ``I
believe I'm going to be here to work with them for tomorrow. I know
I've got a long way to go, but I'm really pleased with the support
I've received inside this building. And the best way to convey my
thanks is to look each in the eye and say, 'Thank you very much.'
``
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., a longtime political ally of Bush's
father, former President George Bush, escorted the governor around
the Capitol. Coverdell told reporters that the senators with whom
the governor met share his views on cutting taxes, reforming Social
Security and education and rebuilding the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our visions of the future and the new millennium are very
homogeneous,'' Coverdell said.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen Republican senators and 114 Republican House members
have endorsed Bush's candidacy, an unprecedented showing of
congressional support this early in the nominating process with 13
other candidates, including three senators and one congressman,
seeking the party nod.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas said Republicans up and down
the ballot will have to stick together next year if they want to
recapture the White House and avoid a Democratic takeover of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it would be productive for members of Congress
to run a campaign isolated from the presidency,'' Hutchison said.
``What we have to do is convince the American people that if we
elect a Republican president and a Republican Congress, we are
going to do the things that people believe are right.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party leaders used Bush's visit to the Capitol to
link him to unpopular legislative priorities of the Republican-led
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although he hasn't said much about his ideas, when you press
him for specifics, Bush follows the far-right GOP Congress more
than he leads it,'' said Democratic National Committee General
Chair Roy Romer.
</P>
<P>
   But polling data suggests Americans like Bush more than the
Republican leadership of Congress. In the latest CNN poll, 54
percent said they preferred Bush over Gore, the Democratic
front-runner, but only 36 percent said they favored the GOP
continuing to control Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk to Bush is that he gets too close to the Republican
Congress,'' said William Schneider, CNN's senior political analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps reflecting this assessment, Bush did not pose for
photographs with the party's congressional leaders, and he stood
alone at a microphone outside a Senate hearing room for his brief
comments to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from Tuesday night's fund-raiser, however, Republicans
are not shying away from Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The 425 sponsors of the Bush reception at the Washington Hilton
included many of the city's most powerful and influential
lobbyists, as well as many former officials from the presidencies
of Bush's father and Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   The event was expected to raise more than $2 million, which
would make it the largest fund-raiser ever by a presidential
candidate, and especially a candidate who, as Bush has done
recently, derides the ``zero-sum politics'' of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, the millionaire publisher who is financing his own
campaign for the GOP nomination, criticized the Bush fund-raiser
and accused the governor of ``becoming inextricably intertwined''
with ``Washington fat cats.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush gained a new challenger Tuesday as Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah
joined the GOP contest, telling reporters that he was entering the
race even though he considers himself ``the longest of long shots''
at this ``late stage'' of the White House campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said Bush ``seems to have it all,'' but said he intended
to position himself as a viable conservative alternative if the
Texas governor should falter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something happens to George W. Bush, I don't know if we
would have an alternative who could beat Al Gore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his Richmond stop earlier Tuesday, Bush directed his
anti-Washington rhetoric Tuesday squarely at Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a Washington, D.C. person,'' Bush said in response to
reporters' questions. ``He thinks Washington has got all the
answers. I don't. I believe the answers are found in our
communities. I believe the answers are found in faith-based
institutions, in community organizations.''

Republican congressional leaders before appearing at a Texas-sized
presidential fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours after deriding Vice President Al Gore as a
``Washington, D.C. man'' at another fund-raising appearance in
Richmond, Va., the Texas governor strode into private meetings with
32 senators and 100 House members with an insider's flair.
</P>
<P>
   If there was any worry in the Bush camp that the ``compassionate
conservative'' might be tainted by the hard-hearted image of the
GOP-run Congress, it was hardly apparent in the governor's
pilgrimage to the Capitol, his first since declaring his intention
to seek the GOP presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   And if there was any concern among Bush advisers about the
anti-Washington candidate being embraced by the Washington
establishment, it was lost in the scramble to join Tuesday night's
$1,000-a-person reception, the biggest presidential fund-raiser
ever held here.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told reporters after his meetings with the lawmakers, ``I
believe I'm going to be here to work with them for tomorrow. I know
I've got a long way to go, but I'm really pleased with the support
I've received inside this building. And the best way to convey my
thanks is to look each in the eye and say, 'Thank you very much.'
``
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., a longtime political ally of Bush's
father, former President George Bush, escorted the governor around
the Capitol. Coverdell told reporters that the senators with whom
the governor met share his views on cutting taxes, reforming Social
Security and education and rebuilding the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our visions of the future and the new millennium are very
homogeneous,'' Coverdell said.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen Republican senators and 114 Republican House members
have endorsed Bush's candidacy, an unprecedented showing of
congressional support this early in the nominating process with 13
other candidates, including three senators and one congressman,
seeking the party nod.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas said Republicans up and down
the ballot will have to stick together next year if they want to
recapture the White House and avoid a Democratic takeover of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it would be productive for members of Congress
to run a campaign isolated from the presidency,'' Hutchison said.
``What we have to do is convince the American people that if we
elect a Republican president and a Republican Congress, we are
going to do the things that people believe are right.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party leaders used Bush's visit to the Capitol to
link him to unpopular legislative priorities of the Republican-led
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although he hasn't said much about his ideas, when you press
him for specifics, Bush follows the far-right GOP Congress more
than he leads it,'' said Democratic National Committee General
Chair Roy Romer.
</P>
<P>
   But polling data suggests Americans like Bush more than the
Republican leadership of Congress. In the latest CNN poll, 54
percent said they preferred Bush over Gore, the Democratic
front-runner, but only 36 percent said they favored the GOP
continuing to control Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk to Bush is that he gets too close to the Republican
Congress,'' said William Schneider, CNN's senior political analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps reflecting this assessment, Bush did not pose for
photographs with the party's congressional leaders, and he stood
alone at a microphone outside a Senate hearing room for his brief
comments to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from Tuesday night's fund-raiser, however, Republicans
are not shying away from Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The 425 sponsors of the Bush reception at the Washington Hilton
included many of the city's most powerful and influential
lobbyists, as well as many former officials from the presidencies
of Bush's father and Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   The event was expected to raise more than $2 million, which
would make it the largest fund-raiser ever by a presidential
candidate, and especially a candidate who, as Bush has done
recently, derides the ``zero-sum politics'' of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, the millionaire publisher who is financing his own
campaign for the GOP nomination, criticized the Bush fund-raiser
and accused the governor of ``becoming inextricably intertwined''
with ``Washington fat cats.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush gained a new challenger Tuesday as Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah
joined the GOP contest, telling reporters that he was entering the
race even though he considers himself ``the longest of long shots''
at this ``late stage'' of the White House campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said Bush ``seems to have it all,'' but said he intended
to position himself as a viable conservative alternative if the
Texas governor should falter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something happens to George W. Bush, I don't know if we
would have an alternative who could beat Al Gore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his Richmond stop earlier Tuesday, Bush directed his
anti-Washington rhetoric Tuesday squarely at Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a Washington, D.C. person,'' Bush said in response to
reporters' questions. ``He thinks Washington has got all the
answers. I don't. I believe the answers are found in our
communities. I believe the answers are found in faith-based
institutions, in community organizations.''

QUESTION OF WHERE TO LAY BLAME INFLAMES TENSIONS AS REFUGEES RETURN

   OBILIC, Yugoslavia _ Frightened by Albanians streaming back into
this central Kosovo town, Snezana Ivanovic and Sabrija Popic sought
out a newly arrived British soldier on Saturday and asked for
``guarantees of protection.'' The two women, one Serbian and one a
gypsy, feared retaliation as Albanians returned here to find their
dwellings and shops looted or burned.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Popic told the soldier that masked paramilitaries were
responsible for the damage, not her. ``There are people who were
robbing and beating people who have escaped,'' from the town, she
said. ``And now the innocent people will pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Abdullah Restelica, a 49-year-old Albanian passing by,
protested. ``I came today from Macedonia,'' he said angrily. ``My
family was beaten here before my own eyes! My house was robbed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Ivanovic, the Serb woman, shot back: ``Who robbed your
house?'' ``I didn't. Innocent people didn't do anything. We
shouldn't have to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   The British soldier answered, ``We are trying to provide a safe
environment for every community.'' But his words did little to calm
the tension of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   In virtually every corner of this embattled province, such
exchanges illustrate one of the most difficult issues in this most
complicated of conflicts. Who is guilty or innocent of the
killings, beatings and burnings in Kosovo and how will the guilty
ever be brought to justice?
</P>
<P>
   Long after the peace accords were approved in Belgrade, those
questions are likely to remain unresolved for months even years
here. And worse, they are almost certain to spark repeated clashes
as returning Albanians and Serbs attempt to resume living together.
</P>
<P>
   An unfocused rage that can well up from either direction is
festering here under even the most innocent of circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday in Slovi, another small village in the middle of the
province, Jasmina Stanisic ran into the road and blocked a passing
car. Pounding her fists on the hood, Ms. Stanisic, a Serb, demanded
that British NATO soldiers immediately search its trunk. Her
brother, she shrieked, had been kidnapped by Albanians 15 minutes
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took him!'' she thundered. ``They took him!''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing was found in the car and for the next chaotic hour,
26-year-old Lt. Graham Shannon and 30 other British soldiers
struggled to keep this ethnically mixed village from exploding.
During the last two nights, Albanian refugees and Kosovo Liberation
Army soldiers have been returning home here to find houses looted
and burned. In retaliation, they had pillaged the homes of
departing Serbs. The kidnapping on Tuesday threatened to spark a
new, more deadly cycle of retribution.
</P>
<P>
   The task of sorting out responsibility for the atrocities is
especially daunting in Kosovo because reports show that the
violence was carried out by a combination of Yugoslav army
soldiers, paramilitary units and internal security forces. Some
Serbian paramilitaries wore masks while they committed many crimes,
some had local guides point them to the homes of wealthy Albanians,
and many followed orders from a central command led by one of
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's top military aide.
</P>
<P>
   The inability to determine who is accountable complicates NATO's
efforts to keep the peace and prevent revenge attacks. The
poisonous legacy of few thousand masked paramilitaries _ and
Belgrade's decision to unleash them _ is that innocent or not, all
Serbs in Kosovo are now all suspects in the eyes of returning
ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Some Albanians are convinced they recognized the voice of a
paramilitary who abused them as that of a local Serb or a gypsy.
Others insist a local Serb must have guided the paramilitaries. How
else would they have singled out houses that belonged to prosperous
local Albanian businessmen? But few Albanians can definitively say
which Serbs, if any, were involved.
</P>
<P>
   The International War Crimes Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia
and whatever local justice system is eventually established here
faces a daunting task in sorting through tens of thousands of
crimes. A tribunal official who spoke on condition of anonymity
said investigators are initially concentrating on who had command
responsibility for the most serious crimes. In some cases, masks
may prevent tribunal officials from eventually identifying specific
perpetrators unless a fellow paramilitary, soldier or policeman
becomes a cooperating witness, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo Liberation Army officials, for their part, said they are
discouraging revenge attacks. Hydajet Hyseni, the acting justice
minister of the self-appointed KLA provincial government, said his
organization would fully cooperate with the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very concerned to stop any such reactions,'' he said,
referring to revenge attacks. ``The consequences will be very grave
if we find anyone carrying out reprisals.''
</P>
<P>
   But fear and rumors of reprisals are rampant in the handful of
communities where Serbs remain. NATO officials said they do not
have a complete tally of the number of Serbian civilians killed
since they arrived last Saturday. But there have been dozens of
sniping attacks and at least four Serb civilians have been shot
dead.
</P>
<P>
   Revenge attacks are already occurring here in Obilic. A gypsy's
home was ablaze here Monday night, set on fire by angry Albanians,
according to a local Albanian farmer. The bodies of five men, two
teenagers and three middle-aged, were found shot dead execution
style in a field outside of town Saturday morning. British soldiers
said the men appeared to have been killed recently but they did not
yet know their identities. Local Serbs said they believed the
victims were Serbs. Albanians said they believed the victims were
Albanians.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Problems in Obilic are in some ways to be expected. Zeljko
``Arkan'' Raznatovic, the Belgrade-based Serb paramilitary leader
indicted by the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague,
made this his base in Kosovo. He owned a soccer club here and the
town was a major center of paramilitary activity. The town had its
own citizens defense brigade that fought with Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The tensions here were evident in the shouting match between Ms.
Popic, Ms. Ivanovic and Restelica. Albanians bitterly complained
about their suffering at the hands of paramilitaries and accused
local gypsies of looting homes and stores. Ms. Popic admitted the
looting occurred but insisted she was not involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't rob anything,'' she said. ``You can come to my house
and see.''
</P>
<P>
   Albanians emerging from hiding or returning home from Macedonia
or Albania were divided over the issue of assigning guilt. The vast
majority of those who were interviewed said they believed some
local Serbs and gypsies took part in the killing and pillaging. But
none of them could cite by name a local Serb who was involved.
</P>
<P>
   They split over whether Serbs and gypsies should be allowed to
stay here. ``They should go,'' said Ingi Nasuri, a 17-year-old who
spent the last three months in hiding in the town. ``They don't
belong here. They don't have any place here.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barije Kostanica, a 34-year-old woman who also spent the
last three months in hiding, said the Serbs and gypsies with
``clean hands'' should be allowed to stay. When asked the question
at the heart of the dilemma _ who should determine guilt or
innocence _ Ms. Kostanica said simply, ``I don't know.''

COURT OVERTURNS BANK FRAUD CONVICTION OF FORMER ARIZONA GOVERNOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A federal appeals court on Tuesday overturned
the bank fraud convictions of former Gov. Fife Symington of
Arizona, saying that the trial judge wrongfully dismissed a juror
who disagreed with the others over the governor's guilt.
</P>
<P>
   In a 2-1 ruling, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting
in San Francisco, said that there was a ``reasonable possibility''
that the juror was removed because the rest of the jury was
frustrated that she did not agree with them, and not, as the jurors
had complained to the judge, because she refused to deliberate with
them.
</P>
<P>
   Symington, who resigned during his second term in September
1997, one month after he was convicted of lying on financial
statements to lenders during his career as a real estate developer,
is now entitled to a new trial. He had been sentenced to two and a
half years in prison, but had remained free on bail pending his
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a great sense of relief,'' Symington said Tuesday
afternoon from his home near Phoenix. ``I'm very grateful for the
decision and frankly, emotions are very high right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Once on the short list of rising stars in the Republican Party,
Symington, a Harvard graduate and decorated Air Force veteran of
Vietnam, was convicted on seven felony counts of defrauding his
lenders by falsely inflating his net worth to obtain new loans to
salvage failing projects, then falsely deflating it to have loans
forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said they had no intention of dropping the case.
They said they were considering three options: appealing to the
United States Supreme Court, asking the full 11-member appeals
court to hear the case, or retrying the case. ``Obviously we're
disappointed,'' prosecutor David Schindler said, adding that they
``were certainly prepared to re-try the case'' or to try to
negotiate a plea agreement with Symington.
</P>
<P>
   The jury in his trial was in its sixth day of deliberations when
Judge Roger Strand of U.S. District Court in Phoenix dismissed the
juror, Mary Ann Cotey, 74, and replaced her with an alternate. The
rest of the jury had complained that Ms. Cotey was inattentive and
confused, seemed not to understand evidence, and refused to discuss
her positions. Strand, after interviewing Ms. Cotey, decided that
she was ``either unable or unwilling to deliberate with her
colleagues,'' which constitutes a ground for removing her.
</P>
<P>
   The 9th Circuit ruled that the judge should have ordered more
deliberations or declared a mistrial, given that some of the
jurors' objections to Ms. Cotey seemed to be based on disagreements
with her over the merits of the case. The appeals court noted that
when interviewed by Strand, Ms. Cotey suggested that the other
jurors' frustrations with her might be because she ``couldn't agree
with the majority all the time, at least temporarily,'' and that
she felt she was being pressured into a vote by the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``While there may have been some reason to doubt Cotey's
abilities as a juror, there was also considerable evidence to
suggest that the other jurors' frustrations with her derived
primarily from the fact that she held a position opposite to
theirs,'' Judge Betty Fletcher wrote in the court's 40-page
decision.
</P>
<P>
   When told of the decision, Ms. Cotey said, ``Hallelujah! Free at
last! Free at last!'' She said she felt the same as she did the day
she was removed from the jury _ that she had been wrongfully
dismissed, and that she never thought the case against Symington
was very good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulations, I'm sorry you resigned,'' she said she would
tell the ex-governor.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Symington, a great grandson of Henry Clay Frick, the
turn-of-the-century coal and steel magnate, and a cousin of Stuart
Symington, a Democratic senator from Missouri, was relatively
unknown when he announced his candidacy for governor in 1989,
promising to run the state the way he ran his real estate empire in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   He was re-elected in 1995, despite the by-then four-year
investigation into his finances. He has contended that he filed
false statements unintentionally, and that those mistakes should
have been caught by his accountants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always felt,'' he said Tuesday, that ``I was wrongly
convicted, that what happened to me was inappropriate. It's a
wonderful day to see truth and justice win.''

REVOLUTION TRADE FOR GORI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The rejuvenation of the Revolution continues.
</P>
<P>
   After slogging through the early part of the season, the
Revolution have demonstrated the potential to be a solid playoff
contender after earning 9 points in the last five games and, more
significant, avoiding regulation-time defeat. And Tuesday they
added Argentine defender Mario Gori in a trade with Miami for Edwin
Gorter, a move that should bolster the defense and change the
team's attacking dynamics.
</P>
<P>
   Gori, 26, won two MLS Cup titles with D.C. United after joining
the league from Rosario Central in 1996. He is a dynamic left-sided
player and his presence should not only provide depth but also
allow Ted Chronopoulos to move into midfield as the Revolution
prepare to visit Dallas without suspended left-sided midfielder
Ivan McKinley.
</P>
<P>
   Gorter, 35, joined the Revolution as a midfield choreographer
last season and played 28 games, but was forced into a sweeper role
as the team suffered through a nine-game losing streak. He was
suspended for the first two games this season after a practice
incident involving former teammate David Nakhid but was expected to
regain a leadership role on the team.
</P>
<P>
   However, Gorter was substituted in the 55th minute of his first
start, against Columbus April 17, and argued with assistant coach
Giuseppe Galderisi on the sideline. Since then, Gorter has played
the entire game in midfield only once, during a 2-0 loss at
Columbus May 15.
</P>
<P>
   He was moved to sweeper for a 2-0 win over Chicago three weeks
later, then provided the last-minute tying goal against Miami, and
was again benched.
</P>
<P>
   Player-coach Walter Zenga apparently made it clear that Gorter
was not in the team's plans, a decision that likely should have
been made earlier.Though Gorter is among the most experienced and
skillful performers ever to have played for the Revolution, his
style apparently clashed with the expectations of Zenga.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second Miami-Revolution deal in two weeks, as
defensive midfielder Carlos Parra joined New England last week.
</P>
<P>
   Gori will rejoin two former D.C. United teammates: John Harkes
and Kris Kelderman.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, major trade speculation regarding Miami has centered
around Revolution striker Joe-Max Moore, who has expressed interest
in playing for the Fusion. A Moore-for-Eric Wynalda trade could
happen after the season. But Moore appears to be finding success
with the Revolution, as he scored his fourth and fifth goals of the
season in a 3-2 victory over Tampa Bay Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm totally focused on my team and getting to the championship
game at Foxboro Stadium,'' Moore said Tuesday. ``There are always
other possibilities, and any player at age 28 needs to take a look
at all of them. But if I can re-sign with the league at comparable
money to what I am making now, I will probably do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore has been encouraged by the Revolution's recent success.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were losing nine games in a row, it was no fun for
us,'' Moore said. ``The guys are enjoying training more now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ivan and Carlos are out for this game but I don't think it
will set us back too much. Everyone is feeling good and
confident.''

done, never mind that the giver of orders, seventh in line to the
throne, is five places behind the beheadee,  &UR; Prince William &LR; . The
problem was that the victim had failed to smile in the official

be removed by computer and replaced with another version.

   A devine hero
</P>
<P>
   By Jeffrey Denberg
</P>
<P>
   C. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Modest, a little shy, Allan Houston is an unlikely
basketball hero for this brawling, irreverent town.
</P>
<P>
   He says God sent him.
</P>
<P>
   The guy who scored those 34 points in Game 3 of the NBA Finals
on Monday, who rescued the Knicks from a sweep before tonight's
Game 4, who has advanced to the forefront of the league's special
shooting guards, says he believes it. And Houston doesn't appear
the sort of person who would tell you a lie.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he wondered about his calling in the winter of 1996-97,
when he first arrived in Manhattan and took a beating from the
boo-birds in the stands and the tabloids in the sidewalk kiosks.
His problem was he didn't come in swaggering and dominating and
showing he was a player worth $55 million over seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never really one to read the papers and look at the
media too much,'' he said Tuesday. ``I knew that (approach) would
be a positive for me here. I relied on my ability just to try and
get the job done on the court. I didn't worry about my personality
in a contrast with this city. Just continue to be the type person I
was and continue to work hard. And I knew that things would work
out.'' He was coming off a big year with Detroit, where he averaged
19.7 in a formidable young tandem with Grant Hill. He was a star on
the rise.
</P>
<P>
   A free agent, he was told by Detroit owner Bill Davidson to
satisfy himself _ to go out and find the best deal in the league
because Davidson would top it. The Knicks were looking at Steve
Smith, and they had vague interest in Reggie Miller. But when the
Knicks waved their huge offer at Houston, the game was over. The
Pistons never had a counter-offer.
</P>
<P>
   In Detroit, they blamed Doug Collins, who was the coach and
general manager Collins reportedly insulted Houston and agent Bill
Strickland by asking Strickland when he would get his client to
play defense.
</P>
<P>
   Houston distances himself from that version. ``I was
disappointed in that people didn't give me credit for making my own
decision in coming here, and people were throwing out all kind of
reasons,'' he said. ``But I knew it was a great opportunity because
look where I am now. I'm in the Finals. That's where God sent me. I
figured that was the reason for me being here.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first year with the Knicks, his scoring average dropped
almost five points and his shooting percentage plummeted. In games
against Detroit, Houston disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   But he bloomed last year after Patrick Ewing broke his wrist.
The Knicks' offense turned away from the post, and the tempo of the
game increased. Houston established himself by averating 18.7
points. This season, even with the difficult adjustment in learning
to share with Latrell Sprewell in a lockout-shortened season,
Houston was able to take the next big step to the top.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jeff Van Gundy has seen a noticeable difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his hunger to continue to score even when he scores
well early is different now,'' he said. ``I thought for the first
year and a half he was here, he was very content if he got 20 to
stay at 20. And now, I think he has a continuing hunger to try and
score.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston says his position demands that. ``They call it shooting
guard. The first word is shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes he is better than good. ``In my mind, I've always
been (a superstar), and I will continue to be that type of player.
That's the belief I have in myself.''
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean he can't get better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get to the point where people say, 'He doesn't have
any weaknesses. He's an all-around player.' That's where I want to
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at a Michael (Jordan), Spree, the great scorers and
players in this league. They aren't happy with 20 points. if they
have a great start, they want to keep it going. Earlier, I was
unselfish. If I got some points, I wanted to get some assists. You
can still do that, but I've learned to stay hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   Take Monday's game. Houston had 18 at the half. The Knicks made
four baskets in the third quarter, and he had all four of them. He
had 34 of their 89 points. That's on top of the 32 he hung on the
Pacers in the decisive Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals.
That's on top of the 34 he dumped on the Hawks in Game 1 of the
second round.
</P>
<P>
   He can do this because he has size (6-foot-6) and quickness and
health, because his dad and former college coach, Wade Houston,
encouraged his intermediate game. He can get you going to the hoop
and from behind the arc and in between.
</P>
<P>
   They used to call him Mr. Softee. No longer.

NORTHEAST DRYING OUT; OFFICIALS GUARD WATER SUPPLIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Water levels in the Ipswich River have dropped so low
that state officials fear fish may begin to die. Farmers such as
Bob Connors have turned to costly, around-the-clock irrigation to
keep crops alive. Towns have begun ordering cuts on water use, as
filling pools and lawn-watering drain wells.
</P>
<P>
   Just three days into the summer of 1999, the Northeast is
already in the grips of a drought that is leaving ballfields,
parks, and untended lawns a parched brown across much of New
England. If the trend continues, state officials say a water
shortage could jeopardize everything from fire protection to the
fall cranberry harvest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're off to a terribly rocky start,'' said William A. Wood,
water superintendent in Topsfield, where plummeting well levels
prompted officials to ban almost all outdoor water use except with
a watering can.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, communities such as Topsfield are particularly
vulnerable because their water supply is small and isolated, but,
after nearly a month without measurable rainfall in Boston and none
forecast until next week, weather watchers from government
officials to farmers are getting nervous.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service is expected to announce Wednesday
that southern New England is experiencing its first ``moderate
drought'' since 1995, with precipitation 15 to 25 percent below
average for the year. Boston already set a record for lowest-ever
rainfall in April, while Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard, and Nantucket
are among the driest places in New England now.
</P>
<P>
   The Weather Service's Climate Prediction Center expects
near-average rainfall for southern and eastern New England this
summer, and above-average rain for parts of the Northeast. But even
weather officials caution against putting too much faith in these
long-term forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we are advising people to take precautions to
conserve water so, if we remain dry over the next few weeks, we
won't have any problems,'' said Joe Dellicarpini, meteorologist at
the National Weather Service office in Taunton.
</P>
<P>
   The New England drought is part of a broader dry spell that
stretches back to last August and covers much of the region from
Maine to Maryland. The Northeast Regional Climate Center at Cornell
University calculates that Maryland has been hardest hit, missing 8
to 14 inches of rain over the past 10 months that normally would
have helped its $500 million farm industry.
</P>
<P>
   The drought crept up on New England, which has had a few wet
months sandwiched around very dry months such as last December.
Since April 1, Massachusetts has had about 5 inches of rain, half
the normal amount, including no measurable rain since May 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can use any rain that we can get,'' said Keith Eggleston,
senior climatologist at the Cornell climate center. ``One or two
heavy rainfall events could help things that rely on the short
term, like gardens, crops, and agricultural interests. But for more
groundwater, we'll need a few months of above-normal
precipitation.''
</P>
<P>
   The drought hasn't gone on long enough to affect major water
resources such as the Quabbin Reservoir that provides Greater
Boston's drinking water. The massive reservoir in western
Massachusetts remains 94 percent full.
</P>
<P>
   However, the dry spell is leaving its mark in places such as the
Ipswich River in northern Massachusetts, where the water level has
dropped to a trickle during the month of June, raising fears that
the fish will begin dying. On Monday, Department of Environmental
Protection officials wrote to 14 towns that draw drinking water
along the river calling on them to educate citizens on the need to
conserve water.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers also are taking precautions to keep their new crops from
dying of thirst in the field. Connors of Danvers is dousing his
corn with 5 million gallons of water a week, and still praying for
rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of scary,'' Connors told the Associated Press.
``We're talking about losing hundreds of thousands of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, communities such as Franklin, Norfolk, and Topsfield
are restricting the amount of water residents can use, both to ease
immediate pressure on the water system and to conserve water for
the dog days of summer ahead.
</P>
<P>
   For many officials, the scary thing is how quickly the water
problem developed. Norfolk water superintendent Jim Martin
initially warned people to conserve in May, then imposed an
every-other-day lawn-watering rule in early June, but quickly found
out that wasn't enough when hilltop residents reported bursts of
air along with water coming from their showerheads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do fine until it gets down to everybody having to water a
quarter acre of lawn,'' said Martin, who banned outdoor lawn
watering last week, in part to ensure enough water pressure to
fight fires.
</P>
<P>
   Lealdon Langley, director of watershed permitting at the DEP,
said the drought isn't nearly as serious as in 1988, when months of
dry weather dangerously depleted even the Quabbin reservoir. But
each dry day makes water officials more anxious.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is definitely at this point a heightened level of
concern among all the water policy planners and water department
supervisors,'' said Langley.

TEXAS GOVERNOR FINDING THAT POST-COLD WAR WORLD CAN BE CONFUSING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. _ Gov. George W. Bush often tells campaign
audiences that the world is a dangerous place in the post-Cold War
era. It can also be confusing.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor had a little trouble with the new world order
on Tuesday when a foreign journalist asked him about Slovakia, a
spin-off from the former Czechoslovakia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I know about Slovakia is what I learned
first-hand from your foreign minister, who came to Texas,'' Bush
replied at a news conference during a campaign stop in Virginia.
``I had a great meeting with him. It's an exciting country. It's a
country that's flourishing. It's a country that's doing very
well.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor added that he was ``very impressed'' with his guest
from the former Eastern bloc.
</P>
<P>
   There were only two problems with Bush's answer: His April 26
visitor in Austin wasn't a foreign minister and he wasn't from
Slovakia. He was Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek of Slovenia, a
breakaway from the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes acknowledged that her boss is
still getting up to speed on foreign policy issues. In recent
weeks, Bush has referred to Greeks as ``Grecians,'' Kosovars as
``Kosovarians'' and East Timorese as ``East Timorians.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the acknowledged front-runner for the Republican
presidential nomination, has assembled a team of foreign policy
advisers that includes former Secretary of State George Shultz and
former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   ``He readily concedes that, as governor, he does not have
extensive foreign policy experience,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Bush isn't the only presidential candidate who has
had trouble keeping track of events of Eastern Europe. In the 1976
presidential debates, Gerald Ford suggested that Poland was not
under Soviet domination, which came as big news to Poland. And that
was before the Soviet Union's collapse created a host of new
republics and ethnic enclaves with nationalist goals.
</P>
<P>
   Bush came to Virginia on the second day of a five-day campaign
swing that will include stops in Pennsylvania, Michigan and
Florida. He also stopped by the Capitol on Tuesday for closed
meetings with House and Senate Republicans. The Bush campaign
counts 20 out of 55 GOP senators and 126 out of 223 House
Republicans as supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The three dozen senators who huddled with Bush Tuesday included
Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who told reporters earlier in the day
that he plans to run for president ``in case Bush stumbles.''
</P>
<P>
   When told of Hatch's comments, Bush said, ``That's an
interesting vision. No, I don't intend to stumble. I'm running. I'm
running hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's meeting with congressional Republicans came as Democrats
sought to link the Texas governor to House Majority Leader Dick
Armey of Irving and Republican Whip Tom DeLay of Sugar Land. A
Democratic National Committee news release asserted that Bush came
to Capitol Hill to ``plot strategy'' with conservative GOP leaders
even though Armey, DeLay and Speaker Dennis Hastert skipped the
session to hold their own separate leadership meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although he hasn't' said much about his ideas, when you press
him for specifics, Bush follows the far-right GOP Congress more
than he leads it,'' said Democratic Party chairman Roy Romer.
</P>
<P>
   Bush shrugged off the Democrats' line of attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``This race, if I'm the nominee, is between me and Vice
President Al Gore,'' he said. At his earlier news conference in
Richmond, Bush predicted that voters would see ``a huge
difference'' between himself and Gore if they face off in November
2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a Washington, D.C. person. He thinks Washington has got
all the answers. I don't,'' Bush said. ``I believe the answers are
found in our communities. I believe answers are found in
faith-based organizations and community organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush ended his Washington visit with a sold-out fund-raiser that
was expected to raise about $1.5 million for the GOP front-runner.
The sold-out event in the Washington Hilton Hotel drew a host of
Republicans with ties to former President George Bush, the
candidate's father.

 &HT;    Atlanta mom takes issue with sexy toy spy
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Talk about a mojo meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of talking action figures based on the hit movie
``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' may disappear from Toys
``R'' Us stores nationwide after an East Point (Ga.) woman
complained that her son was exposed to the swinging secret agent's
saucy catch phrase: ``Do I make you horny, baby? Do I?''
</P>
<P>
   Paula Whitty, a spokeswoman for the giant toy retailer, said
store managers will check their remaining stock of Austin Powers
dolls and remove those that repeat the phrase that offended Tamatha
Brannon and her 11-year-old son, Marvin.
</P>
<P>
   The Brannons were shopping in the chain's Morrow (Ga.) store
Saturday when Marvin picked up one of the dolls, read the phrase
written on the package and asked his mother what ``horny'' meant.
Brannon subsequently filed a criminal complaint against the store
and has demanded an apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not acceptable,'' said Brannon, who stood next to her
son during an impromptu press conference in the store's parking lot
Tuesday. ``My son is not old enough to be talking about sex, and I
think Toys ``R'' Us should be responsible for putting something
that's inappropriate for kids on their shelves.''
</P>
<P>
   Brannon said that two years ago, Marvin saw the first Austin
Powers movie with his father, from whom she's divorced. Even though
the earlier film contained many sexual references, she criticized
the store for ``embarrassing'' her son.
</P>
<P>
   Whitty blamed the incident on a shipping mix-up, saying the
chain's 700 stores were only supposed to receive versions of the
dolls that uttered innocuous lines from the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to get the action figures, but from now on we
will check, and those with the phrase will be sent back to the
vendor.'' It was unclear Tuesday how many of the dolls remained,
because they had been selling briskly since the movie's release
June 11. Whitty said she had gotten no other complaints.
</P>
<P>
   However, Whitty said the store planned to keep versions of the
doll that repeat the word ``shag,'' a British euphemism for sex
that is also part of Powers' retro hipster vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't think that's right,'' said Brannon late Tuesday.
``I don't think any of those words should be in a child's toy
store. If they don't correct this, my son won't be back there.''
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Doug Jewett of the Clayton County (Ga.) police said the
department is no longer investigating Brannon's complaint. But
county solicitor Keith Martin said he's still reviewing the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question here is whether this is obscene or offensive,''
said Martin. ``I don't know who we would even prosecute here.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd McFarlane, owner of the Arizona-based company that
manufactures the dolls, which sell for $14.99, said the ``horny''
versions were intended for stores that cater to older shoppers,
such as Spencer Gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody mixed a couple of boxes up and one of them landed in
Georgia. I won't make any excuses,'' said McFarlane, who is also
the creator of the ultra-violent comic book character ``Spawn.''
</P>
<P>
   But McFarlane, who is the parent of two young children, said
Brannon had blown the issue out of proportion. ``These are the
moments in life when you have to make a decision whether you're
going to save the world from evil or sit down with your kids and
tell them what you think is appropriate, and what isn't.''

FESTIVAL TO SHOWCASE DIVERSE CULTURES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EUN LEE KOH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At first glance, New Hampshire, with its quaint
covered bridges and critical presidential primary, doesn't seem to
have much in common with Romania or South Africa _ until today
(Wednesday).
</P>
<P>
   The culture and customs of all three regions will be featured at
this year's Smithsonian Folklife Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the nation's capital will be able to witness a chip
off the Granite State during the festival, which annually features
a diverse triad of communities from the United States and around
the world. The festival, now in its 33d year, runs through July 4.
</P>
<P>
   On the National Mall Tuesday, participants hammered at covered
bridges and carved into granite tablets, bringing parts of New
Hampshire to life as they prepared for the festival. About 140 New
Hampshire residents will be showing off more than 30 exhibits that
were previewed last month at a folklife festival in Concord, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   As next year's presidential election looms, one exhibit
highlights the outsized role New Hampshire residents play in
national politics. With the exception of Bill Clinton in 1992, no
president has been elected without first winning the New Hampshire
primary, the first in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors also can peek inside a two-story timberwood barn with
live animals or walk through a smaller-scale model of a covered
bridge. They can attend demonstrations on herding sheep and learn
about the history of making Shaker furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Hungry? Tourists can purchase their pick from a menu of lobster
rolls, New England clam chowder, baked beans, maple sausage
hoagies, and fresh-squeezed lemonade. And in the evening,
Franco-American fiddlers will serenade as visitors dance.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to feature the Granite State this year stemmed from
the suggestion of a New Hampshire resident, who, after visiting the
folklife festival four years ago, called the festival director,
Diana Parker, and rallied for his home state.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went on and on about the great craftspeople and wonderful
history that New Hampshire had,'' Parker said. ``So we decided we
had to look into it.''
</P>
<P>
   A team of researchers from the Smithsonian and from the New
Hampshire Arts Council set out to uncover the state's many cultural
traditions _ from music to local culinary treats.
</P>
<P>
   Roberta Kaufhold, 63, of Peterborough, N.H., who was helping set
up the exhibit Tuesday, said, ``There's so much great things that
people do in this state. I'm glad someone noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaufhold and her husband, Hans, who runs a granite and marble
carving business in Peterborough, will hand-carve an outline of New
Hampshire with the state motto ``Live Free or Die'' onto a slab of
granite as part of their exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufhold's family has been in the business for as long as she
can remember. Her father has helped carved headstones for soldiers
in the Tomb of the Unknowns in Arlington National Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people in New Hampshire still do things the old-fashioned
way _ with hammers and mallets,'' Hans Kaufhold said. ``Not
everything is made with machines.''
</P>
<P>
   The festival, which usually features one state and two foreign
countries, chose Romania and South Africa this year out of
``curatorial interest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no one way we choose which countries or states to
feature,'' Vicki Moeser, a Smithsonian spokeswoman, said. ``We
really try to get a mixed variety every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Exhibits from Romania feature music and dance groups, in
colorful costume, from the provinces of Moldova, Transylvania and
Wallachia.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenters from Maramures, a region in northern Romania, have
also carved and constructed a model of a wooden church, similar to
those that line their city streets. Visitors can sample traditional
Romanian dishes such as sarmale, a cabbage dish, or mamaliga, a
corn dish.
</P>
<P>
   The South African exhibit highlights the country's political
history, its success in breaking from apartheid and its continuing
struggle to unite its multiple races and cultures. Traditional
pottery and beadwork is being featured, along with urban artwork,
such as rugs woven from plastic shopping bags and baskets made with
telephone wires.

SYMINGTON (Phoenix) - Spot news story on the appellate decision on
former Arizona Gov. Fife Symington, including but not restricted to
the following elements: Details of the appellate panel'ss reasons
for overturning the conviction. Symington's reax and update on what
he has done with himself since leaving office. Can and will the
prosecution try to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court?Was Judge
Fletcher, the elderly panelist who raised questions about Juror
Cotey's dismissal based on age-related problems, a critical factor
in this decision? If so, how? Is there a dissenting opinion? If so,
what does it say? Legal implication of the case: does this mean
that judicial discretion is being reined in by the appellate court?
Does it conflict with a recent decision in a Tucson case that
strengthened judicial discretion in dismissing jurors from trial
juries? Political reaction: was a governor wrongly unseated? By
CHARLES KELLY, DENNIS WAGNER and JERRY KAMMER. Story will move in
the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
RETRIAL (Phoenix) - Will the prosecution retry the case, and if so,
on which counts? Could they drop some of the counts on which he was
originally convicted, focusing on the strongest one or two? Would
they try to include counts on which he was not convicted,
especially those on which the original jury deadlocked? We should
note that Richard Drooyan, who headed the U.S. Attorney's criminal
division during the Symington investigation, has since left the
office, as has U.S. Attorney Nora Manella. The new U.S. Attorney is
a political appointee with no historical perspective on this case,
nor any face-saving motives to consider. Lead prosecutor David
Schindler will be trying the high-profile Mitnick computer-hacker
case starting in April, and could conceivably leave the office
after that, leaving few of the original players in place. By JERRY
KAMMER. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
FIFE (Phoenix) - What are the chances of Symington renewing his
political career? Would he still be considered a convicted felon,
thereby making him ineligible? What are his interests now? Can he
reclaim his broker's license? The story should capture Symington's
mood in the wake of the decision, and talk about his prospects and
current and planned activities. By CHRIS MAYES and CHRIS MOESER.
Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
COTEY (Phoenix) - Interview with Mary Jane Cotey, the woman whose
ejection from the Symington jury during deliberations gave rise to
the appeal. By MARY JO PITZL. Story will move in the ``A''

SENATE SENDS HOUSE BILL APPROVING PAYMENT OF BACK DUES TO U.N. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Del., Md.)  (mk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate overwhelmingly approved a bill Tuesday
authorizing the payment of more than $800 million in back dues to
the United Nations but cutting future American contributions to the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has agreed to support the bill, after
deciding in the spring to drop its opposition to a provision that
requires the United States to reduce its share of the regular U.N.
budget from 25 percent to 20 percent. The administration reversed
its position as part of a deal to try to win confirmation for
Richard Holbrooke to the chief American diplomat's post at the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate vote to approve the overall bill, 98-1, does not mean
that the United Nations is about to receive a big check from
Washington. Far from it. The legislation, a $6.4 billion two-year
State Department spending bill, now moves to the House, where
conservative Republicans saddled a similar bill last year with
antiabortion language. That led to a veto by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are expected to try to resurrect an antiabortion
provision that would bar American aid from being provided to groups
that lobby abroad for abortion rights, raising the threat of
another veto.
</P>
<P>
   The bill approved by the Senate Tuesday would provide the United
Nations with $819 million in back dues over three years and forgive
$107 million that the organization owes the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The bill requires that in exchange for providing the money, the
United States would cut its overall contribution to the regular
U.N. budget to 20 percent, and the American share of the budget for
peacekeeping operations from 31 percent to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The reductions would be imposed unilaterally on the United
Nations, which is expected to balk at the provisions. The United
Nations has in the past opposed efforts by the United States to
trim its share of the organization's budget.
</P>
<P>
   After originally balking at the proposed cuts in the American
contribution to the U.N. budget and other conditions imposed on the
repayment of the back dues, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
agreed to support the legislation if only to secure Holbrooke's
confirmation as the U.S. representative at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional officials said the Republican chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Jesse Helms of North Carolina,
had threatened to block the nomination until he received Albright's
commitment to support the bill, which he sponsored along with Sen.
Joseph Biden of Delaware, the committee's ranking Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and the United Nations continue to argue over
exactly how much money is owed to the organization. According to
the United Nations, the United States owes about $1.6 billion; the
United States says the figure is closer to $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The only lawmaker to vote against the bill, Sen. Paul Sarbanes,
D-Md., said that it was wrong for the United States to impose
conditions on the repayment of its back dues. ``It's simply
unacceptable that the richest nation on earth is also the biggest
debtor to the United Nations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Biden said that the bill offers the only hope for repayment
of the back dues owed by the United States. ``In an ideal world I'd
like to pay our arrears to the United Nations in full with no
conditions,'' he said. But he added, ``Our choices are this or
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Holbrooke, who now seems assured of confirmation as
U.S. delegate to the United Nations, reaffirmed his support of the
provisions in the Senate bill and pledged to the Senate ``that I
will make it my highest sustained priority to make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second of three days of confirmation hearings before the
Foreign Relations Committee, Holbrooke, a veteran diplomat and the
former American ambassador to Germany, said Tuesday that
``budgetary discipline will be my watchword.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed by the Senate also calls for $3 billion to be
spent over the next five years to step up security at American
embassies around the world, an amount requested by the Clinton
administration in the aftermath of the bombing last year of the
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Beginning at the All-Star Game July 13 at Fenway Park,
fans will have the opportunity to select the 25 members of
baseball's All-Century Team.
</P>
<P>
   Fans will select two players at each infield position, nine
outfielders, two catchers, and six pitchers from a total of 100
nominees. The list of nominees will be unveiled in Boston on the
day of the All-Star Game, with a group of the players expected to
attend the announcement at the Sheraton Boston hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we approach the millennium, we thought it was appropriate
to select the baseball players who are the greatest in this
century, and we thought it was appropriate to have our fans be an
integral part of that selection process,'' said Kathleen Francis,
vice president of marketing for Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The nominees will be selected by a group of sportswriters and
commissioner Bud Selig's office.
</P>
<P>
   Voting will take place from July 13 to Sept. 10, with ballots
available at Kmarts, in special advertisements for MasterCard
International in TV Guide and Sports Illustrated, and on Major
League Baseball's website, www.majorleaguebaseball.com. MasterCard
and Major League Baseball are sponsoring the vote.
</P>
<P>
   A television commercial promoting the selection process will be
broadcast beginning at about the time of the All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   The team will be announced during the NBC broadcast of Game 1 of
the World Series on Oct. 23. The panel of sportswriters will select
a starting lineup _ including a righthanded and a lefthanded
pitcher _ which will be announced before Game 2 the following
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will sit in the coffee shops in the morning with their
paper and you'll see them arguing, you'll see them arguing which
was the greatest player _ Mantle, Mays, or DiMaggio,'' said former
Detroit and Cincinnati manager Sparky Anderson, the program's
spokesman. ``There is no answer. That's why baseball is the
greatest mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis said that banned players, including Pete Rose, are
eligible for the team but would not be able to participate in any
ceremonies or functions.

<P>
   FAME-CONCEPT (Undated) _ Has the concept of fame shifted in the
past decade? Has Andy Warhol's ``everyone will be famous for 15
minutes'' become a cultural cliche? Today the Warholian trajectory
of fame has been reversed: instead of the ordinary becoming famous,
the famous seem to become more ordinary, more like us. In
entertainment, politics and social mores, the high and mighty are
tumbling all around us, or so true celebrities would have us think.
By Caryn James.

   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ORFEU-FILM (Rio De Janeiro, Brazil) _ Even before he emerged as
a torchbearer of the Cinema Novo movement here in the 1960s, the
director Carlos ``Caca'' Diegues yearned to film the myth of
Orpheus and Eurydice. Over the years, he admits, as he was working
on the 13 movies on his resume, including ``Bye-Bye Brazil'' and
``Xica da Silva,'' images of what a Brazilian version of the myth
would look and sound like constantly filled his imagination. Now,
after more than 40 years of dreams, delays and dashed hopes, his
persistence has paid off: ``Orfeu'' is showing in Brazilian
theaters and may be released later by Warner Bros. in the United
States. By Larry Rohter. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HAUNTING-FILM (Nicasio, Calif.) _ ``The Haunting,'' directed by
Jan De Bont, is the second film adaptation of Shirley Jackson's
novel ``The Haunting of Hill House''(Robert Wise directed a 1963
version), and once again Hill House is meant to sound as
frightening as it looks. From its eerie opening scenes, ``The
Haunting,'' set to open on July 23, is layered with the sounds of
inhuman conversations _ between wood and air, between stone and
glass, and between an evil entity and its tormented victims. By
Justine Elias. &QL;

<P>
   ARTURO-UI-THEATER (Undated) _ Next month, the renowned German
troupe Berliner Ensemble will bring the production of Bertolt
Brecht's ``The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui'' to Berkeley and Los
Angeles. Brecht's drama, a parable about the rise of the Nazis,
thinly disguised as Mafiosi and gang members (the characters Giri
and Givola are Goering and Goebbels), will be presented in a
successful 1995 production by the company's director Heiner Muller
who died that same year. By Anne Midgette. &QL;

   &UR; DANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JONES/ZANE-DANCE (Riverside, Calif.) _ History has neglected
Arnie Zane, co-founder of the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance
Company. His partnership with Jones produced the paradigmatic
post-modern repertory of the 1980s, but after his death from AIDS
in 1988 and the notoriety of Jones's subsequent career, Zane faded
into a shadow legend, invoked less as artistic innovator than
tragic hero. Paradoxically, it is an exhibition of Zane's
photography _ a solo pursuit predating his entry into dance via
Jones _ that promises to revive Zane the choreographer. By Ann
Daly. &QL;

<P>
   BMG-DIGITAL-CDS (Undated) _ BMG's new High Performance series at
the bargain price of $12 per CD promises digital revelation for
classic recordings from deep within the vault of RCA Victor Red
Seal. The new project, headed by a veteran engineer, Nathaniel S.
Johnson, is something of a higher-tech sequel to BMG's compact disk
revival of the RCA ``Living Stereo'' series, which helped to launch
stereophonic sound in the late 1950s and early 60s. By Lawrence B.
Johnson. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ALCIDE-OPERA (Undated) _ In a new recording, a group of singers
and instrumentalists from Lviv in newly independent Ukraine has
lovingly resurrected ``Alcide,'' an opera by Dmitri Bortniansky, a
distinguished native of the Ukrainian village of Glukhov who never
thought of himself as a Ukrainian, and who spent most of his life
trying to forget he ever saw the place. Bortniansky wrote
``Alcide'' to an Italian text by the great librettist Pietro
Metastasio during his apprentice years in Bologna, where he was
studying at the expense of the German-born, French-speaking Russian
Empress Catherine the Great. Performed in Venice (once only) in
1778, when the composer was 27, the score now rests in the British
Library. By Richard Taruskin. &QL;

Latin culture, especially its music. By Peter Watrous.

<P>
   JENNIFER-LOPEZ-ALBUM (New York) _ The title of the actress
Jennifer Lopez's recently released debut album, ``On the Six,''
reflects the cross-cultural experience of her formative years, the

baseball, there would have been a ticker tape parade in his honor.

CISNEROS LAWYERS RENEW ATTACK ON FORMER MISTRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Note optional trim)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawyers for former Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros
produced documents in federal court Tuesday showing that his former
mistress planned to ``aggressively market'' taped telephone
conversations for television publicity and possibly a book and
movie deal.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Linda Jones, denied knowledge of any book or movie
offers, but admitted that her attorneys hired a Dallas public
relations specialist to place in the media her story about her
extramarital affair and financial arrangement with Cisneros.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two attorneys thought the case should be generating more
money,'' said Jones, formerly known by her married name Linda
Medlar.
</P>
<P>
   Jones testified she received $15,000 for an interview with
television show ``Inside Edition'' and signed an agreement that
would give attorneys Floyd Holder and Bruce Magness, both of
Lubbock, Texas, a 25 percent share in any book or movie deals and
royalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were going to aggressively market the tapes and do a book
and do a movie?'' Brendan Sullivan, Cisneros' lawyer, asked during
a hearing in U.S. District Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew they were entertaining offers from television, but I
didn't know anything about a book or a movie,'' Jones replied.
</P>
<P>
   She testified for a second day in a hearing to determine whether
34 tapes of her telephone conversations with Cisneros can be
entered into evidence in the Sept. 7 conspiracy trial against
Cisneros, the second member of President Clinton's Cabinet to be
tried on ethics charges.
</P>
<P>
   Former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was cleared in December
of 30 counts of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes form the crux of Independent Counsel David Barrett's
case against Cisneros, who is accused of orchestrating a conspiracy
with aides to conceal from the FBI $250,000 in payments to Jones.
The FBI conducted a background probe in 1993 into his nomination to
head the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros and the aides, John Rosales and Sylvia Arce-Garcia,
have pleaded not guilty to the charges that carry a maximum
sentence of five years upon conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros and the aides did not attend the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan attacked Jones's credibility after she told District
Judge Stanley Sporkin that she erased portions of the tapes where
she threatened to expose Cisneros' then-unknown financial agreement
to provide her $4,000 a month after their affair ended.
</P>
<P>
   She said her lawyers, Holder and Magness, told her the threats
could prove to be trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was threats that could be termed as extortion,'' Jones said
in explaining her editing. ``It had been indicated to me that I
could get into legal problems, if there was extortion or if it
looked like extortion,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones originally signed an immunity agreement with Barrett, who
yanked the deal and indicted her on 28 counts of fraud after she
lied about the origins and authenticity of the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   She pleaded guilty to those charges and is currently serving a 3
1/2-year sentence in the Carswell Federal Medical Center, a prison
facility in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Jones agreed to testify for the government against Cisneros in
exchange for a reduction in her sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a nightmare for you personally?'' Sullivan asked.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, now 50, admitted the case has been a hardship on her, a
daughter and other family members.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to get back to your daughter, understandably, don't
you?'' Sullivan asked her.
</P>
<P>
   His questions were an attempt to raise doubts about her motives
for taping Cisneros and to paint her as selfish and greedy for
seeking money while Cisneros' newborn son, John Paul, was in need
of heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Paul's illness haunted Henry Cisneros, didn't it?''
Sullivan continued.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros made the affair public in 1988, when he was mayor of
San Antonio and a promising Democratic Party prospect for higher
office.
</P>
<P>
   Disclosure of the affair forced Jones into a hospital where she
became dependent on an anti-depressant medicine. She underwent
detoxification while in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros, 52, was HUD secretary from 1993 to 1996. He is
currently president of the Los Angeles-based, Spanish-language
television network Univision.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jones said Cisneros became aware of her drug dependency during
counseling sessions that Cisneros paid for with cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to get through this with our relationship in tact,''
she told the court.
</P>
<P>
   Both had contemplated divorce when the affair was disclosed.
Jones was divorced by husband, Stan Medlar, a San Antonio jeweler,
and Cisneros separated from his wife, Mary Alice.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said she was irate when she read in the press that
Cisneros, following gallbladder surgery in Houston, announced he
and Mary Alice had reconciled. Jones said he was then living at her
San Antonio home.
</P>
<P>
   The taping began when Cisneros was entertaining an offer to join
Clinton's Cabinet in 1993. She said she feared Cisneros would skip
out on their souring relationship and his financial pledge to
support her.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said she first concealed the authenticity of the tapes and
her editing of sensitive topics, on the advice of Holder and
Magness, who were her attorneys in a civil suit against Cisneros
for breach of contract.
</P>
<P>
   After deleting passages she deemed hurtful to her case, Jones
made a second set of tapes that she palmed off as the originals to
FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
   She also misled Internal Revenue Service agents and prosecutors
for the independent counsel's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Jones appeared collected when she recalled the web she created
with repeated lies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like getting yourself into a box and not knowing how to
get of it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan is expected to continue his cross-examination when the
hearing continues Wednesday. Cisneros' lawyers also plan to call a
government tape expert to testify all the tapes have been tampered
with.
</P>
<P>
   Sporkin rejected Tuesday a second request by Cisneros's lawyer
Barry Simon to close the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would just be improper to close the hearing. I see no basis
for it,'' the judge said.

 &HT;    Legendary Georgia coach Bazemore dies
 &HT;    By Darryl Maxie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The man who succeeded Wright Bazemore as Valdosta,
Ga.'s football coach 28 years ago was run out of town because he
won only 17 of 20 games.
</P>
<P>
   The successor's successor, Nick Hyder, who would carve his own
legend, was referred to as ``the new coach'' _ and he'd only been
on the job for 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the shadow cast by August Wright Bazemore, who won 14
state championships, a share of three national titles and in 28
seasons turned a south Georgia town into the nation's capital for
high school football.
</P>
<P>
   Bazemore died of congestive heart failure Tuesday at South
Georgia Medical Center in Valdosta. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   Bazemore went into the emergency room Monday night complaining
of leg pains. He had needed an aortic valve replacement earlier in
the year, but decided to forgo that after consulting with
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Bazemore's funeral will be Friday at 3 p.m. at Park Avenue
United Methodist Church, Valdosta. He is to be buried in Sunset
Hill Cemetery. Carson McLane Funeral Home is in charge of
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight years after Bazemore coached his last game _ a
62-12 rout of Avondale High for the 1971 Class AAA title _ the
legacy of the state's eighth-winningest coach remains apparent. The
current coach, Mike O'Brien, says he feels it.
</P>
<P>
   At Valdosta, it's win or hit the road _ a point brought home by
Charlie Greene's two-year stint following Bazemore's retirement in
1972 and 1973, when his teams went 17-3 but failed to win even a
region championship. Bazemore's efforts have propelled Valdosta
into the nation's winningest high school football program with 768
victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no way to be able to do what he does, to win all
those championships, to even compare,'' O'Brien, only the school's
fourth coach in 53 years, said Tuesday. ``I don't try to. He built
it up. He's the one that set the tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   The school's football field was renamed Bazemore-Hyder Stadium
in 1996 shortly after the death of Hyder, who won seven state and
three national titles in 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hyder knew his place in the Valdosta pecking order and
recounted it some 14 years after he succeeded Greene.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two nice little old ladies came up to me,'' Hyder said
in 1987. `` `Are you Nick Hyder?' they asked. I said I was. Then
they said, just as serious as could be, `Oh, it's so nice to meet
the new coach.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, in May 1989, Bazemore suffered a stroke that
left him partially paralyzed and virtually unable to speak. He
regained partial use of his limbs during a stay at the
Roosevelt-Warm Springs Rehabilitation, where president Franklin D.
Roosevelt often visited.
</P>
<P>
   Though getting around was much more difficult, Bazemore
faithfully attended Wildcats games, including O'Brien's first state
championship last December. Those who sat near him during games,
said the stroke had done nothing to impair his mind four years
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wright still watches a game like a coach,'' Buck Thomas, who
took over the program from 1942-45 while Bazemore served in World
War II, said in 1993. ``He sees the whole field and is always a
play ahead. When he likes something, he'll give me a thumb up. When
he doesn't, it's a thumb down.''
</P>
<P>
   Bazemore built a 268-51-7 record (an .833 winning percentage) by
knowing how to motivate his players, by using innovative strategies
and by enforcing a strict code of discipline that forbade drinking
and smoking and mandated church attendance.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, as Valdosta was reloading for its third consecutive
state title, Bazemore overheard some of his players talking about a
newspaper article speculating on how many of them would get college
scholarships. He gave them a lesson in humility instead.
</P>
<P>
   He sat them on a bench during practice, gave them pens and
pencils and said, ``Sign your autographs and all those college
scholarships you'll get.'' Then, he kicked them off the team and
hid just beyond the practice-field fence to see how they'd respond.
</P>
<P>
   The boys worked out on their own until after dark that day and
earned a reprieve. That team went on to finish 12-0 and won its
first national crown. The Wildcats also shared a 1969 national
title with Coral Gables, Fla., and won it outright in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Bazemore's teams reached the state championship game 17 times
during his career, losing only twice _ in 1950 and in 1955. The
Wildcats tied for the 1969 title with Athens (formerly Clark
Central High).
</P>
<P>
   Bazemore built the Wildcats into a such a power that ``we used
to have 60-year-old ladies come to our games and sit on 10-foot
high fences,'' he said. ``And the preachers used to call to check
our home schedule to make sure they didn't have their revivals at
the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the secret of his success was instilling Valdosta
football techniques into aspiring elementary school-level players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know who my quarterback is going to be from the sixth grade
on,'' Bazemore once said.
</P>
<P>
   It's a practice Valdosta follows to this day.
</P>
<P>
   Bazemore's coaching career began at Waycross, where he was an
assistant in 1938 and 1939, and moved to Valdosta in 1940, where he
assisted Billy Hooks for a season. He took over as head coach in
1942 and would coach the next three decades, except for three years
in the Navy during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Even his time in the military proved fruitful to his coaching
career. Bazemore once noted how ships would fan out on attack
patterns and used that observation to devise punt-coverage schemes.
</P>
<P>
   He was honored in 1970 as National Coach of the Year and
inducted in 1988 into the National High School Sports Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   He had several opportunities to advance into the college ranks,
but declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I could take it, all that hanging in effigy when
you lose,'' Bazemore said in 1969, referring to his prospects of
coaching in college. ``Besides, I like it here. It's a good town,
and I made up my mind years ago that I was content to stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   Born Aug. 1, 1916, in Fitzgerald, Ga., Bazemore became a star
athlete at Fitzgerald High, lettering in football, basketball,
track and tennis all four years. Twice during his senior year, he
scored 10 touchdowns in a game, earning him a mention in the
syndicated newspaper feature, ``Ripley's Believe it or Not.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by Bettie Louise Fowler Bazemore, his wife of 48
years, a son, Curtis W. Bazemore of Lawrenceville, Ga.; two
daughters, Connie Hyde of Denver, Colo., and Pam Davis of Valdosta;
a brother, Charles Bazemore of Denver, Colo.; a sister, Valeria
Conner of New Smyrna Beach, Fla.; and four grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you if I was a writer and sat down to write my life
all over, there's not one single line I would change,'' Bazemore
said in 1978. ``It's been good and I was just a guy who happened to
have everything happen just right for me. And I happened to find a
place like this to have it happen to me.''

NATO COMMANDER WANTS KOSOVO DEPLOYMENT ACCELERATED, POSSIBLY
INCREASED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS    c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ With acts of violence and retribution
continuing in Kosovo, NATO's senior commander, Gen. Wesley Clark,
said Tuesday that the allies should speed up the deployment of
their troops to the Serbian province and suggested that more than
the 50,000 peacekeepers originally planned might be needed.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's force in Kosovo now includes 19,500 soldiers, and it is
growing by 1,000 a day. But the NATO-led troops are still
confronted with sporadic killings and worsening confrontations
between ethnic Albanians and Serbs in cities and villages across
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, who visited Macedonia on Tuesday with President Clinton,
called upon the NATO allies to move more quickly to flood Kosovo
with peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am calling on NATO governments to accelerate the arrival of
the troops to the greatest possible extent,'' he said in an
interview with Reuters. ``There are not enough troops in there
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark said there was ``room for more,'' but he emphasized that
the priority now was to send in the troops already promised.
</P>
<P>
   The general could not be reached Tuesday night to expand upon
his comments.
</P>
<P>
   He had repeatedly pressed for more aggressive action in NATO's
air war against Yugoslavia, sometimes to the annoyance of the
United States and other NATO members. And his remarks Tuesday
underscored the volatility that remains in Kosovo and the
difficulty NATO is having controlling it.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO troops have become increasingly visible in Kosovo's
major cities, especially the capital, Pristina, many smaller, more
remote villages racked by tensions between returning Albanian
Kosovar refugees and the remaining Serbs have yet to see more than
occasional patrols.
</P>
<P>
   In Mitrovica, Serbs have declared a ``Serbian zone'' from the
city north to the border with the rest of Serbia and are blocking
Albanians from returning to their homes. French soldiers have
failed to defuse the situation. Their commanders acknowledged that
they are handicapped by the fact that their entire contingent has
not yet arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The war ended before NATO had assembled its entire peacekeeping
forces in Macedonia and Albania. In the last weeks of the war,
Clark advocated moving more quickly to build up the force so that
it would be ready to move in, but Only about 15,000 troops had
arrived by the time Serbia accepted NATO's terms.
</P>
<P>
   Even in towns where NATO troops have been deployed, like Grace,
there have been repeated scenes of Albanians looting and burning
the homes of Serbs who have fled.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Monday, the NATO commander in Kosovo, Lt.
Gen. Michael Jackson of Britain, appealed for calm. ``The important
thing is to reduce tensions through maintaining a physical
presence,'' he said when asked about the situation in Grace in
particular.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven days after the first NATO troops poured into Kosovo,
Britain has by far the most troops deployed, with 8,500. The United
States now has 3,500, roughly half the 7,000 the Clinton
administration pledged. The other major allies have been slower to
build up. Germany and Italy each have about 2,000 troops at this
point, but they control sectors in the western part of the
province, where the worst destruction occurred. France, which
controls the northwest, has 1,700 troops.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials have said it could be the end of July before the
entire force of 50,000 arrives, joined by some 3,600 Russians.

IN MACEDONIA, CLINTON HEARS REFUGEES' TALES OF HORROR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

<P>
   STENKOVEC CAMP, Macedonia _ In the shadow of Kosovo, President
Clinton on Tuesday came to meet face-to-face with the people on
whose behalf he had fought the war. He heard their stories of
brutality and vowed that he would help make their homeland safe.
</P>
<P>
   The visit to this muddy refugee camp, now emptying at the rate
of more than 1,000 people a day, was planned while the NATO air
attacks were at their peak and an end to the war seemed far away.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, this camp, the first established in Macedonia and
once overflowing with 30,000 refugees, was in the throes of closing
down and in several weeks will most likely be an empty,
trash-strewn field.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton could have made this visit a stirring conclusion to a
conflict that caught the imagination at home only fitfully but
represented survival to the Albanian Kosovars who escaped Serbian
brutality to find shelter here.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, standing on a crude wooden box and without the
trappings of the White House podium, Clinton spoke in muted tones
to a crowd of several hundred refugees, their faces now brighter at
the prospect of going home, though often to homes burned and looted
by the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are committed not only to making Kosovo safe but to helping
people rebuild their lives, rebuild their communities and then
helping Kosovo and all the countries of the region,'' he said
during his speech of a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was here in
May, and their daughter Chelsea, the president visited a selected
group of refugees whose well-spruced tents were at the entrance to
the camp. He heard first-hand a version of a story that had been
told repeatedly on television and newspapers since nearly 1 million
Albanian Kosovars were forced over the borders in late March.
</P>
<P>
   Idriz Macastena, 29, his wife, Nerimane, 26, with their son,
Besart, 4, described their escape from their home near Podujevo, in
northern Kosovo, soon after the NATO bombing started.
</P>
<P>
   Macastena described how they fled to a nearby village in the
mountains, and then how, as they tried to leave in a convoy of cars
and tractors for Pristina, the capital, the Serbs attacked. ``Sixty
people were massacred,'' Macastena said.
</P>
<P>
   In his account to reporters, before Clinton arrived, Macastena,
a carpenter, said the Serbs took one man from each of the vehicles
in the second half of the convoy and killed them.
</P>
<P>
   After reaching Pristina, Macastena told Clinton, his family
stayed for five weeks. Yugoslav army soldiers surrounded the
building where they were staying, he said, beat many of the
Albanian Kosovars and threatened their son, Besart, with a knife
and a lighted cigarette held to his neck.
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Clinton told Macastena's wife, Nerimane, that her son
_ decked out in clean white jeans and a vest for the occasion _ was
a ``beautiful boy,'' the mother replied: ``He's still very much
afraid. He has suffered very much. He has seen people killed and
wounded.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the refugees at the camp, some of the Macastena
family had already returned to Kosovo, the couple told the
Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the refugees, Clinton had other business here: dealing
with the leaders of Macedonia whose country was economically
battered by the war. Clinton met with President Kiro Gligorov and
pledged, as Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had done 10 days
before, that the West would help restore the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced a gift of $12 million in food commodities,
assistance that some officials described as modest given the
dramatic economic decline here and the attention paid by Clinton's
visit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said clothing manufacturer Liz Claiborne would reopen
Macedonian factories so that 2,000 to 3,000 Macedonians could work
again.
</P>
<P>
   With a population of 2.2 million, Macedonia took care of some
300,000 Albanian Kosovar refugees during the war, a burden that
threatened the ethnic balance between the Slav majority and the
Albanian minority. Macedonia's trade, largely dependent on
transportation through Serbia, was decimated by the war and there
were concerns that the fledgling democracy would be seriously
destabilized.
</P>
<P>
   For this high price, Gligorov has been asking for a big reward
from the United States _ membership in NATO and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Gligorov has been publicly skeptical of Washington's promises of
economic assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Gligorov, a former Communist who serves with a young reformer,
Prime Minister Ljubcho Georgievski, on Tuesday boasted of
Macedonia's resilience under the pressure of the last three months,
and reiterated, in front of Clinton, his request for NATO and
European Union membership.

GRISLY FIND IN FLORIDA POND RESOLVES MYSTERY OF MISSING MEN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ATTLEBORO, Mass. _ They were three buddies on vacation in the
sun, blue-collar bachelors who jumped into a shiny sport-utility
vehicle near Disney World last fall and vanished without a trace.
Until now.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the $5,000 reward, Internet bulletins, the powers of
a pyschic, and aerial searches did not matter. Scott Renquin, 35,
Dan Nelson, 32, and Roger DesVergnes, 31, did not disappear into
some mysterious mist.
</P>
<P>
   The Attleboro men apparently died in 16 feet of water, their
1999 GMC Jimmy upside down in a man-made retention pond near a bend
in the road in an affluent Florida community called Celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just find it hard to believe they couldn't get out of the
car,'' said Paul Renquin, Scott's brother. ``Were they all knocked
out or something? My brother was a SCUBA diver. These were all
strong guys. It boggles my mind that they couldn't get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Their families, who tried unsuccessfully to drain themselves of
grief over nine months of uncertainty, are not waiting for
authorities to positively identify the three bodies found in the
same truck Renquin rented at the Orlando airport last September.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning we had a little bit of hope,'' said Roxanne
DesVergnes, whose brother was the father of three. ``We tried to
encourage each other with anything we thought was positive. But we
needed to have the closure for the kids' benefit. They now know
that their dad is in a better place.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida authorities expect to be able to positively identify the
three men as early as Wednesday through dental records shipped from
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery of the submerged truck late Monday capped a
nine-month ordeal for friends and relatives of the men, who shared
a love of the water and outdoor adventure. The men left behind $200
worth of burgers and beers, hot dogs and chips in the
pink-and-white Orlando time-share apartment of which Renquin was
part owner.
</P>
<P>
   As far as investigators can tell, the three men made plans on
Sept. 28 to get together two days later with a boyhood friend of
Renquin's, now living in an Orlando suburb. They were never heard
from again.
</P>
<P>
   Police do not know how the men found themselves on the long
country road to Celebration, a planned community opened by Disney
in 1994, but investigators said Tuesday they might have gotten lost
looking for an on-ramp to Interstate 4.
</P>
<P>
   The posted speed limit is 35 mph, but motorists usually drive
faster, and if they miss the turn could end up in the water. Police
have received a number of complaints, including one that led
Orlando police to ask for a search of the pond, which is in the
neighboring county of Osceola.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a call from a dentist who said he was driving along
talking to his wife when he realized he'd missed the turn and
nearly skidded over the curb and into the pond,'' said Detective
Barbara Bergin, the lead investigator. ``He suggested we search the
pond.''
</P>
<P>
   Police had pulled at least eight automobiles out of the pond, an
isolated spot favored as a dumping place for car thieves, in the
last six months without ever sighting the GMC Jimmy.
</P>
<P>
   The Attleboro victims' SUV jumped the curb with enough speed
that it settled to the bottom about 100 feet from the water's edge.
``The driver may have fallen asleep, and when someone falls asleep
at the wheel, the vehicle starts to accelerate,'' said Sgt. Darryl
Farrar of the Orlando Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the SUV's air bags did not deploy. ``We may
never know who was driving because none of the men was wearing a
seatbelt and the bodies were out of their seats,'' said Lt. Chuck
Williams of the Florida Highway Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   DesVergnes, who ran a small construction company in Attleboro
and was engaged to be married this autumn, suddenly stopped his
daily phone calls that delivered details back home such as the
quality of his lamb-chop dinner or that afternoon's adventure on
the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a free-spirited guy and a loving father,'' said
Paulette Rioux, his sister. ``He'd give you the shirt off his back.
Your priorities were his priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, a machinist who worked in Rhode Island, put in overtime
to support his 5-year-old son who lived with him. He had been
expected at his sister's nuptials in Warwick, R.I., on Oct. 4, two
days after the Florida trip was to have concluded. When he missed
the Oct. 3 rehearsal dinner and then the wedding, where his son
served as ringbearer, his family became alarmed.
</P>
<P>
   Renquin, who ran an auto body business and was certified pilot
and a Mr. Fix-it type, left behind a note in his Attleboro
apartment which read: ``If anything happens to me when I'm away,
then everything I own is to be left to my parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past months, as his family worked to dissolve his
business and rental property, they've learned the note has legal
weight.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Renquin said the news of his brother's death will help
silence some of the demons he's lived with since Scott Renquin
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke up once in the middle of the night just bawling,'' he
said. ``I had this dream that Scott walked into my house. He came
into the kitchen and sat down. I walked over to one of the counters
and backed up to it. He's sitting there and I look down at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I said, `Scott, how's Florida?' And he looked up at me
with the scariest look and all of a sudden he was gone. He just
vanished.''
</P>
<P>
   Along a rural stretch of Lindsey Road, an enclave of sorts for
the DesVergnes family whose members live in separate homes there,
family members spoke of dreams, too, when Roger would once again
take his place at family gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just glad that we finally know,'' said Roxanne
DesVergnes, who said she's troubled by lingering questions. ``Now,
they're building a stone wall which wasn't there at the time of the
accident. We'd like to get some questions answered. Obviously, this
was a bad curve.''
</P>
<P>
   Those questions were being posed in Florida Tuesday, too, where
a spokeswoman for the Celebration Company, the Disney subsidiary
that is developing the land there, said the company is no more free
to make changes to a county road than any other citizen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have plans for walls, fencing and landscaping,'' said
Marilyn Waters, Celebration's director of communications, but those
plans have to work there way through the standard approval and
permitting processes.
</P>
<P>
   Waters took exception to broadcast reports that Disney had
hampered police searches of the pond. It was about two months ago
that investigators first decided to search the pond.
</P>
<P>
   Sources in the Osceola County Fire-Rescue Department said the
two-month delay was due to staffing shortages caused by wildfires
that have burned about 1 million acres in Florida since last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless it's an emergency, we have to think about our overtime
budget,'' said one Osceola fire chief.

 &HT;    MELT DOWN: Mysteriously, the skills vanish _ an athlete's worst
nightmare
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When you live in the Australian city of Sanctuary
Cove, your world is supposed to be serene. The city's name conjures
up images of a safe haven, a real-life utopia unsullied by
real-world problems. By reputation, it is a place to retreat, soak
up some sun and solace and toss another shrimp on the barbee, a
place where neighbors prefer to discuss nothing more serious than
the weather.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Sanctuary Cove is all those things to Ian
Baker-Finch, whose golf game deteriorated so disastrously after his
1991 British Open championship that he walked away from the sport
almost five years later at age 37.
</P>
<P>
   But he was not able to walk away from the persistent questions:
How could Baker-Finch and other athletes like him, who spent years
developing finely tuned mechanics, unravel in a moment's notice?
</P>
<P>
   Baker-Finch can't speak for everyone; he still doesn't have the
answer for his own problem: He cannot hit a golf ball anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, you're the last one to see (the problems)
coming,'' he said. ``Maybe it's just a classic rationalization, but
you always believe the next swing is going to be the one that pulls
you out of it. Instead, it's more like quicksand. The harder you
try to break out of it, the faster it pulls you down. You feel like
you're alone, simply trying to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   The quick demise of Baker-Finch might be the extreme. But
examples of professional athletes who hit the psychological wall _
one day the game is there; the next day it's gone _ appear to be on
the increase.
</P>
<P>
   It was graphically demonstrated recently by the decline of
former Atlanta Braves pitcher Mark Wohlers, whose rehabilitation
attempt has been painful to watch. But the disintegration of
Wohlers, who got the last out in the franchise's only World Series
championship in 1995, is just one of many sports meltdowns.
</P>
<P>
   _ Steve Blass pitched a complete-game victory for the Pittsburgh
Pirates in the seventh game of the 1971 World Series and two years
later couldn't throw a strike.
</P>
<P>
   _ Steve Sax spent 14 major-league seasons playing second base
for four different teams, but he went through a stretch with the
Los Angeles Dodgers in which he couldn't make the simple throw to
first base.
</P>
<P>
   _ Former Buffalo Bills kicker Scott Norwood missed the potential
game-winning field goal in the last seconds of Super Bowl XXV. A
year after he pushed a 47-yard attempt wide right, he was released.
</P>
<P>
   _ Former Braves standout Dale Murphy was moved from catcher to
the outfield, in part because he couldn't throw the ball back to
the pitcher. Asked about the strange aversion, Murphy still
couldn't offer an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Atlanta Falcons used a third-round draft choice on
Appalachian State punter Harold Alexander in 1993. Alexander
averaged a nifty 43.3 yards as a rookie, fell off to 39.9 yards the
following season and by 1995 was back home in Pickens, S.C., his
confidence shattered beyond repair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a guy who should have lasted 10 or 12 years in the
league and been a Pro Bowl (punter),'' former Falcons special teams
coach Bobby April said. ``After he got past that first training
camp and all the harassment he got from Jerry Glanville, he should
have been OK. But instead he went south. I mean, just like that, it
all disappeared. For me, it might always be one of the all-time
mysteries.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the drop from excellent to eccentric is so dramatic in
such cases, it often is blamed as much on the player's mind as on
his mechanics. As a result, the role of sports psychologist, once a
sideline, has expanded tremendously. More than half of the NFL's 31
teams list a team psychologist in their directory.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them deal primarily with such matters as career
counseling and IQ tests. But a few are forced to confront and treat
the kinds of career collapses suffered by Baker-Finch and Wohlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you are, you're usually stepping into tough
territory, mostly because of who you're dealing with,'' said Robert
Crowley, a clinical psychologist who helped salvage Sax's career in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The popular perception of the professional athlete is that of
a hardened person,'' Crowley said. ``The truth is, they take their
problems even harder than most 'civilians' would. It's hard for
them to accept something is wrong. A lot of times, the simplest
explanation is rendered complex because there's such ego involved.
It's a tricky deal, sometimes, trying to get to the nut of the
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists and players agree that the cases of players who
suddenly lose effectiveness are different from those who have
battled long phobias. Shaquille O'Neal, for instance, never has
been a strong free-throw shooter, so his annual shortcomings at the
foul line probably don't affect him as much. Had he been a 75
percent foul shooter who suddenly couldn't hit 50 percent, the
situation would be different.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Crowley said, the problem is not identified and just
goes away. When former Rookie of the Year Sax arrived in Crowley's
office in 1983 _ midway through a season in which he committed a
league-high 30 errors, more than half of them on throwing miscues _
he was more than just another patient in denial. Sax, 23, was a
high-profile performer in a town filled with celebrities, and his
career was collapsing around him.
</P>
<P>
   Sax, now a Fox Sports analyst, offered an emotional assessment
of Wohlers' problems during an on-air appearance last month. He
said his emotions for Wohlers' plight went way beyond sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having been through something similar, it's more like
empathy,'' he said. ``To have the rug pulled out on you like that,
it's a tough thing. When you've experienced it, then it's even
harder to watch from afar. (Steve) Blass and I have discussed it.
We agree that it's hard for most people to understand how you can
have it all going for you one minute and, poof, it's gone the next
minute. It's an ego-deflating experience, let me tell you. If
there's no one to help you, going it alone is devastating. You
really do become a head case.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Lufton, a Long Island psychologist who has treated several
athletes, said that people who earn a living with their bodies
characteristically overreact to any kind of physical dysfunction.
The slightest hint of faulty technique, he said, can trigger all
sorts of insecurities. As the mechanical problems persist, the
player loses confidence and treats every appearance as a must-win
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure to succeed is intense enough to begin with,''
Lufton said. ``For a guy who is going bad, whose confidence is
sliding, it increases exponentially with every bad outing. Just as
with any profession, different guys react different ways to
pressure. But for an athlete, hitting the wall tends to be a more
humbling thing than it would be for, maybe, a construction worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the people whose lives revolve around esteem,'' Lufton
said, ``losing the confidence of your teammates and then your own
self-esteem is a terrible thing to try and handle.''
</P>
<P>
   During the first six years of his NFL career, Norwood converted
74.2 percent of his field-goal attempts. After missing the kick
that would have given Buffalo a 22-20 victory over the New York
Giants in Super Bowl XXV, Norwood retreated to his home in Virginia
and declined all interview requests.
</P>
<P>
   The following year in training camp, he talked only in
generalities about the miss, then made 18 of 29 field goal tries,
62.1 percent, during the 1991 season. The Bills signed free-agent
Steve Christie the next spring, and Norwood never kicked in another
NFL game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ancient history,'' Norwood said recently. ``(It's) not
worth dredging up.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Baker-Finch won at Royal Birkdale with weekend rounds
of 64 and 66, including birdies on five of the first seven holes on
Sunday and a front-side score of 29.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a stretch in which Baker-Finch failed to make a single
cut on the American tour for three consecutive years. In a two-year
period, he averaged $76 per tournament. His driver abandoned him
and he put more pressure on his short game. It became an agonizing
struggle. After the 1995 British Open, Baker-Finch lost his will to
keep trying.
</P>
<P>
   While he refuses to use the word retirement to define his
current status, Baker-Finch is content to deal with his several
businesses in Australia, do commentary for television and
occasionally try again to understand what happened to him.
Resignation has replaced remorse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody, no matter what they do for a living, has had a run
where things didn't go right for them,'' he said. ``But when you're
out there on center stage, with the whole world watching you fall
apart _ that's a shattering experience, a helpless feeling.''

COURT UPHOLDS DECISION AGAINST BAY STATE'S ANTI-BURMA LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- A Massachusetts law barring the state from buying from
firms doing business in Burma was declared unconstitutional Tuesday
by a federal appeals court, a legal ruling that could cripple a
host of so-called selective purchasing laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a severe blow to the practice of state and local
governments using moral criteria to make financial decisions,''
said Simon Billenness, a pro-Burmese democracy activist in Boston
who helped guide the bill into law in 1996. ``The ruling will
divorce morality form state spending.''
</P>
<P>
   The First Circuit Court of Appeals said that federal policy on
Burma, which includes some sanctions, preempts the 1996
Massachusetts selective purchase law, as well as similar statutes
passed by more than 20 other state and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   The three-member court also ruled that the US Constitution
reserves the right of regulating foreign commerce to the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   The Burma law, which was the only state statute of its kind in
the country when it was passed, bars state contracts with firms
that do business in that Southeast Asian country, where a military
junta has crushed a democracy movement.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-junta activists said the decision is a serious setback to
efforts to use the financial resources of local and state
government to force changes overseas and in American foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
   But the court's ruling is a victory for the US State Department
and the Clinton administration's trade representatives, who were
facing strong opposition from foreign trading partners to the Burma
selective purchase laws.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the Massachusetts law took effect, the European
Commission and Japan threatened to take the issue to the World
Trade Organization, arguing that the statute violates US
obligations under trade treaties.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the State Department and the US Trade
Representative's office sent a delegation to the Massachusetts
State House to persuade the Weld administration and the Legislators
to scuttle the law.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-junta activists say the Massachusetts law has been cited by
several major American and international corporations in deciding
to close down operations in Burma. Among those firms are Apple
Computers, Levi Strauss, Eastman Kodak, Hewlett-Packard, Philips
Electronics, and a major Jampenese construction company, the
activists say.
</P>
<P>
   Billeness is a senior analyst at Trillium Assetts Management in
Boston, a social investment firm active in supporting the
Massachusetts Burma law. He said the ruling will prohibit state
governments from using their resources to help bring about
political and social changes as they did in the anti-apartheid
campaign of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially this ruling will require state and local
governments to do business with companies that support dictators,''
Billenness said.
</P>
<P>
   Selective purchasing laws aimed at other international issues
are in jeopardy because of the ruling, Billenness said. He cited
the sanctions against buying rain forest wood and attempts to force
American companies in Northern Ireland to abide by a set of
nondiscrimination policies in hiring.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Byron Rushing, a Democrat and the bill's sponsor
on Beacon Hill, said the court's ruling flies in the face of a long
standing tradition that has allowed states and local governments to
express their opinions on US foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had rulings like this in the '70s and '80s, the United
States would not have been able to participate in the
anti-apartheid movement,'' Rushing said. ``I am glad these judges
weren't around then or (Nelson) Mandela might still be in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he expects the state to appeal the case to the US
Supreme court, where, he said, the law could be reinstated.

 &HT;    BellSouth watches as Qwest battles for deal
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth Corp. again stands at the edge of the ring,
watching others tussle and holding back from a leap into the fray.
</P>
<P>
   The $23 billion-a-year Atlanta-based regional phone company sat
in the stands during one huge telecom merger after another. Now, it
is Qwest Communications struggling to keep its $55 billion bid
alive for U S West and Frontier Communications, both of which are
on record as preferring a competing offer from Global Crossing.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest, which has seen its stock pummeled since launching the
dual-takeover attempt, on Tuesday urged U S West to talk.
Meanwhile, Qwest continued lining up loans that would let it add
enough cash to force a conversation and worked Wall Street to lobby
for the plan. Qwest Chief Executive Joseph Nacchio also argued in a
letter to his targets that the Qwest offer is superior, especially
given a drop in Global Crossing stock.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth could conceivably plop enough cash on the table to
send Global Crossing home but has held itself aloof. And But
BellSouth does have a dog in this fight: The company this year
bought 10 percent of Denver-based Qwest.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth was apparently ambivalent about Nacchio making a run
at the two companies. Now, BellSouth has a stake in the outcome _
win or lose.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has long passed up the chance to bid on U S West, a
less-profitable Bell with a sparser region and a reputation for
customer service trouble.Because BellSouth put money into Qwest
looking for long-distance and high-speed lines, why buy Frontier?
</P>
<P>
   A successful Qwest bid will not only dilute BellSouth's
ownership, it will create a company of nearly equal size _ perhaps
big enough to buy BellSouth. BellSouth has long argued that bigger
is not always better, that what matters is value. Has anything
changed?
</P>
<P>
   Only the landscape. A series of deals has raised the specter of
a global industry dominated by a handful of ``supercarriers.''
Linked with a bulked-up Qwest, BellSouth might be muscular enough
to challenge the likes of AT&AMP;T, MCI WorldCom and Bell Atlantic _ if
that's what BellSouth wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It boils down to whether BellSouth sees itself as needing to
expand its scope, and that would be contrary to their philosophy up
to now,'' said Boyd Peterson, analyst with the Yankee Group.
``BellSouth has exhibited more restraint than its brethren. The
larger question is where they see themselves 10 years from now, and
that's the harder question.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has pegged much of its planning on delivery of
high-speed data. Qwest has added some juice to that strategy by
investing in RhythmsNet Connections Inc. and Covad Communications,
which also offer high-speed lines.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth's $3.5 billion current investment in Qwest has shrunk
by about $1 million, thanks to the drop in Qwest stock. That could
be a positive, since the cost of buying all of Qwest has also
fallen.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all, if Qwest stock continues to dip, it's a bargain,''
Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   Network World has reported that Qwest has been in merger talks
with BellSouth, a rumor that BellSouth will not confirm. A deal for
all of Qwest has been discounted because BellSouth and U S West _
like other regional Bells _ are still not permitted to offer
long-distance service in their regions. But Qwest has promised not
to offer long-distance in the U S West region should that deal go
through.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest could take the same pledge for the Southeast, said Mel
Marten, analyst at Edward Jones &AMP; Co. ``BellSouth could buy Qwest,
as long as they didn't offer long-distance service.''
</P>
<P>
   A purchase of Qwest could short-circuit discussion about U S
West and Frontier, companies in which BellSouth sees relatively
little strategic value. Qwest stock closed at $35.31 1/4 a share.
At that price, the 90 percent BellSouth does not own is worth about
$22.4 billion.

SMALLER BANKS NEXT, MERGER WATCHERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Now that New England's largest banks have morphed into
a heavyweight contender and a robust regional player, scores of
smaller institutions from Massachusetts to Maine are rethinking
their futures.
</P>
<P>
   Mergers are not just for banks with hundreds of billions of
dollars in assets, and smaller banks are likely to see a flurry of
combinations in coming years, industry observers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The probability that many of these smaller banks are going to
survive in their current form is slim,'' said Stanley Wells, a vice
chairman at Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods, an investment bank that
specializes in financial services.
</P>
<P>
   The logic that will send local community institutions into each
other's arms or force mergers of New England's two-dozen
billion-dollar banks is familiar.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, the savings and loan crisis and the dismantling of
restrictive interstate banking laws helped spark a first round of
consolidation. More recently, mergers in the financial services
industry have been fueled by drives to cut costs and gain market
share amid fierce competition. Such an eat-or-be-eaten philosophy,
which has spawned ever bigger banks, led Citizens Financial Group
to snap up US Trust on Monday, three months after Fleet Financial
Group paired with BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
   But the circumstances facing New England banks as they reassess
their positions have a particular cast.
</P>
<P>
   Uncertainty over who will own the assets that Fleet and
BankBoston are selling as part of their mega-combination into a
$160 billion institution is keeping many smaller banks on
tenterhooks. Local institutions want to know who is going to own
those deposits, branches, and loans _ nearly $14 billion worth _
before they ponder any deals.
</P>
<P>
   Banks are also concerned that the region's latest deal has
removed two prominent buyers from the acquisition ring, at least
for now. Citizens, now a $28-billion bank, is likely to be so busy
digesting US Trust and making a grab for the Fleet-BankBoston
assets that it may not be interested in buying more banks, bank
advisers said.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for People's Heritage Financial Group of Portland,
Maine, which recently bought Banknorth Group of Burlington, Vt. to
form a $17 billion bank and become the other mid-size bank in the
region, with the new Citizens.
</P>
<P>
   There are other factors that will figure in future mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Many attractive banks, like the $9.9 billion People's Mutual
Holding Co. of Bridgeport, Conn., are mutuals, meaning that they
are owned by depositors and cannot easily be acquired.
</P>
<P>
   Some mutuals, like the $1.9 billion Seacoast Financial Services
in New Bedford, have recently become publicly traded companies,
with listed shares that could make a transaction easier. But such a
conversion process usually leaves a bank off-limits to a merger for
several years.
</P>
<P>
   Other banks, including People's Heritage, are relatively big but
are focused on slow-growth markets like Vermont. And hundreds are
old-fashioned savings banks, with only a few branches.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some companies are already in play. New England Community
Bancorp, an $803 million bank based in Windsor, Conn., said
recently that it was in talks with potential suitors.
</P>
<P>
   James Moynihan, a senior vice president at stock brokerage
Advest Inc., is so certain that consolidation will accelerate in
coming years that he is creating a mutual fund-like product to
invest in stocks of smaller regional banks that he considers likely
to participate in mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Topping his list are Cape Cod Bank &AMP; Trust Co., a $1.8 billion
bank based in South Yarmouth.; the $1.6 billion Independent Bank
Corp. of Rockland; and Westbank Corp., a $355 million bank in West
Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``New England is totally overbanked, and I think we're going to
see a lot of deals before the year's end,'' Moynihan said. He said
new accounting rules that take effect next year will make mergers
more difficult and more costly, creating pressure to complete deals
by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to other areas, the six-state New England region has
more than 400 banks _ including 240 in Massachusetts _ with less
than $1 billion in deposits, a size that some observers consider a
cutoff point for qualifying as a community bank.
</P>
<P>
   Banks with less than $5 billion in assets control nearly one
quarter of the $233 billion in deposits held by all New England
banks, according to the Massachusetts Bankers Association, a trade
group. In a world where the nation's biggest bank, BankAmerica, has
more than $570 billion in assets, those deposits would collectively
constitute a single regional bank.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the question of what designs the big players
outside New England have upon the region. Giant banks are
scrambling to win a toehold through the Fleet-BankBoston
divestiture _ the largest in banking history _ and could eventually
even push to acquire Fleet-BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any significant out-of-region presence here,''
said Warren Heller, president of Veribanc Inc., a bank analysis
firm. ``There's probably someone out there who wants to capture
some of New England's rich store of banks.''
</P>
<P>
   But big players could conceivably eye the region's smaller,
billion-dollar banks, too. Indeed, of the nation's 50 biggest banks
in 1985, only 15 are still standing, Wells said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep that in mind,'' he added, ``when you speculate on the
fate of those $1 billion to $1 billion commercial banks.''

TREASURIES PRICES FALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Prices for Treasuries fell Tuesday as corporate
borrowers prepared to sell about $10 billion in debt. Traders and
analysts also said that expectations continued to weigh on the
market that the Federal Reserve will increase short-term rates at
its two-day policy meeting next week.
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive day, the yield on the benchmark
30-year bond stayed above 6 percent as market participants had more
reasons to sell securities than to buy them. The supply of debt
easily outstripped demand and the government and corporate issuers
came to market at the same time and found themselves competing for
cash.
</P>
<P>
   By the close of the New York cash market, the yield on the
30-year bond was 6.06 percent, up from 6.02 percent on Monday; its
price, which moves in the opposite direction, fell 15/32, to 88
31/32.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor Credit Co., Avis Rent a Car and other companies are
getting ready this week to sell debt before the Fed raises
short-term rates. Typically, underwriters issuing corporate debt
sell Treasuries from their portfolios as a hedge until their
corporate deals are done _ and thus put the Treasuries market under
pressure. After the corporate deals are completed, the securities
firms then buy back Treasuries and return them to their portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is expected to sell $3 billion to $6 billion worth of debt
in blocks to international investors. Neither the precise size nor
the timing of the sale have been set, but traders expect the deal
to occur this week.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Jones, an economist with Briefing.com, a market analysis
firm in Burlingame, Calif., said that the coming corporate and
government issues had the bond market focusing on the lack of
demand and higher rates. ``So with the Fed close to raising
short-term rates, it's not surprising why no one wants to step up
and buy new supply.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Treasury sold $10 billion of a new 52-week bill,
and it will auction $15 billion of a new two-year note Wednesday.
By late in the afternoon the note was being offered at a price to
yield 5.65 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The bill auction Tuesday was described as mediocre at best, with
the bills awarded at a rate of 4.89 percent, worse than expected.
The bid-to-cover ratio, or the number of bids compared with the
amount being sold, was 2.6 to 1, only marginally better than the
ratio last month but far less than the average ratio of 3.14 to 1
for the last 12 auctions.
</P>
<P>
   Treasuries were also being hurt by concern that the dollar may
decline in the coming months. This concern came after the release
earlier this month of figures that showed the Japanese economy grew
a greater-than-expected 1.9 percent in the first quarter. A weaker
dollar makes Treasury securities less appealing to international
investors who see their investments lose value when they convert
them into other currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Mexico sold its first euro-denominated issue, raising
400 million euro, or about $412.6 million, through J.P. Morgan &AMP;
Co. and Paribas. The yield on the seven-year bond was 9.625
percent, or about 337.5 basis points more than a comparable German
government security. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage
point.

SEN. HATCH SAYS HE WILL SEEK GOP PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Orrin Hatch, a Utah conservative who came to
Washington to battle Democratic liberals but has moved toward the
center on health and children's issues, said Tuesday that he would
seek the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of Senate hallway interviews, Hatch praised Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, acknowledging that the governor was the
favorite for the nomination. But the senator said that he would be
the party's best hope of defeating Vice President Al Gore if Bush
faltered.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch conceded that much of the party hierarchy was already
committed to Bush. But he said it could be desirable ``to have
someone who is not beholden to the Republican establishment,'' and
had a record like his of being able to work with Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to run because I'm tired of the divisiveness up
here,'' Hatch said. ``I think I can bring both sides together.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch's record over more than a decade of alliances with Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., on AIDS, children's health care and
summer jobs, has often angered Republicans more insistently
conservative than himself _ while still leaving moderates and
liberals doubtful or hostile.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, he has ignored demands
from the right to block all of President Clinton's judicial
nominees. But he has stalled enough of them to leave the
administration and the Democratic senators who picked them unhappy,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch sketched a brief presidential agenda as he moved from one
clump of reporters to another. He said he wanted to see the tax
code rewritten from thousands of pages to a few hundred and would
``strengthen our military.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``It's going to take presidential leadership and guts
to solve Social Security and Medicare.'' And he said he was
concerned ``about a racial breakdown in the country,'' and felt
that only a conservative Republican could prevent one.
</P>
<P>
   The 65-year-old lawyer, who won his first public office when he
was elected to the Senate in 1976, said it was not just his Capitol
Hill experience that qualified him for the presidency, but ``the
total experience I've had from birth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born in poverty,'' Hatch said. ``You're looking at a
former janitor who made 65 cents an hour working his way through
college.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said a formal announcement would come ``within the next
short while,'' and probably with no more ceremony than a press
release. He said he would not be running ``for ego, not for
self-aggrandizement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Utah Republican said: ``I'm planning on running. I know it's
late, but I don't think it's too late.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few people give me a chance,'' he said, ``but my life has
been a long string of surprises.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch's current Senate term ends in January 2001, but Utah law
would allow him to run for re-election and the presidency at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Bush, other Republicans already in various stages of
candidacy are former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander; Gary Bauer, a
Christian conservative activist; Pat Buchanan, a commentator;
Elizabeth Dole, a former Cabinet officer and head of the Red Cross;
Steve Forbes, a wealthy publisher; Rep. John Kasich of Ohio; Sens.
John McCain of Arizona and Robert Smith of New Hampshire; and
former Vice President Dan Quayle.

VIRGINIA INTERNET COMPANY BUYS INTO NEW ENGLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fast-growing Virginia Internet company PSINet Inc. is boosting
its presence in the Northeast, buying one of New England's oldest
and largest Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   PSINet has acquired The Internet Access Co. (TIAC) of
Woburn, &UR;  &LR; Mass., a privately-held firm that serves 33,000
individuals and businesses in Massachusetts, New Hampshire,
Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, and New Jersey. Financial
details of the purchase were not disclosed, and calls and
electronic mail messages to TIAC officials were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   According to a statement on the TIAC Web site, the company plans
to maintain offices in the New England area. TIAC will be operated
as a division of PSINet and will retain the TIAC name.
</P>
<P>
   Computer entrepreneur Tim Jackson founded TIAC in January 1994,
making it one of the first companies to sell Internet services to
homes and businesses. It rapidly became a major regional Internet
company.
</P>
<P>
   John Kraft, president of PSINet's northeast region, said TIAC is
ideally suited to his company's goal to become a leading Internet
provider in the world's top 20 markets for telecommunications
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a reputation for excellent customer service,'' said
Kraft, adding that TIAC has about 50 ``points of presence'' in the
region _ telephone numbers that allow customers to connect to the
Internet with a local phone call. The purchase of TIAC means that
PSINet customers will also be able to dial into these points of
presence, expanding PSINet's coverage area.
</P>
<P>
   PSINet plans to build an enhanced set of services around its
TIAC assets. For example, Kraft said the company plans a major
drive to sell Internet data center services in New England. A data
center operates computer systems for businesses that prefer not to
do the work themselves. Many large companies employ data centers to
run their Web sites, and Kraft expects demand for such services to
increase rapidly.

 &HT;    Delta calls French alliance 'terrific win'
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Delta Air Lines' new management team, which had seen
two big strategic moves fizzle in the past 18 months, chalked up a
victory on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Executive Leo Mullin and other executives flew home from
Paris with an exclusive 10-year marketing deal with Air France. The
two carriers said they'll add more partners by the end of the year,
creating a new global airline alliance to challenge those already
formed by rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrific win,'' Mullin said in a brief phone interview
as he prepared to board an Air France flight to Atlanta after the
formal announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Air France chief Jean Cyril-Spinetta said the pact will add
about $160 million in annual revenue for each carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Air France chose Delta over rival Continental Airlines. Both
U.S. carriers had formed limited marketing pacts with the French
carrier in 1997 but were vying for a broader, exclusive deal.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it was Continental that spurned Delta's buyout bid
in early 1998, shortly after Mullin arrived at Delta. Delta later
attempted a domestic alliance with United but had to scale it back
because of pilot union snarls.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said it was important for Mullin and his new executive
team to close the Air France deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows that they're players and are being aggressive in the
international arena,'' said Ray Neidl of ING Barings Furman Selz.
</P>
<P>
   The deal came after months of lobbying, with the Delta effort
led by Mullin and marketing chief Fred Reid, hired last year from
Lufthansa.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations got serious last fall, when Delta hosted an Air
France delegation for a secret summit at posh Amelia Island, Fla.
This spring a similar retreat was held in Cannes, France, with many
smaller meetings in between.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really have been at this very aggressively,'' Mullin said.
</P>
<P>
   Delta has a long-standing trans-Atlantic partnership with
Swissair, Sabena and Austrian Airlines, but most analysts feel its
been outflanked by larger alliances in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Air France, with 205 planes and flights to 85 nations, is
substantially bigger than Delta's other European partners combined.
</P>
<P>
   By code-sharing, or selling seats on each other's flights,
carriers in such alliances expand their international route
offerings without actually adding flights. The alliances also
include joint frequent flier awards and other service perks, along
with shared passenger handling.
</P>
<P>
   All of it is aimed at keeping customers within the alliance
wherever they fly, in theory boosting revenue for all the partner
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Air France's big hub at Charles de Gaulle Airport offers
extensive code-share connecting possibilities in Europe and beyond.
Delta already tickets passengers on seven Air France flights to
Paris and 48 other European cities. Those offerings will be
expanded, though no details were immediately announced.
</P>
<P>
   Air France, in return, will get greater access to Delta's route
system in the eastern United States.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin said Delta hopes to continue the Swissair alliance and
eventually incorporate it with the Air France deal. However,
Swissair on Tuesday announced it was starting code-share flights
with American, raising the possibility it will switch to the
Oneworld alliance.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, Delta's code-share operations with Swissair
and other existing European partners are unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Delta and Air France plan to bring other carriers into the deal
_ aiming especially for Latin and Asian partners _ to compete with
existing multicarrier alliances. They include the Star Alliance,
which includes United, Lufthansa and others; Wings, with Northwest,
Continental, KLM and Alitalia; and Oneworld, a tentative pact
headlined by American, British Airways and Japan Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our key goal is to create an alliance that will be competitive
with the largest and most successful,'' Mullin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What these alliances bring is an ability to get customers more
easily from anywhere to everywhere and have them feel like they're
dealing with one airline,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Neidl said the Air France deal ``reinforces'' Delta's position
in Europe but added he believes it will remain ``the weakest among
the four major alliances.''
</P>
<P>
   However, brokerage Merrill Lynch said in a recent report that a
Delta-Air France linkup ``could be the turtle in the old fable'' if
it is well executed.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin wouldn't comment on specific carriers that might be
candidates to join the Delta-Air France alliance. One strong
possibility is Aeromexico, which already has tight ties with Delta.
Asia is a bigger question mark. Both Delta and Air France suspended
code-sharing with Korean Air Lines this year because of safety
concerns, but say they hope to revive it when KAL fixes its
problems.

ANOTHER METRO MEANT TO BE MEMORABLE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 27) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RITA REIF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BILBAO, Spain _ The giant caterpillerlike entrances to the
Metro, this city's subway system, are made of glass ribbed with
steel and alive with light. Symbols of a city reborn, they beckon
riders with their sparkle by day, their glow by night, all part of
the design signature of the British architect Lord Norman Foster,
the winner this year of the Pritzker Architecture Prize.
</P>
<P>
   He designed the entrances to be sheltered spaces. ``These things
have got to be protective,'' he said. ``Bilbao has an Atlantic
climate. The weather can be quite hostile.''
</P>
<P>
   Bilbaoans were so delighted with everything about the Metro and
its creator that they have dubbed the entrances ``fosteritos.''
``It has to be the ultimate compliment,'' Lord Foster said. The
entrances soon became synonymous with the Metro itself; as he put
it, ``sort of an icon.'' ``Like the entrances to the Paris Metro
that say `Paris,' these say `Bilbao,''' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The entrances to the subways in the two cities are radically
different, though their designs are both organic in form. In Paris,
Hector Guimard's sinuous iron flowers framing the Metro entrances,
while standing as glorious expressions of the Art Nouveau style,
are purely ornamental.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Bilbao's ``fosteritos,'' with their undulating
walls washed in light, look alive and are an integral link between
the street and the subway far below. These are places where riders
enter and move swiftly to glass-walled escalators and elevators to
reach the Metro, tunneling like a worm through the earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The form invites you to descend,'' Lord Foster said. ``It also
tells you about the dynamic of rising to the light.''
</P>
<P>
   Glass has been a distinguishing feature of so much of Lord
Foster's work _ most recently the new dome of the Reichstag in
Berlin. An extensive use of glass was part of the design for the
Bilbao Metro, which took first place in a 1988 competition
sponsored by the local government, the award going to Lord Foster's
firm, Foster &AMP; Partners of London. ``My first shorthand throws at
them were rectangular,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The shape of the entrances was changed a year later; they were
rounded for greater naturalness after the Foster design team, led
by David Nelson, reviewed plans for the entire transit system.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 percent of the subway system, 18 miles, has been
completed at a cost of $400 million. The deadline for the rest is
the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the Metro grew out of a 1970s program of the Basque
government of Vizcaya calling for improvements in the
infrastructure and economy of Bilbao. An ancient shipbuilding and
port city, Bilbao has been an industrial center for most of this
century, falling into decline in the '60s. Today, serving a million
people, the Metro links the region's coastal villages, industrial
zone, city center and suburbs, with connections to local rail
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said the project had presented a daunting design
challenge. Architects usually envision a building from the outside
before detailing the spaces within. But because the subway system
was largely underground, there were virtually no exterior spaces
except for the fosteritos. ``We made models using toilet paper
rolls taped together to get the feel of those underground spaces,''
Nelson said. ``We had to get used to the totally interior series of
spaces.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite these constraints, Lord Foster's modernist sensibility
is ever present in the Metro's bold structures, extravagant use of
glass and vast open spaces in the mezzanines and column-free tunnel
platforms. What excited Nelson most, he said, was when ``the space
itself would tell you how you should move in it.'' If a building
can explain itself to the people who use it, he said, it becomes
comprehensible to all, and ``you don't need a sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus getting around the Bilbao Metro is self-explanatory. ``You
enter the underground through a slot in the street,'' Nelson said.
``Next, you move to the glass-sided escalators that take riders to
the mezzanine's ticket booths and turnstiles. From there, you use
the stairs to the terrazzo-tiled subway platforms below. For the
elderly and disabled, there are ticket machines at the street
level, and elevators from there to the trains.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there are signs to guide riders. Matching the color of
a Basque police officer's hat, the signs are bright orange-red with
spare white lettering, a scheme created by Otl Aicher, the German
graphics designer, shortly before his death in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem that Lord Nelson and his colleagues had
anticipated has not materialized. ``When we started 11 years ago,
the reputation of the Basques was synonymous with anarchy,'' he
said, referring to the unrest associated with the Basque separatist
struggle. ``Everybody expected the worst in Bilbao. We thought
signs of protest would erupt all over the subway system. So we made
a tremendous investment in time, energy and research to making
concrete graffiti-proof. The subway system, which opened four years
ago, is so appreciated and loved that it always seems to look
pristine.''

JUSTICES RULE ON DISABILITIES IN STRING OF EMPLOYMENT DECISIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court, delving into the civil rights
arena Tuesday, made it more difficult for disabled workers to claim
employment discrimination but easier for people hospitalized with
mental disabilities to return to their communities.
</P>
<P>
   In a string of employment decisions, the high court ruled that
employees and job applicants making discrimination claims must
first prove their disabilities cannot be easily alleviated.
</P>
<P>
   But the justices also ruled that the Americans with Disabilities
Act requires states to place mentally disabled people in community
settings, rather than institutions, when doctors deem it
appropriate and state resources permit it.
</P>
<P>
   With its decisions in these cases, the high court continued to
define the scope of the ADA, a 1990 federal law designed to end
discrimination against the disabled and to help historically
outcast individuals into mainstream society.
</P>
<P>
   The civil rights law, however, has divided the business
community, which fears increased litigation, and disability rights
advocates ever since the measure was first debated in Congress 10
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also has split civil libertarians and state
governments, which fear the financial cost and public-safety risk
of releasing mentally disabled people into the community.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decisions Tuesday did little to bridge these
divides.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce hailed the Supreme
Court's employment decisions while a disability rights group
assailed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court is applying a common-sense standard to the
workplace,'' said Steve Bokat, the chamber's general counsel.
``Employers make reasonable accommodations for employees who are
truly disabled, but they should not have to relax necessary
standards for employees who have common and easily correctable
ailments.''
</P>
<P>
   New York Lawyers for the Public Interest, by contrast, called
the employment rulings a blow to civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court undercut Congress' desire to help people with
disabilities in their efforts to work and lead full and responsible
lives,'' said John Gresham, the group's senior litigation counsel.
``It would be far better to support people who have found ways to
overcome their impairments, rather than stripping them of legal
protection against discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   The court's other ADA decision, clearing the way for mentally
disabled people to return to the community when appropriate, marked
a defeat for Texas Attorney General John Cornyn, who had urged the
court to give states breadth in deciding how and where mentally ill
residents will be treated.
</P>
<P>
   Houston Attorney David Kahne, a board member of the Texas
chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, hailed the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Supreme Court has recognized that there can be
discrimination when people are unnecessarily segregated in
institutions,'' Kahne said. ``In Texas, and particularly in
Houston, there are people in nursing homes and similar facilities
who desperately want to live in the community. This decision can
open the door.''
</P>
<P>
   In its employment decisions, the court agreed with the
employers' position that the term disability should be interpreted
narrowly to include only those physical and mental handicaps that
``substantially limit'' a major life function and cannot be
corrected. The high court also ruled that companies cannot be held
liable under the law if their decision to fire or refuse to hire a
disabled worker was in compliance with a federal regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The justices also said employers may generally consider a
worker's physical and mental abilities when making employment
decisions without violating the ADA.
</P>
<P>
   In one employment ruling, the court said two airline-pilot
applicants with poor vision could be considered disabled under the
law because their affliction could be corrected with eyeglasses or
contact lenses. In another decision, the justices discounted a
fired truck driver's high blood pressure because the medical
problem could be reduced with medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``A person whose physical or mental impairment is corrected by
medication or other measures does not have an impairment that
presently `substantially limits' a major life activity,'' Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for the majority in the pilots' case,
Sutton vs. United Air Lines Inc. ``To be sure, a person whose
physical or mental impairment is corrected by mitigating measures
still has an impairment, but if the impairment is corrected it does
not `substantially limit' a major life activity.''
</P>
<P>
   The court also resolved, in the employers' favor, a provision of
the ADA that prohibits companies from discriminating against a
worker or job applicant they ``regard as'' disabled. Employers are
free to consider in their employment decisions a worker's physical
and mental impairments that do not substantially limit major life
activities, the high court said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Accordingly, an employer is free to decide that physical
characteristics or mental conditions that do not rise to the level
of an impairment _ such as one's height, build or singing voice _
are preferable to others, just as it is free decide that some
limiting, but not substantially limiting, impairments make
individuals less than ideally suited for a job,'' O'Connor wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Joining O'Connor's opinion in Sutton were Chief Justice William
H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, David
H. Souter, Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   But dissenting Justices John Paul Stevens and Stephen G. Breyer
said the ADA should be interpreted broadly to allow even a person
whose poor eyesight can be easily corrected to sue employers that
have allegedly refused to hire them on the basis of an ``irrational
fear and stereotype'' regarding the impairment. An employee with
glasses might not win the lawsuit, but he or she nevertheless has a
disability that is protected under the law, Stevens wrote in a
dissenting opinion Breyer joined.
</P>
<P>
   The high court, in a case brought by two hospitalized mentally
ill Georgia women seeking community treatment, said the ADA's
prohibition on discrimination favors having the mentally disabled
treated in a home rather than in an institution. Under the law,
states must provide home-based care whenever feasible and
appropriate, Ginsburg wrote in the court's majority opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Institutional placement of persons who can handle and benefit
from community settings perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that
persons so isolated are incapable or unworthy of participating in
community life,'' Ginsburg wrote. ``Confinement in an institution
severely diminishes the everyday life activities of individuals,
including family relations, social contacts, work options, economic
independence, educational advancement and cultural enrichment.''
</P>
<P>
   But hospitalization of a mentally ill person seeking community
treatment may pass ADA muster if the state concludes confinement
should continue based on the ``reasonable assessments'' of doctors,
the court said. Mentally ill patients who favor hospitalization
also retain the right to refuse to be treated in a community
setting, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   In a vehement dissent, Thomas said the ADA's prohibition on
``discrimination'' against the disabled does not apply to the
institutionalization of the mentally ill. The discrimination
Congress sought to redress in the ADA is disparate treatment
between mentally disabled and able-minded individuals,, not among
mentally ill people, Thomas said in a dissent Rehnquist and Scalia
joined.

   NEW YORK _ New York is witnessing a small invasion of major
French talent. Earlier this year, Philippe Starck, the most gifted
designer of his generation, moved to New York. If this town cared
as much about design as it does about baseball, there would have
been a ticker tape parade in his honor. Even if Starck does no more
than remodel a few extra Ian Schrager hotels, his relocation here
is an important cultural event.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Jean Nouvel, another radiant Parisian talent,
presented his design for a hotel-spa-movie theater complex on the
Brooklyn waterfront. Pressure from community groups may well
prevent this project from being realized. Fortunately, they have no
power to wish away the world-class quality of Nouvel's design.
</P>
<P>
   And now, due for completion on July 15, comes the LVMH Tower on
East 57th Street, between Fifth and Madison Avenues, the American
headquarters of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the maker of
luxury products whose businesses include Christian Dior, the
perfumer Guerlain, Moet Champagne and Hennessy cognac, and Louis
Vuitton leather goods.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by Christian de Portzamparc, the youngest architect to
be awarded a Pritzker Architecture Prize, in association with the
Hillier Group, the 23-story office tower does the skyline a great
service. Portzamparc has reimagined the idea of Art Deco. In doing
so, he has released the city from the grip of the Dead Deco
imitations that in the 1980s began to turn New York into a theme
park version of itself.
</P>
<P>
   The building is on New York's most privileged stretch of luxury
shopping. With Chanel, Burberry and Hermes lined up in a row, the
north side of the block has long been a window shopper's dream.
Portzamparc has lifted that fantasy peep-show to new heights. The
entire facade of his building is a gigantic shop window. Here,
windows themselves are on display.
</P>
<P>
   Portzamparc has described the facade as a flower. It is safe to
assume that a shrinking violet is not what he had in mind. Though
the facade remains strictly within the boundaries set by the city
zoning code, it appears to burst forward from the perpendicular
plane of the typical curtain wall in a flourish of tapering,
origami-like folds.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of this exotic bloom is a pillbox of blue glass,
lodged on the eastern edge of the facade at the 10th-floor level.
The petals, of irregular size and contour, radiate upward in
crystalline shapes that recall a bird of paradise.
</P>
<P>
   The folded segments are fashioned from extra-transparent,
so-called white glass, which has been sandblasted to produce a
pattern of clear wedges _ windows within windows (or petals within
petals). The wedges, in turn, are incised with a pattern of
delicate horizontal bands that increase in thickness toward the
top. From within, the sandblasted lines create the effect of skinny
Venetian blinds. At night, they will pick up the glow from strips
of neon tubing, set beneath one of the folds, which will radiate a
rainbow spectrum of changing colors.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the tower is a three-story glass cube, a party
space that Portzamparc calls the magic room. It's a place for
swooping grand entrances down a spiral staircase, a slice of
cinematic glamour that makes the Rainbow Room look like a caterer's
hall.
</P>
<P>
   The penthouse further elaborates an already complex facade. But
the composition is held together by an implied Z-shape that extends
the full height of the building. The shape starts at the roof,
slashes diagonally down and finishes off with the rectangular glass
frame around the entrance. Louis Vuitton wasn't the first to put
his initials all over the place. This building bears the mark of a
very tall Zorro.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you count Baroque moldings, the folded plane has few
precedents in Western architecture. It was a staple of Czech
Cubism, which flourished in Prague in the late teens and early 20s.
More recently, folding was taken up by Peter Eisenman, Wolfgang
Prix and others as an avant-garde riposte to post-modernism's
period style ornament.
</P>
<P>
   Portzamparc, however, is not a favorite of the avant-garde.
Though his 57th Street building may strike New Yorkers as cutting
edge, other architects of his generation regard him as
conservative. (Some saw the decision to award him the 1994 Pritzker
Prize as a slap at the children of '68.) Portzamparc's work is not
derived from literary theory. He never practiced Deconstruction,
whatever that was. On the contrary, one of his specialties is
mending rips in the urban fabric shredded by Parisian planners in
the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   It may be fair to call Portzamparc an urbanist first, an
architect second. This is meant as a compliment. His designs rely
heavily on context, often by playing counterpoint to it.
Portzamparc designed LVMH's light, free-form facade to contrast
with the dark, uniform walls of the hulking IBM Building across the
street.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the Chanel Building next door, designed by Charles Platt
after Portzamparc had completed his plan, also makes an excellent
foil. With its impeccably tailored facade of granite, glass and
steel, the Chanel Building is perhaps the best of the Dead Deco
breed, a place where the ghosts of departed Rockettes go browsing
after dark.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when one of the worst things you could say
about a serious work of architecture was to call it Art Deco. In
1925, when the style emerged at the Exposition des Arts Decoratifs
in Paris, modern architects rallied around the Pavillon de l'Esprit
Nouveau, a machine for living designed by Le Corbusier that was
segregated from the main exposition by a tall fence. That fence
drew the line between the Modern Movement and a style denigrated by
modernists as merely decorative.
</P>
<P>
   Portzamparc, 55, represents a fusion of these once opposed
esthetics. Trained at the Ecole des Beaux Arts, he came of age at a
time when Le Corbusier had come to stand for the classical
tradition. His work springs from Le Corbusier's later, sculpturally
expressive designs, like the chapel at Ronchamp. And Portzamparc is
practicing at a time when few architects still consider ornament a
crime.
</P>
<P>
   It's no mystery why New York became preoccupied with Art Deco in
the 1970s and '80s. With confidence in the city's future waning, it
was heartening to look back at a style that flourished when New
York was beginning to displace Paris as the center of the cultural
universe.
</P>
<P>
   But Dead Deco buildings like World Wide Plaza and Trump Palace
were counterproductive. French architects conceived Art Deco, in
part, as an homage to the idea of New York: its speed, jazz and
power of invention. Buildings like the Chrysler, 70 Pine Street and
the Majestic apartments on Central Park West became shrines of that
mythology.
</P>
<P>
   LVMH looks nothing like an Art Deco building. Rather, it deforms
the style in order to reinvigorate its fresh, jazzy spirit. Instead
of symmetry, Portzamparc creates balance. He holds asymmetrical
elements together with the poise of a Balanchine dancer. He
emphasizes the building's height not with vertical lines, but by
tapering the curtain wall as it rises.
</P>
<P>
   The result is to today's jazz what Art Deco was to the first
Jazz Age. Looser in form, lyrically more seductive, this is a
building for the singer Sade to tuck behind one ear.
</P>
<P>
   LVMH is one of two new Manhattan buildings that rise from the
level of real estate to the plane of architecture. Both buildings
have been cliffhangers. The second of the two, Raimund Abraham's
design for the Austrian Cultural Institute, finally went into
construction three months ago on East 52d Street between Madison
and Fifth, after six years of diddling on the part of the Austrian
government. The LVMH went into the ground in 1996. The steel frame
rose a few stories, then work stopped, and the thing just sat
there, paralyzed by corporate squabbles.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the actual causes, it was hard not to see these
delays as signs of New York's ambivalence about architecture
itself. Would the city actually allow this art form to show its
face in New York again, after so many years of keeping it at bay?
Or would these holes in the ground just sit there until developers
bought them, hired the usual commercial architects, and let
business-class architecture go on as usual?
</P>
<P>
   The LVMH Tower was worth the wait. Watching the building rise,
seeing people on the street look up as its faceted, crystalline
contours took shape, even overhearing people say how much they hate
it: this has been like watching a flatliner's pulse revive.

COURT UPHOLDS DECISION AGAINST BAY STATE'S ANTI-BURMA LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- A Massachusetts law barring the state from buying from
firms doing business in Burma was declared unconstitutional Tuesday
by a federal appeals court, a legal ruling that could cripple a
host of so-called selective purchasing laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a severe blow to the practice of state and local
governments using moral criteria to make financial decisions,''
said Simon Billenness, a pro-Burmese democracy activist in Boston
who helped guide the bill into law in 1996. ``The ruling will
divorce morality form state spending.''
</P>
<P>
   The First Circuit Court of Appeals said that federal policy on
Burma, which includes some sanctions, preempts the 1996
Massachusetts selective purchase law, as well as similar statutes
passed by more than 20 other state and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   The three-member court also ruled that the US Constitution
reserves the right of regulating foreign commerce to the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   The Burma law, which was the only state statute of its kind in
the country when it was passed, bars state contracts with firms
that do business in that Southeast Asian country, where a military
junta has crushed a democracy movement.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-junta activists said the decision is a serious setback to
efforts to use the financial resources of local and state
government to force changes overseas and in American foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
   But the court's ruling is a victory for the US State Department
and the Clinton administration's trade representatives, who were
facing strong opposition from foreign trading partners to the Burma
selective purchase laws.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the Massachusetts law took effect, the European
Commission and Japan threatened to take the issue to the World
Trade Organization, arguing that the statute violates US
obligations under trade treaties.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the State Department and the US Trade
Representative's office sent a delegation to the Massachusetts
State House to persuade the Weld administration and the Legislators
to scuttle the law.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-junta activists say the Massachusetts law has been cited by
several major American and international corporations in deciding
to close down operations in Burma. Among those firms are Apple
Computers, Levi Strauss, Eastman Kodak, Hewlett-Packard, Philips
Electronics, and a major Jampenese construction company, the
activists say.
</P>
<P>
   Billeness is a senior analyst at Trillium Assetts Management in
Boston, a social investment firm active in supporting the
Massachusetts Burma law. He said the ruling will prohibit state
governments from using their resources to help bring about
political and social changes as they did in the anti-apartheid
campaign of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially this ruling will require state and local
governments to do business with companies that support dictators,''
Billenness said.
</P>
<P>
   Selective purchasing laws aimed at other international issues
are in jeopardy because of the ruling, Billenness said. He cited
the sanctions against buying rain forest wood and attempts to force
American companies in Northern Ireland to abide by a set of
nondiscrimination policies in hiring.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Byron Rushing, a Democrat and the bill's sponsor
on Beacon Hill, said the court's ruling flies in the face of a long
standing tradition that has allowed states and local governments to
express their opinions on US foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had rulings like this in the '70s and '80s, the United
States would not have been able to participate in the
anti-apartheid movement,'' Rushing said. ``I am glad these judges
weren't around then or (Nelson) Mandela might still be in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he expects the state to appeal the case to the US
Supreme court, where, he said, the law could be reinstated.

LATE ROUND OF SELLING HELPS DEPRESS THE MAIN INDICATORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices staged a broad retreat Tuesday as a
further rise in long-term interest rates and a late round of
selling depressed the main market gauges.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, optimism about coming earnings reports helped to lift
stocks in sectors like technology and financial services.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, however, analysts said they were troubled by the way
the market reacted to quarterly results from Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   The securities firm reported second-quarter earnings that were
substantially above Wall Street's expectations. But the stock,
which rose more than 7 percent on Monday, fell 3 11/16 Tuesday, to
56 5/8, and dragged shares of other big brokerage firms down with
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes numbers can be too good,'' said Laszlo Birinyi, who
heads his own stock research firm in Greenwich, Conn. ``But the
market's reaction to Lehman's huge profits was a little
disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   For a second day, a rise in long-term interest rates helped to
push down cyclical stocks, which depend on a growing economy to
generate profits.
</P>
<P>
   The drop in cyclical stocks was largely responsible for a
decline in the Dow Jones industrial average, which fell 94.35
points, or nine-tenths of a percent, to 10,721.63. Companies like
DuPont, Alcoa and International Paper led the blue-chip index
lower.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks, which had rallied for five consecutive
sessions, pulled back Tuesday, and dragged down the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index and the NASDAQ composite index.
</P>
<P>
   The S&AMP;P 500 lost 13.12 points, or just less than 1 percent, to
1,335.88. Stocks like Microsoft, Lucent Technologies, Cisco Systems
and America Online, which all gained ground on Monday, fell back
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those same stocks helped to pull down NASDAQ. After a
strong opening, sellers emerged and by the end of the session the
index had fallen 50.02 points, or 1.9 percent, to 2,580.26.
</P>
<P>
   Although stock traders appear to have accepted that the Federal
Reserve will raise short-term interest rates by a quarter of a
percentage point next week, Christopher Durbin, chief investment
strategist at J.P. Morgan Investment Inc., which manages more than
$300 billion, said the central bank would most likely have to
increase rates much more than that to slow the economy.
</P>
<P>
   At a luncheon with reporters in New York Tuesday, Durbin said
short-term interest rates would probably rise a full percentage
point over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Based on his forecast for interest rates, and what he called the
market's sky-high valuations, Durbin said Morgan was advising
investors to shed U.S. stocks and bonds and buy stocks in Japan,
Europe and the emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said the rise in long-term interest rates Tuesday was
caused by positioning in front of a heavy calendar of upcoming
corporate debt issues. And the rising rates probably did not help
brokerage stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the slide in Lehman's stock, Goldman Sachs, which is
expected to report earnings Wednesday, fell 1 1/2, to 68. Merrill
Lynch dropped 2 1/2, to 75 3/4. And Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette
fell 2 3/8, to 55 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   Among Dow stocks, DuPont fell 2 9/16, to 67 5/8. International
Paper lost 1 7/8, to 52 5/8. And Alcoa fell for a second day,
dropping 1 5/8, to 62 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, shares in Alza, the maker of sustained-release drugs,
gained 1 1/2, to 47 3/4, after Abbott Laboratories said it would
buy it for $7.3 billion in stock. In what was generally a good day
for drug stocks, Abbott fell 11/16, to 43 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   Oil stocks were weaker.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron, a Dow component, fell 9/16, to 90 1/8, after it said a
fire at its refinery near San Francisco would cut second-quarter
profits by about 15 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Mobil dropped 1 7/16, to 98. Exxon fell 1 1/4, to 77. And BP
Amoco dropped 1 1/16, to 110 1/2.

CLINTON OURGES REFUGEES TO AVOID MINE DANGER, DELAY RETURN 
</HEADLINE>

   STENKOVICH, Macedonia _ President Clinton visited a refugee camp
here Tuesday and asked ethnic Albanian refugees to give NATO
peacekeepers ``a couple of more weeks'' to remove land mines before
returning home to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have suffered enough,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In an emotional tour of Macedonia's largest refugee camp, which
at its peak held 30,000 people who had fled Kosovo and the security
forces of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, Clinton sought to
comfort the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   He told them he understood they were anxious to get home and
knew that many had already left since Serb forces began withdrawing
its troops from Kosovo and NATO ended its 11-week bombing campaign.
The last of the Serb forces withdrew Sunday. Shortly after the
withdrawal, Kosovo Liberation Army leaders signed an agreement to
warehouse their weapons and end their fight.
</P>
<P>
   But only a day later, a top KLA leader said the rebels never
agreed to give up their guns and still hope to form an army.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said many land mines still lay on routes into Kosovo and
other communities, and that the United States was bringing in some
of the world's best experts to remove them.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I ask you, please be patient with us. Give us a couple of
more weeks to take the land mines up if the people here ask you to
do that, because you are going to be able to go back in safety and
security. I want to make sure it is a happy return,'' the president
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of civilians already have died in explosions of land
mines since the peacekeepers entered Kosovo on June 12.
Peacekeepers' spokesman Lt. Col. Robin Clifford said mine blasts
killed one civilian Monday and a child on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the refuges continue to return. The UN refugee agency
said more than 170,000 of the 860,000 or so refugees who fled from
Kosovo have returned in little more than a week.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton, accompanied by his wife and daughter, arrived at
this vast camp, near Skopje, children rushed up to embrace him and
refugees greeted him with chants of ``Clinton, Clinton, Clinton.''
One small boy, standing with other children on top of portable
toilets, wore green sweatpants partially rolled and a grey Boston
College sweatshirt.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told the refugees, ``We are commited not only to making
Kosovo safe, but to helping people rebuild their lives, rebuild
their communities, and then to helping Kosovo and all the countries
of the region build a brighter, more prosperous future.''
</P>
<P>
   As Apache helicopters hovered overhead for security, and a
roadblock backed up traffic all the way into Kosovo, President
Clinton was received almost worshipfully by the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``My children think of him as a God that has descended upon
us,'' Said Mevlyde Dulaku, whose six-year-old son, Nexhat shook
hands with the president. ``We couldn't believe he came. He showed
he really feels for us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He sends his planes and saved out lives,'' said Nexhant, who
said he and his family would wait three weeks to return to their
Kosovo hometown, Vucitrn. ``Because Mr. Clinton told us we
should,.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaysreti Nuhiu, 32, said Serb paramilitary soldiers wearing ski
masks killed her five-year-old son Ferid, in front of her. Since
then, she said, she and her husband have been on medication to calm
their nerves. ``Mr. Clinton's visit to us took half my pain away,''
Nuhiu said. ``Seeing him conme and speak I feel we will be safe
now. I feel there is a force to protect us.''
</P>
<P>
   As two-year old Getuar Kqiku sat in his lap, Clinton heard the
story of one family that fled their Kosovo home 3 1/2 months ago
and had witnessed the massacre of 60 people in a small village
where they lived for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the army entered the buildings, they started beating
us,'' Idriz and his wife, Nerimane Macastena, told Clinton through
an interpreter. ``They took a four-year-old boy and put a knife on
one side of his neck and a lighted cigarette on the other and
threatened us to give them all our money.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the refugees here also made it known that they also will
not forget the pain the Serbs caused them. When asked if she could
live with Serbs again, Shpresa Zairi, 17, she shook her head. ``The
police crushed my home, they took all my things. They massacred us,
they killed us. No.''
</P>
<P>
   After touring the camp, Clinton said he was aware of the
bitterness on the part of some refugees, but said it hadn't
resulted in a lot of retaliation. ``We thought there would be some
problems and I thought it would be worse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he urged Kosovar Albanians not to retaliate against the
Serbs on Monday after attending a US-European Union summit, he did
not make such a request once he arrived in the Balkans. There was
evidence of retaliation by rebels or their supporters in Kosovo.
Serb houses burned in the western city of Pec and a Serb power
company worker was shot in the capital. The violence followed the
first deaths in Kosovo's peace force. Two soldiers from the British
contingent were killed Monday when unexploded NATO ordnance they
were trying to destroy accidentally blew up. Two villagers helping
the peacekeepers also were killed and a third was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Rrustem Mustafa, a KLA commander known for his hard-line views,
said an agreement in which the rebels pledged to turn in their
weapons, disband and put away their uniforms doesn't mean the end
of the insurgents or their struggle for an independent Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agreement does not demand that we give up our arms,''
Mustafa, known as ``Commander Remi,'' told the rebels' Kosova Press
news service. ``The arms will be gathered at certain places and the
KLA will take care of them while NATO has a right to observe
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Clinton also met with the leaders of Macedonia and
Albanians, the two countries that bore the brunt of the refugee
crisis. ``NATO could not have achieved its mission without you; the
people of Kosovo would not be going home to security and autonomy
without you. I came here, as much as anything else, to say thank
you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders told Clinton they were prepared to work
together, and were committed to build a ``spirit of tolerance,'' in
the region.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told the leaders that some analysts believe it wll take
several generations to instill trust between Serbs and Albanians in
the strife torn region, according to an administration official.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's response, the official said, was he believe it
could happen much sooner.
</P>
<P>
   On his way back to Washington, the president stopped at the Air
Force Base in Aviano, Italy to thank American and NATO pliots for
their ``noble endeavor'' in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The president then began the flight home, where he was due to
arrive early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In other developments:
</P>
<P>
   _Yugoslavia's parliament scheduled a session Thursday to end the
state of war.
</P>
<P>
   The state of war, in effect since March 24, banned men of
military age from leaving the country, let the army take over key
institutions and subjected the news media to censorship.
</P>
<P>
   _With the 78-day air war over, US warplanes sent to Europe as
part of the allied bombing campaign are coming home. The first of
367 military planes is to return Wednesday, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
   _The foreign ministers of Italy, Britain, Germany and France
will visit Kosovo on Wednesday to meet with U.N. special
representative Sergio Vieira de Mello and NATO's Kosovo commander,
Lt. Gen. Mike Jackson.

<P>
   DJAKOVICA, Yugoslavia _ Serbian forces dug up the bodies of some
100 Albanian Kosovars from a mass grave here in late May and
carried the bodies off, the municipal official in charge of burials
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They dug all night, from 7 o'clock until 5 in the morning,''
said Faton Polloshka, the director of Cabrati, the city sanitation
agency. ``They used a backhoe, and eight of our workers were taken
to help them.''
</P>
<P>
   The killings occurred during what Polloshka described as
``terrible massacres between the 7th and 10th of May.'' He said his
workers collected the dead and buried about 100 people in the
municipal cemetery on May 14. On May 22, he said, they were
exhumed. He did not provide details on how or where the victims
were killed.
</P>
<P>
   `'Every dead body was taken by the Serbs,'' he said. `'We don't
know where they were taken.''
</P>
<P>
   A large brown patch of dug-up earth _ roughly 10 yards wide and
twenty-five yards long _ was apparent in the municipal cemetery
Tuesday afternoon in the place that Polloshka indicated. The earth
was mostly raw and still soft, indicating it had been dug fairly
recently, but enough time had passed for a few tufts of grass to
sprout.
</P>
<P>
   Under a dark gray rainy sky, bits of blankets and clothing could
be seen poking up here and there in the turned-up ground. On a
piece of red plastic, someone had placed six pieces of human bones,
apparently found in the area. A small flute, its holes caked with
mud, was found at the edge of the patch.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, there were scars in the grass where it appeared that the
supporting feet of the backhoe had been placed. Four rubber gloves
were scattered on the ground nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The latest disclosure of disappeared bodies came as
investigators from the International War Crimes Tribunal,
journalists and human rights researchers fanned further out through
Kosovo finding more and more evidence of graves and widespread
destruction. The war crimes investigators were seen concentrating
particularly on a 10-mile stretch of the highway between here and
Prizren, around Velika Krusa (Krush-e-Madhe in Albanian) where
refugees have reported a series of massacres in late March.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Djakovica, besides the leveling of the picturesque
Ottoman-era Old Town, virtually every shop in the city has been
destroyed, including a well-designed new market place and, U.N.
relief officials estimate, about a third of the dwellings are
uninhabitable.
</P>
<P>
   The killing of the 100 people described by Polloshka occurred
weeks after the Serbian forces pushed through Djakovica in March,
</P>
<P>
   Polloshka, who has been responsible for keeping the city clean,
including burying the dead, since 1985, has managed to keep a
record of the names and occupations of the 140 other people his
teams buried since the Serbs began their rampage here around
midnight on March 24, the night the NATO bombing began. He has
turned the records over to human rights organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were found in their houses, dead, they were massacred,''
he said of the city's dead. ``Many of the bodies were carbonized.
</P>
<P>
   `'In the case of the family Vesa, by the billiard hall'' he
said, `'from 21 bodies, there was hardly enough to make one grave.
That was our most tragic case, but we found different bodies in
other houses. There was no dead body in a house that wasn't
burned.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Polloshka, an ethnic Albanian, said he still could not get
the names of the roughly 100 people who were killed in early May.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Serbian forces rousted people out of the Cabrat
neighborhood, between the Old Town and a ridge of hills at the edge
of the city that residents said had been a base for the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   About 700 men from the city, along with about 300 from outlying
areas, were taken into custody by the Serbs and carried off to an
unknown fate. What has happened to these captives is a major
concern of people here. Many believe they have been taken to
Serbian prisons, possibly in Leskovc or Krusevc.
</P>
<P>
   More bodies continued to turn up around the countryside. In the
village of Dvorane, several miles east of Suva Reka in southern
Kosovo, half a dozen Albanian men stood in a chilly rain Tuesday
looking down into a pit about 10 feet deep. Villagers said a well
had been there, but it was apparently excavated by a backhoe; the
stones that once lined the well's walls were stacked up beside two
huge mounds of dirt.
</P>
<P>
   At the rear of one mound lay two brown shoes, one of which still
had a sock tucked inside with what appeared to be part of a
decomposing foot. Hotem Kolgeci, 45, from the nearby village of
Vranic, said Serbian soldiers had killed 22 civilians _ men ranging
from 17 to 48 years old _ in the village of Bukos on May 2. Two
days later, he said, two trucks picked up the bodies and brought
them to the hole.
</P>
<P>
   NATO soldiers have asked villagers not to search for bodies in
the well, which they say is another 12 feet deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what's in there,'' Kolgeci said. ``But it must
be something.''

MORE THAN 50 FBI AGENTS HEAD FOR KOSOVO TO JOIN PROBE

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A team of more than 50 FBI agents left the United
States for Kosovo on Tuesday to join an international investigation
of possible war crimes, the first time that federal agents have
been sent abroad to investigate accusations of wartime atrocities
against civilians who are not Americans, law enforcement officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Agents flew to Kosovo carrying thousands of tons of gear,
including Humvees, tents, food, portable showers and specialized
equipment for field laboratory analysis of evidence, the officials
said. The agents, all volunteers, are likely to remain in the
region for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The agents are planning to set up a base camp in the U.S. sector
in the southeastern corner of Kosovo, but will be available to
investigate possible war crimes sites throughout the province of
Serbia. Among their tasks will be an effort to determine how
possible victims of war crimes died and who killed them.
</P>
<P>
   Agents trained in evidence collection, laboratory analysis and
forensic science are on the team along with other agents like some
from the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team, a highly trained paramilitary
unit and crisis response team, whose agents will secure areas in
which the agents will be working.

<P>
   Dennis A. Moore had spent much of last Wednesday night collapsed
on the floor of his home near the mouth of the Amazon River,
wracked by fever, violent shakes, and intense stomach pains.
</P>
<P>
   It had already been a horrible spring for Moore, a scholar of
tribal languages, who had recently learned that the Brazilian
government was cutting funding for his research.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Thursday, the phone rang. It was the man from the
MacArthur Foundation calling to say that he had just won a huge
cash award _ a ``genius grant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that I'd just had the worst night of my life,''
Moore said. ``He said, `Yeah, well this is going to be your best
morning.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Moore, a Michigan native, is among the 32 MacArthur Fellows
announced Tuesday by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur
Foundation, which awards stipends to intellectual innovators to
free them from the constraints of their daily financial
obligations.
</P>
<P>
   The five-year grants, which range from $200,000 to $375,000, are
dropped like manna from heaven on winners who are rarely aware
thatthey are under consideration. The money comes with no strings
attached.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a gift of time,'' said Daniel J. Socolow, director of the
MacArthur Fellows Program. ``It drops out of the sky, and it gives
extraordinary people the space and time to do their thing in the
way they want to. It's magical.''
</P>
<P>
   Three Massachusetts residents are among this year's winners.
They are John Bonifaz of the National Voting Rights Institute,
social historian Jacqueline Jones of Brandeis University, and
physicist Juan M. Maldacena of Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   The MacArthur Foundation is recognizing Maldacena, 30, for his
work in the abstract field of string theory, which postulates the
existence of constituents of matter that are too tiny to detect
with the latest experimental apparatus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to understand string theory and how nature behaves
in very short distances and at very early periods of time, close to
the beginning of the Big Bang, the beginning of the universe,''
said Maldacena, who lives in Cambridge, Mass. He said he hadn't
decided what to do yet with the prize money.
</P>
<P>
   Bonifaz, 33, also of Cambridge, an energetic public interest
lawyer, uses litigation to press for campaign finance reform. The
National Voting Rights Institute, which he heads, has been retained
to defend several state-based campaign-finance reforms passed by
ballot initiatives or legislators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to say that we are a democracy,'' Bonifaz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is we have a plutocracy, where less than one
percent of the population is giving 80 percent of the money to
campaigns. That angers me deeply.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, of Wellesley, Mass., the Harry S. Truman professor of
American history at Brandeis, is being recognized for her
scholarship on labor history. She has focused on how economic
transformations have affected the status of workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this as a validation of the effort to bring the voices
of ordinary working people to a larger, modern audience,'' she said
of the award. Jones learned of the award as she returned Thursday
from a lunch in Cambridge to celebrate her 51st birthday. On her
answering machine was a message from the MacArthur Foundation,
urging her to return the call. The message said, ``This is a call
you'll want to make.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband and I just looked at each other and laughed,''
Jones said. ``It was a complete surprise _ pretty shocking
actually.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore, who was reached at his home in Belem, Brazil, said he was
still dumbfounded by the $365,000 prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would take until the year 2016 for me to earn that kind of
money,'' said Moore, who was recognized for his work preserving the
language and culture of endangered indigenous groups in the Amazon
region. ``It kind of puts a floor under you when you've been
hanging from a cliff from your fingers for so many years.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There's a story out of Hollywood that Francis Ford
Coppola is wooing Leonardo diCaprio to play the young Sonny
Corleone in ``The Godfather, Part IV.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to picture the girlish Leo as the super-macho
gangster depicted with memorable volatility and virility by James
Caan in the original ``Godfather.'' And after ``Godfather III''
soiled the legacy of the first two Oscar-winning films, is it
really necessary to beat a dead horse's head?
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the 2000 political race is already a sequel, with a
cast of familiar names _ Bush, Gore, Clinton, Dole _ and its own
version of the Godfather saga.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush family has been dubbed the ``WASP Corleones'' by Howard
Fineman of Newsweek. Like his mother and father, George W. lives by
a simple code: Either you're with us or you're not.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of W.'s friends have compared him to Sonny Corleone,
the hot-headed, cocky heir to the family business. Despite being
the oldest, Sonny, like W., was not the one his father thought had
the temperament to follow in his footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   You get the feeling with W., as with Sonny, that he's one insult
away from blowing up and losing his chance at succession. It's
there, bristling right beneath the surface, that unforgiving,
unforgetting, tart-tongued nature he inherited from his mother.
</P>
<P>
   With Sonny, it was his brother-in-law Carlo who beat up his
sister, Connie, and provoked him into falling into the trap at the
tollbooth.
</P>
<P>
   With W., it might be one too many questions from the huge press
pack trailing him about ethanol, gun control or his youthful
libertinism.
</P>
<P>
   It is entertaining to imagine the former President Bush as a
preppy Don Corleone, sitting up at Kennebunkport overseeing the
family councils, with Jeb as Michael, Neil as Fredo and Doro as
Connie. Don Georgio would receive political supplicants, dispense
favors and ask for services from the vast group of politicos and
policy hands under Bush family protection.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of cannoli, there are tuna sandwiches on white bread
with Tabasco sauce. Instead of red wine and Strega, there are
martinis. Instead of hugging each other, they give Skull &AMP; Bones
secret handshakes. Instead of the crooner Johnny ``I Want a Horse's
Head in That Studio Executive's Bed'' Fontane, there is Lee ``I'm
Proud to Be an American'' Greenwood. Instead of a cement-shoe
thing, it's a white-shoe thing.
</P>
<P>
   The WASPy Godfather is looking for a splash of revenge by taking
the White House back from the rival family now occupying the sacred
turf. The Bushes feel about the Clintons the way Don Corleone felt
about
</P>
<P>
   Don Tattaglia, who insisted on bringing darker elements into the
business.
</P>
<P>
   You can imagine Don Georgio in a darkened room _ with Brent
Scowcroft as consigliere and Bar as Luca Brasi _ doing his own
Bushspeak version of Mafiaspeak: ``Message: The family cares. This
race is about the honor thing. We shall have our justice. An eye
for an eye. They're out to get my boy. They're out to get me.
Before we're finished, our enemies will summer with the fishes.
They won't be able to keep their snorkels above the water level.
The bluefish rots from the head down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll try to persuade Forbes and McCain and Quayle to get out
of the race. We'll make them an offer they can't refuse. Forbes
will wake up screaming in the night when he finds bloodied flat-tax
plans under his silk sheets. Dan Quayle will perish in a hailstorm
of potatoes. We can kick McCain right into the end zone by letting
the word out to the other families that he's really serious about
this campaign finance reform nonsense. It's bad for everybody's
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us be frank. If W. blows up, we've always got Jeb waiting
in the wings. I always thought he would be the one to take over the
family business anyway. But we've got to keep an eye on Jeb's wife.
Why did Columba embarrass the family by trying to save a few
hundred dollars in duties on $19,000 in clothing and jewelry she
got in Paris? If she had come to me, my purse would have been hers.
What have I ever done to make her treat me so disrespectfully?''
</P>
<P>
   Don Georgio noted that the restless W. was not paying attention
to the family council. He was playing video golf and avoiding his
foreign affairs coaches. If he refused to be instructed, Junior
could never become the Don.

 &HT;    Ivester to give apologies on Belgian TV
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving to (i) International and (f) Financial categories.)
 &HT;    By Bert Roughton Jr.

<P>
   BRUSSELS _ Coca-Cola Chairman M. Douglas Ivester plans to go on
Belgian television this evening with commercials to apologize for a
health scare involving his company's top brands and to reassure
consumers its soft drinks are safe.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes as the Belgian government postponed a decision
Tuesday on whether to lift a partial ban on Coke products. A
decision, however, could come today.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a key French official hinted that similar
restrictions in her country could be removed today. Consumer
Affairs Minister Marylise Lebranchu said her country may be ``at
the state of coming out of the crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivester is expected to talk to Belgians in 90-second commercials
that will carry the same general message as his personal apology
that ran Tuesday in full-page ads in 15 newspapers. He will speak
in English, but there will be subtitles in the country's major
languages, which include French and Flemish.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in Brussels, there is the sense that intense
negotiations are under way behind closed doors to resolve the
matter soon.
</P>
<P>
   Belgian Health Minister Luc Van den Bossche had indicated
Tuesday morning that he was likely to make a decision on
Coca-Cola's request to end restrictions imposed for eight days. The
product ban was imposed after scores of people reported becoming
ill after drinking Coca-Cola products from bottling plants in
Antwerp and in Dunkirk, France.
</P>
<P>
   Bossche, who could not be reached for comment, has expressed
skepticism about explanations from Coca-Cola and its largest
bottler, Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Enterprises, about the cause of
the illnesses. The company has attributed the illnesses to
reactions to ``rotten egg'' smells caused by faulty carbon dioxide
gas in some beverage containers and a fungicide from wooden pallets
for others.
</P>
<P>
   Bossche also has publicly criticized the company for not
reacting promptly when the reports that people were falling ill
were initially made. Government officials here say it was Bossche's
frustration that led to a brief ban on all Coke products last week.
That ban has been relaxed to include Coca-Cola's main brands _
Coke, Sprite and Fanta.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's executives in Brussels also appear frustrated that
the process of getting their company's top brands back on store
shelves is taking so long. They met with the government during the
day Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to have detailed talks with the government,'' said
Paul Pendergrass, a spokesman for the company in Europe. ``We
expect to continue having detailed talks tomorrow (Wednesday).''
</P>
<P>
   At one point Tuesday, Ivester briefed Coca-Cola's board of
trustees on developments during a 45-minute conference call.
Ivester and board members also talked about the political situation
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman and chief executive of the world's largest soft
drink company has already met with Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc
Dehaene to apologize for quality control lapses at plants bottling
his company's products.
</P>
<P>
   And Coca-Cola spokesman Randal Donaldson said the soft drink
company has had positive responses from Ivester's apologetic
newspaper ads. But not all consumers have been impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds a little as if he's making excuses,'' said Martin
Bueiens, a university student who was reading the ad Tuesday during
his lunch at a Quick fast-food restaurant in central Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, really, it looks to me as if he's making too much of the
whole thing,'' Bueiens said between bites of a chicken sandwich and
fries. ``It was just a few cans of Coke, and for this they do all
this? American companies have enough money to waste, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   The student washed down his lunch with an iced Coke. Belgium's
ban on fountain drinks was lifted last week.
</P>
<P>
   Upbeat about France
</P>
<P>
   ``We're encouraged by the statements of the French
authorities,'' Donaldson said after the country said it had found
the company's products safe for consumption and a top official said
the crisis there may be near an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a personal conviction, but I may be mistaken, that we
will see a way out of the crisis this evening or tomorrow
morning,'' Lebranchu, the consumer affairs minister, told the
Agence French-Presse on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   French scientists say they have found nothing wrong with
Coca-Cola products tested over the weekend, confirming the
company's assertion that there is no health risk in consuming its
products.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Hirsch, the head of the government's food safety and
agency, echoed this assessment and predicted that experts making
the final review of the data should wrap up their work today.
</P>
<P>
   But Lebranchu said while France will likely allow cans of
Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Light (the European version of Diet Coke),
Fanta and Sprite from Dunkirk back on sale, the ban will remain in
place on beverages imported from Belgium to France.
</P>
<P>
   ``All (Coca-Cola) products transported on Belgian pallets will
remain under embargo,'' she said in a Reuters report. ``I do not
see who would allow them back.''
</P>
<P>
   In other developments:
</P>
<P>
   _ Investigators from the European Union began inspecting
Coca-Cola Enterprises plants in Antwerp and Dunkirk Tuesday
morning. The EU was moved to enter the fray in part because it says
no one has turned up a conclusive explanation to explain the
illnesses. The EU's executive body, the European Commission,
expects to wrap up its inspection Friday and announce its findings
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   _ Health officials in Portugal plan to inspect a Coca-Cola
factory in Lisbon after a dark residue was found in the bottom of
several cans of the soft drink.
</P>
<P>
   Traces of carbon used in the Lisbon factory's water filtering
system became mixed with the drink in up to 3,000 cans, which the
company has withdrawn, company spokesman Tiago Lima said.
</P>
<P>
   A Capital newspaper reported no drink had an odd taste or odor
and no illnesses were reported. A Coca-Cola Portugal spokesman told
the paper that the residue was harmless.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola has published full-page newspaper ads in recent days
assuring the public that drinks produced at its Portuguese factory
are safe.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coca-Cola Co. handed out free Coca-Cola Light in Switzerland
to reassure customers its drinks are safe.
</P>
<P>
   _ The company informed the Mexican government that its beverages
posed no health risks after the country's health department asked
for a report on the situation in Europe, Bloomberg News reported.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico, the largest per-capita consumer of Coca-Cola products,
wanted to know whether a similar problem could arise there.

CORRECTABLE IMPAIRMENTS SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED DISABILITIES, HIGH
COURT RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also SCOTUS-ADA, SCOTUS-EMPLOY-DISCRIMINATE) 
(rm) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Resolving one of the most pressing questions of
federal disability law, the Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that people
with physical impairments who can function normally when they wear
their glasses or take their medicine generally cannot be considered
disabled and therefore do not come within the law's protection
against employment discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   By a surprisingly wide 7-2 margin, the court took a restrictive
view of the definition of disability under the Americans With
Disabilities Act of 1990. Employers greeted the decision with
relief, saying it would prevent an uncontrollable expansion of the
law, while advocates for people with disabilities said the court's
definition of disability would remove the law's protection from
millions of people who needed it.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled in three separate cases, rejecting the
discrimination claims in each one by the same 7-2 vote. The
dissenters in each case were Justices John Paul Stevens and Stephen
G. Breyer; Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote two of the majority
opinions and Justice David H. Souter wrote one.
</P>
<P>
   The losing plaintiffs were: two nearsighted women, twin sisters
with vision correctable to 20/20, whom United Air Lines turned down
for jobs as pilots; a truck driver with functional vision in only
one eye, who saw normally for most purposes but who was dismissed
for not meeting the federal vision standard for driving commercial
vehicles, and a hypertensive automobile mechanic, whose blood
pressure kept him from meeting federal standards for driving a
truck but, when controlled by medication, left him able to hold
non-driving mechanics' jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate ruling Tuesday, the court interpreted another
provision of the Americans With Disabilities Act to give states the
obligation to care for people with mental and other disabilities in
group homes or other non-institutionalized settings, when medically
appropriate and not an unreasonable burden on the a state's
resources.
</P>
<P>
   In the trio of employment discrimination cases, there were
several secondary issues but there was one central question: should
a ``disability'' be measured in its untreated state or in light of
any corrective measures that can enable a person to function
normally?
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor answered the question in the leading case, the suit by
the twin sisters against United Air Lines. The sisters flew as
pilots for regional airlines, and met federal vision standards for
airline pilots, but were turned down by United because they did not
meet its standard for uncorrected vision of 20/40.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said that three provisions of the disability law led to
the conclusion that people with remediable conditions were not
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   First, she said, was the law's definition of disability as an
impairment that ``substantially limits one or more of the major
life activities,'' a definition expressed in the ``present
indicative verb form,'' O'Connor noted. ``We think the language is
properly read as requiring that a person be presently _ not
potentially or hypothetically _ substantially limited in order to
demonstrate a disability,'' she said, adding that ``a `disability'
exists only where an impairment `substantially limits' a major life
activity, not where it `might,' `could,' or `would' be
substantially limiting if mitigating measures were not taken.''
</P>
<P>
   A person with a corrected impairment still has the impairment,
O'Connor said, ``but if the impairment is corrected it does not
`substantially limit' a major life activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, she said, the law requires that people be assessed on
the basis of their individual conditions, not as members of a group
that is usually affected in a particular way by an uncorrected
impairment.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, O'Connor said, the findings that Congress incorporated
in the text of the law included the statement that ``some
43,000,000 Americans have one or more physical or mental
disabilities.'' O'Connor said that while the source of this figure
was uncertain, Congress could not possibly have meant to include
all the people who wear glasses or have some other correctable
problem, because the number in that case would be closer to 160
million. ``The 43 million figure reflects an understanding that
those whose impairments are largely corrected by medication or
other devices are not `disabled' within the meaning of the ADA,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the dissenting opinion in this case, Sutton vs. United Air
Lines, No. 97-1943, Stevens, joined by Breyer, said that ``in order
to be faithful to the remedial purpose of the act, we should give
it a generous, rather than a miserly, construction.'' Congress's
use of the 43 million figure may have been a form of ``legislative
myopia,'' Stevens said, that should not be invoked to determine the
scope of the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the purpose of the ADA is to dismantle the employment
barriers based on society's accumulated myths and fears,'' Stevens
continued, ``it is especially ironic to deny protection for persons
with substantially limiting impairments that, when corrected,
render them fully able and employable.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, referring to the sisters in the case: ``If United
regards petitioners as unqualified because they cannot see well
without glasses, it seems eminently fair for a court also to use
uncorrected vision as the basis for evaluating petitioners' life
activity of seeing.''
</P>
<P>
   The criticism from advocates for people with disabilities
mirrored Stevens's dissent. Professor Chai Feldblum of Georgetown
Law School, one of the drafters of the law, said the decisions
``create the absurd result of a person being disabled enough to be
fired from a job, but not disabled enough to challenge the
firing.'' Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who was one of the chief Senate
sponsors, said the decision ``undermined one of the most basic
principles of the ADA,'' which he said was to ``eliminate
discrimination against every individual with a disability.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stephen Bokat, general counsel of the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, praised the court's interpretation for avoiding a ``huge
growth in the number of cases.'' He said the most important aspect
of the rulings from an employer's perspective was the court's
conclusion that ``creating physical criteria for a job ordinarily
does not violate the ADA.'' He added: ``The statute protects you
from discrimination in a class of jobs, but it does not guarantee
you a particular job.''
</P>
<P>
   David Fram, director of the National Employment Law Institute,
an organization here that trains corporate managers and others on
how to apply the disabilities law, called the decisions ``a great
victory for management.'' He said he was ``shocked'' by the court's
``very hard line.'' He noted that most lower courts, as well as the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, had taken the opposite
view.
</P>
<P>
   In her opinion in the United Air Lines case, O'Connor said ``an
employer is free to decide that physical characteristics or medical
conditions that do not rise to level of am impairment _ such as
one's height, build, or singing voice _ are preferable to others,
just as it is free to decide that some limiting, but not
substantially limiting, impairments make individuals less than
ideally suited for a job.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor rejected a suggestion in the dissenting opinion that
even people with artificial limbs would not be considered disabled
under the majority's analysis. People may be highly functional with
prosthetic devices but still be ``substantially limited'' in such
activities as walking or running, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that under another provision of the law, people with
correctable impairments may still be covered as disabled if an
employer ``regards'' them as disabled. However, the majority's
analysis of the law's ``regarded as disabled'' prong appeared to be
somewhat limiting; to come within this section, O'Connor said, a
person would have to be regarded as ``unable to work in a broad
class of jobs,'' not just the job in question.
</P>
<P>
   The other two cases were Murphy vs. United Parcel Service, No.
97-1992, and Albertson's vs. Kirkingburg, No. 98-591. Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M.
Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined the
majority opinions by O'Connor and Souter.

morning. The EU was moved to enter the fray in part because it says
no one has turned up a conclusive explanation to explain the
illnesses. The EU's executive body, the European Commission,
expects to wrap up its inspection Friday and announce its findings
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   _ Health officials in Portugal plan to inspect a Coca-Cola
factory in Lisbon after a dark residue was found in the bottom of
several cans of the soft drink.
</P>
<P>
   Traces of carbon used in the Lisbon factory's water filtering
system became mixed with the drink in up to 3,000 cans, which the
company has withdrawn, company spokesman Tiago Lima said.
</P>
<P>
   A Capital newspaper reported no drink had an odd taste or odor
and no illnesses were reported. A Coca-Cola Portugal spokesman told
the paper that the residue was harmless.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola has published full-page newspaper ads in recent days
assuring the public that drinks produced at its Portuguese factory
are safe.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coca-Cola Co. handed out free Coca-Cola Light in Switzerland
to reassure customers its drinks are safe.
</P>
<P>
   _ The company informed the Mexican government that its beverages
posed no health risks after the country's health department asked
for a report on the situation in Europe, Bloomberg News reported.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico, the largest per-capita consumer of Coca-Cola products,
wanted to know whether a similar problem could arise there.

U.N. PANEL SAYS MORE COUNTRIES ARE STUDYING YEAR 2000 PROBLEMS

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Disruptions from Year 2000 computer problems
are inevitable, but are not likely to be as widespread or serious
as feared just six months ago, said organizers of an international
conference that ended two days of meetings on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Action is under way everywhere, by and large on schedule,''
said Ahmad Kamal, the Pakistani representative to the United
Nations and chairman of its working group on information
technology.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting had delegates from 173 countries, a jump from the
120 at first global Year 2000 meeting here in December. Organizers
said the regional sessions that led up to it were creating ties
that could encourage international cooperation on technical issues
long after the Year 2000 challenge had passed.
</P>
<P>
   The problem stems from the use of two digits to represent years,
like 99 for 1999. Some computers and programs read 00 as 1900
instead of 2000, and others do not recognize it as a valid year,
leading to miscalculations or crashes. Most countries started much
later than the United States in dealing with the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amount of cooperation going on is fascinating,'' John
Koskinen, chairman of President Clinton's Council on Year 2000
Conversion, said. ``A lot of the worry about international
preparedness a year and a half ago was because no one could imagine
putting all these people together.''
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen said Latin American countries had created a
continent-wide map of electricity grids and had been discussing
using such information in cooperative projects.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the cheer, though, are continuing uncertainties about how
far along many countries really are and how thorough their
contingency plans are. Russia, speaking directly to a concern in
Europe, which has vivid memories of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster,
pledged to have all its nuclear power plants repaired and tested by
September. But there was no information about how the testing would
be conducted.
</P>
<P>
   Many countries are still uncertain, as well, about how much
information to divulge. Venezuela fears creating runs on banks and
food shortages if it follows the lead of the United States in
advising citizens to prepare for several days of disruptions, said
Hugo Castellanos, head of the Year 2000 agency there. Japan also
has yet to decide how to address its citizens, and New Zealand's
plans include delivering a checklist of preparations to every house
in September.
</P>
<P>
   Some historic tensions proved impossible to set aside. North
African and Middle Eastern nations refused to allow Israel to
participate in their regional meeting, which Morocco organized.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't force people to invite people they don't want in
their homes,'' Kamal said after reporters had expressed disbelief
at his statement that Israel could have been excluded because
Morocco had determined that Israel had no ``shared problems'' with
its neighbors. Kamal said Israel had accepted an invitation to make
a separate presentation that included an offer to share expertise
with any other country.

   ATLANTA _ Tuesday's public apology to Belgians by Coca-Cola
Chairman M. Douglas Ivester apparently was accepted on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock climbed as much as 5.2 percent at one point
during trading before retreating to a smaller gain after news broke
that Belgium had postponed its decision on whether to lift its ban
on the company's top soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   The stock closed up 1.7 percent, or $1.06 1/4, at $62.62 1/2 on
heavy volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors are concluding that eventually this, too, shall
pass,'' Manny Goldman, global beverage analyst for Merrill Lynch,
said of the European health scare. Ivester issued an personal
apology in full-page ads that ran in 15 Belgian newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Also, analysts said bargain hunters may be on the prowl since
Coca-Cola shares had fallen 9 percent between June 8, when children
in Belgium first reported becoming ill after drinking Coca-Cola
products, and Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Coca-Cola's shares fell nearly 3 percent after
Goldman Sachs analyst Marc Cohen cut his earnings and volume
estimates because of the company's overseas problems.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen expects Coca-Cola to have a second-quarter profit of 40
cents a share instead of 41 cents. He also indicated that the
company's case volume could be slightly weaker, partly because of
the product scare.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola has lost $24 million in revenue from the recalls and
product bans, according to an estimate by analyst Martin Romm at
Credit Suisse First Boston. That amounts to 0.000595 per share in
lost profit.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Enterprises, the bottler that
owns the two plants at the center of the crisis, fell 50 cents
Tuesday to close at $32.62 1/2 on heavy volume. CCE's shares have
lost 10 percent since June 8.

<P>
   Dennis A. Moore had spent much of last Wednesday night collapsed
on the floor of his home near the mouth of the Amazon River,
wracked by fever, violent shakes, and intense stomach pains.
</P>
<P>
   It had already been a horrible spring for Moore, a scholar of
tribal languages, who had recently learned that the Brazilian
government was cutting funding for his research.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Thursday, the phone rang. It was the man from the
MacArthur Foundation calling to say that he had just won a huge
cash award _ a ``genius grant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that I'd just had the worst night of my life,''
Moore said. ``He said, `Yeah, well this is going to be your best
morning.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Moore, a Michigan native, is among the 32 MacArthur Fellows
announced Tuesday by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur
Foundation, which awards stipends to intellectual innovators to
free them from the constraints of their daily financial
obligations.
</P>
<P>
   The five-year grants, which range from $200,000 to $375,000, are
dropped like manna from heaven on winners who are rarely aware
thatthey are under consideration. The money comes with no strings
attached.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a gift of time,'' said Daniel J. Socolow, director of the
MacArthur Fellows Program. ``It drops out of the sky, and it gives
extraordinary people the space and time to do their thing in the
way they want to. It's magical.''
</P>
<P>
   Three Massachusetts residents are among this year's winners.
They are John Bonifaz of the National Voting Rights Institute,
social historian Jacqueline Jones of Brandeis University, and
physicist Juan M. Maldacena of Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   The MacArthur Foundation is recognizing Maldacena, 30, for his
work in the abstract field of string theory, which postulates the
existence of constituents of matter that are too tiny to detect
with the latest experimental apparatus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to understand string theory and how nature behaves
in very short distances and at very early periods of time, close to
the beginning of the Big Bang, the beginning of the universe,''
said Maldacena, who lives in Cambridge, Mass. He said he hadn't
decided what to do yet with the prize money.
</P>
<P>
   Bonifaz, 33, also of Cambridge, an energetic public interest
lawyer, uses litigation to press for campaign finance reform. The
National Voting Rights Institute, which he heads, has been retained
to defend several state-based campaign-finance reforms passed by
ballot initiatives or legislators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to say that we are a democracy,'' Bonifaz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is we have a plutocracy, where less than one
percent of the population is giving 80 percent of the money to
campaigns. That angers me deeply.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, of Wellesley, Mass., the Harry S. Truman professor of
American history at Brandeis, is being recognized for her
scholarship on labor history. She has focused on how economic
transformations have affected the status of workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this as a validation of the effort to bring the voices
of ordinary working people to a larger, modern audience,'' she said
of the award. Jones learned of the award as she returned Thursday
from a lunch in Cambridge to celebrate her 51st birthday. On her
answering machine was a message from the MacArthur Foundation,
urging her to return the call. The message said, ``This is a call
you'll want to make.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband and I just looked at each other and laughed,''
Jones said. ``It was a complete surprise _ pretty shocking
actually.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore, who was reached at his home in Belem, Brazil, said he was
still dumbfounded by the $365,000 prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would take until the year 2016 for me to earn that kind of
money,'' said Moore, who was recognized for his work preserving the
language and culture of endangered indigenous groups in the Amazon
region. ``It kind of puts a floor under you when you've been
hanging from a cliff from your fingers for so many years.''

PRINCESS CRUISE LINE TO MOVE TO VALENCIA   IN SANTA CLARITA,
CALIF.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ANGELA M. LEMIRE AND PATRICIA FARRELL AIDEM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Princess Cruises will move its headquarters to
Valencia in the Santa Clarita Valley north of Los Angeles,
consolidating operations in a deal that marks the largest-ever
corporate relocation to Santa Clarita, company officials said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The move from Century City in Los Angeles will bring another 750
employees to Princess offices at the Valencia Town Center. Princess
moved its 750-employee customer service operation to Valencia in
November, lured by Santa Clarita's 15-year moratorium on business
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The new move is to consolidate as the company expands its
10-ship fleet with seven more ocean liners, said Rick James, senior
vice president of customer service and sales for the cruise line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company will be doubling in size between now and 2004,''
James said. ``With that expanding work force, we wanted the company
to be in one location.''
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clarita's economic development manager, Michael Haviland,
heralded the announcement as solidifying Santa Clarita's
``prestige'' as a growing industrial center in Los Angeles County,
as well as a direct result of the city's competitive,
business-friendly policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're obviously very pleased, especially since we worked
closely with them initially to bring them here,'' Haviland said of
the privately owned, 34-year-old cruise line. ``It's a pleasure
having a company of that prestige here in our community.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the cruise line's move to Valencia will not yield
business tax revenues, the city regards its presence ``in terms of
the work force'' brought to the city, said Haviland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people that work in a community spend money in a
community,'' he said, projecting that the company's workers would
frequent area retailers and restaurants. That, in turn, would lure
other prospective retailers to the Valencia Town Center.
</P>
<P>
   The cruise line expects to complete the new headquarters in
spring of 2001. The new offices will be in two buildings _ of four
and five stories _ with the ground levels reserved for retail
shops. The buildings will house fleet operations, marketing,
finance, legal, land programs, yield management and human resources
departments.
</P>
<P>
   The customer service center is housed in a six-story building,
also with retail space on pedestrian-oriented Town Center Drive.
The trio of buildings will cover a total of 270,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   The Princess complex will be part of a shopping and
entertainment district under construction by The Newhall Land and
Farming Company. Restaurants, a Borders book store and an Edwards
Cinema with 12 screens opened recently on Town Center Drive, where
an Imax 3-D theater is under construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The staff loves it there,'' James said. ``It's a great
location.''
</P>
<P>
   Some employees lived in Santa Clarita before the first
relocation, and several others have since moved to the area, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cushman Realty Corp. engineered the 15-year, $65 million lease
transaction on behalf of Princess.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Princess Cruises move represents the largest corporate
headquarters relocation to the Valencia area,'' said John C.
Cushman III, the realty company's president and chief executive
officer.
</P>
<P>
   The planned relocation is a milestone transaction that
reinforces the favorable economic environment that is drawing
businesses to the Santa Clarita Valley, Cushman said.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction represents a 163,000-square-foot expansion of
Princess Cruises' 108,000-square-foot existing space, which will
allow the cruise line to expand the customer service center and
relocate its corporate headquarters. &QL;

HINDU PRIEST CONVICTED OF SEXUALLY ASSAULTING ARKANSAS WOMAN

<P>
   HOUSTON _ A Hindu priest sobbed Tuesday when a jury convicted
him of sexually assaulting a 21-year-old Little Rock, Ark., college
student who sought his spiritual guidance.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors deliberated about an hour and 45 minutes before
convicting Bhogeshwernand Sharma. He now could be given probation
or a prison term of up to 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Sharma, 37, wept and continually dabbed his eyes. He became even
more upset when his wife, Aneeta Sharma, testified in the
punishment phase and said her husband could obey any probation
terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not the monster these people have made him out to be,''
said the angry wife. ``This has been a masquerade here from day
one.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman also called the 21-year-old and her mother ``fools''
who envied her family.
</P>
<P>
   Sharma sexually assaulted the 21-year-old on or about April 3,
1998, at his Harris County home, according to testimony. The woman
and her mother said they first met Sharma in September 1997 at a
prayer meeting in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   The mother and daughter and her aunt said they had sought
Sharma's help with medical problems and he later converted them to
Hinduism, becoming their Hindu ``godfather'' or ``guru.''
</P>
<P>
   The mother and her sister say Sharma bullied them into sex
during the September 1997 visit, using the pretext of blessings or
rituals to get them alone on separate days.
</P>
<P>
   They say he told them he needed to cleanse them with his ``holy
sperm.'' They also say he told them they or their kin would suffer
or die if they didn't submit or if they told anyone about it.
</P>
<P>
   The mother and daughter saw Sharma again October 1997 in
Arkansas. They visited him in Houston in April 1998 and that's when
the daughter says he used the same tactics on her.
</P>
<P>
   Sharma is not charged in Arkansas with the alleged encounters
with the mother and aunt, but their testimony was allowed in this
case.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   A fourth Hindu woman called prosecutor Kelly Siegler during the
trial and alleged that she had been sexually assaulted by Sharma in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Siegler told state District Judge Ted Poe about the woman Monday
and, outside the presence of jurors, she said the woman told her
that Sharma's brothers and his mother talked her out of coming
forward in February.
</P>
<P>
   Bashist Sharma, the defendant's brother and co-counsel in the
case, said, with jurors out of the room, that he didn't recall the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Siegler intended to call the defendant's brother, Jai Sharma,
and his mother to the stand Tuesday. But they, along with Bashist,
hired an attorney who told Poe they would invoke their Fifth
Amendment right.
</P>
<P>
   Jai Sharma, also an attorney, represented his brother at one
time.
</P>
<P>
   Poe ruled that any testimony on the alleged February meeting was
inadmissible. Bashist Sharma removed himself as co-counsel at the
urging of lead defense lawyer Katherine Scardino, who said she knew
nothing about the fourth woman until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Siegler said in court Tuesday that a family friend of the
Sharmas apparently called the woman's father Monday to talk about
her accusations. That woman did not testify.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In closing arguments, lead defense lawyer Katherine Scardino hit
on the big themes of her defense, which has been a mix of alibi
witnesses and attacks on the credibility of the three women.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case stinks,'' said Scardino, who argued that no
reasonable woman would believe such diagnoses and predictions, or
submit to such crude come-ons from a man they hardly knew.
</P>
<P>
   Scardino said the three women had lied and that her defense
witnesses clearly showed that Sharma was never alone with them in
Houston or Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   But Siegler countered that the women had no motive to lie. She
said their story did sound strange, but that was because Sharma
picked his vulnerable victims well.
</P>
<P>
   Siegler also attacked the credibility of Sharma's alibi
witnesses, most of whom were either related to or friends of
Sharma. She said they had lied for Sharma out of loyalty to a
smooth manipulator who ``cloaks himself in the mystery and secrecy
of Hinduism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all just a big incestuous mess,'' Siegler said of the
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Over the Scardino's objections, Siegler hinted there might be
other victims in the Hindu community and a guilty verdict could
protect them from Sharma.
</P>
<P>
   Sharma's relatives were dismayed at the verdict. Scardino told
reporters later that her task had been made harder because she had
to defend Sharma against three accusations, though he was only
charged with one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the jury believed those three women from Arkansas
over all the witnesses I produced in front of this jury,'' Scardino
said. ``I don't mean to sound like sour grapes, but it's hard for
me to believe that they would believe those stories instead of the
credible people I put in front of the jury.''
</P>
<P>
   Scardino said she hoped jurors would consider probation.
</P>
<P>
   Closing arguments in the punishment phase will be Wednesday. If
Sharma gets prison time, he will have to serve a quarter of it
before he is eligible for parole.

SENATE BLOCKS BILL RESTRICTING STEEL IMPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., N.Y., Pa., Minn., Texas)  (mk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Tuesday blocked the passage of a bill
that would have sharply restricted imports of foreign steel to the
United States, a blow to unions and steelmakers and a victory for
President Clinton, who had warned that the legislation would revive
protectionism.
</P>
<P>
   After some furious last-minute vote-switching, supporters of
placing tight quotas on imported steel _ both Democrats and
Republicans from steelmaking states that have been hit by Asian
imports _ attracted 42 votes of the 60 votes required to end debate
and move toward a vote on the actual legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which is now dead, would have rolled back imports of
steel to the levels before the Asian economic crisis, ending a
surge that began as countries sought to export their way out of
their economic trouble.
</P>
<P>
   After the House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved the
import quotas in March, the debate over steel quotas took on far
greater dimensions. It became a divisive argument over the merits
of free trade, and the economic wisdom of protecting steelworkers
at the expense of raising prices on a range of every day goods _
from American-made cars, to housing, airplanes and farm equipment.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Clinton won the day by allying with key Republicans
_ including the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, R-Miss., who
reversed earlier indications that he might support the legislation
and took to the floor of the Senate just before the vote to warn
his colleagues that if the measure passed, ``the consequences would
be dire indeed.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Lott, who a few days ago seemed to be enjoying the
administration's discomfort on the issue, sounded surprisingly like
a member of the White House economic team. He argued from the well
of the Senate that the bill would ``adversely affect our businesses
and farmers who depend upon access to the international market.
There's no question that this bill will undercut the economic
growth that we enjoy today.''
</P>
<P>
   The action also removed Vice President Al Gore from a political
quandary. He had been caught between the administration's
free-trade instincts and the United Steelworkers of America, whose
support he seeks in his presidential bid. On Monday night Gore,
siding with the White House, called the legislation ``unnecessary''
but was reluctant to join in working actively for its defeat.
</P>
<P>
   That was left largely to members of the Cabinet, especially the
outgoing Treasury secretary, Robert Rubin, and Commerce Secretary
William Daley. Daley successfully argued that a series of actions
he has taken to prevent the ``dumping'' of steel in the American
market _ including placing retaliatory tariffs on Japan, South
Korea and Brazil _ was already succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's brief but heated debate Tuesday on the steel quotas
revealed the degree to which the economic prosperity of the 1990s
has changed the nature of political discourse. While senators from
many steel-producing states argued passionately about the need to
protect the jobs of their constituents, they were outnumbered by
those who concluded that an industry that employs 170,000 workers
should not be protected by raising the price of steel for virtually
every consumer in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   One estimate, put together by the Institute for International
Economics, suggested that each job saved by the import quota would
cost consumers $800,000, an argument the steel lobby never
answered.
</P>
<P>
   Several senators from both parties warned that the bill, while
it might protect steelworkers, risked repeating what is now
considered one of Congress' greatest economic blunders of this
century: the Smoot-Hawley Act of 1930, which many economists now
believe deepened the Great Depression. While economic conditions
today are the exact opposite of what they were then, Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., warned that passage of the bill would
result in ``an immediate reaction'' around the world, as countries
imposed retaliatory restrictions on American products.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, last-minute lobbying by agricultural interests,
which likely would have been the first victims of that retaliation,
turned the vote around. ``They came on big time,'' said Sen. Rick
Santorum, R-Pa., who served as the floor manager for the defeated
bill. ``And the White House lobbied hard. They saw this as a big
political loser for Al Gore, and they wanted to protect him.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, that appears to be exactly what happened in the last 90
seconds or so of voting, when senators are free to approach the
clerks and quietly switch sides. Several Democrats, realizing the
import quotas were going down to defeat, changed their vote to
support the White House, which on Monday night thought that the
vote would be extremely close. ``Two weeks ago,'' one senior
administration official said, ``we thought this bill might pass
with a veto-proof majority.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote clearly left a residue of anger, though, within
Democratic ranks. Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., said, ``The White
House is saying that the steel crisis is over, and so they pulled
all the stops to defeat this bill. Well, last weekend I was on the
Iron Range in northeastern Minnesota. I talked to some of the
workers who just got laid off at EVTAC Mining in Eveleth, Minn.,
and to some of the workers who are going to be laid off at the end
of this month. For them, the steel crisis is not over. For their
husbands and wives and children, the steel crisis is not over.''
</P>
<P>
   In an economy with rising unemployment, such arguments would
probably have carried far more weight. But the remarkable expansion
of the last few years apparently led a number of senators to buy
the argument that the retaliation by other nations would be far
more costly to other American workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill will kill jobs,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas.
`Since we are the greatest beneficiary of international trade, we
will lose more than anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a statement released by the White House,
acknowledged that ``the surge in steel imports has created a
significant hardship for many steelworkers and communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``But quota legislation was the wrong approach and would have
weakened our economy and undermined our ability to tear down unfair
trade barriers in foreign countries.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate seems likely to take up in the next few weeks an
alterative to the quota bill that would strengthen American
anti-dumping laws, giving the Commerce Department more weaponry to
fight imports that are priced below manufacturing costs.

COURT NARROWS RIGHT TO SUE UNDER DISABILITIES ACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a string of important rulings on the Americans
with Disabilities Act, the Supreme Court Tuesday restricted who can
sue for employment discrimination under the 1990 law and also told
states to expand housing and treatment options for the mentally
ill.
</P>
<P>
   Business groups such as the US Chamber of Commerce hailed three
related workplace decisions as a ``victory for employers'' because
the court said people with correctable disabilities, like poor
eyesight or high blood pressure, cannot bring lawsuits under the
ADA against companies that fire them, or won't hire them, because
of their condition.
</P>
<P>
   The closely watched cases involved two nearsighted sisters who
wanted to be pilots for United Air Lines, a truck mechanic fired by
United Parcel Service because of his high blood pressure, and a
trucker for Albertsons food stores who was dismissed after the
company learned he was functionally blind in one eye.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the 7-2 majority in the United Air Lines case,
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said Congress did not intend for the
disabilites act to cover the estimated 160 million Americans with
correctable impairments. The legislation was aimed at protecting
some 43 million people whose physical and mental disabilities limit
their ``major life activities,'' O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   Though acknowledging Congress's source for the 43 million was
unclear, ``the figure reflects an understanding that those whose
impairments are largely corrected by medication or other devices
are not `disabled' within the meaning'' of the disabilities act,
O'Connor wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Advocacy groups for the disabled called the workplace rulings a
major setback. At the same time they applaudd the court for a
separate 6-3 decision that said states discriminate against
mentally ill people when they institutionalize them in psychiatric
hospitals rather than provide community housing and home-based
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unnecessary segregation of persons with mental disabilities
perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that such persons are unfit
for, or unworthy of, participating in community life,'' Justice
Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for the majority. Dissenting were Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Clarence Thomas, who
wrote the minority opinion, and Antonin Scalia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Temporary exclusion from community placement does not amount
to `discrimination' in the traditional sense of the word,'' Thomas
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The case centered on two mentally disabled women who charged the
state of Georgia with discrimination for confining them to a
psychiatric hospital when they wanted to live and receive services
in their community and near their families.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, claiming a state's right to make its own mental-health
treatment and housing decisions, initially had 26 other states,
including Massachusetts, weigh in on its side. But an intense
national lobbying campaign last winter by disabilities-rights
groups persuaded Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly to change his
mind, and Massachusetts had its name removed from an amicus brief.
</P>
<P>
   John Widdison, spokesman for the state's Department of Mental
Health, said Tuesday's ruling would have little practical
application in Massachusetts because most of the state's
mental-health clients are already being treated in communities, a
trend that began in 1992 when the state closed four psychiatric
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   In a White House statement, President Clinton said he was
pleased by the Georgia decision and pledged that the departments of
Justice and Health and Human Services would assist states in
carrying it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing so will advance the goals of the ADA and bring us closer
to our ultimate goal _ a nation that integrates people with
disabilities into the social mainstream, promotes equality of
opportunity, and maximizes individual choice,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration had argued in favor of extending the scope of
the ADA to protect people who claim a disability, even if there are
``mitigating measures'' _ medications, devices, treatments _ that
allow them to function fully in jobs and other activities. Lower
courts had been divided over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The court majority, in its first major interpretations of the
disabilities law, said a disability exists only when an impairment
``substantially limits'' a person's ability to have a normal work
and social life _ ``not where it `might,' `could,' or `would' be
substantially limiting if mitigating measures were not taken,''
O'Connor wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the court said, employers under the ADA have the
right to establish physical criteria that suit the job. United Air
Lines, for example, did not discriminate against Karen Sutton and
her twin sister, Kimberly Hinton, by requiring its global airline
pilots to have uncorrected 20/20 vision while it does not impose
the same criteria on regional pilots or flight instructors, the
court said. The sisters, who had been regional pilots, had been
turned down as global pilots because they wear glasses.
</P>
<P>
   UPS did not discriminate when it fired Vaughn Murphy, the
mechanic with high blood pressure, because he was unqualified for a
particular job that required him to operate motor vehicles and meet
a high federal health standard, the court said. He was qualified
for other mechanic positions, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   And Hallie Kirkingburg, the truck driver for Albertsons who
compensated with his right eye for the amblyopia in his left eye,
had excellent vision for many jobs but it was not good enough for
driving a commercial truck, the court found.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision turns the ADA law on its head,'' said Chai
Feldblum, a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center who
worked with advocacy groups and Congress to write the disabilites
law. ``What the court said is that if you have an impairment that
makes you dysfunctional, you can be fired, and it's not
discrimination. And if you are qualified for the job, then you are
not disabled enough to be discriminated against.''
</P>
<P>
   Feldblum said she expects disabilities-rights groups to urge
Congress to amend the law and clarify the definition of who is
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Writing dissenting opinions on the workplace cases, Stevens said
a corrective device does not, in itself, relieve a disability. The
court majority had a ``crabbed vision'' of the disabilities law, he
said, and Congress, ``by reason of legislative myopia, may not have
foreseen its definition of `disability' might theoretically
encompass not just some `43 million Americans' but perhaps two or
three times that number.'' Justice Stephen Breyer also dissented in
the cases.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Conrad, senior vice president of the Chamber of Commerce's
National Litigation Center, said she believed ``the 43 million
figure'' did make an impact on the court, just as the complexity
and reach of the law has had a chilling effect on the business
community. Tuesday's rulings, she predicted, represented the first
round of interpretations of a law that is in for much litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the beginning,'' Conrad said, ``but we are off to
a good start.''
</P>
<P>
   The cases are Sutton et al. v. United Air Lines, Inc. No.
97-1943. Albertsons, Inc., v. Kirkingburg. No. 98-591. Murphy v.
United Parcel Service, Inc. No. 97-1992. Olmstead v. L.C. No.
98-536.

COURT RULES 5-4 THAT EMPLOYER MAY NOT LIABLE FOR EMPLOYEE'S
DISCRIMINATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Supreme Court ruling Tuesday in an important
civil rights case made it unlikely that many employees who bring
successful discrimination suits against their employers will be
able to collect punitive damages, a remedy that Congress made
available for the first time when it amended the Civil Rights Act
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-4 decision held that when a company has made ``good-faith
efforts'' to comply with the civil rights law, it cannot be
required to pay punitive damages for the discriminatory actions of
managers who violate company policy.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the majority, said that
this standard would serve the purpose of encouraging companies to
adopt anti-discrimination policies and thus would help ``promote
prevention as well as remediation.''
</P>
<P>
   She said this was an important goal of Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, the basic federal law that prohibits
discrimination in employment on the basis of race and sex. The
decision was important beyond Title VII cases, because that law's
remedial standards also apply to the Americans With Disabilities
Act and to the Federal Fair Housing Act.
</P>
<P>
   Although punitive damages have not been common under any of
these laws, the potential that a jury might award them has been a
factor in large settlements.
</P>
<P>
   In a dissenting opinion, Justice John Paul Stevens said the
standard the majority adopted was ``gratuitous'' and ``ill
advised,'' because it was based on a legal theory that neither side
had argued.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, which left many important questions unanswered,
was a surprising outcome to a closely watched case that had already
produced a bitter 6-5 split on the federal appeals court here.
</P>
<P>
   The case began as a lawsuit against the American Dental
Association by a woman who was passed over for a high-level
position in the organization's Washington office in favor of a man
with less experience.
</P>
<P>
   A jury in U.S. District Court here found in 1996 that the
plaintiff, Carole Kolstad, had been the victim of intentional sex
discrimination and awarded her back pay of $52,718. But the judge
would not permit the jury to consider an award of punitive damages,
and the case turned into a battle over what circumstances Congress
had in mind when it amended Title VII in 1991 and made punitive
damages of up to $300,000 available in cases of intentional
discrimination in which the employer acted ``with malice or with
reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of an
aggrieved individual.''
</P>
<P>
   In its 6-5 decision last year, the District of Columbia U.S.
Court of Appeals held that punitive damages were available only
when the employer's behavior was particularly ``egregious'' _ a
word that did not appear in the statute and which, the dissenting
judges objected, reflected an effort by the majority to limit the
law by effectively rewriting it.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kolstad's Supreme Court appeal, Kolstad vs. American Dental
Association, No. 98-208, focused entirely on the ``egregious
conduct'' standard _ an argument that she in fact won Tuesday.
Seven justices, all except Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justice Clarence Thomas, agreed that the law did not make egregious
conduct a prerequisite to punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Connor's majority opinion then turned to an issue that had
not been argued by the parties, and that was suggested only in a
friend of the court brief filed on the dental association's behalf
by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. That question was whether a
company could be held liable for punitive damages at all for the
discriminatory actions of its employees.
</P>
<P>
   This was a question the court dealt with in a somewhat different
context last year in a pair of sexual harassment rulings. In those
cases, the court ruled that employers generally had to take
``reasonable care'' to prevent supervisory employees from harassing
lower level workers. The court then went further: if the supervisor
had taken ``tangible employment action'' against an employee _
conditioning a promotion on yielding to a sexual demand, for
example _ the company had no defense and was liable.
</P>
<P>
   The court Tuesday made no such distinction among the range of
discriminatory situations that can arise in a workplace. O'Connor
said only that ``in the punitive damages context, an employer may
not be vicariously liable for the discriminatory employment
decisions of managerial agents where these decisions are contrary
to the employer's good-faith efforts to comply with Title VII.''
Nor did the opinion define a good-faith effort.
</P>
<P>
   The decision sent the case back to the appeals court for
reconsideration under the new standard, and it was not completely
clear how the standard would apply to Ms. Kolstad's complaint. The
men who made the promotion decision that the jury found to be
discriminatory were at the highest level of the organization, its
executive director and the acting head of the Washington office, a
factor that Stevens, in his dissenting opinion Tuesday, said made
much of the majority's discussion irrelevant because their actions
were those of the organization's.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy, along with
Rehnquist and Thomas, joined the majority opinion. Justices David
H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer joined the
dissent.

 &HT;    Ruling extends rights of mentally disabled
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ruling Tuesday in a Georgia case, the U.S. Supreme
Court extended the rights of people with mental disabilities,
giving them a greater voice in deciding when they can transfer from
state institutions into homelike settings.
</P>
<P>
   By a 6-3 vote, the high court gave a qualified victory to two
Georgia women who sued the state, seeking to transfer from Georgia
Regional Hospital in DeKalb County and to receive continued
treatment at state expense in a group home.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans With Disabilities Act requires states to move the
mentally disabled into more homelike settings when they are deemed
ready for release from mental institutions and when the state has
the resources to accommodate it, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   The core of the court's ruling _ that the unjustified isolation
of the mentally disabled in institutions is a form of illegal
discrimination _ was hailed as a landmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tremendous victory for people with disabilities,''
said Atlanta Legal Aid lawyer Sue Jamieson, who represented the two
Georgia women.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Supreme Court has now made it clear _ the very act of
unnecessarily segregating a person with mental disabilities
violates his or her civil rights,'' she said. ``We've done that in
this country for generation after generation and decade after
decade without batting an eye. It's a very significant day.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, President Clinton said he was pleased with the
court's ruling, predicting it ``will increase access to home- and
community-based long-term care services and support for these
persons. . . . Our ultimate goal is a nation that integrates people
with disabilities into the social mainstream, promotes equality of
opportunity and maximizes individual choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the high court's ruling sympathized with state concerns
about being able to accommodate the transfers, state Attorney
General Thurbert Baker also claimed victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ruling has something in it that is encouraging to both
sides,'' Baker said. ``It will afford states around the country to
address this in a more even-handed approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Since filing suit in 1995, Elaine Wilson, 47, and Lois Curtis,
31, have been released from Georgia Regional and live in metro
group homes. State doctors had said both women were ready to leave
Georgia Regional at the time they filed suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great,'' Wilson said of the court's decision. ``It
will help other people who want to get out of institutions. I know
it will. I know it will help them get placed in homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the majority, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg set
conditions for transfers out of state institutions: when the
state's treatment professionals have determined that community
placement is appropriate; when the transfer from institutional care
to a less restrictive setting is not opposed by the affected
individual; and when the placement can be reasonably accommodated,
taking into account ``the resources available to the state and the
needs of others with mental disabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg also directed Georgia to put together a
``comprehensive, effectively working plan'' for placing qualified
people with mental disabilities in less restrictive settings than
an institution.
</P>
<P>
   And the state must have a waiting list that moves ``at a
reasonable pace not controlled by the state's endeavors to keep its
institutions fully populated,'' Ginsburg wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The case now returns to federal court in Atlanta, where the
state will be allowed to further defend its position. Ginsburg
instructed lower courts to consider ``the appropriate relief, given
the range of facilities the state maintains for the care and
treatment of persons with diverse mental disabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia has eight psychiatric hospitals housing about 3,000
people, 1,500 of whom are mentally disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Human Resources Commissioner Tommy Olmstead
conceded Tuesday that it costs less to treat a person with mental
disabilities in a group home than in a psychiatric hospital.
</P>
<P>
   But the state does not realize any savings if it has to pay for
both group home treatments and institutions with abundant
vacancies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Olmstead said the state is committed to moving the mentally
disabled into community settings and will continue its efforts to
accommodate the transfers when appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this decision allows us to continue to expand our
community services, reduce our waiting list and safely move people
from our hospitals,'' he said. ``But it's a matter of financing. We
either need to get more money allocated by the state, or we've got
to close hospitals.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamieson, the Legal Aid lawyer, who took the case in 1995, said
the court's ruling means that the DHR can no longer continue
business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision means the state has to begin identifying those
individuals who don't need to be in the psychiatric hospitals and
it means moving these people out at a pace that is appropriate,''
she said. ``The state now knows it can no longer keep people in an
institution when they don't need to be there. Period.''

NEW MUSIC FOR OLD SOUND  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 27) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Lawrence B. Johnson is the music critic of The Detroit News.  
 By LAWRENCE B. JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was an eerie encounter, hearing the high, pianissimo string
harmony rippling into clear presence over the familiar contrapuntal
weave of Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra. Experience suggested that
not even the most expensive compact disk players could extract that
luminous layer of sound from a conventional CD, no matter how
painstaking the mastering process.
</P>
<P>
   But here was an ``ordinary'' disk playing in a moderately priced
machine, and delivering music as transparent, vital and complete as
one expects to hear in a good concert hall.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the CD at hand, created from a 1962 recording by Erich
Leinsdorf and the Boston Symphony, is not at all ordinary.
Standard, yes, in the sense that it can be played on any boombox.
But the breathtaking sound bespeaks a clever grafting of
cutting-edge digital technology onto the garden variety compact
disk.
</P>
<P>
   That hair-raising Bartok belongs to the first fruits of BMG's
new High Performance series, which at the bargain price of $12 per
CD promises digital revelation for classic recordings from deep
within the vault of RCA Victor Red Seal.
</P>
<P>
   The new project, headed by a veteran engineer, Nathaniel S.
Johnson, is something of a higher-tech sequel to BMG's compact disk
revival of the RCA ``Living Stereo'' series, which helped to launch
stereophonic sound in the late 1950s and early '60s.
</P>
<P>
   But while the remastering of ``Living Stereo'' CDs generally
reflects great care, that process still utilizes the same digital
sampling rate of 44.1 kilohertz that has governed the compact disk
since its genesis in the early 1980s. For its High Performance
remastering, BMG uses a sampling rate of 96 kilohertz with 24-bit
resolution, compared with the 16-bit capacity of the CD as we know
it.
</P>
<P>
   This more elegant digitizing process, known as 96/24, will
apparently be the standard for DVD-audio recordings somewhere down
the road. And the latest generation of DVD players can indeed play
back that supersonic mode. But no CD player can do so.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the real magic of BMG's new recycling process springs from
a digital engine that converts the 96/24 masters to the
44.1-kilohertz, 16-bit framework of regular compact disks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You lose some very delicate upper partials in the
down-conversion,'' Johnson said, ``but I have to say a major
benefit of 96/24 is miraculously carried through.''
</P>
<P>
   Miracle or not, the result is quite amazing to hear in disk
after disk. And to experience a work like the Concerto for
Orchestra or its companion here, Kodaly's ``Peacock Variations,''
with such presence and textural depth is to gain a new appreciation
of both Leinsdorf's expansive, clear-sighted interpretations and
the Bostonians' thoroughgoing virtuosity (09026-63309-2).
</P>
<P>
   On a blazing CD of Stravinsky ballets, the Boston Symphony's
1968 recording of ``Petrouchka'' _ with a youthful Michael Tilson
Thomas at the piano _ is paired with the Chicago Symphony's 1969
``Rite of Spring,'' both under the stewardship of Seiji Ozawa
(09026-63311-2). BMG's high-speed processing and 24-bit platform
serve equally well to underscore the fearsome power of the ``Rite''
and the airy brilliance of ``Petrouchka.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet another sonic thriller spotlights the Bizet-Shchedrin
``Carmen Ballet'' in Arthur Fiedler's 1969 recording with the
Boston Pops (09026-63308-2). Scored for strings and a prodigious
percussion battery, Shchedrin's quirky, droll transmogrification of
Bizet's opera has always intrigued recording engineers and
mesmerized hi-fi buffs. But this is surely the work's most vibrant
incarnation ever on disk. Shostakovich's incidental music for
``Hamlet'' and Glazunov's ``Carnaval Overture'' round out the CD.
</P>
<P>
   Scenes from Gershwin's ``Porgy and Bess,'' with Leontyne Price
and William Warfield (09026-63312-2), recorded in 1963, and works
for solo piano by Charles-Valentin Alkan played by Raymond
Lewenthal (09026-63310-2) complete the initial release of five
disks.
</P>
<P>
   The stunning immediacy of Lewenthal's piano sound, which seems
to bring the instrument forward from the loudspeakers, points up
the perhaps unsuspected sophistication of recording technology 35
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Just which treasures to resurrect through the new process was,
and remains, a difficult call, Johnson admitted. ``We didn't want
to recycle the `Living Stereo' series, which will continue to have
a life of its own,'' he said, ``so we decided to focus on the later
'60s. Many of those recordings have never been brought out on CD.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Boston stuff alone, with Leinsdorf and Fiedler, is
incredible: beautiful recordings made in the great acoustics of
Symphony Hall. During Leinsdorf's directorship, the Boston Symphony
was under contract to make seven recordings a year for 10 years.
And there's another group of wonderful things with Jean Martinon
and the Chicago Symphony, plus all the London Symphony recordings.
There's got to be 200 or 250 titles without any problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The clarity achieved through the 96/24 mastering technique has
proved to be double-edged, Johnson said. The revivified sound
represents long hours of meticulous work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little things that were invisible 30 years ago, like splices
or air-conditiong hum, are a real problem. One particular noise in
the Boston Symphony tapes has a signature that we joke about:
`There goes the bus to Harvard Square.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're able to go in and do remarkable things. It just
takes a third again as much time as `Living Stereo.' We've really
tried not to compromise. We're seriously trying to set a new
standard.''
</P>
<P>
   To avoid overwhelming consumers in an already glutted CD world,
BMG will limit the High Performance series to just 13 releases this
year and 13 more in 2000. Among the disks scheduled for release by
autumn: Handel's ``Messiah,'' performed by Richard Westenburg and
Musica Sacra; ``The Fantastic Philadelphians,'' Vols. I and II (on
one CD); a two-disk set of Mahler's Symphonies Nos. 1 and 3, with
Leinsdorf, and the Boston Symphony in a program of Bartok's
``Miraculous Mandarin,'' Varese's ``Arcana'' and Hindemith's
``Nobilissima Visione'' with Martinon and the Chicago Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much information captured on those tapes, just
waiting to get out of prison,'' Johnson said. ``I hope this
encourages people to listen more closely.''

COURT NARROWS RIGHT TO SUE UNDER DISABILITIES ACT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a string of important rulings on the Americans
with Disabilities Act, the Supreme Court Tuesday restricted who can
sue for employment discrimination under the 1990 law and also told
states to expand housing and treatment options for the mentally
ill.
</P>
<P>
   Business groups such as the US Chamber of Commerce hailed three
related workplace decisions as a ``victory for employers'' because
the court said people with correctable disabilities, like poor
eyesight or high blood pressure, cannot bring lawsuits under the
ADA against companies that fire them, or won't hire them, because
of their condition.
</P>
<P>
   The closely watched cases involved two nearsighted sisters who
wanted to be pilots for United Air Lines, a truck mechanic fired by
United Parcel Service because of his high blood pressure, and a
trucker for Albertsons food stores who was dismissed after the
company learned he was functionally blind in one eye.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the 7-2 majority in the United Air Lines case,
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said Congress did not intend for the
disabilites act to cover the estimated 160 million Americans with
correctable impairments. The legislation was aimed at protecting
some 43 million people whose physical and mental disabilities limit
their ``major life activities,'' O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   Though acknowledging Congress's source for the 43 million was
unclear, ``the figure reflects an understanding that those whose
impairments are largely corrected by medication or other devices
are not `disabled' within the meaning'' of the disabilities act,
O'Connor wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Advocacy groups for the disabled called the workplace rulings a
major setback. At the same time they applauded the court for a
separate 6-3 decision that said states discriminate against
mentally ill people when they institutionalize them in psychiatric
hospitals rather than provide community housing and home-based
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unnecessary segregation of persons with mental disabilities
perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that such persons are unfit
for, or unworthy of, participating in community life,'' Justice
Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for the majority. Dissenting were Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Clarence Thomas, who
wrote the minority opinion, and Antonin Scalia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Temporary exclusion from community placement does not amount
to `discrimination' in the traditional sense of the word,'' Thomas
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The case centered on two mentally disabled women who charged the
state of Georgia with discrimination for confining them to a
psychiatric hospital when they wanted to live and receive services
in their community and near their families.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, claiming a state's right to make its own mental-health
treatment and housing decisions, initially had 26 other states,
including Massachusetts, weigh in on its side. But an intense
national lobbying campaign last winter by disabilities-rights
groups persuaded Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly to change his
mind, and Massachusetts had its name removed from an amicus brief.
</P>
<P>
   John Widdison, spokesman for the state's Department of Mental
Health, said Tuesday's ruling would have little practical
application in Massachusetts because most of the state's
mental-health clients are already being treated in communities, a
trend that began in 1992 when the state closed four psychiatric
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   In a White House statement, President Clinton said he was
pleased by the Georgia decision and pledged that the departments of
Justice and Health and Human Services would assist states in
carrying it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing so will advance the goals of the ADA and bring us closer
to our ultimate goal _ a nation that integrates people with
disabilities into the social mainstream, promotes equality of
opportunity, and maximizes individual choice,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration had argued in favor of extending the scope of
the ADA to protect people who claim a disability, even if there are
``mitigating measures'' _ medications, devices, treatments _ that
allow them to function fully in jobs and other activities. Lower
courts had been divided over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The court majority, in its first major interpretations of the
disabilities law, said a disability exists only when an impairment
``substantially limits'' a person's ability to have a normal work
and social life _ ``not where it `might,' `could,' or `would' be
substantially limiting if mitigating measures were not taken,''
O'Connor wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the court said, employers under the ADA have the
right to establish physical criteria that suit the job. United Air
Lines, for example, did not discriminate against Karen Sutton and
her twin sister, Kimberly Hinton, by requiring its global airline
pilots to have uncorrected 20/20 vision while it does not impose
the same criteria on regional pilots or flight instructors, the
court said. The sisters, who had been regional pilots, had been
turned down as global pilots because they wear glasses.
</P>
<P>
   UPS did not discriminate when it fired Vaughn Murphy, the
mechanic with high blood pressure, because he was unqualified for a
particular job that required him to operate motor vehicles and meet
a high federal health standard, the court said. He was qualified
for other mechanic positions, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   And Hallie Kirkingburg, the truck driver for Albertsons who
compensated with his right eye for the amblyopia in his left eye,
had excellent vision for many jobs but it was not good enough for
driving a commercial truck, the court found.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision turns the ADA law on its head,'' said Chai
Feldblum, a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center who
worked with advocacy groups and Congress to write the disabilites
law. ``What the court said is that if you have an impairment that
makes you dysfunctional, you can be fired, and it's not
discrimination. And if you are qualified for the job, then you are
not disabled enough to be discriminated against.''
</P>
<P>
   Feldblum said she expects disabilities-rights groups to urge
Congress to amend the law and clarify the definition of who is
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Writing dissenting opinions on the workplace cases, Stevens said
a corrective device does not, in itself, relieve a disability. The
court majority had a ``crabbed vision'' of the disabilities law, he
said, and Congress, ``by reason of legislative myopia, may not have
foreseen its definition of `disability' might theoretically
encompass not just some `43 million Americans' but perhaps two or
three times that number.'' Justice Stephen Breyer also dissented in
the cases.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Conrad, senior vice president of the Chamber of Commerce's
National Litigation Center, said she believed ``the 43 million
figure'' did make an impact on the court, just as the complexity
and reach of the law has had a chilling effect on the business
community. Tuesday's rulings, she predicted, represented the first
round of interpretations of a law that is in for much litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the beginning,'' Conrad said, ``but we are off to
a good start.''
</P>
<P>
   The cases are Sutton et al. v. United Air Lines, Inc. No.
97-1943. Albertsons, Inc., v. Kirkingburg. No. 98-591. Murphy v.
United Parcel Service, Inc. No. 97-1992. Olmstead v. L.C. No.
98-536.

HOUSTON ASTROS MANAGER TO GO HOME WITH CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Sports eds.: Press conference will be held at 10 a.m. CDT
Wednesday.) 
 
By DALE ROBERTSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Manager Larry Dierker of the Houston Astros will check
out of the hospital Wednesday morning sporting a burr haircut and a
conspicuous scar from ear to ear across the top of his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll just keep my cap on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More important, however, is that Dierker will leave with a clean
bill of health eight days after undergoing brain surgery that, by
all accounts, removed the cause of the grand mal seizure he
suffered during an Astros game against the San Diego Padres on June
13.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never felt better,'' Dierker said. ``Of course, I haven't
had any toxins in my body in a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he will remain on anticonvulsive medication for an
undetermined period _ until ``they wean me from them,'' Dierker
said _ doctors have told him he has no reason to fear a recurrence
of the seizures that struck without warning as he sat in the
Astros' dugout.
</P>
<P>
   The game, which Houston led 4-1, was stopped and will be
finished July 23 _ presumably with Dierker back at the Astros'
helm. He expects to return to the Astrodome in street clothes next
week when the Astros host the St. Louis Cardinals and resume
managing the team after the All-Star break, which is July 12-14.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're telling me that will be OK,'' he said, ``so I'm
counting on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker has seen or listened to most of the Astros' games since
the operation and has maintained regular contact with general
manager Gerry Hunsicker and interim manager Matt Galante.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke with several players by phone Sunday, when he called
the clubhouse to congratulate pitcher Chris Holt for earning his
first victory since August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker's wife, Judy, will be charged with preventing him from
trying to do too much too soon when he returns home Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   First order of business: Hide the golf clubs and the wine.
Dierker confessed he had ``a small sip, just enough to remind me I
like it,'' Monday night when his family ``smuggled'' a celebratory
bottle into his suite at Methodist Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``No alcohol for now,'' he said. ``Doctor's orders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I already know I'm going to have a hard time making sure he
doesn't overdo anything,'' Judy Dierker said. ``He's anxious to get
things back to normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker will go home Wednesday after a news conference at which
his surgeon, Dr. Rob Parrish, will discuss his progress since the
five-hour operation in which an abnormal tangle of blood vessels
that ruptured in the manager's brain was removed. The sutures were
removed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Once he returns home, he will spend much of his time over the
next few weeks answering the volumes of mail he has received since
the attack. A photo taken at the hospital and posted on the Astros'
Web site (astros.com) shows him viewing some of the thousands of
e-mail messages he has received. He is writing a response, which
the Astros plan to post on the Web site in the next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's overwhelming, and very humbling,'' he said of the
public's response. ``The piles and piles of cards, all the flowers
... people have been just great. It's a hard way to find how many
friends you have, but if there's a good side to going through
something like this, I guess that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker offered special thanks to the Astros players and
personnel and the paramedics who rushed to his aid when the seizure
was in full force. He singled out outfielder Derek Bell, who jumped
atop Dierker's convulsing body in an effort to prevent him from
injuring himself against chairs or benches in the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Don Wilson (the former Astros pitcher) have a seizure in
the clubhouse when we were teammates,'' Dierker said. ``It's really
violent, a scary thing to watch. I've gained a lot of respect for
Derek for his willingness to try to hold me down.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he cared to reflect on his ordeal, Dierker laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to,'' he said. ``But I can't remember much of it.''
</P>
<P>
   A news conference by Dierker is scheduled at 10 a.m. CDT
Wednesday. It will be carried live by the Fox Sports Network
Southwest cable channel.

SUPREME COURT RULES FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES IN
INSTITUTIONALIZATION CASE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Pa.)   (See also SCOTUS-DISABLE, SCOTUS-EMPLOY-DISCRIMINATE) 
(rk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Isolating people with disabilities in big state
institutions when there is no medical reason for their confinement
is a form of discrimination that violates federal disabilities law,
the Supreme Court ruled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-3 decision, in a case brought against the state of Georgia
by two women with mental impairment, was a substantial victory for
a disabilities rights movement that has looked to the Americans
With Disabilities Act of 1990 as a tool for breaking down
institutional walls that separate people with serious mental and
physical problems from the larger community.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling affirmed, in most respects, a decision last year by
the federal appeals court in Atlanta, which held that states have a
duty under the 1990 law to provide care in group homes when
medically appropriate. In 1994 the federal appeals court in
Philadelphia, in the only other appellate decision on the subject,
reached the same result.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's decision six months ago to hear Georgia's
appeal in this case alarmed advocates for people with disabilities,
who feared that the court might steer the law in the opposite
direction and reverse the nationwide trend toward
deinstitutionalization. An unusually vigorous grass-roots campaign
sprang up around the case, leading 15 of the 22 states that had
originally supported Georgia to disavow the state's position in the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The case involved a 1995 lawsuit filed on behalf of Lois Curtis
and Elaine Wilson, both of them mentally retarded and mentally ill,
who sought state care outside the Georgia Regional Hospital, where
they had lived off and on for years. Both remained in the hospital
for several years after state doctors had concluded that they could
be more appropriately cared for in small group homes.
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, the decision Tuesday was the court's first
rather than last word on the subject, and it may require more cases
to clarify the full dimensions of the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's majority opinion held that states'
obligation to care for people in small, neighborhood-based settings
was limited to some degree by available resources. States are not
required to close their big hospitals _ which, the court stressed,
may still be appropriate for some people _ or to create group home
programs that they do not now have. In fact, though, every state
now has such a program.
</P>
<P>
   The decision interpreted a regulation that requires states to
make ``reasonable modifications'' in their programs to avoid
discriminating against people with disabilities, while at the same
time providing that states need not make ``fundamental''
alterations.
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg said that if a state ``were to demonstrate that it had
a comprehensive, effectively working plan for placing qualified
persons with mental disabilities in less restrictive settings, and
a waiting list that moved at a reasonable pace not controlled by
the state's endeavors to keep its institutions fully populated, the
reasonable-modifications standard would be met.''
</P>
<P>
   That interpretation did not give the states enough leeway to
satisfy the three dissenting justices. Justice Clarence Thomas,
joined in a dissenting opinion by Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justice Antonin Scalia, said the decision imposed
``significant federalism costs'' and failed to ``respect the
states' historical role as the dominant authority responsible for
providing services to individuals with disabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas predicted that states would ``now be forced to defend
themselves in federal court every time resources prevent the
immediate placement of a qualified individual.'' He said that
rather than addressing discrimination in any conventional sense,
the majority was imposing its own ``standard of care.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority opinion was joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor,
David H. Souter, John Paul Stevens and Stephen G. Breyer. Justice
Anthony M. Kennedy concurred in a separate opinion, noting that
``the depopulation of state mental hospitals has its dark side''
and warning that the decision should not be interpreted ``to drive
those in need of medical care and treatment out of appropriate care
and into settings with too little assistance and supervision.''
Breyer also signed that part of Kennedy's opinion.
</P>
<P>
   While the decision, Olmstead vs. L.C., No. 98-536, referred
throughout to mental disabilities, the ruling also applies to the
states' obligations to people with serious physical disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The decision interpreted Title II of the disabilities act, which
prohibits state and local governments from discriminating against
or excluding people from programs ``by reason of'' their
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   A regulation issued by the attorney general at Congress'
direction, after the law's adoption, provides that ``a public
entity shall administer services, programs and activities in the
most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified
individuals with disabilities,'' with ``integrated setting''
defined as ``a setting that enables individuals with disabilities
to interact with nondisabled persons to the fullest extent
possible.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Georgia argued that the two mentally impaired women involved in
the case did not come within the disabilities law's protection
because they had not been subjected to discrimination, which the
state defined as unequal treatment. Ginsburg said Tuesday that in
the context of the federal law, ``unjustified isolation, we hold,
is properly regarded as discrimination based on disability.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Institutional placement of persons who can handle and benefit
from community setting perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that
persons so isolated are incapable or unworthy of participating in
community life,'' Justice Ginsburg continued.
</P>
<P>
   She added that ``confinement in an institution severely
diminishes the everyday life activities of individuals, including
family relations, social contacts, work options, economic
independence, educational advancement and cultural enrichment.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the two plaintiffs lives today in a three-person group
home, and the other lives in her own apartment, with supportive
services.
</P>
<P>
   Ira Burnim, the legal director of the Bazelon Center for Mental
Health Law, an organization here that coordinated Supreme Court
briefs on the women's behalf, praised the decision. ``This is the
first time the court has announced that needless
institutionalization is a form of discrimination,'' he said in an
interview, adding that the disabilities rights movement had been
working toward this goal for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Another advocate for people with disabilities, Curtis Decker,
executive director of the National Association of Protection and
Advocacy Systems, called the decision a ``touchstone for the
disability community'' and said it would provide a strong incentive
for states to continue the trend toward deinstitutionalization.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In an unexpected turn that opens a prime podium in the world of
classical music, the Boston Symphony Orchestra announced Tuesday
that its longtime music director and leading conductor, Seiji
Ozawa, would leave after the 2002 season to take over the baton at
the Vienna State Opera.
</P>
<P>
   The formalization of the decision, the orchestra said, is set
for Wednesday morning in Vienna, where Ozawa, 63, was to meet with
government officials and the opera's manager, Ioan Holender.
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa, who has led the Boston Symphony since 1973 and is often
referred to as the longest-tenured music director of any of the
world's major orchestras, notified the Boston Symphony's management
Monday. The orchestra's musicians were to be informed by letter
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The shift adds Boston to a list of venerable orchestras that
will have podiums to fill over the coming years _ Berlin,
Philadelphia, New York, Atlanta, Houston, Indianapolis and
Cincinnati and others. Berlin, where Claudio Abbado has announced
his retirement in 2002, is said to be close to a choice between two
likely candidates, Daniel Barenboim, music director of the Chicago
Symphony Orchestra, and Sir Simon Rattle, who recently left
Britain's City of Birmingham Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   This month, another vacancy was filled with the appointment of
the Austrian conductor Franz Welser-Moest by the Cleveland
Orchestra. The New York Philharmonic has said it is looking for a
replacement for Kurt Masur, whose contract expires in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Some music commentators said they could not remember a time when
so many prime conductorships were up for grabs. Although it has
become common for music directors to divide their time between
ensembles on both sides of the Atlantic, word that Ozawa's career
was to take this turn caught many music world observers by
surprise. He will be setting down in a music capital famous for
being hard on its musical icons from Mahler to von Karajan.
</P>
<P>
   Like that of many fellow conductors, Ozawa's tenure in Boston
has hardly been free of controversy. In 1997 and 1998, the
Tanglewood summer festival under his direction was roiled by
administrative battles and some recent reviews have been harsh,
although others have been favorable.
</P>
<P>
   Under Ozawa's leadership, the Boston Symphony cemented a
reputation as one of the world's leading ensembles, touring widely,
helping to develop Tanglewood as a premier summer music festival,
and building on an endowment that is the envy of many an orchestra.
The 1998-99 season-long celebration of Ozawa's 25th anniversary
with the Symphony drew varying critical assessments. Writing in The
New York Times in November, James R. Oestreich praised his
conducting of the biting, driving ``Miraculous Mandarin'' by Bartok
as ``being just the sort of thing in which Ozawa excels.'' Mahler's
``Lied von der Erde'' was also ``music after Ozawa's heart, big and
bold.''
</P>
<P>
   But in February at Carnegie Hall, another Times critic, Bernard
Holland, detected `'a certain weariness'' and said Ozawa made the
Beethoven Violin Concerto ``sound almost vulgar''
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa, in his letter to the Boston players, called his years as
music director ``the most rewarding artistic experience that any
musician could ever hope to have.'' He said he would never leave
the Boston Symphony ``for another orchestra,'' but that that ``in
my own growth as a musician, I increasingly have come to love the
operatic repertoire.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Symphony said that Ozawa will assume his position in
Vienna after the end of the 2002 Tanglewood summer season, for an
initial term of three years, and that he would be in residence in
Vienna five months a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Vienna State Opera traces its history to the court opera of
the Hapsburgs in the mid-1800s and its intrigues with music
directors over the years have been the stuff of music lore and
history. It has been without a music director for several years
since the departure of Claudio Abbado. In an unusual arrangement,
the opera's musicians also constitute the famously independent and
self-governing Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, which operates
without a music director and engages its own visiting conductors.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Zervas, president of the Boston Symphony's board of
trustees, said ``Vienna's gain is certainly Boston's loss,'' and
voiced hope that Ozawa would continue to lead the orchestra as his
schedule allowed.
</P>
<P>
   The board of trustees will organize a search committee to find a
successor, the orchestra said.
</P>
<P>
   But that may be not easy. With so many leading orchestras on the
hunt for new leadership, it has become a seller's market, even at
salaries of $1 million and up a year. Famous names are floated one
day, only to be shot down the next.
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa, who was traveling Tuesday with the Vienna Philharmonic in
Baden-Baden, Germany, before breaking off to go to Vienna for the
announcement, began his music career as a youngster in Shenyang,
China. In 1959, at age 24, he won first prize at a competition of
conductors in France, drawing him to the attention of Charles
Munch, then music director of the Boston Symphony, who invited him
to Tanglewood, where he won another prestigious conducting prize.
</P>
<P>
   While working with von Karajan in West Berlin he drew the
attention of New York Philharmonic music director Leonard
Bernstein, who named him assistant conductor in New York for the
1961-2 season. He conducted the Boston Symphony for the first time
at Tanglewood in 1964, became artistic director of Tanglewood in
1970 and music director of the Boston Symphony three years later.
Over the years he has guest-conducted orchestras around the world,
in symphonic programs and opera. On July 4, he is scheduled to lead
the Boston Pops Esplanade Orchestra in its traditional ``1812
Overture.''

 &HT;    WebMD: The hype and the hope
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ WebMD Inc. and Healtheon Corp. may be poised for a
multibillion-dollar merger, but they are in a business that some
analysts view as smoke and mirrors, touting wildly hyped ability to
deliver goods and services _ let alone make a profit during the
foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   But wait: These same analysts predict WebMD and Healtheon will
be well-positioned to become a dominant player in their niche
business _ health care services delivered online to physicians,
institutions and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Only when discussing Internet businesses might both perceptions
be true.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Atlanta-based WebMD has come a long way fast. In one
year, WebMD has morphed from a tiny start-up, born from the ashes
of a young entrepreneur's previous company, into a big name on the
Net replete with prestigious board members, an experienced
management team, a merger deal with a California company whose
stock is worth billions and an arrangement for Microsoft to invest
$250 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Cinderella storyline has everything _ except profits.
</P>
<P>
   It is, in short, a typical Internet success story, told in
Internet time. A company soars to stratospheric value, its flight
fueled by investors blind to traditional measures. Cynics compare
it to the 17th century tulip craze, in which prices rocketed beyond
all reason only to suffer collapse beyond all precedent.
Traditionalists look at the Net and say: Gravity will have its way.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not sheer madness. Look at the potential of the Net as
a conduit for the economy and communications. A new report from the
Commerce Department says the Internet and technology industries
account for at least a third of the U.S. economic growth in the
past four years.
</P>
<P>
   Health care represents 14 percent of the $6 trillion U.S.
economy, more than $840 billion. If any significant portion of that
is shifted to the Net and if WebMD can win any sizable piece of the
market, then current valuations could be far too modest.
</P>
<P>
   Is it too early in the game to take this seriously? No, said
Charlene Li, analyst with Forrester Research. ``They are leaders in
a field that doesn't exist. But they have as good a chance as
anybody to pull it off.''
</P>
<P>
   What gives them that chance? Does WebMD have the best Web site,
the most visionary business plan, the smartest technology?
</P>
<P>
   No way, Li said. But they might have the fastest, slickest and
most-image savvy sales pitch. And they are surely first in their
class at collecting cash _ by the hundreds of millions of dollars _
needed to market themselves into a winner.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a series of missteps leaves her wondering, she
said. ``There are a lot of things about this company that make me
uneasy. I can't figure out what these guys are doing, what the
value is, because they keep casting about for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet virtues and vulnerabilities can be reversed in the shadow
reality of the Internet. Consider the idea of a business model so
fluid that it's hard to tell from quarter to quarter how the
company expects to make a buck. It could be desperation. It could
be flexibility. The rise from obscurity started with founder
Jeffrey Arnold selling off much of his previous business, Endeavor
Technologies. In August, the company received a $10 million
investment from HBO &AMP; Co. Endeavor Technologies became WebMD with a
board of high-tech stalwarts. Olympic organizer Billy Payne joined
the company as vice chairman. During the next few months, an
experienced management team was named. In November, Jay Gilbertson
left HBO &AMP; Co. as it prepared to merge with McKesson and leapt to
WebMD as it prepared for a public offering of stock.
</P>
<P>
   Then WebMD announced a five-year deal with DuPont, in which the
pharmaceutical giant would pay $220 million, mostly to boost the
company's network of doctors.
</P>
<P>
   But the hype reached a crescendo as the company delayed and
finally called off the IPO, choosing instead to merge with
Healtheon. It seemed an ideal fit on paper. WebMD had a
consumer-oriented Web site and an information service for doctors.
Healtheon handled transactions for clinics, insurance companies and
large medical institutions.
</P>
<P>
   An Internet marriage made in heaven
</P>
<P>
   The stock market loved the match.
</P>
<P>
   WebMD is still privately held, but the current value of
Healtheon stock implies a combined company worth upwards of $6
billion. That would make the company _ which will be based in
Atlanta _ one of the most valuable companies in Georgia,
approaching the value of Delta Air Lines.
</P>
<P>
   Delta last year had revenues of $14 billion and net income of $1
billion while moving millions of customers around the globe. By
comparison, Healtheon last year had revenues of $49 million along
with a $54 million loss. WebMD last year had revenues of $408,000
and a $23 million loss. Although Healtheon says it will handle 475
million transactions this year, that apparently comes from a
relative handful of customers. WebMD is no longer talking about how
many doctors signed up for its $30-a-month service. As to how many
consumers have clicked onto the Web site _ that, too, is only a
guess.
</P>
<P>
   And along the way, there have been a few WebMD slips.
</P>
<P>
   It might be a case of building a business on Internet time.
WebMD has developed so quickly because it had to, changed direction
because it must be Net nimble. It has slipped once or twice in its
haste. It could also be a simple case of overselling a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the company proclaimed its plan to sell services to
doctors as the key to profits. A few months later, WebMD was
emphasizing consumers and advertising as a revenue source. Earlier
this year, founder Arnold listed himself on the company Web site as
a graduate of the University of Georgia. He attended, but has no
diploma. WebMD bought CertifiedMail.com in December, only to file
suit against the company in March, charging that it had been given
false information before the purchase. Arnold also drew criticism
from The Wall Street Journal for near-cocky predictions made during
the ``quiet period'' that follows the announcement of a merger.
</P>
<P>
   The disappearance of Jay Gilbertson
</P>
<P>
   And then came the clumsily handled _ and still pending _
departure of Jay Gilbertson.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbertson's arrival in November was touted by Arnold and other
officials as proof that the company was for real, compelling
evidence that Wall Street could take seriously its impending offer
of stock. But within a few days, the IPO was called off in favor of
the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when Healtheon and WebMD announced the combined management
team, Gilbertson's absence from the list of jobs was striking.
Arnold assured reporters that Gilbertson would stay and be given
``an operational role.'' But on June 14, a company spokeswoman said
Gilbertson had resigned _ an announcement that Gilbertson denied
that same day. The following day, the company stopped talking about
Gilbertson altogether _ a sign that only the terms of his departure
were in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, WebMD's claim to a unique set of services was being
undercut by a slew of newcomers also aiming to make a mark in the
health care sector. High-flying IPOs included CareinSite.com and
AmericasDoctor.com. Some like Claims.net, IDX, Atlanta-based
Medcast, Third Millennium Healthcare and AccentHealth are fighting
Healtheon for the online route to doctors or ``back office''
transactions. Others like Dr. Koop, Adam.com, HealthGate, WebDoctor
and CareData.com are striving to become the consumer's portal to
health care information on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   William Michalak, analyst at Wachovia Securities, chalked up the
strategic changes to an astute reading of the market. ``I think
both Healtheon and WebMD were going to approach doctors and they
found them much different than expected. That's why WebMD went to
the consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   What looks like a scramble is a clever effort to gain a foothold
before an inevitable consolidation, he said. ``I think there is
room in the market for five to seven significant players. But it's
like Rubik's Cube or like a multidimensional chess game and we are
not sure who all the players are right now. ''
</P>
<P>
   Wide-open cyberspaces
</P>
<P>
   Terry Lee, executive vice president of Claimsnet.com, said he
thinks there is space for plenty of competition. His company gives
physicians a Net-based method for handling claims, and the
potential is enormous for moving health care from paper to
electronics, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 95 percent of all health care records are still
paper-based,'' he said. ``Technology abounds in health care, but
what is hanging on the end of every hospital bed? A clipboard
chart.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hicks, president and COO of AccentHealth, said his company
serves about 10,000 doctors' offices, most via video feeds to
patients in the waiting room. How that connection develops is hard
to predict, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He foresees selling doctors insurance adjudication, credit card
verification, medical education, videos and software of various
kinds. ``We say that doctors have deep pockets and short arms.
Doctors are not going to adapt technology just for the sake of
technology. They have to have a reason _ either economics or
productivity.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks have for many months been purchased according to
rules that seem not to apply anywhere else. Profitability is simply
irrelevant _ at least for now. What matters is marketing,
deal-making, and _ perhaps most critically _ burning a brand name
into the public consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   WebMD has been very good at all that. Among its deals, the
company has agreements with several well-known brands including
Lycos, Excite, CNN, MSNBC and Reader's Digest.
</P>
<P>
   Learning from the king of high tech: Microsoft
</P>
<P>
   Quality of technology and service is not the end of the story,
said analyst Li. ``Look at Microsoft. They don't even come close to
having the best products, but they have a marketing machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also knows how to scare off rivals with ``vaporware,''
announcement of products that sound frighteningly powerful but are
in fact nowhere near ready. WebMD has _ in some respects _ a
similar approach, Li said. ``It's basically a PR play. It's
vaporware. It may pan out, but not for a couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   The WebMD-Healtheon merger is to be completed by the end of
September. And Microsoft will emerge with 17 percent ownership of
the combined company. And _ vaporware or no _ with the Microsoft
seal of approval, how far away can success be?
</P>
<P>
   Still, Microsoft has leapt aboard many a bandwagon, covering its
bets as with investments ranging from Dialogic Corp.'s computer
phone technology to ThingWorld's streaming media technology to
WebTV.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, too, doesn't want to get left behind when the
Internet truly takes off. And while everyone agrees that billions
of dollars are hanging at the horizon, no one yet has the reach to
pick them off. There is as much insecurity as there is
anticipation. Hence, the hysteria and hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``WebMD has a lot of competition,'' said David Restrepo, analyst
with Jupiter Communications. ``The WebMD-Healtheon merger was
really the kick-off of the hype about the sector. It's going to be
a while until we can assess that hype.''

J.D. SALINGER'S LOVE LETTERS SOLD TO ENTREPRENEUR WHO SAYS HE WILL
RETURN THEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: New England, Calif.)  (rm) 
 By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The saga of the hermitic author, the confessional
writer, the love letters and the auction block came full circle
Tuesday and ended, at least in theory, happily for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen letters written 27 years ago by J.D. Salinger to Joyce
Maynard, a young writer and star-struck admirer who lived with him
briefly when she was a young woman, were sold at Sotheby's for
$156,500 to the software entrepreneur and art collector, Peter
Norton. Norton then announced that he was going to return them to
Salinger.
</P>
<P>
   The sale would seem to wrap up a story that has fascinated the
literary world with a Shakespearean denouement. Salinger, a famous
recluse who has sued in the past to keep his words private,
presumably will be content to have the letters back. Ms. Maynard,
who said she needed to sell them to raise tuition for her children,
now has enough for four years at an Ivy League college, before
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   And Norton is pleased to be of service.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people I admire,'' he said in a telephone interview,
``share the opinion that if the letters have to be sold they should
fall into sympathetic hands.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My intention is to do whatever he ( Salinger) indicates to me
he wants done with them,'' he continued. ``He may want them
returned. He may want me to destroy them. He may not care at all.''
</P>
<P>
   A man who answered the phone at the office of Phyllis
Westerberg, Salinger's agent, said that neither she nor the author
would have any comment about the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Maynard, in a telephone interview on Monday, said she felt
little emotion about finally parting with Salinger's letters. ``I
don't shed a tear. The sale of the letters really was a business
decision,'' she said. ``I'm really finished with it. I feel a
burden lifting for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Norton, the retired head of Peter Norton Computing Inc. and a
contemporary art collector, said he does not know the 80-year-old
author of ``Catcher in the Rye'' and other works, and has not been
in touch with him. But he indicated he respected his quest for
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Since Salinger last published in 1965, he has vigorously guarded
his seclusion and he has not been heard from during what in gentler
times would have been called a literary scandal. Ms. Maynard, who
published a memoir last year that included an account of her
nine-month romance with Salinger, has been roundly taken to task
for her decision to sell the letters.
</P>
<P>
   Some accused her of violating Salinger's privacy, and trading on
his name. The National Review termed her an ``opportunistic onetime
nymphet.''
</P>
<P>
   But Norton defended her decision to sell the letters. ``This
woman also had a right, really a duty to herself and her children
to safeguard her economic security.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Maynard, 45, is the divorced mother of three children.
</P>
<P>
   Norton said the sale was fraught with ``moral ambiguity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, gee, it's a shame this is happening and I thought
if it's happening, it would be for the best if the letters ended up
in the hands of the sympathetic party,'' he said. ``I had the means
to be a contender.''
</P>
<P>
   Norton did not attend the auction but placed an ``order bid''
with Sotheby's beforehand, setting an upper limit to the amount he
would pay. Pre-sale estimates for the letters ran between $60,000
and $80,000. The final price includes a commission to Sotheby's, so
Ms. Maynard will receive about $140,000.
</P>
<P>
   The auction, which was held at Sotheby's New York headquarters,
had an air of anti-climax about it, with the room only half filled.
Marsha Malinowski, a vice president in the department of books and
manuscripts and the expert in charge of the sale, said there were
at least four bidders, including Norton. The opening bid was
$50,000. Bruce Gimelson, a book dealer bidding on behalf of a
private collector, stopped bidding at $130,000.
</P>
<P>
   Norton, 55, made his fortune as the inventor of a set of
computer programs called Norton Utilities. One of them, UnErase,
can recover deleted computer files. Norton sold his software
business to Symantec in 1990 and runs his foundation from Santa
Monica, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The sale represents an ending of sorts, to a story that began in
1972, when Ms. Maynard, then a student at Yale, wrote an article,
``An 18-Year-Old Looks Back on Her Life,'' in The New York Times
Magazine, published with a photograph of its doe-eyed author.
Salinger, then 53, wrote the 18-year-old a fan letter, ``in
strictest privacy, if you can bear it,'' offering her fatherly
advice, and warning her not to let herself be exploited for her
talent.
</P>
<P>
   The letters continued with Salinger praising her writing
abilities, and saying they were soulmates. He told her how much he
craved isolation from the world, and expressed disillusionment with
his relatives and the publishing industry.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the tone became one of a lover. Ms. Maynard left
Yale, and moved in with him at his home in Cornish, N.H. But the
relationship was troubled. After less than a year, Salinger broke
it up. On Aug. 17, 1973, he wrote Ms. Maynard one last letter in a
cold tone.
</P>
<P>
   For 25 years, Ms. Maynard kept silent about their connection,
until her memoir ``At Home in the World,'' (Picador USA). She said
that one reason she wrote the book was to put the past to rest. She
also said, in a statement written on the eve of the auction, that
she was motivated to make public the couple's intimacy by her
discovery that Salinger had carried on similar correspondences with
other young women.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Maynard had originally planned to attend the auction, but at
the last minute, changed her mind when she realized that much of
the attention would be focused on her. ``This will sound naive,''
she said, ``but it didn't occur to me that anyone would watch me.''
She said she had hoped that people ``would look at the letters
themselves, instead of focusing the attention on my violation.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of copyright restrictions, the letters were only on view
at Sotheby's from July 17 to July 21 in a private room under guard.
They could be seen only by people judged by Sotheby's to be
prospective buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Salinger had turned to legal action in the past to prevent
letters or significant portions of them from being published. Under
copyright law, letters are the property of the owner, but the
content belongs to the writer. In 1987, Salinger successfully
stopped the author Ian Hamilton from quoting from his copyrighted
letters in a biography of him.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, a letter written by John Adams three days
before the signing of the Declaration of Independence sold for a
record price of $635,000. In the letter, Adams warned that freedom
from England would be won ``at great expence of blood.''

STUDY FINDS LEAD POISONING IS TIED TO CHILDREN'S TOOTH DECAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATT: Calif., Md., N.Y., Ohio) (rk) 
 By JOHN O'NEIL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Children exposed to higher levels of lead have more problems
with tooth decay, according to a new study that suggests that lead
could account for as many as 11 percent of pediatric cavities.
</P>
<P>
   An accompanying study that appears in Wednesday's issue of The
Journal of the American Medical Association found that children and
adults who had more vitamin C in their blood had lower levels of
lead, though the researchers stressed that they were not ready to
say that vitamin C could prevent lead poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   Exposure to lead has fallen sharply in recent decades since it
was removed from household paint and gasoline. But nearly a million
American children are still believed to have elevated lead levels
in their blood , with consequences that can include a lowering of
I.Q.
</P>
<P>
   Both the studies drew on data from the Third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey, which collected detailed information
on thousands of Americans from 1988 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The study on cavities, conducted by Dr. Mark E. Moss and Dr.
Peggy Auinger of the University of Rochester and Dr. Bruce Lamphear
of the Children's Hospital Medical Center of Cincinnati, compared
dental records and blood lead levels from 25,000 children and
adults.
</P>
<P>
   Focusing on children ages 5 to 17, they found that every
increase of five micrograms per deciliter in lead levels was linked
to an 80 percent increase in risk of tooth decay (the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention has set 10 micrograms as the maximum
acceptable level).
</P>
<P>
   The researchers are not sure how lead exposure may lead to
cavities, and Moss said that the next step in research would be to
figure out the mechanism involved. He speculated that lead either
reduced production of saliva, which contains elements that protect
teeth, or crowded out calcium during tooth formation or prevented
fluoride from bonding with tooth enamel.
</P>
<P>
   Tooth decay is concentrated among poorer, inner city children;
20 percent of the nation's children account for about 80 percent of
cavities. ``Tooth decay is a major health problem by itself,''
Lamphear said. ``This study provides additional evidence that lead
is a system toxin and that further efforts to reduce residential
hazards are needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gary Goldstein, director of the Kennedy-Krieger Institute, a
center for the study of developmental disabilities in Baltimore,
said the research appeared to show a striking correlation but
should be replicated in a more focused study. ``When you have these
huge mountains of data, you have to remember that there were 10,000
other items asked about and try to try to look for the association
again in a prospective study,'' Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   The study examining vitamin C and lead levels also found a
striking link, but its authors were even more cautious about
suggesting the vitamin as a possible lead countermeasure. Anecdotal
evidence and studies dating from the World War II era, along with a
recent animal study, have suggested that the vitamin could be an
effective treatment for lead poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, two epidemiologists from the University of
California at San Francisco, Dr. Joel A. Simon and Dr. Esther S.
Hudes, looked at 19,000 children and adults and found that youths
with the highest levels of vitamin C in their blood were almost
twice as likely to also have low levels of lead in their blood as
youths with low levels of the vitamin.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers found no correlation between lead levels and
the amount of vitamin C the survey subjects reported eating, which
they speculated could either be due to a flaw in the survey or
because lead caused vitamin C to be flushed out of the body more
quickly. They also cautioned that the correlation they found could
be related to factors like a healthier way of life.

GOV. BUSH OF FLORIDA EXPLAINS WIFE'S CUSTOMS INCIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The first lady of Florida was worried about how her
husband would react to the fact that she had spent $19,000 on
clothes and jewelry during a shopping spree in Paris, and that is
why she told U.S. Customs Service agents that she had spent only
$500, Gov. Jeb Bush says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can assure you, it was a difficult weekend at our house,''
Bush said this week, adding that his wife, Columba Bush, is
suffering ``a deep feeling of remorse'' over her decision to
undervalue her purchases when she entered the country through
Customs at Hartsfield International Airport in Atlanta last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knew what she did was wrong and made a mistake,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   The discrepancy, which Mrs. Bush called ``bad judgment,''
resulted in a civil fine of $4,100, and wound up as fodder for
front-page newspaper stories, radio call-in shows and spirited,
street-corner discussion around Florida. It spiced the radio and
television airwaves in Spanish and English in Miami, and became the
butt of jokes on the Howard Stern radio show.
</P>
<P>
   It comes at a time when Florida's Bush is working after hours to
raise money and line up support for his older brother, Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas, who is running for the Republican presidential
nomination. And the $19,000 shopping spree _ which cost Mrs. Bush
$23,100 with the fines _ comes at a time when Republicans are
trying to persuade potential voters that the Republican Party is no
longer just a party for the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush, speaking to reporters at a news conference in
Tallahassee, the state capital, apologized on behalf of his wife
but added that the shopping spree itself was ``our money and our
business.''
</P>
<P>
   As for any embarrassment it could cause in his brother's
campaign, Bush told reporters: ``Anything is possible in politics
in 1999. There is no dividing line anymore, as there should be,''
between public and private lives.
</P>
<P>
   Political experts in Florida and elsewhere in the country, while
conceding the embarrassing nature of the incident, said they
doubted it would have even the slightest impact on either of the
Bush brothers' careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the stuff of which political commercials are
made,'' said Q. Whitfield Ayres, a Republican pollster based in
Atlanta. ``I mean, a Democrat is going to attack the Hispanic wife
of George Bush's brother? I'd like to see somebody try it,'' Ayres
said.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Democrats have been mostly silent on the incident and
political experts who track voting trends and politics in Florida
say the attention it has brought the Bush family will soon blow
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is embarrassing publicly and privately but will
ultimately have no effect at all on Jeb Bush, his popularity in
this state or his chances in Florida,'' said Jim Kane, editor of
The Florida Voter, a news and polling service in Fort Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, Kane said, will it have an impact on Gov. George W. Bush's
political destiny in Florida, beyond being a ``footnote in Florida
presidential politics.''
</P>
<P>
   If it had been Jeb Bush himself who had misled the Customs
agents, it could have called into question his honesty, making ``a
significant difference,'' Kane said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the Customs incident was no longer an issue in his
home. His wife, he said, is a private person, not ``a political
wife.''
</P>
<P>
   It all began on Thursday when Mrs. Bush, returning from a trip
to Paris that Bush had promised her during his campaign for
governor in 1998, was asked by a Customs agent if she had anything
to declare. Mrs. Bush, who had not been accompanied on the trip by
her husband, said she had bought just $500 worth of clothes and
jewelry. Travelers who purchase $400 or less pay no duty, or tax,
on the goods.
</P>
<P>
   But Customs agents found receipts for thousands of dollars of
clothes and jewelry stuffed in her passport.
</P>
<P>
   She was fined, and immediately wrote a check for the penalty _
about four times what she would have paid if she had admitted the
value of the goods and just paid the duty.
</P>
<P>
   The incident was a distraction for Bush on Monday, a day in
which he signed legislation that had been the cornerstone of his
campaign. Bush had promised to install a controversial school
vouchers program _ in which students in the state's worst schools
could receive state money to go to private or religious schools _
as part of his education reform package.
</P>
<P>
   Many public school teachers and administrators have fought the
program, which is certain to be challenged in state courts by
opponents who say it violates constitutional bans on financing
religious schools with taxpayer dollars. And on Tuesday, civil
rights groups filed a complaint in a state circuit court in
Tallahassee to block the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while the school voucher program drew the attention of
educators and politicians, it was the airport incident that had
people talking in the streets in Miami, St. Petersburg and other
places around the state.
</P>
<P>
   But the jokes will soon die down, and few will even remember the
incident, said political experts and supporters of Jeb Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very upfront about this from the start, and then we
moved on,'' said Cory Tilley, a spokesman for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   As for any political backlash down the road, Republicans seem
unconcerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a stretch,'' Ayres said, ``worthy of an Olympic
gymnast.''

SOME FEAR RUSSIA MAY NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO MANAGE ITS
REACTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also RUSSIA-Y2K, U.N.-Y2K) 
 (HLW)  
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The Deputy Atomic Energy Minister Valentin Ivanov has
good reason to promise that Russia's 29 nuclear reactors will be
free of the Year 2000 computer problem in January. The reactors, it
seems, are largely free of computers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ivanov said, at the nuclear station nearest to Moscow,
``the general engineer promises that he'll have a New Year's party,
and he's invited me.''
</P>
<P>
   Although American experts said they would quite likely accept
such an invitations, they still have nagging questions about how
ready the reactors are. The experts said they were unsure whether
engineers could locate and check all the microchips and other
digital improvements that have been added to Soviet-era plants over
the years.
</P>
<P>
   The experts worry that Russian engineers, adept at handling
breakdowns in sometimes creaky plants, might be overwhelmed if four
or five systems fail at once, and they wonder whether backup
systems for water and power are sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, the experts wonder whether the cash-depleted
government can really oversee all the work at stations flung across
10 time zones, some so remote that it is tough to administer them
even in normal times.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're taking it seriously,'' an American official said.
``Our concern is that they won't do enough, either because there
are some pockets in Russia that still aren't taking it seriously,
even though they've been ordered by the government to do things, or
because they lack the resources.''
</P>
<P>
   The official echoed an analysis by the Pacific Northwest
National Laboratories of the U.S. Energy Department about potential
Year 2000 flaws in Soviet-style reactors. The report found that
senior Russian officials had made reactor safety a priority, but
that ``the level of effort devoted to date varied from site to site
and organization to organization.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, American experts worry that the nuclear-energy
industry is so short of cash and time that even some obvious flaws
will go uncorrected. Those experts stress that their views are only
well-educated guesses.
</P>
<P>
   Although Americans have visited all 66 Soviet-style reactors in
Russia and surrounding nations, they have not evaluated the plants
for Year 2000 vulnerabilities. In general, they said, the
millennium bug poses a small threat.
</P>
<P>
   Most ``mission critical'' functions, including crucial water
pumps, are controlled by analog devices. Some flawed computers or
chips could force a plant to shut down, but none appears vital to
stopping reactors in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   In an emergency, a reactor can usually be shut down instantly.
But operators still need to pump cool water to the core for a few
days, until the plant is completely stabilized.
</P>
<P>
   That underscores American experts' second concern, that reactors
could be hampered by the failure of regional power grids or other
utilities and that backup systems at cash-strapped reactors might
prove inadequate. As in the West, Russian nuclear stations have
emergency backups like multiple generators. But they can be
thwarted by many factors like poor maintenance or a shortage of
diesel fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in Western plants,'' an American said, ``the systems
don't work right all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian experts nevertheless said they were atop the situation.
The top Year 2000 official in the Atomic Energy Ministry, Yuri
Sokolov, said in March that experts had checked 97 percent of
date-sensitive reactor components. Sokolov did not say what that
review found, but he said his ministry would use all means at its
disposal to correct any flawed hardware or programs.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov said flatly that the only computer systems with potential
problems are those that process data and that all systems that
affect critical reactor operations had, been deemed safe, as have
the systems that contain radiation at the plants.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he indicated that Russian experts harbored some of the
lingering concerns that nag American scientists. Some programs that
monitor and schedule maintenance are not ready, he said. Operators
will rely on paper schedules and forgo unplanned repairs in the
period around Jan. 1. Computers that control electricity in
regional power grids also need changes, Ivanov added.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, he allowed that some secondary safety
systems involving tasks like water and fire control might have
problems. But he pledged that those and other deficiencies would be
fixed or that the systems will be under human control on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The nuclear-power industry is in dire straits. Rosenergoatom,
the state-owned company that oversees reactor operations and power
sales, owes scores of millions of dollars in debt to tax
authorities and its suppliers, and the business came under criminal
investigation in February.
</P>
<P>
   One reactor complex in eastern Russia recently went 18 months
without collecting even a kopeck from electricity customers, who
paid their bills with barter _ if they paid them at all.
</P>
<P>
   Spare parts can be at a premium, and a number of reactors are
overdue for renovation or retirement. Ivanov said that the minimum
budget for updating reactors was $1.8 million and that plant
workers will be carrying out most of the work. If others wish to
offer financial aid, he added, ``we will accept it gladly.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia, it turns out, is not the Americans' greatest concern.
The greatest potential for problems is in Ukraine, which is in even
worse financial shape. It has 14 reactors in operation.
</P>
<P>
   Armenia, home to one Soviet-style reactor, is another potential
problem spot, the experts said. The Energy Department has conducted
workshops in former Soviet nations since last year. But American
officials said it was difficult to know how extensively those
workers had inspected their equipment.

OLD TRIESTE OUT OF GOLD CUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Old Trieste developed a fever Tuesday and was withdrawn from
Sunday's Hollywood Gold Cup, costing the brilliant front-runner a
shot at national prominence and leaving Hollywood Park with a short
field for its $1 million race.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Mike Puype said that when he went to his barn at the
afternoon feeding time, he found Old Trieste ``looked miserable,
very uncomfortable.'' The 4-year-old colt had a 103-degree
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Gary Biszantz indicated the illness stems from the body's
efforts to fight a recurrence of a foot abscess, one of the
maladies that sidelined Old Trieste for months before his
seven-length victory in the May 29 Californian.
</P>
<P>
   And Biszantz said that although Old Trieste could be well in
three or four days, ``you can't consider running him in a Grade I
race very soon after a glitch like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Old Trieste and jockey Chris McCarron would have been favored to
win the Fox-televised race against four other Southern
California-based horses _ 1998 Kentucky Derby winner Real Quiet
(Jerry Bailey), the Richard Mandella-trained duo of Puerto Madero
(Kent Desormeaux) and Malek (Alex Solis), and longshot Budroyale
(Garrett Gomez).
</P>
<P>
   The son of 1992 Horse of the Year A.P. Indy would have been
shooting for his fifth consecutive victory following a 10th-place
finish in the '98 Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's devastating, you just don't know how devastating,'' Puype
said of missing the Gold Cup, for which entries will be taken
Thursday. ``We'll just have to get him ready for the next one.''
</P>
<P>
   A likely target is the Aug. 29 Pacific Classic, final leg of the
NTRA Champions on Fox series for older horses.

RUSSIAN FINANCIAL ECLIPSE IS OPPORTUNITY FOR FORD 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By NEELA BANERJEE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Looking beyond Russia's severe economic problems, Ford
Motor Co. announced a preliminary agreement with the government
Tuesday to begin construction in July of an automobile factory near
St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ford's financial contribution is only $150 million, the
plant would be among the largest foreign investment projects in
Russia since the financial crisis that began nearly a year ago. A
final agreement on the plant is expected in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A meeting in Moscow on Monday between Ford's president, Jacques
Nasser, and Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin reflected the
seriousness of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser said in a statement that the plant represented ``an
important step in achieving our long-term growth objectives.'' And
Alain Batty, president of Ford Russia, said ``this will be a sound
agreement both in terms of the present rate of economic development
and Russia's huge potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford plans to establish a manufacturing joint venture with
Bankers House-St. Petersburg, a consortium comprising three
influential local banks. The exact terms of the venture were not
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The factory site is an existing facility once operated by
state-owned heavy machinery maker Russky Diesel and is situated in
the region surrounding St. Petersburg. Although the plant will be
designed to produce up to 100,000 cars annually, the company said
initial output of its new compact Ford Focus line would be about
25,000 vehicles. Ford expects the factory to be fully operational
by the first half of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The automaker already has a small plant in a neighboring former
Soviet republic, Belarus, where it applies the finishing touches to
nearly assembled cars that are shipped in from factories abroad.
</P>
<P>
   While the new plant in the town of Vsevolozhsk is likely to
start with such assembly projects, Ford plans to gradually shift
more of the entire production process there.
</P>
<P>
   The company has chosen to expand its work in Russia at a time
when sales of imported cars have fallen drastically. The ruble has
lost about 80 percent of its value against the dollar since the
crisis began, which has priced foreign-made cars out of the range
of most Russians. Ford's plant in Belarus stood idle for months as
the company gradually sold off inventory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crisis has made foreign car companies either forget Russia
or become de facto domestic producers to cut costs,'' said Kim
Iskyan, an equity analyst with Renaissance Capital, a Russian
brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
   Renault recently delayed until August the signing of a formal
agreement to begin manufacturing in Moscow, and Fiat has deferred
the start of a project in Nizhny Novgorod to some time next year.
</P>
<P>
   But BMW recently announced a car-assembly project in the far
western Russian enclave of Kaliningrad, and General Motors is in
discussions with Russia's largest car manufacturer, Avto Vaz, about
developing a joint venture.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has sought to attract foreign car makers by offering tax
and customs breaks on their imported parts and machinery, which
would help make the non-Russian vehicles closer in price to
domestic ones. But such concessions are often insufficient to
compensate for the political and economic uncertainty that Russia
has presented in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such barriers to investment, it appears that few car
companies are willing to entirely abandon Russia. Faced with stiff
competition in more stable markets, the automakers hope to increase
sales by entering new markets such as Russia where the level of car
ownership is low. But analysts warn that the payoff is further in
the future than manufacturers may think.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Ford really does have a long-term vision for Russia,''
Iskyan said, ``then maybe 10 years from now, when Russians are
buying one million cars a year, it will have a nice little car on
the market and 30 percent of the market.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The painting is called ``Forming the Fifth
International.'' On one side of the oversize canvas sits Rosa
Luxemburg, the Polish-born socialist leader assassinated in Berlin
in 1919 when she was 48.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, a figure from a different era, is Alice
Stevens, an aged, infirm, nursing-home patient who died in 1985 at
age 89. Rosa is weightless, a black and white projection. Alice is
heavy, pink and fleshy. Rosa stares out at the viewer; she seems to
intuit her imminent martyrdom.
</P>
<P>
   Alice seems to stare at Rosa, rubbing her own swollen knee and
ankle and squinting behind her eyeglasses at the unfamiliar woman
beside her. Aside from the painting's rich green background, these
women share nothing. It is the type of meeting that could take
place only in art.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother was voiceless,'' said May Stevens, artist, activist,
daughter of Alice Stevens and subject of the show ``May Stevens:
Images of Women Near and Far'' at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts
through Aug. 8. A show of Ms. Stevens' drawings and prints is on
view concurrently at the Mary Ryan Gallery in New York through Aug.
27.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was not able to participate in the world at all,'' Ms.
Stevens continued. ``She essentially withdrew from life. And Rosa
was able to participate to the utmost, even though she was killed
for it. I want both of them to continue as symbols. I want Rosa and
her work to be remembered. But I also want Alice to be remembered,
to validate the lives of women like her, women who are discounted
when they are old and heavy and no longer glamorous or charming.''
</P>
<P>
   There has always been a message in Ms. Stevens' medium. For more
than five decades, her art has been animated by a host of political
and social causes. Born in 1924 into a working-class family in
Quincy, Mass., Ms. Stevens went on to attend the Massachusetts
College of Art in Boston. In 1947 she moved to New York, where she
met the painter Rudolf Baranik at the Art Students League. Baranik
had fled his native Lithuania in 1938. His parents, Lithuanian
Jews, were killed there during the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   The couple soon married and left for Paris in 1948. Ms. Stevens
had her first solo show there and also created her first political
painting, ``The Martinsville Seven,'' a work about seven black men
who had been accused of rape in Virginia. The couple returned to
New York in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Ms. Stevens and Baranik championed civil rights
and protested against the war in Vietnam. Their art was
transparently political. But it was also intensely personal.
Baranik, who died last year, is best known for ``Napalm Elegies,''
a series of paintings about the Vietnam War that also served as
unstated elegy for his murdered parents.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stevens first came into prominence in the late 1960s with
her ``Big Daddy'' series, a group of large paintings done over nine
years in which she expressed her resistance to racism, militarism
and sexism, along with her ambivalent feelings toward her father,
whom she remembers as a racist.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Ms. Stevens channeled much of her energy into
feminism. In 1976, she was a founding member of the feminist
journal Heresies, a publication whose founders included Lucy
Lippard, Joan Snyder and Miriam Schapiro. From 1976 through 1992,
Ms. Stevens painted her ``Ordinary/Extraordinary'' series,
contrasting the figure of Luxemburg with that of her own mother, a
woman she describes as ``housewife, mother, washer and ironer,
inmate of hospitals and nursing homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stevens readily admits that Luxemburg represents her
spiritual and intellectual mother. Yet the artist does not
repudiate her biological mother. Different as they were, Alice and
Rosa are presented as pawned icons that the artist has redeemed
from an archetypal store of memory. Both women are given equal
dignity. Both are equally tragic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not despise who I was, nor where I came from,'' said Ms.
Stevens, who left New York for Santa Fe in 1997, shortly before her
husband died. ``Because it's all part of this process. I think I
was trying to make Rosa real for me, and not just a figure I read
about in books. And I was trying to get some distance from my
mother. Because she was so powerful for me. And because she was so
unhappy.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Images of Women Near and Far'' features more than a dozen
large acrylic paintings done from 1983 through 1997. Most are from
the ``Ordinary/Extraordinary'' series. Several of the canvases are
unstretched, hanging down from wooden dowels like tapestries or
movie screens. The human figures, most of which are based on
photographs, look almost like slides one might use to illustrate a
sociology lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Several of Ms. Stevens' canvases include text, with citations
from Christopher Marlowe, Virginia Woolf and, of course, Rosa
Luxemburg. The works are not quite as pedantic as primitive church
art, or as propagandistic as the posters Soviet leaders directed at
the Russian people after the Bolshevik Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stevens' figures are working-class heroes, vehicles of
destiny intended to edify. But they are also fragile human vessels.
</P>
<P>
   ``She can isolate an image that truly sticks in your mind,''
said Patricia Hills, a professor of art history at Boston
University, who has written extensively on Ms. Stevens. ``This is
what makes her work so haunting and elegaic. She is, of course, a
wonderful manipulator of paint. But she's not just interested in
surface. And this is where she distinguishes herself from so many
of her contemporaries. Her work is of her time. But she is not
narrowly topical. And in time, I think she will emerge as a major
painter of the late 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Sea of Words,'' her most recent series, Ms. Stevens covers
her canvases with a dense, handwritten text taken from Virginia
Woolf and Julia Kristeva. Done in refulgent gold, the text becomes
the shimmering surface of a body of water. A group of boats floats
across the water. Some of them are empty; others carry ghostly
female forms, rowing through the verbiage. The Museum of Fine Arts
show includes four paintings from this latest series. The allegory
is almost embarrassingly legible.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the work is once again redeemed by an implicit reference to
Ms. Stevens' childhood, the ``golden river'' formed by the sun
shining across the Quincy bay on a late summer afternoon. It is a
highly personal image that Ms. Stevens transforms into an
archetype, the same sort of alchemy that gilds all her work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always believed that I could make a difference,'' Ms.
Stevens said, standing in front of ``Go Gentle'' (1983). The
painting is a composite of images showing her mother as child,
young woman and nursing-home patient. The final image shows Alice
seated on her stool, mute and frightened. She raises her hands in
an attempt to articulate words she cannot form. But the hands
dissolve before her eyes. It is the most powerful work in the show,
one that has caused more than one visitor to pause and weep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am aware of injustice, of the horrible things that have
happened during my lifetime,'' Ms. Stevens said. ``But I also
believe that the only way to live is to work against those things.
And I believe that I have something to give. I have always believed
that.''

marketing to a young, upscale and better educated slice of the
world's population - the same people who drink imports, as it

the accident, black sailors were ordered to resume loading
ammunition onto ships. Fifty of the sailors, Meeks among them,
refused and were court-martialed by an all-white panel after being
found guilty of mutiny. Now, in an extraordinary legal battle,
lawyers for Meeks have filed for a presidential pardon arguing that
the black sailors failed to follow orders out of legitimate fear
and had no intent to mutiny. (Monica Almeida/New York Times Photo)

Ted was not a classic bully who used hostility to vent his anger
and insecurity. Rather, as a player in the often confusing,
socially uneasy, sometimes cruel culture of American boyhood, he
was one of those kids who initiate taunts rather than stand to the
side or take the heat themselves. ``It took being the victim to
realize it wasn't as fun as I thought it had been,'' he says. (John

the Taylor family's heart. It also launched his wife, Karen, on a
difficult journey to find the stamina, means, faith, and humor to

   (NYT28) WASHINGTON -- June 22, 1999 -- EDUCATION-CONGRESS, 6-22
-- The House majority leader, Dick Armey, is among lawmakers
greeting youths in a school bus Tuesday at a news conference to
promote a Republican education bill. The bill builds significantly
on previous Republican efforts to give state and local governments
ever broader discretion over the spending of federal money. (Justin

   (NYT27) MOSCOW -- June 22, 1999 -- RUSSIA-Y2K, 6-22 -- Boris V.
Mikhailovich, a top computer specialist at the Russian Federal
Aviation Service, is one of the numerous Russian experts who bridle
at the notion that their end-of-millenium efforts may not meet
Western standards. When asked whether air-traffic-control centers
were ready, he has a ready response. ``What do you think I am?'' he
asks, ``An enemy of my own people?'' (Jacqueline Mia Foster/New

   (NYT26) WUHAN, China -- June 22, 1999 -- ARGENTINA-BUDWEISER,
6-22 -- China has become Anheuser's fifth-largest overseas market
since Budweiser was introduced there in 1993. Through aggressive
marketing to a young, upscale and better educated slice of the
world's population - the same people who drink imports, as it
happens, back in St. Louis, where Anheuser is based - the company
is hoping to turn Budweiser into a truly global brand, something no
other has ever pulled off. (New York Times Photo) LITE

   (NYT25) LOS ANGELES -- June 21, 1999 -- BLACK-SAILOR-PARDON-2,
6-21 -- Fred Meeks at home with his wife Elinore. During World War
II, an explosion on a segregated naval base killed 320 men. After
the accident, black sailors were ordered to resume loading
ammunition onto ships. Fifty of the sailors, Meeks among them,
refused and were court-martialed by an all-white panel after being
found guilty of mutiny. Now, in an extraordinary legal battle,
lawyers for Meeks have filed for a presidential pardon arguing that
the black sailors failed to follow orders out of legitimate fear
and had no intent to mutiny. (Monica Almeida/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT24) NEW YORK -- June 22, 1999 -- OZAWA-VIENNA, 6-22 -- Seiji
Ozawa conducts the Boston Symphny Orchestra at Carnegie Hall in
October, 1997. With top classical music orchestras already shopping
for scarce new leadership, the Boston Symphony Orchestra joined the
worldwide game of musical chairs with a surprise announcement that
Ozawa, its long-reigning conductor, will leave after the 2002
season to take over the Vienna State Opera. (Chang W. Lee/New York

   (NYT23) DJAKOVICA, Yugoslavia -- June 22, 1999 --
KOSOVO-GRAVES-3, 6-22 -- Bone fragments seen on Tuesday in an area
where authorities suspect a mass grave existed. Serb forces dug up
some 100 massacred ethnic Albanians from a mass grave here late
last month and carried the bodies off, apparently to hide evidence
from the Hague war crimes tribunal, the municipal official in
charge of burials said on Tuesday. (Stephen Crowley/New York Times

Artist's rendering of an idea by the Space Island Group for
building orbiting hotels from the discarded external fuel tanks of
the space shuttle. It would be easy for shuttle crews to release
the tanks in space, says Gene Myers, president of the Space Island
Group, which is seeking funding through corporate sponsorships
similar to those for the Olympics. ``The tanks are as big as a
747,'' he says, and could be fitted together into a wheel shape.

George W. Bush of Texas, running for the Republican presidential

Bush denounced Vice President Al Gore as a Washington insider
Tuesday but promised fellow party members in Congress he would
stand with them. At right is Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho. (Rick

Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, with Warren Rudman, a former U.S. Senator and
current chairman of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory
Board, on Tuesday. Hatch, the conservative chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, said Tuesday he intends to make what he admits

Calista Flockhart is a teen-ager seduced by her teacher in
``Medea,'' part of Neil LaBute's ``Bash, Latterday Plays,'' at the

   (NYT18) NEW YORK -- June 22, 1999 -- LABUTE-PROFILE-1, 6-22 --
Neil LaBute's new play, ``Bash, Latterday Plays,'' opens Thursday
at the Douglas Fairbanks. For many moviegoers there is nothing more
depressing on screen than a LaBute film. Nothing more likely to
induce despair, or more frightening, perhaps, for what it shows us
about ourselves. Sexual cruelty. Domination. Hatred. LaBute shoves
them in your face. And now, he has done it again, for the stage
this time. (Sara Krulwich/New York Times Photo) LITE

Israeli-Arab family's home which was demolished on Sunday. The
Israeli-Arab population, which was courted by and voted for Prime
Minister-elect Ehud Barak, is certain to accelerate its quest for
civil rights during his administration. (Rina Castelnuovo/New York

   (NYT16) NEWTON, Mass. -- June 22, 1999 -- MEN-BULLY-BOS, 6-22 --
Ted Harrington, left, with his father, Wesley Edward Harrington IV.
Ted was not a classic bully who used hostility to vent his anger
and insecurity. Rather, as a player in the often confusing,
socially uneasy, sometimes cruel culture of American boyhood, he
was one of those kids who initiate taunts rather than stand to the
side or take the heat themselves. ``It took being the victim to
realize it wasn't as fun as I thought it had been,'' he says. (John

   (NYT15) ORLANDO, Fla. -- June 22, 1999 -- MEN-EXPECTATIONS-BOS,
6-22 -- Richard E. Lapchick, left, with his son Joe. By all
accounts, Joe Lapchick (Richard's father) was as gifted a father as
he was a coach and athlete. In turn, Richard, as a teacher, author,
human rights activist, and director of Northeastern University's
Center for the Study of Sport in Society, has spent much of his
life promoting better parenting by sharing the lessons he learned
from his father. ``Joe Lapchick was my hero,'' he says. (John

   (NYT14) FAIRFAX, Va. -- June 22, 1999 -- MEN-MOTHERS-BOS, 6-22
-- Alex, Luke and Karen Taylor. Jeff Taylor's brain cancer and
death three years ago, when he was 41, clearly left a huge hole in
the Taylor family's heart. It also launched his wife, Karen, on a
difficult journey to find the stamina, means, faith, and humor to
fill Jeff's big fathering shoes and to raise their two boys. ``From
the beginning, I told myself there was no way I was gonna let these
boys fall through the cracks,'' she says. (John Blanding/Boston

   (NYT13) LAWRENCEVILLE, Ga. -- June 22, 1999 -- MEN-NOTIME-BOS,
6-22 -- The Rev. Edward Palmer, left, with his son, Jadwin. It has
not been an easy path for father or son, though Palmer is hardly
the only father to struggle to balance great expectations and
tenderness, his own high ambitions and the time a child needs.
``You've go to remember, I came from a broken family before so I
always promised never to let my family be the same way,'' he says.

   (NYT12) RAPID CITY, S.D. -- June 22, 1999 -- MEN-GUNS-BOS, 6-22
-- Glenn Jones, left, with his father, Ronn Jones. Glenn, 15, owns
three guns. Out here , in the West - less wild these days but still
wide open - that's the way it's always been and is supposed to be.
Children learn to shoot, and their fathers are proud to help. (John

   (NYT11) DALLAS -- June 22, 1999 -- MEN-OUTCAST-BOS, 6-22 --
18-year-old Willi Wagner, left, with his father Bill Wagner, before
being chaperoned to a ``gay prom'' in Dallas last month. In order
to protect his son from the rampant anti-homosexual racism of
Booneville, Ark., Wagner moved his family to Fayetteville, a
relatively liberal college community two hours away that bills
itself as ``The first home of Bill and Hillary Clinton.'' (John

   (NYT10) WASHINGTON -- June 22, 1999 -- NUCLEAR-SPYING-FLOATER,
6-22 -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson listens to former U.S.
Sen. Warren Rudman, currently chairman of the Presidents' Foreign
Intelligence Advisory Board, during testimony before a Senate
committee on Tuesday. Richardson predicted that he would reach
agreement with Congress on a plan to tighten security at his
agency's nuclear labs, which have been hit with allegations of
Chinese spying. (Justin Lane/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT9) DJAKOVICA, Yugoslavia -- June 22, 1999 --
KOSOVO-GRAVES-2, 6-22 -- Faton Polloshka, director of the local
sanitation agency, during an interview on Tuesday. Polloshka claims
that he, along with his employees, were forced by Serb forces to
dig up the remains of some 100 ethnic Albanians last month who had
been massacred. According to Polloshka, the Serbs removed the
remains to hide evidence from the Hague war crimes tribunal.

   (NYT7) NEW YORK -- June 22, 1999 -- NUDE-CHEFS, 6-22 -- Marcus
Samuelson, the chef at Aquavit, is made up for an advertising
campaign for Vita-Prep's blender series. The chef as a hunk in
advertising campaigns is a development that some chefs revel in
while others tolerate. And still others find silly and
trivializing. (Nicole Bengiveno/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT6) FAVIGNANA, Italy -- June 22, 1999 -- ITALY-TUNA-6, 6-22
-- A bluefin tuna is prepared by a fishmonger in the island off
Sicily. For hundreds of years, the fishermen of Favignana could
live off the sea. But the cannery on the island closed 16 years ago
for lack of product. Because of falling prices, almost none of the
sons of the tonnoretti, as the local fishermen are known, work at
sea. Instead they find jobs catering to the island's tourists, or
they head to the mainland. The sea no longer holds the work of the
future. (James Hill/New York Times Photo)

factory which is now closed. For hundreds of years, the fishermen
of Favignana could live off the sea. But the cannery on the island

known locally as tonnoretti. The fishermen of this little island
off Sicily have gone after bluefin tuna in the same ceremonial way
for the last 900 years. For the four weeks when the huge fish
migrate through these waters, the men await a signal each day from

FLAMBOYANT NIGERIA PLAYS EXUBERANTLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Nigeria is playing in its third Women's World Cup, so
the team is no longer green, unless you count the hair of its top
scorer, Mercy Akide. For her, Mercy is a name, not a virtue. Attack
is the only style for a team that plays with joyous assertion and
individual brilliance, one that needs a pit crew more than a
coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's match against the United States is set for Soldier
Field here, but it might be better suited for the Brickyard in
Indianapolis. The Nigerians have only one gear, overdrive. Patience
is the name of one of the starting forwards, but none is ever
expected on the soccer field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football is a game of taking risks,'' said Ismaila Mabo, the
Nigerian coach. ``We will rattle the Americans. We will not be
intimidated.''
</P>
<P>
   This may sound flamboyantly self-assured for a team that had
never won a World Cup match until it left skid marks on North
Korea, 2-1, on Sunday. But Nigeria's Super Falcons are flying high
after a recent exhibition victory over China, their confidence
fuel-injected by nationwide expectation and fervent Christian
conviction. They expect to win Thursday. They expect to win the
whole tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sunday's opener, the Super Falcons received a call of
encouragement from Nigeria's first lady, Stella Obasanjo, wife of
the newly inaugurated president, Olusegun Obasanjo. For two
previous days, the entire team had fasted and prayed for victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked God to give us the trophy and to surprise the
world,'' said Akide, who scored a goal and delivered an assist in
the victory.
</P>
<P>
   It is a remarkable emergence for a team that did not officially
exist before 1991 and that has overcome the cultural stereotype
that soccer is a man's game and that women who played would be
unable to bear children. Two weekly, half-hour television programs
are now devoted to women's soccer in Africa's most populous
country, and at least five newspapers and magazines give the Super
Falcons significant coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are household names,'' said Pepsie Adiukwu, who hosts a
weekly program called ``Female Soccer With Pepsie.''
</P>
<P>
   Two businesswomen, Princess Bola Jegede and Gina Yeseibo, are
generally credited with kick-starting women's soccer in Nigeria in
the late 1980's. Princess Jegede sponsored the first national club
championship and operates a team called the Jegede Babes in Lagos,
providing her players free education.
</P>
<P>
   Yeseibo, who is in the construction business, donated 100
trophies in the name of traditional leaders around Nigeria,
respectfully and cleverly gaining their acceptance for the women's
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started, people said women should not be showing their
legs, or that they would not be able to have babies, but football
is football, male or female,'' Yeseibo said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there are a total of 34 teams in the top two divisions of
the Nigerian women's league, which is sponsored by Pepsi-Cola. One
of its senior executives, a Scotsman named Iain Nelson, heads a
development project for female players, and the company also
sponsors soccer academies for boys and girls. Players earn $50 to
$100 a month in league play and endorsements, officials said, not
an insignificant amount of money in a country stunted by years of
corrupt military dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Akide owns a small transport business. Anne Chiejine, the
goalkeeper, operates a hair salon. Her sense of style is as
ostentatious as her goalkeeping. She has dyed her hair white, and
wears a brightly decorated head scarf during games. For the World
Cup, she has dyed Akide's hair green and white, the colors of the
Nigerian flag, and for the captain, Florence Omagbemi, Chiejine has
applied a shade of flamethrower orange.
</P>
<P>
   A fan of Mexico's Jorge Campos and Paraguay's Jose Luis
Chilavert, Chiejine is as much a diva as a goalkeeper. She shakes
her head and waves at players who deliver weak shots, and makes
acrobatic, diving saves even when only routine stops are called
for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always hold the belief that whenever my husband comes to
watch me play, he wants to know how well I justify my involvement
in the game that takes me out of the house oftentimes,'' Chiejine
once told a women's soccer magazine in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   There is another reason she plays to be noticed, Chiejine said
in an interview. She would love to play soccer in the United States
if this World Cup generates a women's league here.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter said, `Play well, so I can go to school in the
United States,''' said Chiejine, who is 25. ``I play stylishly so
people will recognize me. To show them that I can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   As the only wife and mother on the Nigerian team _ she has two
daughters, ages 5 and 3 _ Chiejine serves as a powerful rebuttal to
those who believe that sports sabotage motherhood, her teammates
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some feel that when you get married, that is the end of your
career, and that if you play football, you won't be able to have
children,'' Chiejine said. ``I am showing that you can still play
and it will not disturb you.''
</P>
<P>
   Akide, 23, was a table-tennis star at the state level in
Nigeria, when her sister told her in 1991 that a World Cup was
being played for women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be there next time,'' Akide told her sister.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Falcons did not score a goal in their three matches at
the 1991 Women's World Cup, and managed only a tie with Canada four
years later in 1995. But Akide, known as Marvelous Mercy, scored 10
goals during qualifying for the 1999 tournament, as the Super
Falcons won the African championship by scoring 28 goals and giving
up none.
</P>
<P>
   A World Cup victory finally came against North Korea, and there
is pressure for more. A failure to advance to the quarterfinals,
which would qualify Nigeria for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney,
Australia, could undermine corporate and private support of its
women's league at home, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our third time,'' said Lizzy Onyenwenwa, the head of
the women's division of the Nigerian Soccer Federation. ``The
sponsors have put a lot of money into this. It is important to
deliver.''

MANHUNT CONTINUES FOR SUSPECTED SERIAL KILLER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By S.K. BARDWELL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nationwide manhunt for suspected serial killer Rafael
Resendez-Ramirez focused Tuesday on Illinois, where authorities
think the rail-riding vagabond may be a suspect in a third killing
in that state.
</P>
<P>
   In Pontiac, 80 miles southeast of Chicago, officials said
Resendez-Ramirez is a possible suspect in last week's slaying of
40-year-old Juanita Sapp, whose body was found near her apartment
complex.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday _ the same day the FBI included him on its Ten Most
Wanted Fugitives list _ Resendez-Ramirez was charged in the deaths
of two people in the tiny downstate-Illinois town of Gorham.
</P>
<P>
   Like the six homicides already credited to Resendez-Ramirez in
Texas and Kentucky, all three Illinois victims were killed a short
distance from railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously he got out of Texas,'' said Texas Department of
Public Safety spokesman Tom Vinger. ``It got too hot for him here.
Unfortunately, that doesn't mean that he won't come back. I'm not
saying that to scare people. It's just that we shouldn't let our
guard down. ... There's no reason to believe he's stopped
killing.''
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez's movement north prompted some investigators to
speculate he may be heading for the Canadian border. Federal
authorities acknowledged Tuesday that that was a possibility, but
said it would change nothing in their search.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez, 38, has ridden the rails for at least 20
years, authorities say. A Mexican national, he's been convicted of
federal offenses in Texas and Missouri and served time for state
crimes in New Mexico and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   He's been charged in five Texas slayings _ two in Houston, two
in Weimer and one in Schulenburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's obviously getting satisfaction from these crimes,''
Vinger said. ``He's brutal. He's sadistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Pontiac Police Chief Don Schlosser said Sapp's body was found
under a pile of brush outside her apartment complex early last
Wednesday. Her death, he said, was caused by ``physical trauma.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no firearm used,'' he said. ``I don't want to say
more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlosser said results of tests to determine if Sapp _ like many
of the other victims _ had been sexually assaulted should be
available by week's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are considering him a suspect because the crime occurred
near a railroad track and because there is evidence that
Resendez-Ramirez had been active elsewhere in the state,''
Schlosser said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Gorham authorities charged him with first-degree
murder in the deaths of George Morber, 79, and his daughter,
Carolyn Frederick, 51. Morber, investigators said, was shot in the
head with a shotgun; his daughter was beaten to death with the
firearm.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez's fingerprints were found in the victims' car.
</P>
<P>
   Until late Tuesday, he had been a suspect in a second Illinois
double slaying, in Apple River, near the Wisconsin border. But
Sheriff Steven Allendorf said a local man had been arrested and
charged.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in Texas, Hughes Spring Police Chief Randy Kennedy
awaited word on whether the killing of an 87-year-old woman could
also be attributed to Resendez-Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   The body of Lefie Mason, who lived alone in the town of 2,000
north of Tyler, was found Oct. 2. She had been beaten to death by
an intruder who entered her home through an unlocked window.
</P>
<P>
   Mason's home was near railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Rewards for information leading to the suspect's arrest and
conviction now total $125,000.

ANHEUSER-BUSCH AIMS TO MAKE BUDWEISER THE FIRST TRULY GLOBAL BEER

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Anheuser-Busch decided to go full throttle into the
Argentine beer market, it looked around for advertising
opportunities and found one in the form of Marcelo Tinelli,
Argentina's answer to Jay Leno with a little ``Candid Camera''
thrown in. Tinelli is on the air five nights a week, cracking
jokes, interviewing guests _ and, in recent months, sipping
Budweiser from a can in front of millions of viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks in part to the magic of product placement, Budweiser's
sales in Argentina soared 61 percent in the first quarter of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina is just one of many overseas markets _ the others
include Britain, China, Ireland and Japan _ where Anheuser-Busch
Cos. is pouring it on with its flagship brand. Through aggressive
marketing to a young, upscale and better-educated slice of the
world's population _ the same people who drink imports, as it
happens, back in St. Louis, where Anheuser is based _ the company
is hoping to turn Budweiser into a truly global brand, something no
other beer has ever pulled off.
</P>
<P>
   Anheuser is intensifying its marketing abroad at a time of great
strength at home. After a long and nasty price war with its closest
rival, the Miller Brewing Co. unit of Philip Morris Cos., Anheuser
has remained the leader in the United States, with a 45 percent
market share, slightly more than it had five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Volume has risen slightly in recent months, and the company has
used the promise of extra marketing funds to entice many
distributors to deal exclusively in its products.
</P>
<P>
   Having conquered the U.S. market, Anheuser is now hoping to
follow in the footsteps of Coca-Cola Co. and Gillette Co., and
burnish its stock, which has been something of a sleeper lately,
through overseas expansion.
</P>
<P>
   For all the risks of such a global strategy, from the potential
for economic turbulence in emerging markets to publicity nightmares
like Belgium's ban on Coke last week, analysts say it is about
time. While Coke, the undisputed worldwide king of cola, was
selling 1 million cases of its products a year in Shanghai back in
1926, Anheuser did not even form an international division until
1982. ``They were so late to this game, it was just unbelievable,''
said Jennifer Solomon, a beverage analyst for Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Getting a late start is the least of the company's problems.
Selling American beer to finicky foreigners is tough going. After
all, most of the world acknowledges America as the land of the soft
drink and the home of the technologically advanced razor blade. But
outside of the United States, beer lovers tend to be fiercely loyal
to local brands, many of which date back hundreds of years, and
scorn American beer as boredom in a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Even the master brewers of Europe have a hard sell when they
stray too far from home. For example, about 62 percent of the beer
made by Heineken of the Netherlands and 70 percent of the volume
produced by Carlsberg AS of Denmark is sold in the European Union,
according to Frank Walters, the director of research at Impact, a
trade newsletter in New York. If it is tough for them, say people
in the industry, it will be doubly hard for Anheuser.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a small international force now, and they will work
very hard to become a major force,'' said Dan Tearno, a spokesman
for Heineken USA. ``But I would say they have their work cut out
for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with the task of building the brand abroad, there is the
sticky matter of a decades-old trademark dispute that prevents
Anheuser from using the name Budweiser in many European countries.
Budweiser Budvar, a Czech brewery, claims rights to the name
stretching back to medieval times and has vigorously challenged
Anheuser's use of it, with several lawsuits pending in countries
like France and the Netherlands, where Anheuser's beer is labeled
``Bud.''
</P>
<P>
   Anheuser ``would try to persuade the world (and perhaps
themselves as well) that Budweiser is a fantasy trademark which
does not have its roots in Budejovice but is exclusively connected
with America,'' says a note on the Budweiser Budvar Web site,
www.budweiser.cz. Ceske Budejovice, the Czech town where Budweiser
Budvar is brewed, is known as Budweis in German.
</P>
<P>
   Anheuser is playing hardball in return. ``Periodically, some of
their beer has leaked in here,'' Anheuser International chief
executive Steven Burrows said of the other Budweiser, ``and as soon
as we know about here or anywhere else where we have clear rights
to the name, we go right after it.''
</P>
<P>
   Burrows said the disputes were confined to Europe and had little
effect on Anheuser's overseas sales. ``In some markets, we
coexist,'' he said. ``In some markets, we have gained the right to
use `Budweiser'.'' In one market _ the Czech Republic _ Anheuser's
beer is banned outright.
</P>
<P>
   Anheuser has tried to acquire a minority stake in Budweiser
Budvar on several occasions, most recently in 1992, provoking
further animosity.
</P>
<P>
   Anheuser's recent stepped-up effort abroad may have been
inspired by the dimensions of imported beer's growth in the United
States. Imports accounted for 8 percent of the U.S. market of 193
million barrels last year, up from 5.5 percent five years ago on
similar consumption, and surged by 21 percent in the first quarter
of this year even as overall beer consumption barely increased,
Walters said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But although beer is not Coke, Anheuser has been able to borrow
certain pages from the Coca-Cola playbook. It is concentrating its
efforts around its flagship, Budweiser, and playing up its
product's American cachet. It is also adapting its packaging to the
demands of international markets, introducing one-liter bottles in
Argentina and China, for example, in addition to the 12-ounce
single-serving cans and bottles that are more popular in the United
States. And in another echo of Coke strategy, Anheuser says it
understands the need to make large investments of money and
patience overseas before sales take off.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Coke, though, Anheuser is new to the global way of
thinking. ``It's taken Anheuser some time to genuinely admit that
people make beer outside of St. Louis,'' said Ms. Solomon of
Salomon Smith Barney. ``There's always been this idea that beer is
such a regional business that American beer is for American
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   That mentality is changing. Anheuser knows that the United
States, where the beer-chugging population of men in their 20s will
increase over the next few years, remains its core market. Still,
Burrows said, ``the opportunity for long-term growth and increasing
shareholder value will come from expanding our business beyond the
U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, that expansion has slowed. After shooting up more than
13 percent in both 1996 and 1997, the company's total overseas beer
sales rose just six-tenths of 1 percent last year, largely as a
result of the recession in Japan, according to the company's annual
report. And overseas sales reached just 7.1 million barrels last
year, around 7 percent of the total, with profits around 6.7
percent of Anheuser's total beer profits.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign expansion is a costly exercise. Like Coca-Cola, Anheuser
believes that a key to winning converts is making a product that
tastes exactly the same everywhere in the world. So it sends
brewmasters to its overseas plants to supervise the making of
Budweiser from ingredients that are mostly imported from the United
States. ``If you don't have a consistent product, you can't build
up brand loyalty,'' Walters said.
</P>
<P>
   Anheuser was forced to modify its strategy in Japan last year.
In the last three years, as the country's economy has been mired in
recession, a cheaper beer type known as happoshu has emerged,
supported by a reduced government tax on such beer, which is less
than 25 percent malt, Burrows said.
</P>
<P>
   Anheuser sat out the first round, watching as Suntory Ltd.
cornered the market for products priced about 30 percent below the
200 yen, or $1.75, that most premium beers are sold for. When
Suntory's share went from zero to 18 percent in the category,
Anheuser had a change of heart and began marketing its own brand of
lower-malt beer, called Buddy's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was important to compete,'' Burrows said.
Earlier this year, Anheuser also introduced a beer called Budweiser
Fine Malt, intended for the older consumer, with a flavor that
Burrows described as ``slightly more bitter, fuller, darker,
consistent with a Japanese beer profile.'' Anheuser reported
selling about 500,000 barrels of beer in Japan last year.
</P>
<P>
   China has become Anheuser's fifth-largest overseas market since
Budweiser was introduced there in 1993. Sold largely in hotels,
discos and restaurants in coastal cities like Shanghai and
Guangzhou, Bud is known locally as Baiwei, which Burrows translates
as ``100 magnificents.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, China has been a complex frontier. Budweiser is priced
two to three times higher than local premium beers, and
distribution is a piecemeal arrangement. A price war among
international beer makers in China during the last half of 1998 cut
into sales because Anheuser did not lower its prices and volume
declined, Burrows said. A lower-priced beer is being sold this year
in test markets there, also under the Buddy's brand.
</P>
<P>
   The largest foreign market for Budweiser is Canada, where 1.7
million barrels, brewed under arrangement with the Labatt Brewing
Co. unit of Interbrew of Belgium, were sold last year. It has also
been successful in Ireland, where a 1986 distribution arrangement
with Guinness, a Diageo PLC subsidiary, has made Budweiser one of
the top three beers. (Guinness, meanwhile, is still No. 1, followed
by Budweiser or Heineken, depending on who is counting.)
</P>
<P>
   Anheuser is aiming at younger people overseas because they are
more likely to experiment with new brands. To lure them in Japan,
for example, the company peddles Budweiser clothing and other
products on the Web, and hands out free samples in bars.
</P>
<P>
   Anheuser has been able to export many of its other
tried-and-true marketing devices as well. The famed frogs appear in
commercials in Ireland, England and on ESPN broadcasts around the
world. The ``Budweiser girls,'' spandex-clad representatives at
various company-sponsored events, have their overseas incarnations
as well. In China, generally a more conservative place socially,
the women often turn up at bars dressed in skirts, vests and tennis
shoes, Burrows said, although miniskirts are not unheard of. ``It's
whatever people in the market are most comfortable with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Argentina, per capita beer consumption has risen to 9.275
gallons a year from 7.95 over the last 15 years, while wine
consumption has declined. Budweiser signs have cropped up on
venerable restaurant facades across Buenos Aires, including that of
Los Inmortales, a shrine to tango, which now has four big
red-and-white Bud signs.
</P>
<P>
   A major factor in Budweiser's advance has been the partnership
with Compania Cervecerias Unidas, an established distributor that
had long wanted to increase its sales in Argentina and was willing
to compete against Quilmes, the most popular local beer, although
Budweiser is priced higher.
</P>
<P>
   Anheuser has also tried to affiliate its brand closely with
popular sports events. Budweiser is the exclusive beer sponsor for
the Copa America soccer competition in South America, for example.
It also sponsors horse races in Ireland and American football
matches in England.
</P>
<P>
   As it tries to drive Budweiser sales overseas, Anheuser has made
equity investments in other beer makers, notably Mexico's Grupo
Modelo, which makes Corona, the top-selling import in the United
States. Anheuser holds a $1.6 billion, 50.2 percent stake in
Modelo, profiting every time a Corona is sold even though it does
not own the brand.
</P>
<P>
   And the company has an 8 percent stake in CCU Argentina, its
Argentine distributor, which, if one takes the long view, may carry
Anheuser beyond Argentina. ``Argentina is next to Brazil,'' Emanuel
Goldman, a global consumer-products analyst for Merrill Lynch,
pointed out, ``and on a long-term basis, Brazil is very much in
Anheuser's plans.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Not wanting to belie their clean and wholesome image
by complaining about the officiating in Game 3 of the NBA finals,
the San Antonio Spurs heaped praise upon the Knicks Tuesday while
refraining from the most overt forms of referee bashing.
</P>
<P>
   But during Tuesday's session with the news media, the Spurs'
feelings came out, even if the words did not.
</P>
<P>
   When asked how Allan Houston and Latrell Sprewell managed to get
to the foul line 22 times in Game 3, after totaling only 16
free-throw attempts over the first two games, Spurs Coach Gregg
Popovich smiled and kept silent. But his smirk, along with the way
he ran his fingers across his mouth as if zipping his lips, spoke
volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Later on, Sean Elliott, the Spurs' small forward, said the
Knicks were probably not the only ones who were pleased that this
initially lopsided series now stands at a competitive two games to
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as New York and NBC and the league are concerned, yeah,
I'm sure they're happy that the series is prolonged,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Spurs were sending a subtle message to Wednesday
night's officiating crew, trying to create an us-against-the-world
mirage, or reacting in a spoiled-brat fashion after losing for the
first time in 13 games, the San Antonio players clearly had
questions about the work of the referees Monday night at Madison
Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   In the Spurs' eyes, physical contact that was viewed as
aggressive, hard-nosed defense in the Alamodome suddenly became a
foul. And the Spurs' guards, Mario Elie and Jaren Jackson, suffered
because of it. Elie, San Antonio's best perimeter defender, was
whistled for two fouls in the game's first 1 minute 57 seconds.
Under five minutes later, his backup, Jackson, was forced to the
bench with two fouls himself, leaving Houston virtually free to
overpower the defense of the undersized reserves, Antonio Davis and
Steve Kerr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mario's an aggressive defender, and at home he was allowed to
defend them hard and last night he was taken out of the game right
away,'' said Kerr, a finals expert after playing on the Chicago
Bulls' last three title-winning teams. ``But that's the way it
goes. You're going to have some things like that happen on the
road. I think guys know that. Guys have been in the league a few
years, and it's always been that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The next two games are at the Garden, which could bode ill for
the Spurs. But Elie said he would not change his style and would go
after Houston with the same ferocity that has made him one of the
National Basketball Association's most respected defenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't let the ticky-tack fouls change my game,'' Elie said.
``I'm going to come out with the same aggressiveness that I've been
coming with the whole series.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Just let me play out there. There were a lot of
questionable calls. There were a lot of fast whistles. Two of our
guards had four fouls with eight minutes to go in the first
quarter. I mean, this is the finals, let the players decide the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Elie admitted that it would be interesting to
see how the Spurs reacted to a loss. They had not dropped a playoff
game on the road all year, and had an NBA record 12 straight
post-season victories. Their last defeat on the road was at
Sacramento on April 27, giving them a gap of 54 days between road
losses. Not since Feb. 28, when they had a 6-8 record, have the
Spurs lost consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen a great character and response in this team,''
Spurs center David Robinson said. ``We've come in the locker room,
and we are very upset about losses and really kind of mad at each
other. And it's just a bad atmosphere after we lose. That always
gets us wanting to be on the right track real soon. We come back
and play extremely well generally.''
</P>
<P>
   While the officiating was a concern, the Spurs were most
disappointed by their shoddy ball handling and distribution. They
gave out only 15 assists and committed 20 turnovers, 6 more than
their average during the playoffs. They had not committed 20
turnovers in a game since defeating Phoenix on April 12, and they
had only 15 assists or fewer twice during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember the last time we had 20 turnovers in two
games,'' said Avery Johnson, overstating the issue but getting his
point across. ``The way we played was an abomination, but I don't
expect it to happen the next game.''
</P>
<P>
   Elie, the native New Yorker with the playground mentality, has
already embraced the mind-set that it is the Spurs against the
world. ``When you win a title, it's always hard,'' he said.
``Nobody's going to just let you take it. It's a test for our team.
It's a good test. I'm sure we'll respond. We've been in this
situation before. There's no need to panic. It's a seven-game
series. It takes four games to win the series, and all we can
control right now is what we do tomorrow night.''
</P>
<P>
   Try as they might, they certainly cannot control the officials'
whistles. &QL;

IN WAKE OF ESPIONAGE, DEBATE ON NEW NUCLEAR ARMS AGENCY  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JEFF GERTH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate and the Clinton administration moved
closer to a drastic legislative restructuring of the Energy
Department, but in Senate testimony Tuesday Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson continued to resist a key element, a proposal to create
a new agency to oversee nuclear weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal to establish an Agency for Nuclear Stewardship
within the Energy Department is scheduled to be considered by the
Senate this week. Support for a separate office to oversee
government nuclear weapons programs has built since the release
earlier this month of a scathing report about lax security at the
weapons labs after charges of Chinese spying.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which recommended the creation of a semi-autonomous
agency to oversee nuclear operations was issued last week by
President Clinton's foreign intelligence advisory board, headed by
former Republican Sen. Warren B. Rudman. Rudman testified at an
unusual joint hearing Tuesday attended by almost one third of the
Senate and drawn from four committees.
</P>
<P>
   Rudman told the senators that blame for the security problems
was widespread and bipartisan and therefore required a more
independent solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's everybody,'' he said, including President Clinton, for
``acting too slowly,'' and Congress, where oversight ``probably
could be improved.''
</P>
<P>
   In talks on Monday night, Rudman and Richardson said they were
able to narrow their disagreements about how to reorganize the
nuclear weapons programs. Richardson signaled the hopes of the
Clinton administration for a ``consensus amendment'' and noted he
has already adopted 38 of the report's 43 recommendations. This led
Democrats and Republicans to express optimism about passage of the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   But by the hearing's end, Richardson had dug in his heels,
resisting a semi-autonomous agency for nuclear weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate the `agency' word'' he told the senators, because ``it
connotes something that is a separate entity within my own''
department.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Richardson backs the creation of an undersecretary of
energy to take control of the array of department nuclear programs.
</P>
<P>
   Rudman countered, saying he and others do not ``understand the
secretary's abhorrence to this word.'' Rudman also addressed
concerns by some Democrats that civilian research would be harmed
by the reorganization. He noted that his report called for the
secretary of energy to keep responsibility for the nonweapons labs.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson and Rudman testified later before the House Commerce
Committee hearing. There some members raised questions about
whether a separate agency would adequately oversee other issues in
the weapons programs, including those of safety and health.
</P>
<P>
   The legislative momentum seems focused now in the Senate, where
the three Republican sponsors of the proposed legislation said
Tuesday that they have largely adopted Rudman's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the ultimate legislative outcome, it is increasingly
clear that the spy cases at the weapons labs will lead to a
reorganization of the Department of Energy, which was created in
1977. And significant changes seem likely in the way the government
investigates spy cases.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has also been
working on legislation to address problems encountered during the
investigation of China's acquisition of design secrets of American
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 the Justice Department rejected requests by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation to conduct surveillance of the chief
suspect in a case involving the theft of design information for the
W-88 warhead.
</P>
<P>
   Rudman Tuesday said the rejection may have been based on an
``overly strict'' interpretation of the Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act. He asked whether the act, which balances privacy
and national security, was ``being administered properly,'' a
question at the heart of the intelligence committee's work.
</P>
<P>
   Rudman also criticized the FBI for miscommunications, saying the
Justice Department's decision ``might have had a different result''
if more of the FBI's evidence had been presented to the Justice
Department.

CONSIDER GAMBLING'S REAL EFFECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For better or worse, the head of the American Gaming Association
is dead right when he says casino gambling has been accepted as
part of America's ``mainstream culture.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the response of Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., the
association's chief exec, when a panel formed to analyze gambling
recognized last week a fact of life already acknowledged by just
about everyone except gambling's most ardent foes.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the National Gambling Impact Study Commission report's
most significant finding for gambling's friends and foes alike was
that gambling had been a boon to local economies. Given America's
preoccupation with judging business activity by how it affects
local prosperity, this will give the gambling industry a strong
card to play.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the industry couldn't help but gloat a bit in
the aftermath. Its news release reacting to the report was
headlined, ``I hate to say I told you so...''
</P>
<P>
   What was somewhat surprising, however, was the commission's
findings on those who can't handle gambling. It estimates there are
2.5 million pathological gamblers and 3 million problem gamblers.
In a population of more than 260 million having widespread access
to legal and illegal gambling, those numbers seem relatively small.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates on the social overhead costs of gambling were also
surprisingly small. The study found that compulsive gamblers cost
taxpayers, employers and creditors $6 billion to $9 billion
annually in lost jobs, crime, bankruptcies, divorce and health-care
costs. Assuming those numbers are valid, they're practically
inconsequential in the context of an $8 trillion economy.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the number of problem gamblers and their cost to U.S.
society also seem insignificant when compared with, say, the number
of those with alcohol and drug-related problems and the social
overhead costs they create.
</P>
<P>
   It goes without saying that it's unfortunate whenever someone's
life becomes a tragedy because of gambling problems. Nevertheless,
it would be irrational to deny the overwhelming majority of any
society a social and economic good they want simply because a few
can't handle its downside. Is there any human activity, after all,
that can be considered 100 percent free of potential threat or risk
to a society?
</P>
<P>
   None of this is to say that gambling is an unalloyed good. It
isn't. Its allure is the prospect of getting something for nothing,
which appeals to the worst in us. On the other hand, gambling has
been a constant throughout human history. Its popularity ebbs and
flows, and for the past generation it has been in the ascendancy.
</P>
<P>
   Why? The prosperity of the postwar era explains a lot of the
phenomenon. A gambling boom is nature's way of telling us we have a
lot more discretionary income than we can use constructively.
</P>
<P>
   This, however, doesn't mean it's wrong, bad or immoral. All it
means is that many of us are, well, human.
</P>
<P>
   This report isn't going to stop the debate over the merits of
legalized gambling. Both sides will probably find much in the
report to support their points of view. Nevertheless, the
commission has done a valuable public service by providing a common
referent for those on both sides of the debate.

OZAWA TO LEAVE BOSTON SYMPHONY FOR VIENNA OPERA POST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (e and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Seiji Ozawa will relinquish his position as music
director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra at the close of the
2001-02 Tanglewood season to assume the music directorship of the
Vienna State Opera. The formal announcement is expected at a
Wednesday press conference by Austria's secretary of state for
culture, Peter Whittmann, along with the director of the Vienna
State Opera, Ioan Holender.
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa, 63, has served as music director of the BSO since 1973,
the longest tenure of any conductor who has held the post. News of
his decision reached Symphony Hall late Monday, and it came as a
surprise to even his closest associates.
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa is currently touring with the Vienna Philharmonic, which
serves as the orchestra for the Vienna State Opera. Tuesday night
he was conducting the Philharmonic in Bruckner's Second Symphony in
Baden-Baden, Germany. After the concert he said by telephone:
</P>
<P>
   ``After all the celebrations of my 25th anniversary in Boston, I
knew that the time must one day come to make the decision to leave,
but this was not a subject I could discuss with anyone but my wife.
I thought that either this September or a year from now I would
need to make a decision and an announcement, and then Vienna came
out with this very surprising offer. I thought that once I left the
Boston Symphony, I would keep only the Saito Kinen Orchestra and
Festival in Japan, and guest-conduct elsewhere. I did not want to
be a music director again, and would not leave the Boston Symphony
for another orchestra. But before I die, I do want to conduct more
operas. I am in Boston for three more years and in Vienna for three
years beyond that. At my age six years of commitment represents a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with obvious emotion, Ozawa added: ``This was a very
difficult decision. With the musicians, the board, and the
administration, I feel we have a dream team, and leaving now is not
so easy. I have spent my life with this orchestra, and after the
next three years, I would love to do anything they want me to do.
The next conductor must be free, and it will depend on what he
wants. The decision in Vienna was very quick. Monday was the
meeting with the government, and after government meetings, it is
not possible to keep a secret anymore. This is a very emotional
time because there are so many people in Boston who have done so
much for me. But I think the time to leave has come. What I want is
for the next three years to be the most glorious time both for me
and the Boston Symphony.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to members of the orchestra, Ozawa wrote, ``For 25
years we have worked together as partners to make music. We have
traveled together over five continents and performed for millions
of music lovers who we hope have appreciated our efforts. As
musicians, we have struggled, achieved, and often succeeded in our
quest to do honor to our art. My relationship with the great Boston
Symphony Orchestra has been and continues to be the most rewarding
artistic experience that a musician could ever hope to have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very difficult decision for Seiji,'' said BSO
managing director Mark Volpe. ``Boston Symphony has been his life;
it was where he grew up musically. Without the head start he got as
a student at Tanglewood, he would not be who and what he is today,
but he feels this opportunity in Vienna is one that he cannot pass
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa has recently enjoyed great success in Vienna with
productions of Verdi's ``Ernani'' and Tchaikovsky's ``The Queen of
Spades.'' He has also conducted opera in Salzburg, at La Scala, the
Paris Opera, the Met, and in Japan; since 1980, he has made opera
an almost annual part of the repertory of the BSO.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nicholas T. Zervas, chairman of the BSO board of trustees,
said in a statement, ``Vienna's gain is certainly Boston's loss.
The Boston Symphony has been blessed to have had Seiji as music
director. He is one of the world's greatest conductors _ an
incomparable artist and sheer beauty to behold on the podium. . . .
I consider him one of the finest human beings I have ever known.
Most importantly, we look forward to his continued presence as a
member of the BSO family as often as his schedule will permit.
There is no one like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Volpe added, ``It is important to emphasize that Seiji Ozawa
remains music director for three more years and four more summers
at Tanglewood. One of the things we need to do is sit down with
him, and figure out a continuing role for him in the life of the
orchestra, especially at Tanglewood.''
</P>
<P>
   Volpe said his first responsibility in the aftermath of Ozawa's
announcement is to create a search committee from the various
constituents of the orchestra _ board, musicians, and staff _ to
come up in an orderly fashion with a successor. ``Fortunately, the
BSO has maintained excellent relationships with many of the most
important conductors of our time,'' Volpe said. ``The music
directorship of the BSO remains a very desirable post. Through the
Tanglewood Music Center the music director of the BSO can help
shape the next generation of international musical life.''
</P>
<P>
   While Volpe made a general reference to Ozawa's recent ``moments
of difficulty'' (his recent reorganization at Tanglewood resulted
in protests and a few resignations), Volpe praised Ozawa's
``remarkable music making. One of the great things about Seiji
Ozawa is his capacity for growth. He is a very different musician
today from what he was 17 years ago when I first heard him conduct.
There have been some growing pains, but I feel confident in saying
the best is yet to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa returns to Tanglewood Friday to rehearse with the
Tanglewood Music Center orchestra. July 4 he makes his first
appearance on the Esplanade conducting the Boston Pops in
Tchaikovsky's ``1812'' Overture.

 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican leaders in Congress unveiled an
education bill Tuesday that builds significantly on their previous
efforts to give state and local governments ever broader discretion
over the spending of federal money.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, a state could opt out of the current federal
financing system, which allocates money for specific, targeted
purposes, and instead use most of that federal aid as it wishes,
provided that the state first enters into a five-year contract with
the Department of Education that holds the state to certain
performance goals.
</P>
<P>
   If the state failed to meet those goals, which the secretary of
education would have to approve, the state would return to the old
system of financing.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which would apply to more than $10 billion in federal
money nationally, faces an uncertain fate. There is not yet any
timetable for its procession to the floor of either the House or
the Senate, and Democrats in both chambers denounced it as a
reckless experiment.
</P>
<P>
   But the extraordinary fanfare with which it was introduced
suggested the extent to which Republicans in Congress, eyeing next
year's critical elections, have decided to seize education as an
issue and make local control their battle cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education is No. 1 on the Republican agenda,'' said Sen. Trent
Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader, at an early-afternoon news
conference just outside the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Lott was joined by Speaker J. Dennis Hastert. They stood with
other lawmakers in front of a yellow school bus brimming with
fresh-faced students. Dozens of other children fanned out around
the lawmakers, clapping and cheering their assent to each policy
point, no matter how arcane.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert described the bill, which Republicans have titled the
Academic Achievement for All Act and nicknamed ``Straight A's,'' as
a ``historic step.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the direction of that movement was backward. Rep.
George Miller, D-Calif., said it was unclear from the Republican
plan how accountable schools would really be. He also said states
would be able to shift money from poor districts and children to
wealthier ones. ``Communities will be pitted against each other to
lobby their state capitols for school money,'' Miller said. ``We
know how that fight will turn out.''
</P>
<P>
   Education Secretary Richard Riley issued a statement denouncing
the bill along similar lines.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is a far-reaching extension of the philosophy behind
the Education Flexibility Partnership Act, or Ed-Flex, which
Congress passed with broad bipartisan support this year and
President Clinton signed into law.
</P>
<P>
   The law authorizes states to grant waivers to local school
districts that want to spend federal dollars in ways that differ
slightly from the specifically intended purpose. But districts can
deviate only so much; money meant to combat substance abuse can be
shuttled from a program specified by the federal government to one
that is not, but the money cannot be used, for example, to improve
reading skills.
</P>
<P>
   The new Republican bill, whose chief sponsors are Rep. Bill
Goodling of Pennsylvania and Sen. Slade Gorton of Washington, would
allow precisely that kind of reshuffling. Republicans said the
safeguard preventing any particular area of education or school
district from neglect would be the performance contract, which
would oblige states to prove that achievement was not suffering.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats said many students could fall by the wayside
before the federal government was able to determine that a state
had fallen short of its goals.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ed-Flex, the new bill would affect slightly more than $10
billion in federal money, largely the same pool of money to which
Ed-Flex applies. That represents most of what the federal
government spends on primary and secondary education.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the government provides only about 7 percent of the
education budget for the nation's public schools, and education
experts have said that even striking changes in federal policy have
limited impact.

 KC police say fatal chase didn't violate policy  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE VENDEL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Police commissioners on Tuesday said they
believed the police chase Monday that ended with three deaths was
conducted within department policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing I have heard has caused me any concern that this was
not within our policy,'' said Board President Jeff Simon.
</P>
<P>
   Simon said the department planned an internal review of the
chase, which is standard procedure. He said, however, the chase and
the subsequent wreck would not prompt a review of department
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are comfortable with the policy,'' Simon said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the department's policy, a pursuit is justified when the
officer knows or has reasonable grounds to believe the suspect
presents a clear and immediate threat to the safety of other
motorists.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Randy Sims, who supervises the accident investigation unit,
briefed commissioners for about 45 minutes at a closed meeting
Tuesday. Afterward, Sims said the car was traveling at 83.6 mph
just before the wreck that killed three men.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the men who died in the fiery wreck at 38th Street and
Woodland Avenue had been identified, but police did not release
their names Tuesday. The third man had been tentatively identified,
but police were trying to verify his name.
</P>
<P>
   Sims said a police officer started the 90-second chase after the
three men who were in a Mustang convertible sideswiped a parked
police van containing two prisoners; the Mustang kept going. Sims
said officers then saw the occupants of the Mustang tossing beer
cans from the car.
</P>
<P>
   The officer reported that the Mustang ran two stop signs and two
stoplights, including the light at 39th Street and Woodland.
</P>
<P>
   At that intersection, a van pulled out in front of the Mustang.
The van's driver swerved right to avoid being hit and the Mustang
swerved left to avoid hitting the van.
</P>
<P>
   The Mustang's driver apparently lost control, and the car veered
off the road. The Mustang sheared off a fire hydrant, spun out and
flipped over, landing with its roof against a vacant building. The
car then burst into flames, which spread to the building.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of the driver and one passenger were trapped under
the dashboard of the Mustang and had to be cut out by firefighters.
The backseat passenger was ejected into the building and his body
was found under a pile of rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Results from toxicology tests to determine whether alcohol was a
factor were unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   One unanswered question is how the three men acquired the
Mustang. The owner of the car told police he lent the car to a
friend on Thursday. The friend was not one of the dead men.

TURNING A PHOTOGRAPHER'S VISION INTO CHOREOGRAPHY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 27) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 Ann Daly's most recent article for Arts and Leisure was about the
photographs of Martha Graham by Imogen Cunningham.  
 By ANN DALY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIVERSIDE, Calif. _ History has neglected Arnie Zane, co-founder
of the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company. His partnership with
Jones produced the paradigmatic post-modern repertory of the 1980s,
but after his death from AIDS in 1988 and the notoriety of Jones'
subsequent career, Zane faded into a shadow legend, invoked less as
artistic innovator than tragic hero.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, it is an exhibition of Zane's photography _ a
solo pursuit predating his entry into dance via Jones _ that
promises to revive Zane the choreographer. ``Continuous Replay: The
Photographs of Arnie Zane,'' on view through Aug. 8 at the
U.C.R./California Museum of Photography in Riverside, outside Los
Angeles, traces his oeuvre from 1971, the year he met Jones, to the
early 1980s, when he let his photography lapse in favor of a dance
career.
</P>
<P>
   The multimedia exhibit features about 100 original prints, as
well as slide projections, an interactive Webcam installation and
video footage (some newly discovered). Selections from the show and
catalog are accessible online, at the museum Website:
www.cmp.ucr.edu.
</P>
<P>
   The show and catalog, organized and edited by the museum's
director, Jonathan Green, comprise an extraordinary recovery
project that fundamentally changes the way we understand ``the
other half'' of the Jones-Zane collaboration. Zane was a dancer
neither by nature nor formal education, but he contributed more to
the company's esthetic than may have been previously apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Side by side, Jones and Zane cut a dramatic chiaroscuro, and
critics were eager to cast the couple as a pair of ``opposites
attracting.'' Jones was tall, fluid and black; Zane was short,
percussive and white. The former verbal, the latter visual. Zane
was the cool structuralist foil to Jones' emotional personal
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Continuous Replay'' tells a more complex story.
</P>
<P>
   Zane's genre was portraiture; he even named his earliest dance
solo ``First Portrait'' in 1973. Like himself, his images stood
small and square, with a powerful center. Eclectically inspired by
Jacques-Henri Lartigue's concept of timeless photographs, the
glamour of Richard Avedon and the series of workmen by August
Sander, he aimed for what he and Jones called ``rough elegance.''
</P>
<P>
   If Zane had started out by searching the surface of the human
body in the retro-chic portraits of his bohemian circle of friends,
by the time he turned his attention around 1975 to Pearl Pease, a
wizened eccentric in his Binghamton, N.Y., community, he was
looking deeper into the fissures of the body's collapsed, creased
and cracked flesh. Ambivalent about exposing his own body onstage,
Zane identified with her vulnerability _ and her self-possession _
as an outsider.
</P>
<P>
   Tightly cropped and frontally composed, the images were as
provocative as any of Jones' explicitly combative solos. Asking
``what is beauty?'' was a political as well as an artistic
question.
</P>
<P>
   Zane expanded into a series of widely varying nude torsos
(including those of Jones, young tough guys from the neighborhood,
fellow go-go dancers and other acquaintances), whose gestures and
attitudes he used (as had the founders of modern dance) to reveal a
person's inner life. With infrared photography, he hoped to plumb
the body even further.
</P>
<P>
   Becoming ever more the choreographer, Zane launched the
photographs into time (by serializing them) and space (by
projecting them). An image repeating itself in a progressively
tighter frame gains a momentum akin to gestures accumulating into a
dance. By integrating slides into his performances, he explored,
both literally and metaphorically, what it meant to ``project'' a
performative presence.
</P>
<P>
   Zane disliked talking about art; instead, he channeled his
theoretical rigor directly into the work, which can be recognized,
two decades later, as a sustained investigation of the body: the
production and location of identity (particularly gender, sexuality
and race); the rhetoric of difference; the expressive value of
gesture; and the relationship between sight and knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   He was already engaged with a very post-modern set of concerns,
yet he approached them with a utopian spirit that the art world
left behind in the 1970s. Zane hoped to find a body both physical
and ``transcendent.''
</P>
<P>
   In his catalog essay, Green makes a convincing argument that the
results were more performative than photographic. Zane's pictures
were staged events _ costumed, directed and repeated. Indeed, his
visual experiments prefigured his choreographic vision, which
persists in the company still bearing his name. There is the
emphasis on diverse body types, on gesture and structural
precision. The use of multimedia. (Zane played with found images,
Polaroid and Xerox copies of photographs, photo-booth sequences,
video and magic-lantern slides.) And the intimate relationship
between art and life.
</P>
<P>
   But the most obvious connection is the vocabulary of the pose.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Zane modeled for art classes and studied film,
processes that both depend on the illusion of movement produced by
stillness. He often left the frame lines strategically visible in
his photos and would also serialize a single image by incrementally
cropping it, as if to remind the viewer that in order to exist, an
image requires its limits _ that an image, and by implication the
viewer as well, is constituted by its frame.
</P>
<P>
   As a choreographer, Zane favored a similar accumulation of
discrete gestures, which were effectively ``framed'' by the
poselike moments of stillness in between. These hairline fractures
stood outside the flow of movement, and yet at the same time they
constituted the flow of movement.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lay Zane's radical critique of the dancing body.
</P>
<P>
   The body, he was suggesting, is indeed the site of knowledge,
but that knowledge is not the continuing, seamless, coherent
experience that the conventional dancing body would have us
believe. Rather, our body-knowledge halts and falters. Lurches
along in fits and starts. Doubles back on itself, only to begin
again. It is, as Zane titled a dance in 1982, a ``Continuous
Replay.''

MORE STUDENTS FINDING ROOM FOR SUMMER SCHOOL IN THEIR SCHEDULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARA ROSE WILLIAMS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Dinh Pahn had a choice this summer: hang out
with friends in California or stay in Kansas and take a six-week
American government class.
</P>
<P>
   Like a growing number of students, Pahn opted for summer school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really needed to take this class now, so that next year I
could take a business tech class,'' the 16-year-old high school
junior said during a class break last week.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas and Missouri officials don't have hard numbers, but in
the last five years, they've noticed many more students attending
summer classes, not because they failed during the regular school
year but because they want to accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt about it. School officials all over Missouri
will testify that summer school is no longer just for kids who
flunk,'' said Carl Sitze, director of the Missouri School
Improvement Program in Jefferson City.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more of our better students are going to summer
school all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Pahn's honors government class, for example, includes 28 other
students who have ceded some of their summer to academics. Each has
a different story, but most want to get the required class out of
the way so they can take others during the regular school year.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall Dix, an honor student in high school, is hoping for a
better-than-usual grade in government by focusing on one subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, summer school is a desperate attempt to raise my class
rank,'' Dix said.
</P>
<P>
   Students such as Dix are still in the minority, but the gap is
closing.
</P>
<P>
   In the Shawnee Mission (Kan.) School District, said summer
school principal Jim Wink, about 40 percent of summer students are
taking classes for advancement rather than remediation.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, officials said, accelerated students are a major
contributor to higher summer enrollments.
</P>
<P>
   In Shawnee Mission, enrollment jumped by 300 students from 1997
to 1998 and was up 75 more this year to 1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas officials expect statewide numbers to be up, but figures
are not yet available. Last year, 50,000 students enrolled in
summer classes, about 3,000 more than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri, slightly more than 200,000 students are in summer
school, an increase of more than 20,000 from last year.
</P>
<P>
   Educators list several reasons for the rising popularity of
summer classes:
</P>
<P>
   - More air-conditioned schools. Climate control makes summer
classes bearable. And in the Independence School District, more
schools are being air-conditioned this year, partly to accommodate
the demand for summer classes.
</P>
<P>
   - Higher graduation requirements. When more math, science and
English are required, it becomes more difficult for students to
squeeze in the electives they want.
</P>
<P>
   - A tight labor market. The demand for young people in the
service industry makes employers more flexible, enabling students
to take classes and work, said Cliff Mohn, assistant superintendent
in Independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students go to summer school in the morning and work full
shifts later in the day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   - Economics. Some students take summer classes to gain time
during the school year to take college credit or advanced placement
classes. In the long run, that will save them money.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can get 12 to 15 hours out of the way in high school,
you can save $1,200 to $1,500,'' said Dick Howard, assistant
superintendent in the Blue Springs School District.
</P>
<P>
   Shawnee Mission students pay $240 for a six-week course, but
they can save much more by earning the college credits in high
school. It's an even better deal in Missouri, where summer classes
are free.
</P>
<P>
   - More attractive course offerings. In Missouri, state aid for
summer school is so generous that some schools can offer breakfast
_ and a smorgasbord of courses _ to summer students.
</P>
<P>
   Students in the Independence School District, for example, can
study computer applications, advanced fitness, career planning, art
and health. The nearby Fort Osage district offers classes in
theater, broadcasting and film.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Pearson, a 14-year-old ``A'' student, spends four hours
each morning in film class at Fort Osage High School, where he'll
be a freshman next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun, and we hardly have any homework,'' Kyle said.
</P>
<P>
   Summer, he said, is the only time he'll have to take such
electives. He intends to take a load of weighted college prep
courses during the school year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get a B in a weighted course, it is like an A in a high
school course,'' Kyle said. ``But if you get an A, then you can get
above a 4.0 grade point. And that is what valedictorians and
salutatorians do.''

BECKER STRETCHING OUT HIS FINAL WIMBLEDON
</HEADLINE>
  (With TEN-WIMBLEDON-HINGIS) 
 (rk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Boris Becker, the war horse who put himself
out to pasture two years ago but decided to tackle Wimbledon one
last time, Tuesday pawed and pounded his way out of a
two-sets-to-none deficit against Scotland's Miles Maclagan and into
the second round.
</P>
<P>
   On Court Two, this facility's renowned and reviled Graveyard
Court, Becker recovered his poise, erased three match points, and
secured his 69th victory at Wimbledon. Becker's 31st ace clinched
the 5-7, 6-7 (7-9), 6-4, 7-5, 6-2 comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still around, somehow; today was as close as it could get,
three match points down, two sets to love down, but there's a
reason why I've won so many matches here,'' the 31-year-old Becker
said after improving his record in Wimbledon five-setters to 9-2 at
the expense of the 298th-ranked wild card.
</P>
<P>
   The first-round match in Becker's 15th Wimbledon was almost too
much for his wife, Barbara, who is expecting the couple's second
child in August. ``I told her to calm down a little _ otherwise
we'd have had a baby on the court,'' Becker said. ``She's only a
few weeks away.''
</P>
<P>
   By wearing down Maclagan, Becker earned himself a second-round
Center Court grudge match against his Davis Cup
protege-turned-nemesis, Nicolas Kiefer. Of Becker, the 15th-seeded
Kiefer said: ``He doesn't want to talk to me. I don't know why, but
I don't care. I'm here to play tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   Becker, a three-time Wimbledon champion, became this event's
youngest and first unseeded champion at 17 in 1985, defended the
title a year later, was ousted by Australia's Peter Doohan in the
second round in 1987, but then won the last of his three titles
here a decade ago in 1989. Becker said he reneged on his tearful
1997 Wimbledon retirement announcement because he realized his
total departure from the pro tour was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   With a second child on the way, Becker, who has played
sporadically since 1997 but won the last of his six Grand Slam
tournaments at the 1996 Australian Open, decided he would soon have
to quit all competition to concentrate on his family. That done, he
decided six months ago that he had one last Wimbledon in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of reasons why I can't leave Wimbledon
alone, that's for sure; it's taken this one last highlight to spur
me on,'' the 77th-ranked Becker said. ``But I haven't played a
five-setter in years. What I'm going to feel tomorrow morning, I
don't know yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Becker, there were plenty of other notables who eluded
the upset bug that claimed Martina Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth-seeded Andre Agassi posted an impressive 6-1, 6-2, 6-3
victory against Romania's Andrei Pavel, the runner-up to Patrick
Rafter last week in a grass-court tuneup in the Netherlands. The
29-year-old Agassi, whose French Open victory three weeks ago made
him only the fifth man to win all four Grand Slam events and the
first to accomplish the feat on three surfaces, pronounced himself
ready for his next challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it's like to be a two-time champion anywhere
now, so I'd like to win more, finish the year No. 1,'' the Las
Vegas resident said of his escalated ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Other top-seeded players to advance included the second-seeded
Rafter, who disposed of Italian qualifier Cristiano Caratto, 6-3,
6-2, &QC; 6-2. Fifth-seeded Richard Krajicek, the 1996 champion and the
only man to defeat five-time champion Pete Sampras here in the last
six years, crushed Norway's Christian Ruud, 6-2, 6-3, 6-1. And
eighth-seeded Todd Martin recovered from two sets down to defeat
Hendrik Dreekmann of Germany, 6-7 (8-6), 6-7 (7-5), 6-3, 6-2, 6-4.

IN FILMS, DIRECTOR OLIVER PARKER LIKES TO SHAKE UP CONVENTIONAL
THINKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Despite, or maybe because of, his long career in the
theater, director Oliver Parker doesn't take a reverential approach
when putting stage classics on film.
</P>
<P>
   For Oscar Wilde's ``An Ideal Husband,'' a witty Victorian
melodrama, his goal was to make ``a period screwball comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker's first film was a naturalistic version of William
Shakespeare's ``Othello,'' released in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed while on a tour promoting ``An Ideal Husband,''
which opens Friday, Parker says he braced himself for criticism for
cutting away at classic texts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the inspiration behind both `Othello' and `An Ideal
Husband' has been the desire to shake up the conventional attitude
toward the works. It's almost as if they've been seen solely in
academic worlds until now. I feel more loyal to the spirit of the
original than the original words.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I feel if you don't take some angle, if you don't find a
way to win your audience over, then you have even less of a chance
at delivering the essence of the piece. Striving to make the work
accessible drives one along almost as much as making complex ideas
accessible. The trick is to retain the complexity but make the text
less fearsome for people.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his relatively scant movie-making track record, Parker
has been able to corral great talent for both of his films.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Othello,'' it was Laurence Fishburne, Kenneth Branagh and
Irene Jacob.
</P>
<P>
   For ``An Ideal Husband,'' it's Cate Blanchett, Minnie Driver,
Rupert Everett, Julianne Moore and Jeremy Northam.
</P>
<P>
   Wilde's witty comedy of manners, moral values and dark secrets
that threaten a rigidly loving marriage at the turn of the century
seems timely today. The movie was the closing feature at the Cannes
Film Festival and played earlier this month at the Seattle
International Film Festival, winning Everett the festival's best
actor award.
</P>
<P>
   Blanchett plays Gertrude Chiltern, a devoted and do-right wife
to brilliant politician Robert Chiltern (Northam). They have
everything they could hope for _ love, ambition and a future. But
when the mysterious adventuress, Mrs. Chevely (Moore), reminds Sir
Robert of a letter that could prove to be his undoing, the couple's
carefully structured, perfectly manicured world falls apart.
</P>
<P>
   It's up to hedonistic, happy bachelor and arch best friend
Arthur Goring (Everett) to come to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Parker says he felt extremely lucky to get the cast. He waxes
especially enthusiastic about rising star Blanchett, who earned a
best actress Oscar nomination this year for ``Elizabeth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's fantastic. I was so pleased to have her because her role
is essentially the toughest part. I was amazed she was even
interested in doing it, though I always felt there was something
interesting to get hold of in Gertrude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who knows the play will, I think, be prejudiced
against her because she's normally the antagonist of the piece _
she stops everyone from having a good time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were quite keen to try and craft a slightly different route
for her in our film. Wilde had, perhaps, a different agenda in his
day. He satirized the bureaucracy and the upper middle class
through her and, in a way, we tried to get behind the scenes a
little more.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the main things we needed to dramatize was the battle
going on in her head. She has been brought up to believe in strict
moral codes, and she actually has feelings that are in opposition
to them when she learns the truth about her husband. In that very
moment, we get into her head and heart. Then there is interesting
drama.''
</P>
<P>
   The director says he purposefully cast an American to play the
antagonist, Mrs. Chevely. ``She's an outsider in the play so we
wanted a non-British person to play her, and Julianne has a
wonderful way of being hard, yet vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   So, is there one character in the play that embodies Wilde's,
well, wild personal philosophy?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' says Parker. ``The obvious character who stands as a
mouthpiece for Wilde is Goring. He's the reluctant hero who has no
morality at all, but by the end has saved everybody from their
terrible troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   Goring is ``a walking paradox'' and that is the ``heart'' of
Wilde, Parker explains. ``Even the main theme of the play was about
embracing the ambiguities in oneself, in a lover and in the world
we live in _ and not to be afraid of them because that's what makes
us human; that's what makes us unique.''
</P>
<P>
   And who does he personally relate to in ``An Ideal Husband?''
</P>
<P>
   He laughs. ``The butler, of course. He's a little bit like a
director, watching people come and go and opening and closing all
those doors.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, he says, a relief to direct a comedy of manners after a
tragedy like ``Othello.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was certainly a saving on the laundry bills,'' he says,
laughing. ``There was much less blood around because everyone was
still standing at the end of this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are parallels between the two plays, of course, but in
terms of tone, it's a lot of fun to be working with Wilde's wit
infecting the filmmaking community. I think it was a terrific
atmosphere to work in, and I always believed it was crucial to the
quality of the relationships onscreen. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel if you can encourage actors to relax and enjoy their
environment, you'll get their best. I have some lovely memories of
this cast and how they started to work together as a team, despite
their different backgrounds and cultures.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker draws on a huge theater background in bringing his
directorial techniques to the screen. ``I worked in a company of
Clive Barker's,'' he says. ``I'd been an actor and also involved in
stage management, and I wrote a play about William Blake with
another actor in the company. I ended up in the director's chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been interested in aspects of it. I enjoyed acting
immensely but I realized my weakness as an actor might be my
strength as a director.''
</P>
<P>
   He's scheduled to begin working soon on a third film _ a
fictional movie about Orson Welles from a script by John Sayles.

   NEW YORK _ It did not matter if Marcus Camby had the upper body
of a coat hanger, he was not about to hand over his milk money to a
star center with cargo room in his biceps.
</P>
<P>
   So Camby, once labeled a pushover, pushed back when fighting for
position against David Robinson during the Knicks' Game 3 victory

Robinson's face as Larry Johnson stepped between the two in

   ``Hey, I just had to stand my ground,'' said Camby, who will
start again Wednesday night in Game 4. ``I wasn't going to let this
guy come in and push me on national TV and try to embarrass me. I
wasn't going for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``My team saw I wasn't going to back down. And that's the way we
have to approach every game.''
</P>
<P>
   This defiant attitude, which has sustained the Knicks in their
desperate moments of the playoffs, helped put the team on the board
in the National Basketball Association finals. But what is
physically left in a team with spirit but few bodies to counter the
Spurs?
</P>
<P>
   If Allan Houston, Latrell Sprewell and Johnson have anything in
reserve, they have a chance to change the feel to this
four-of-seven-game series with a victory Wednesday night at Madison
Square Garden. If the Knicks slip on fatigue, as they did in Games
1 and 2, they'll find themselves one loss from elimination.
Wednesday night, they can put the league's 2-3-2 format to good use
or waste it.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted by the possibility of a Spurs sweep, Coach Jeff Van
Gundy came back with strategic adjustments in the Knicks' 89-81
victory. They worked hard to take away the high-low combination of
Robinson to Tim Duncan, used each other to create mid-range jumpers
instead of predictably driving into the shot-blocking path of the
Spurs' two 7-footers and bullied their way to the free-throw line.
All of this was made possible by an incredible hit of energy.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday provided the only day of rest for the threesome that
carried the burden of Game 3 by pushing the envelope on playing
time. On a sprained knee, Johnson played a season-high 43 minutes,
while Sprewell and Houston played 46 and 45 minutes. Before the
finals, Sprewell was averaging 33.6 minutes per game in the
playoffs and Houston 36.8 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But with Patrick Ewing's absence, and the team's litany of
injuries, what choice do they have?
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in the finals, you try to forget about the minutes
you're playing,'' said Houston, who was a little rubbery-legged
Tuesday. ``All I can say is there is a time where you do need a
little rest, with the schedule we're playing. But hopefully you can
kind of have a good strategy as to when you get that rest. But it's
the finals. This is what dreams are made of.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs have the same dream. A day after their first loss in
12 playoff games they were upset at several issues: their 20
turnovers, the officiating that put the Knicks on the free-throw
line 30 times and their uncommon loss of poise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, when we get a technical early in the game and start
fussing too much about calls, we're not focused,'' Avery Johnson
said. ``We think people are going to give it to us. When we're
really good, no matter what the calls are and what the opposing
team is doing, you'll see us locked in. We weren't locked in early
in the game, and that was the disappointing thing.''
</P>
<P>
   They will seek to gain some control in Game 4, while the Knicks
will stick with the strategy that worked for them in Game 3. Even
though Camby found himself in foul trouble early trying to guard
Robinson and played just 16 minutes, he'll start again. If anyone
has energy to burn for Game 4, it's Camby. If he can stay on the
floor, he can ease the burden on Johnson and company.
</P>
<P>
   Camby was one of the few Knicks unsettled by the whistles
Monday. As the aggressors, the Knicks got the calls, which piqued
the suspicions of a Spur or two. Half joking, some wondered if the
league and NBC were hoping to extend the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know what's going to be called on any given night,''
said Mario Elie, who picked up two fouls in the first two minutes
of the game. ``I've been playing Allan the same way all series, and
all of the sudden, Boom, I got three questionable calls.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fouls aside, the Knicks earned Game 3 with their execution,
aggressiveness and attention to Duncan. Johnson, moving as freely
as he has all series, planted his undersized but square body on
Duncan and kept him from catching the ball deep in the post. Forced
to settle for awkward shots, Duncan was 0 for 4 in the fourth
quarter. Growing uncharacteristically flustered, Duncan was called
for traveling and a three-second violation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they wore Tim down,'' Elie said. `'They did a good
job. The Knicks were beating him up all game. They did a good job
of wearing him down.''  &QL;

 SALON.COM IPO GETS CHILLY RECEPTION  &HT;     By Arthur M. Louis 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In one of the most tepid Internet stock debuts yet, investors
turned noses up and thumbs down yesterday on the closely watched
initial public offering of Salon.com, an online magazine based in
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The stock went public at $10.50 _ but instead of doubling,
tripling or quadrupling like most Internet stocks, it actually
fell, finishing the day at $10.
</P>
<P>
   Salon.com's offering was closely watched because it was the
highest-profile example of a radically new stock-distribution
method designed to give ordinary investors access to IPOs over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In most IPOs, investment bankers offer the bulk of the shares at
bargain prices to their biggest customers _ usually institutions
and rich individuals _ to thank them and encourage future business.
</P>
<P>
   Salon went public via an ``Open IPO'' with the help of San
Francisco investment banker Bill Hambrecht, who left his first
company, Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, to form W.R. Hambrecht &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Salon stock was offered on Hambrecht's Web site
( &LR; www.openipo.com &LR; ) in a ``Dutch auction.''
</P>
<P>
   In such an auction, investors specify how many shares they're
willing to buy and at what price. At the end of the auction period,
the company figures out the highest price at which it can sell all
shares. It then sells all of its stock at that price to everyone
who bid that price or higher.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, following the conclusion of Salon's Dutch
auction, its IPO was priced at $10.50. The offering price was the
first sign that there might be trouble because it was at the bottom
of the $10.50-to-$13.50 price range set by Hambrecht in April.
</P>
<P>
   Financial experts scrambled yesterday to understand why the
offering flopped _ or even whether it really did flop.
</P>
<P>
   Some blamed the disappointing performance on the fact that
Internet stocks in general are well below their highs, and that the
entire stock market was weak yesterday, with the Nasdaq composite
index falling nearly 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, Salon.com was down nearly 5 percent from its offering
price.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ramp Networks, another Internet company that went
public yesterday, jumped $5.75 from its offering price to finish at
$16.75 _ up 52 percent. The Santa Clara company produces software
for Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Robertson, another San Francisco investment banker and
longtime rival of Hambrecht, graciously pointed out that an IPO
based on a Dutch auction ``by definition'' balances supply and
demand, leaving little room for price gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theory of the Dutch auction is that the issuing company is
going to get the very best price available,'' said Robertson. ``The
issuer doesn't leave a lot of money on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   In a traditional IPO, investment bankers deliberately underprice
stocks to guarantee their customers a quick profit and generate
excitement in the stock.
</P>
<P>
   David Menlow, president of IPO Financial Network in New Jersey,
said he considers Dutch auctions foolish from the standpoint of
stock-market psychology.
</P>
<P>
   The offering should have been priced lower than demand
indicated, he said, so the stock would have room to soar the first
day. Now, when investors see how Salon.com performed, they won't
want to buy it, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``IPO investors should not go into a deal and buy a stock and
the very first day show a loss. The market is not used to that sort
of thing and has no tolerance for it,'' Menlow said.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts suggested that Salon.com's stock was held back by
the company's unconvincing business model.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which publishes news and commentary online and
relies almost entirely on advertising for revenues, lost $6.2
million in the fiscal year ended March 31, or more than twice its
revenues of $2.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all Web sites are losing money, but unlike Salon, most
are relying in part on e-commerce _ selling goods via the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Content alone has not proven to be a ``viable business model,''
noted Lisa Allen, an analyst with Forrester Research in
Massachusetts. ``Content sites that are losing money are a dime a
dozen.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hagen, chief financial officer of Salon.com, insisted in a
brief telephone interview: ``We're very excited and happy. The
stock is performing as we expected, and now we are focusing on
running the company.''
</P>
<P>
   W.R. Hambrecht officials could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Salon's top management includes President and Editor in Chief
David Talbot, who formerly served as the San Francisco Examiner's
arts and features editor. Andrew Ross, vice president for business
and strategic development, was the Examiner's foreign and national
news editor.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg News reported that in the wake of the
2.5-million-share IPO _ which amounted to nearly a fourth of
Salon.com's stock _ Talbot's stake is worth $4 million and Ross' is
worth $1.1 million.

DELTA AND AMERICAN JOIN NEW PARTNERSHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By EDWIN McDOWELL    c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two new airline alliances were announced Tuesday, between Delta
Air Lines and Air France, and among American Airlines Swissair and
Sabena World Airlines of Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   While both accords are expected to integrate flight schedules
and frequent-flier programs between partner airlines, the Delta-Air
France long range plan is to bring other partners into their fold,
so they can better compete with the eight-member Star Alliance, led
by United Airlines, and the eight-member One World alliance, led by
American Airlines. Both the Star Alliance and One World consist of
at least one airline from Europe, Asia, South America and
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Airline partnerships, an outgrowth of the ``open sky''
agreements that have pried open aviation markets around the globe,
have accelerated tremendously since Northwest Airlines and KLM
Royal Dutch Airlines linked up in 1993. Eleven European airlines
from seven nations banded together last year under the name of the
Qualiflyer Group, and now serve more than 300 destinations.
Austrian Airlines, Sabena and Swissair are members of the Atlantic
Excellence partnership, as is Delta _ which said Tuesday that it
would continue as a member.
</P>
<P>
   Many airlines belong to one or more alliances, because each one
is thought to confer different strengths. Later this year
Continental Airlines is expected to join the Wings alliance, which
currently consists of Alitalia, KLM and Northwest. Yet Continental
is already allied with Northwest and Alitalia, and Alitalia is a
partner with KLM.
</P>
<P>
   And several Asian airlines that are not yet committed to
existing alliances _ as Singapore Airlines appears committed to the
Star Alliance _ have talked about forming a regional alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller airlines benefit from alliances by being able to expand
their reach with the help of their partners, a reach that otherwise
would be financially prohibitive. And bigger airlines benefit by
being able to offer their passengers seamless travel and flights on
partner airlines to destinations to which they could never afford
to fly on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Early results suggest that alliances can be profitable. In May,
both United and Lufthansa said that their membership in the Star
Alliance _ which also includes Air Canada, Air New Zealand, Ansett
of Australia, Scandinavian Airlines System, Thai Airways and Varig
of Brazil) _ contributed significantly to their respective bottom
lines. United said the alliance contributed about $200 million, or
about 10 percent, of its $2.3 billion profit in 1998. For
Lufthansa, the alliance contributed about 18 percent, or $265
million, of its 1998 operating profit of $1.5 billion.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: BALKAN TOURISM HURTING; NEW ORDERS FOR CRUISE
SHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Duplication warning: also sent with `t' code)  
 (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dim Prospects for Travel in the Balkans, at least for now
</P>
<P>
   The end of the NATO bombing campaign in the Balkans will not
revive the region's travel or tourist industry anytime soon. But
Austrian Airlines has already restored its daily flight between
Vienna and Skopje, Macedonia, and is evaluating whether to restore
service to Tirana, the capital of Albania. Both flights were
suspended after the bombing began March 24.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago PricewaterhouseCoopers estimated that the
fighting in the Balkans could cost hotels, travel agencies,
airlines and cruise ships as much as $100 million. The conflict
certainly seems to have taken a heavy toll on travel to Western
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of whether you think of it as 'Clinton's War,'
`NATO's War,' `Our War' or `Their War,' there is no question that
the U.S.-led nightly bombings of Yugoslavia have brought the annual
summer invasion of American tourists into Europe to a near halt,''
Joel M. Abels, the editor and publisher of Travel Trade, wrote in
that trade publication's June 14 issue. With few exceptions, he
added, ``travel agents, tour operators, cruise lines and airlines
watched as the booking season was stopped practically dead in its
tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   Most travel industry analysts think that situation will improve,
now that the bombing has ended _ especially since airlines, cruise
ships and European hotels are dangling attractive discounts.
British Airways and American Airlines are currently offering two
round-trip economy tickets to London for the price of one, with
certain restrictions. And cruise lines are dangling upgrades and
substantial discounts on their Mediterranean cruises. Windstar
Cruises is offering as much as 50 percent on its European
itineraries, plus a ship-board credit of $100 for guests who book
by July 19.
</P>
<P>
   Order for New Ships
</P>
<P>
   Princess Cruises, which is owned by the Peninsular &AMP; Oriental
Steam Navigation Co., has ordered four new ships for delivery
between October 2001 and May 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the ships, which will carry 1,950 passengers each, will
be built by Chantiers de l'Atlantique of France. The other two,
which will each accommodate 2,600 passengers, will be built by
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan. P&AMP;O Cruises, a sister
company, has also ordered a 2,600-passenger ship from Fincantieri
of Italy. The five ships will cost approximately $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Including three ships already under construction and scheduled
for delivery through 2002, the Princess fleet will grow from 9
ships currently to 16 and the number of berths will more than
double to 30,000. &QL;

 &HT;    Spurs not fazed byrare playoff defeat
 &HT;    By Mark Rosner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sean Elliott is sure San Antonio Spurs fans are
reacting rationally to the team's defeat against the New York
Knicks on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are burning their houses,'' Elliott said.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so the Spurs consider expectations so unreasonable that they
either dismiss them offhand or make jokes to illuminate the
absurdity.
</P>
<P>
   To those who believed San Antonio was supposed to win its first
NBA championship by defeating New York in four straight games,
Elliott said, ``Everyone was talking sweep _ except us.''
</P>
<P>
   But even the Spurs have to admit that a different feeling has
set in now that their 12-game playoff winning streak ended with an
89-81 loss that cut San Antonio's lead in the NBA Finals to 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a strange day for us, the day after a loss,'' said
Avery Johnson, after the Spurs held a practice session to prepare
for tonight's game. ``It's a funny feeling, I'll tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time they felt this way was May 11, after a defeat that
seemed more damaging than the one on Monday. On May 11 the Spurs
were beaten by Minnesota at the Alamodome, evening their
first-round series 1-1. The Spurs responded with an 85-71 victory
two nights later in Minneapolis, starting the winning streak that
ended on Monday after 40 days without a defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Spurs will do what they have done before, what every
team does after losing a playoff game: make adjustments. They will
tweak the offense. They will tinker with the defense. But they will
not burn their houses. They will not panic, although Coach Gregg
Popovich did not place mints on their pillows after the defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pop is brutal when we win,'' Johnson said. ``So you can only
imagine . . . he's a maniac when we lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs do not agree with suggestions that New York has
changed the tone of the series by winning a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel the same,'' Tim Duncan said. ``It's not out of control
and it's not in control. It's right there where it can swing either
way, but we're very confident with what we are doing. We've lost a
game, but we're not in a hole. We don't feel badly about the loss.
We're not crying about the loss.''
</P>
<P>
   At times Monday, the Spurs appeared to cry about the
officiating. For the first time in the series, the Spurs were
called for more fouls and the Knicks shot more free throws. Mario
Elie committed two fouls within four seconds of the first quarter
trying to guard Allan Houston, who finished with 34 points. Elie
received a technical foul for protesting the second personal foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of questionable calls,'' Elie said. ``I've played my
same defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs faced a similar situation in game three at Portland,
when David Robinson, Duncan, Elliott and Will Perdue were assessed
two fouls each in the first quarter. But they responded
significantly better than on Monday, winning 85-63.
</P>
<P>
   Elie's foul trouble seemed to set the tone for Monday's game. He
was forced to sit down after less than two minutes had elapsed. His
replacement, Jaren Jackson, also picked up two quick fouls, and the
Spurs never established a perimeter game.
</P>
<P>
   Elie, Elliott, Jackson and Johnson combined for only 23 points,
their lowest production during the playoffs and 14 fewer than they
had averaged before Monday. They hit only 10 of 27 shots and stood
around too much, watching Robinson (25 points) and Duncan (20) work
inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just weren't normal,'' Johnson said. ``We looked like
another team in Texas (Houston). We can't play like our I-10
counterparts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs are not sure the perimeter players need to get more
shots. But they at least must refrain from standing still.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get a little more movement and not be so
predictable,'' backup guard Steve Kerr said.
</P>
<P>
   By doing that, Duncan, in particular, should have more
opportunities to score inside, and he might shoot more free throws.
His 20 points were nine fewer than he averaged in the first two
games.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan did not score in the fourth quarter. He missed four shots
and committed three of the Spurs' turnovers during the game. Duncan
also shot only four free throws after averaging 9.5 in the first
two games.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs must play better defense on Houston and Latrell
Sprewell, who scored 24 points. The Spurs allowed Houston and
Sprewell to receive the ball closer to the basket than during the
first two games. When they did not score, Houston and Sprewell
combined for nine assists.
</P>
<P>
   But Kerr, a veteran of three championship teams with Chicago,
said the 30-22 edge New York had in free-throw attempts was the
biggest reason the Spurs lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were at the line all night,'' Kerr said. ``We defended
them well in the first two games, and last night we didn't defend
them as well. Still, they shot only 39 percent (on field goals), so
the key was obviously getting to the foul line to score.''

 Regulator Wants to Rewrite State Electricity-Industry Rule  &HT;     By Rebecca Smith 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
The operator of California's high-voltage transmission system is
pressing federal regulators for permission to rewrite some of the
rules governing the state's $23 billion deregulated electricity
market.
<P>
   The request is prompted by apparent market gouging by Duke
Energy Corp., the new owner of some PG&AMP;E power plants, which last
week charged 10 times the normal price for an energy service it
provided to the grid operator, the California Independent System
Operator.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of who profits from new market rules, created when
California deregulated its electricity market 15 months ago, is
extremely important to consumers because, ultimately, they bear the
cost of market-design flaws or market abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Although not illegal, Duke's action was harmful because it
exploited defects in market design to garner a windfall profit of
roughly $1 million a day last week, said Terry Winter, chief
executive of the grid-operating ISO in Folsom (Sacramento County).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there will be a hue and cry from some of the
generators about our intervening, but I'm not going to allow
someone to make millions of dollars like this,'' Winter said. ``The
rules aren't right, so I'm changing the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke executives objected yesterday to the inference that they
were gouging but said they understood why the ISO took action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to see the ISO doing a lot of tinkering with the
market, but if something's broken, they need to fix it,'' said
Randy Hickok, Duke's vice president of California regulatory
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   As California's grid operator tweaks the rules to nip perceived
market abuse, other states are watching. In addition to buying
three plants from PG&AMP;E here in California, Duke, a Charlotte, N.C.,
operator which is one of the nation's biggest energy conglomerates,
has bought power plants from mainline utilities in other states
that are undergoing deregulation, including Connecticut,
Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In its June 18 filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, the grid operator is asking for permission to change
market rules to correct market defects.
</P>
<P>
   The incident behind the unusual request _ one of only two such
cases identified since the ISO began running the electric grid 15
months ago _ concerns Duke's operation of the Morro Bay generating
station it acquired last year from PG&AMP;E along with Moss Landing and
Oakland power plants.
</P>
<P>
   Duke is accused of exploiting transmission bottlenecks to
extract a higher price for the services that it and other
generators offer the ISO to help relieve occasional electrical
congestion.
</P>
<P>
   At certain times of the year, major transmission lines become
overloaded, usually because of high demand due to extreme heat or
cold in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   In those instances, the ISO must intervene and order power
plants in congested areas to reduce their electricity production to
ease the overload situation that jeopardizes power-line stability.
Additional power then must be obtained from other areas. Both those
reducing output and those providing extra electricity get paid by
the ISO.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the ISO taps the plants that offer the cheapest
prices for lowering electric output in an affected zone. The
problem is that, in some cases, there may be just one or two plants
permitted to ease the overload situation under existing ISO rules.
It's more a regulatory problem than a technical problem.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, important transmission lines connecting the Midway
and Vincent substations _ so-called Path 26 _ that straddle PG&AMP;E
and Southern California Edison service territories were overloaded.
But only the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Plant, still operated by PG&AMP;E,
and Duke's Morro Bay plant were considered qualified under ISO
rules to fix the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Because nuclear plants can't be ramped up and down very easily,
the ISO called on Morro Bay to reduce its electrical output. Duke,
anticipating the need, raised its price for providing the
``adjustment'' service tenfold, to $250 per megawatt.
</P>
<P>
   It might have demanded an even higher price _ and the ISO would
have been forced to pay it under its tariffs _ but the ISO imposed
a $250 price cap last summer in response to previous instances of
gouging by other power plant owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yankee ingenuity is alive and well,'' said ISO chief Winter.
``We had someone who saw an opportunity to make some extra money
and took advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The ISO wants the federal agency's permission to solicit the
services of power plant operators from a wider geographic area to
break the market power of any single generator.
</P>
<P>
   Duke executives said they simply charged what the market would
bear. Isn't that what markets are all about?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hope was that $250 was the value of the service we were
providing,'' said Hickok. ``We provided the grid with the stability
that was needed.''

OZAWA TO LEAVE BOSTON SYMPHONY FOR VIENNA OPERA POST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (e and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Seiji Ozawa will relinquish his position as music
director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra at the close of the
2001-02 Tanglewood season to assume the music directorship of the
Vienna State Opera. The formal announcement is expected at a
Wednesday press conference by Austria's secretary of state for
culture, Peter Whittmann, along with the director of the Vienna
State Opera, Ioan Holender.
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa, 63, has served as music director of the BSO since 1973,
the longest tenure of any conductor who has held the post. News of
his decision reached Symphony Hall late Monday, and it came as a
surprise to even his closest associates.
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa is currently touring with the Vienna Philharmonic, which
serves as the orchestra for the Vienna State Opera. Tuesday night
he was conducting the Philharmonic in Bruckner's Second Symphony in
Baden-Baden, Germany. After the concert he said by telephone:
</P>
<P>
   ``After all the celebrations of my 25th anniversary in Boston, I
knew that the time must one day come to make the decision to leave,
but this was not a subject I could discuss with anyone but my wife.
I thought that either this September or a year from now I would
need to make a decision and an announcement, and then Vienna came
out with this very surprising offer. I thought that once I left the
Boston Symphony, I would keep only the Saito Kinen Orchestra and
Festival in Japan, and guest-conduct elsewhere. I did not want to
be a music director again, and would not leave the Boston Symphony
for another orchestra. But before I die, I do want to conduct more
operas. I am in Boston for three more years and in Vienna for three
years beyond that. At my age six years of commitment represents a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with obvious emotion, Ozawa added: ``This was a very
difficult decision. With the musicians, the board, and the
administration, I feel we have a dream team, and leaving now is not
so easy. I have spent my life with this orchestra, and after the
next three years, I would love to do anything they want me to do.
The next conductor must be free, and it will depend on what he
wants. The decision in Vienna was very quick. Monday was the
meeting with the government, and after government meetings, it is
not possible to keep a secret anymore. This is a very emotional
time because there are so many people in Boston who have done so
much for me. But I think the time to leave has come. What I want is
for the next three years to be the most glorious time both for me
and the Boston Symphony.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to members of the orchestra, Ozawa wrote, ``For 25
years we have worked together as partners to make music. We have
traveled together over five continents and performed for millions
of music lovers who we hope have appreciated our efforts. As
musicians, we have struggled, achieved, and often succeeded in our
quest to do honor to our art. My relationship with the great Boston
Symphony Orchestra has been and continues to be the most rewarding
artistic experience that a musician could ever hope to have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very difficult decision for Seiji,'' said BSO
managing director Mark Volpe. ``Boston Symphony has been his life;
it was where he grew up musically. Without the head start he got as
a student at Tanglewood, he would not be who and what he is today,
but he feels this opportunity in Vienna is one that he cannot pass
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa has recently enjoyed great success in Vienna with
productions of Verdi's ``Ernani'' and Tchaikovsky's ``The Queen of
Spades.'' He has also conducted opera in Salzburg, at La Scala, the
Paris Opera, the Met, and in Japan; since 1980, he has made opera
an almost annual part of the repertory of the BSO.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nicholas T. Zervas, chairman of the BSO board of trustees,
said in a statement, ``Vienna's gain is certainly Boston's loss.
The Boston Symphony has been blessed to have had Seiji as music
director. He is one of the world's greatest conductors _ an
incomparable artist and sheer beauty to behold on the podium. . . .
I consider him one of the finest human beings I have ever known.
Most importantly, we look forward to his continued presence as a
member of the BSO family as often as his schedule will permit.
There is no one like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Volpe added, ``It is important to emphasize that Seiji Ozawa
remains music director for three more years and four more summers
at Tanglewood. One of the things we need to do is sit down with
him, and figure out a continuing role for him in the life of the
orchestra, especially at Tanglewood.''
</P>
<P>
   Volpe said his first responsibility in the aftermath of Ozawa's
announcement is to create a search committee from the various
constituents of the orchestra _ board, musicians, and staff _ to
come up in an orderly fashion with a successor. ``Fortunately, the
BSO has maintained excellent relationships with many of the most
important conductors of our time,'' Volpe said. ``The music
directorship of the BSO remains a very desirable post. Through the
Tanglewood Music Center the music director of the BSO can help
shape the next generation of international musical life.''
</P>
<P>
   While Volpe made a general reference to Ozawa's recent ``moments
of difficulty'' (his recent reorganization at Tanglewood resulted
in protests and a few resignations), Volpe praised Ozawa's
``remarkable music making. One of the great things about Seiji
Ozawa is his capacity for growth. He is a very different musician
today from what he was 17 years ago when I first heard him conduct.
There have been some growing pains, but I feel confident in saying
the best is yet to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa returns to Tanglewood Friday to rehearse with the
Tanglewood Music Center orchestra. July 4 he makes his first
appearance on the Esplanade conducting the Boston Pops in
Tchaikovsky's ``1812'' Overture.

 &HT;    Uneasy coexistence in Macedonia
 &HT;    By Keith Graham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ Most people didn't expect to come close to
President Clinton on his visit to Macedonia's capital Tuesday. But
almost everyone was willing to send him a message when given the
chance.
</P>
<P>
   What they said illustrated the deep differences within this
nation of 2 million people over NATO's policy on Kosovo, and showed
why the Balkan region remains a tinderbox.
</P>
<P>
   Sasko Velickovski, 28, a taxi driver, admitted that Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic had made ``some mistakes,'' but he
said NATO's air strikes on Yugoslavia were also a mistake because
they harmed many innocent citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Serbs, we are the same religion,'' he said, referring to
Macedonia's Slavic, Orthodox Christian majority. ``Every family
from here has some family, some cousin, there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the American media, Mr. Clinton was not
well-informed about Serbia and Kosovo,'' insisted Emil Ribarski,
15, turning his attention briefly from flirting with two teenage
girls in a park in central Skopje. ``Many situations where
civilians died were on Serbian television but not on American
television and CNN.''
</P>
<P>
   Ribarski loves American music, video games and movies. But his
feelings about the United States have changed. ``Before the war,
most Macedonians thought America was the promised land,'' he said,
``but now they are not so sure.''
</P>
<P>
   But across the old stone bridge over the Vardar River from the
park, the mood _ and the message for the U.S. president _ were far
different.
</P>
<P>
   The old Turkish market area is the heart of Skopje's ethnic
Albanian minority _ a group that makes up, according to various
estimates, between 20 percent and 35 percent of the national
population.
</P>
<P>
   Helicopters had begun a sometimes deafening roar, a signal to
everyone that the president had arrived in the city. And at cafes
along the narrow cobblestone alleyways, people drinking Turkish
coffee were unanimous in praising Clinton, America and NATO for
helping the Kosovo Albanians against the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Bugar Isene, a 16-year-old in a Mortal Kombat T-shirt, said his
message to the president was to continue ``to protect the people in
Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Isene was so impressed with the recent pounding of the Serbs and
the current occupation of Kosovo by peacekeepers that he has a new
career ambition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a NATO pilot,'' he said. ``I want to defend
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a few steps away, Qenan Sabani, 32, the manager of a small
shoe store, said Clinton ``is a great man for me. Kosovo is only
one example of his greatness.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabani's brother-in-law, Lundrim Memishi, 24, said he also had a
very important message for the president: He wants to live in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Memishi had arrived in Macedonia three weeks ago after escaping
from his home in Serbia, 5 kilometers from the Kosovo border.
Serbian troops were still occupying his house, he said, ``using it
like a bus station.'' He wished NATO had invaded and gone all the
way to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Skopje, people had heard about the sexual scandal
that threatened to bring down the Clinton presidency, but no one _
despite their views of Clinton's policies _ took the issue too
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton won praise from everyone. Her appearance with a
group of Macedonian businessmen, broadcast live on local television
in early afternoon, local time, attracted crowds of viewers around
TV sets in cafes.
</P>
<P>
   The president's speech to the Macedonian parliament was taped
for airing in prime time, and viewers with satellite service could
watch his meetings with refugees and U.S. soldiers live on BBC.
</P>
<P>
   Isabela Hristovski, 54, a retired administrator for a
construction firm, was out for a stroll with one of her
grandchildren and wasn't following the day's events too closely.
But she said the president's ``personal life is his business.''
</P>
<P>
   Hristovski is part of the majority Slavic community that
identifies itself as Macedonian. Most self-described Macedonians
distinguish themselves from the minorities _ the ethnic Albanians
and the smaller Gypsy and Bosnian communities.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the Macedonian Slavs, Hristovski opposed the NATO
bombings, but she said she would not object to the peacekeeping
force in Kosovo if it is fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``My message to the president is that it must be the same for
the Serbs as for the others,'' she said. ``If NATO is helping both
sides, the Serbs and the Albanians, that is OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Slavic Macedonians raised the specter of a greater Albanian
movement, in which the country of Albania and ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo and western Macedonia would try to unite. Some feared that
many of the refugees from Kosovo will remain in their country,
while others expressed relief that many are already leaving. They
worried, too, about the high birthrate of Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Albanian community, meanwhile, complained that
they are discriminated against in both education and employment
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Both Slavs and Albanians who live in Macedonia said civil war
could erupt in the future, though not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite those fears, there were hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Costa Symanovski, 63, chief of maintenance at a large shopping
center, said the point people should remember about the recent
conflict is that ``we did what the world asked of us. We helped the
Kosovars.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, the country that helped so many refugees despite
its own conflicts needs help from the world to build a stronger
economy of its own. With aid, he said, ``We may help make the
Balkans stable.''
</P>
<P>
   Muhamed Mashovitc, a Bosnian Muslim who manages a transport
business, agreed. ``If people are making money and have decent
jobs, then there will not be war,'' he said. ``But if the world
does not help these people, there could be war.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Velickovski, the cabdriver with a strong distrust of
Albanians, acknowledged that financial aid could help.
</P>
<P>
   The silver lining to the NATO strikes and the influx of not only
refugees but journalists, diplomats and humanitarian workers is
that ``for the first time in my life, all the hotels in Skopje are
filled. All the restaurants are filled, too'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be better, though,'' he added, ``if our factories
worked.''

 Chevron to Slash 1,500 More Jobs  &HT;     By Rebecca Smith 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Chevron Chairman Kenneth Derr said the San Francisco oil giant will
cut an additional 1,500 jobs this year. That's on top of the 1,000
job cuts announced in December as part of a $500 million
cost-reduction program.
<P>
   One-quarter of the jobs eliminated are expected to be in the Bay
Area.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the increase in job cuts, not many Chevron employees
actually will be laid off. That's because more than 2,500 employees
have elected to take an early retirement in exchange for an
enhanced pension. Due to the high number of voluntary quits, pink
slips will be minimal, said company spokesman Mike Libbey.
</P>
<P>
   Although there's isn't an exact match between the voluntary
quits and the jobs slated for elimination, Libbey said a
reshuffling of employees will enable most who want to stay with the
oil giant to remain.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron steadily has been reducing its workforce since 1985,
when it acquired Gulf Oil Corp. Just after the merger, Chevron's
workforce swelled to 80,000 employees, but subsequent divestitures
and reorganizations have slimmed it down to 33,700 employees
worldwide. Roughly 8,100 of those employees work in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Derr also said the most recent job cuts would result in a $150
million special charge against second-quarter earnings. Chevron was
expected to post second-quarter earnings of 78 cents a share,
according to a First Call survey of analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 2,500 people who have volunteered to take an
enhanced retirement package will be gone by the end of the year,
Libbey said. The job cuts will reduce Chevron's workforce by
slightly more than 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron's news came only weeks after discussions with Texaco
Inc. about a possible merger abruptly fell apart. Texaco said then
that the offer from its slightly larger rival was ``unacceptable in
all respects.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Derr refused to comment yesterday on the failed deal,
he said the company remained ``on the prowl'' for quality assets.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company's size will allow it act more quickly and
remain more flexible than in an environment of ``supermajor'' oil
companies typified by the Exxon-Mobil merger .
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to it the old-fashioned way _ by growing our
volumes,'' he said yesterday in New York, where he met with stock
analysts and news reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Derr also said a March fire at Chevron's refinery in Richmond,
and several separate refinery problems, would reduce second-quarter
operating earnings by an additional $100 million.

   MEASURE TO LIMIT IMPORTS OF STEEL IS KILLED BY SENATE
</P>
<P>
   The Senate killed a bill that would have sharply restricted
imports of foreign steel to the United States, a blow to unions and
steelmakers and a victory for President Clinton, who had warned
that the legislation would revive protectionism. The bill, which
became a divisive argument over the merits of free trade and the
economic wisdom of protecting steelworkers at the expense of
raising prices on a range of everyday goods, would have rolled back
imports of steel to the levels before the Asian economic crisis,
ending a surge that began as countries sought to export their way
out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   LEHMAN BROTHERS POSTS SOLID PROFIT
</P>
<P>
   Lehman Brothers, which has been broadening from its traditional
base as a bond house into equities and investment banking, reported
second-quarter earnings that were far above analysts' expectations.
But despite the unexpectedly high profits, shares of the company
fell $3.6875, or 6.11 percent, to $56.625, on volume of more than
four million shares _ more than four times the daily average.
</P>
<P>
   3COM RESULTS BEAT EXPECTATIONS
</P>
<P>
   3Com reported fourth-quarter earnings a penny above analysts'
expectations based on strong growth in products used to manage data
flow over networks.
</P>
<P>
   STOCK PRICES IN BROAD RETREAT
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices staged a broad retreat as a further rise in
long-term interest rates and a late round of selling depressed the
market. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 94.35 points, or
nine-tenths of a percent, to 10,721.63. Technology stocks dragged
down the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index and the Nasdaq composite
index. The S.&AMP;P. 500 lost 13.12 points, or just less than 1
percent, to 1,335.88. Nasdaq fell 50.02 points, or 1.9 percent, to
2,580.26.
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices fell as corporate borrowers prepared to sell about
$10 billion in debt. The yield on the benchmark 30-year issue rose
to 6.06 percent from 6.02 percent.
</P>
<P>
   SENATE PANEL APPROVES SUMMERS
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Finance Committee unanimously approved the nomination
of Lawrence Summers, left, to be the next Secretary of the
Treasury, clearing the way for a confirmation vote by the full
Senate as early as next week. But the majority leader, Trent Lott,
Republican of Mississippi, said a final vote could be pushed back
because Democrats were threatening to add health care reform and
other initiatives to spending bills over Republican objections.
</P>
<P>
   EUROPEANS TO INSPECT COKE PLANTS
</P>
<P>
   The 15-nation European Union announced plans for health

Chevron Chairman Kenneth Derr said the San Francisco oil giant will
cut an additional 1,500 jobs this year. That's on top of the 1,000
job cuts announced in December as part of a $500 million
cost-reduction program.
<P>
   One-quarter of the jobs eliminated are expected to be in the Bay
Area.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the increase in job cuts, not many Chevron employees
actually will be laid off. That's because more than 2,500 employees
have elected to take an early retirement in exchange for an
enhanced pension. Due to the high number of voluntary quits, pink
slips will be minimal, said company spokesman Mike Libbey.
</P>
<P>
   Although there's isn't an exact match between the voluntary
quits and the jobs slated for elimination, Libbey said a
reshuffling of employees will enable most who want to stay with the
oil giant to remain.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron steadily has been reducing its workforce since 1985,
when it acquired Gulf Oil Corp. Just after the merger, Chevron's
workforce swelled to 80,000 employees, but subsequent divestitures
and reorganizations have slimmed it down to 33,700 employees
worldwide. Roughly 8,100 of those employees work in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Derr also said the most recent job cuts would result in a $150
million special charge against second-quarter earnings. Chevron was
expected to post second-quarter earnings of 78 cents a share,
according to a First Call survey of analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 2,500 people who have volunteered to take an
enhanced retirement package will be gone by the end of the year,
Libbey said. The job cuts will reduce Chevron's workforce by
slightly more than 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron's news came only weeks after discussions with Texaco
Inc. about a possible merger abruptly fell apart. Texaco said then
that the offer from its slightly larger rival was ``unacceptable in
all respects.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Derr refused to comment yesterday on the failed deal,
he said the company remained ``on the prowl'' for quality assets.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company's size will allow it act more quickly and
remain more flexible than in an environment of ``supermajor'' oil
companies typified by the Exxon-Mobil merger .
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to it the old-fashioned way _ by growing our
volumes,'' he said yesterday in New York, where he met with stock
analysts and news reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Derr also said a March fire at Chevron's refinery in Richmond,
and several separate refinery problems, would reduce second-quarter
operating earnings by an additional $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   capacity, isn't expected to be fully operational until the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Chevron shares fell 56 cents, to $90.13, yesterday.

 S3 Will Purchase Internet Music Firm for $180 Million  &HT;     By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
S3 Inc., the Santa Clara maker of microchips that control computer
graphics, yesterday took aim at the world of Internet music and
home networking when it announced plans to buy Diamond Multimedia
Systems Inc. in a deal valued at about $180 million in stock.
<P>
   Diamond Multimedia, well known within the computer industry for
its 3-D graphic accelerator boards for PCs, made a splash in
consumer electronics and the worldwide recording industry in
November with its portable Rio MP3 music player.
</P>
<P>
   S3 hopes that the deal will allow it to branch out beyond PC
graphics into a new and promising market.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Diamond Multimedia of San Jose expects the deal will
give it the resources to continue developing its new products such
as home networking equipment. In particular, it hopes that the deal
will help fund the spin-off of its Rio line of portable devices
that play music encoded in MP3 and other digital audio formats,
into a new company called RioPort.com.
</P>
<P>
   S3 President and CEO Ken Potashner said in an interview that the
acquisition marks a ``significant strategic shift'' as the company,
the second-largest maker of graphics chips, tries to rebound from a
money-losing year.
</P>
<P>
   Potashner said many details still need to be worked out, such as
what Diamond's corporate relationship will be to S3 and whether
there will be staff cuts.
</P>
<P>
   But Potashner clearly was upbeat about the move. ``Diamond
possesses some products that will be our entree into what we see
are high-growth and high-value markets, the Internet-appliance and
home-networking arenas.''
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the deal, S3 will swap 0.52 shares of S3 common
stock for each share of Diamond Multimedia. Shares of S3 closed
down 69 cents at $8.75 on the Nasdaq stock market yesterday, while
Diamond's stock closed down 94 cents at $4.75, also on Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   The deal brings together S3, maker of a line of graphic chips
called Savage, with Diamond Multimedia, known for its Stealth and
Viper lines of graphics accelerator boards and Supra modems.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the merger, which is expected to be completed by
October, continues an industry trend of mergers between makers of
chips and boards.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Dan Scovel of Fahnestock &AMP; Co. gave the deal ``a
qualified thumbs up.'' ``Diamond has the MP3 player, and they're
moving into wireless networking,'' he said. ``And in the long term,
that's what makes sense for S3.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Scovel said the new company might alienate current
customers of both companies who will have no choice but to buy S3
chips and Diamond boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see that as a problem that will be limited to the second
half of this year,'' Scovel said. ``Next year at this time, nobody
will be concerned about customer alienation.''
</P>
<P>
   Potashner became CEO of S3 last November to turn around a
company that had posted a $113.2 million loss in 1998 on revenue of
$224.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said S3, which supplies chips to computer-makers like
Compaq, IBM and NEC/Packard Bell, apparently is back on track. Last
week, for example, S3 announced a deal that will give it about $660
million worth of stock in a Taiwan chip manufacturing plant.
</P>
<P>
   With Diamond, S3 will take over a company about three times
bigger. Diamond reported $608.6 million in revenues in 1998, though
for the year posted a net loss of $39.5 million and sliced 20
percent of its workforce.
</P>
<P>
   S3 has about 450 employees, while Diamond employs 950. Potashner
will become CEO of the merged company, and Diamond's CEO William
Schroeder will become chief operating officer and president.

 IBM Points Its Wallet Toward E-Commerce for Small Firms  &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Last month, International Business Machines Corp. kicked off a $100
million marketing campaign to promote its e-commerce products for
small businesses. Then two weeks ago, it paid even more to buy
Whistle Communications, a Foster City company that offers easy
e-mail and Internet access to small companies.
<P>
   Both events underscore an important economic fact about the
information technology industry. ``The small-business segment is
growing more quickly than any other,'' said Peter Rowley, general
manager of Global Small Business at IBM.
</P>
<P>
   International Data Corp. estimates that small and midsize
businesses make up half of the $300 billion global information
technology market and that their expenditures are growing faster
than those of large companies.
</P>
<P>
   Equally important, the small-business market is growing at 11 to
13 percent per year, compared with 8 or 9 percent for larger
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   But IBM, which is better known for its large computing systems
and PCs, faces a problem with the small-business market: It's very
fragmented, with thousands of large and small vendors.
</P>
<P>
   That is the reason for its concerted _ and costly _ crusade to
establish an electronic relationship with smaller businesses. The
campaign includes these features:
</P>
<P>
   _The Small Business Program, which unifies IBM products and
services for this market for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   _The Small Business Solutions Club, where subscribers, for a
small annual fee, can get discounts on products and 50 percent
savings at Hilton, Hyatt, Marriott and other hotels and resorts.
</P>
<P>
   _IBM Small Business Custom Connections ( &LR; www.ibm.com &LR; ), which is
designed to let small businesses create customized pages and
organize the Web according to their specific needs, including
reminders of appointments and events.
</P>
<P>
   _Business Advantage, which provides various online tools and
consulting services to help growing businesses use the Web for
communication, collaboration and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   _ThinkCenters, in which joint ventures between IBM, the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce and Small Business Administration provide
small-business owners with hands-on experience and personal
consulting. They are located in various cities, but none has been
established in California.
</P>
<P>
   Without Whistle, IBM had some products to help small businesses
establish Web sites, sell goods and services online and run their
accounting and other business operations. But it didn't have an
all-in-one system to let little companies using different hardware
and software easily connect to the Internet and send e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   IBM plans to make Whistle Communications products available to
small businesses in all industries around the world. For example, a
small mortgage broker could advertise mortgage rates on the Web,
accept online applications and communicate with customers by
e-mail. An employment agency could advertise jobs and receive
resumes online, deal with prospective employers by e-mail and
receive their fees by a secure network.
</P>
<P>
   Rowley said Whistle Communications will strategically help IBM
``capture small companies and then migrate them to our other
products.''
</P>
<P>
   Whistle had its own reasons to become part of IBM. It had raised
$35 million from venture capital investors. But Whistle CEO John
Hamm said much more was required ``to get big enough, fast enough
to influence small-business buying patterns.'' In addition to cash,
he noted that IBM ``had the brand reach we really needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Whistle and IBM's other e-commerce offerings will help small
businesses ``harness the power of the Internet and compete more
effectively,'' Rowley said. ``This levels the playing field for
small businesses and helps them appear bigger than they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts said IBM is on the right track.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Whistle, IBM bought a conduit into the small-business
market,'' said Dataquest analyst James Staten in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of small businesses are in the early stages of
e-commerce, like sending e-mails back and forth,'' said Boston
information technology consultant Joseph Villarosa. ``But they are
not really conducting business on the Internet. IBM is smart to see
this coming and try to help early adopters move up the chain to
larger products.''
</P>
<P>
   Other major companies may not be spending as much as IBM on
marketing. But they also are targeting the small-business and
so-called SOHO (small office, home office) market with e-commerce
products, services and information at special pages on their Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Hewlett-Packard ( &LR; www.hp.com &LR; ) provides plenty of
information about its products, as well as expert advice, customer
success stories and other Web site resources.
</P>
<P>
   Intel ( &LR; www.intel.com &LR; ) has a full menu of products and services
for small business, including a glossary of terms, case studies and
information on building computer networks, growing on the Internet,
and mobile computing.
</P>
<P>
   Intuit ( &LR; www.quicken.com &LR; ), Microsoft ( &LR; www.microsoft.com &LR; ),
Compaq, ( &LR; www.compaq.com &LR; ), Dell ( &LR; www.dell.com &LR; ) and most other
large hardware and software vendors offer special information for
small businesses.

 _ SF CHRON   Good Sites For Tiny Firms 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &UR; Q: What are some of the best Web sites to learn about e-commerce &LR; 
 &UR; and conducting business online and avoid self-serving promotions &LR; 
 &UR; for products and services? &LR;
<P>
   A: As you have no doubt discovered using Yahoo, MetaCrawler or
other search engines, it's easy to get overloaded online. Many Web
sites operated by companies such as IBM, Intel and Microsoft have
lots of good information, but they also have an ax to grind or
accessories to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, there are a host of independent sites with less-biased
information.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few, including some newcomers:
</P>
<P>
   _Webentrepreneurs.com _ This online community for Internet
entrepreneurs will be launched next Tuesday ( &LR; www. &LR; 
 &LR; entrepreneurs.com &LR; ). The brainchild of San Diego small-business
attorney Steven Morgan, it aims to provide a one-stop destination
for small businesses to find information about operating online,
share stories and network with other Internet entrepreneurs and
potential partners.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure credibility and encourage the same sort of interaction
one might find in a trade association, Webentrepreneurs will not
depend on sales of products or banner ads to make money. Rather, it
will charge users a $99 annual membership fee.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Workz.com _ Last month, this Seattle company launched its
e-commerce portal ( &LR; www.workz. &LR;   &LR; com &LR; ) to help small businesses
compete online. For a membership fee of $49 a year, it provides
access to information on how to build, manage and promote a Web
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We founded Workz.com because we saw that small businesses
needed the same online capabilities as their larger counterparts
but lacked a way to get them,'' said company President David
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The site provides nuts-and-bolts information about setting up
credit card transactions online, creating cost-effective banner ads
and graphic design, securing and registering domain names for Web
sites, getting better position on search engines and expanding
globally.
</P>
<P>
   Workz.com also provides a place in cyberspace where small
businesses can exchange ideas, form partnerships and solve
problems. Eventually, it would like to provide Consumer
Reports-type product reviews and services with members joining in
the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   The company already has about 2,500 members, most of them with
one to nine employees and less than $500,000 in annual revenues.
Free trial 30-day memberships are available.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Onvia.com _ This is another new Seattle site (www.onvia.  &LR; com &LR; )
that aims to be a one-stop, Internet-only resource for
entrepreneurs. The company says it can help small businesses
research, compare and purchase most any product or service at one
site, without linking to another site and without registering and
submitting credit information many times. Next month, it will kick
off a $10 million advertsing campaign to spread the word.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_WorkingSolo _ If you are self-employed, a home-based business, a
consultant, telecommuter or ``e-lancer,'' you might want to check
out  &LR; www.workingsolo.com &LR; . It provides links to other sites, gives
answers to business startup questions and publishes Working Solo
eNews, a free monthly newsletter that offers technology tips and
other information.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Inc.Online _ Associated with Inc. magazine, www.inc.com offers an
Internet index and Web links, an E-Commerce Advisor Newsletter, a
guide to Internet terms and concepts, bulletin boards and news
groups, charts and statistics to benchmark your business, and a
free and simple create-your-own-Web-site feature.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Entrepreneur Magazine _ This publisher has a useful Web site
( &LR; www.entrepreneurmag.com &LR; ) that offers information and articles on
e-commerce essentials, cyberstars and Web site building.

OF INSURANCE FRAUD, MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND THE ONE WHO GOT AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., Conn., Ohio, Tenn., Va., OKla., Mo.)   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH KAHN and JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In early March, a Mississippi state regulator stumbled upon a
curious statistic: Several insurance companies in the state had
funneled as much as $14 billion in stock trades through a
Connecticut-based securities firm, paying just $40,000 in
commissions.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the age of discount brokers, it seemed too much of a
bargain to be true. It was. As they pushed the companies to explain
the transactions and show that they were real, Mississippi
officials brought down what appears to have been a house of cards,
unearthing what investigators now suspect is one of the biggest
insurance frauds in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few weeks, Martin Frankel, the man whose brokerage firm
claimed to have made those trades, had fled with hundreds of
millions of dollars that investigators said he siphoned from as
many as 11 insurance companies in five states.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities have issued an arrest warrant for Frankel,
though he has not been charged with any crime. They suspect that
his firm, Liberty National Securities, was the foundation of a
pyramid scheme. Frankel, they said, escaped just before it
collapsed, slipping out of the United States in early May. He left
behind a trail of intrigue that extends from small Southern
insurance companies and the ``back country'' luxury of Greenwich,
Conn., to the Caribbean and the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   The full scale of the scheme is a mystery, as are many details
of Frankel's life. A native of Toledo, Ohio, operating amid
elaborate security and under at least three aliases, Frankel, who
is 44, absconded with at least $334.6 million in life insurance
premiums from companies in Tennessee, Mississippi, Oklahoma,
Virginia and Missouri, federal prosecutors said in a complaint
filed in U.S. District Court in Connecticut in late May.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme may have involved larger sums _ unless accounting
records filed by Frankel were faked. A civil lawsuit filed by the
insurers claims that $950 million is missing, though some of that
may reflect exaggerated trading profits.
</P>
<P>
   And nearly $2 billion appears to be missing from a charity
controlled by Frankel and affiliated with a Vatican-linked
foundation, though some investigators question whether those assets
ever existed.
</P>
<P>
   Though nearly everyone involved in the matter expresses
confusion as to exactly what happened, Frankel _ cloaked with
credibility provided by the Catholic Church and several prominent
political, legal and media figures with whom he associated himself
_ apparently defrauded insurance companies that he controlled on
the assumption that he could move faster than the state regulators
who police them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all like Alice in the Looking Glass, but we think it's
all part of his pyramid scheme,'' said John Q. Kelly, a lawyer who
represents a Catholic priest associated with Frankel. ``He kept a
stranglehold on the money, and everyone else involved with him just
saw a piece of it.''
</P>
<P>
   It took regulators years to catch on. The red flags included
Frankel's tiny commissions, together with what appeared to be
massive daily trades of Treasury securities, a practice considered
unusual for insurers.
</P>
<P>
   But the authorities apparently did not discover until too late
that Frankel had been banned from the securities business by the
Securities and Exchange Commission for earlier conflicts with
investors in Ohio. His quickness in ferrying money to Swiss and
other foreign bank accounts when he came under scrutiny also
escaped notice.
</P>
<P>
   Though federal investigators say that he often used aliases
including David Rosse, Mike King and Eric Stevens, Martin Frankel
was well known to some regulators. The SEC first brought civil
fraud charges against him in 1991, contending that he had ``engaged
in a fraudulent scheme'' in the sale of limited partnership
interests in an entity called the Frankel Fund.
</P>
<P>
   According to the SEC, Frankel lied about the fund's past
performance, his own experience, the identities of the fund's
managers and how the proceeds would be used. More than $1 million
was raised from investors. In 1992, Frankel settled the complaint
by agreeing to be barred from associating with registered
broker-dealers. He promptly violated that agreement by setting up a
new trading shop from his home in Greenwich.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel surrounded himself with friends who gave him the air of
legitimacy. The Rev. Peter Jacobs, a retired priest now living in
Rome who has broad connections in American political and religious
circles, worked closely with Frankel to establish a charity, the
Saint Francis of Assisi Foundation. Though a business plan for the
charity promised to shower more than $1 billion on poor people
worldwide, it seems to have been used as a vehicle through which
Frankel sought to buy more insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   When the time came for the charity to hire a law firm, Frankel
approached Robert Strauss, the Democratic Party heavyweight and
former ambassador to the Soviet Union, and retained his firm, Akin,
Gump, Strauss, Hauer &AMP; Feld. Akin, Gump said it did minimal work
for the charity and no longer has any connection to it.
</P>
<P>
   The charity also claimed former CBS News anchor Walter Cronkite
and former Chrysler Corp. chairman Lee Iacocca as board members.
Cronkite and Iacocca said they had nothing to do with the charity.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Frankel's troubles became evident May 5. Firemen responding to
an alarm at his $3 million home in Greenwich found blazing
documents spilling out of fireplaces and a file cabinet smoldering
in the kitchen. The house was deserted.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel, authorities now suspect, had already fled the country.
Clues were found amid the charred remains of documents in his
house. Authorities found a ``to-do'' list. Item No. 1: ``Launder
Money.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankel also apparently drew up astrological tables to answer
questions including ``Will I go to prison?'' and ``Should I
leave?'' Authorities found research on U.S. extradition treaties
with various countries, including Israel and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel's home and Liberty National's offices shared an elegant
stone contemporary on exclusive Lake Avenue that had been converted
with rough drywall partitions into a trading floor with links to
the New York Stock Exchange and commodities markets.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel often wore jeans and T-shirts, according to people who
visited his home, and operated his business single-handedly, though
he had a small staff of young women doing clerical work.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently obsessed with security, said Frankel, several people
who knew him, traveled with multiple security guards when he
ventured outside, which was rarely. The house was protected by a
guardhouse, security cameras and floodlights. It contained a
network of more than 80 computers connected to satellite receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel bought at least one other home in Greenwich and created
a stir by using residences with rarefied Lake Avenue addresses to
conduct business amid maximum security. Though several neighbors
had used the same access road to get to their homes, Frankel
installed a guard house and other security measures at the front
entry.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors ``literally had to pass through a gauntlet of security
to get to and from their homes,'' said Philip Russell, a lawyer who
a few months ago was consulted by several of Frankel's neighbors
who were trying to learn their legal options. ``It is not exactly
the kind of neighbor who you go over to borrow a pound of sugar
from.''
</P>
<P>
   Making it worse for the neighborhood was the activity at
Frankel's house. Huge satellite dishes were placed in both the
front and back yards, along with floodlights. Residents grew
dismayed at the bustling traffic, with as many as 35 people at the
home at every hour of the day and night.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were coming and going 24 hours a day, and it was clear
there was intensive commercial activity going on,'' Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   Court records filed by federal prosecutors detail a vast web of
bogus companies and identities that they believe Frankel used to
perpetuate the fraud. At the center is Sundew International, an
entity incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands.
Sundew was the owner of the Greenwich home, and had a contract to
pay Frankel $700,000 a year, court records show.
</P>
<P>
   The fraud appears to have worked this way: Frankel operated or
had ties to several corporations, funds and enterprises that bought
controlling stakes in insurance companies, according to the court
records.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, these companies steered trading business to his
brokerage company, Liberty National, allowing Frankel to drain
their assets. Frankel used a complicated web of transactions to
conceal the destination of funds, according to court records. For
example, one insurer in his orbit invested $30 million in an
account at Prudential Securities, the New York brokerage house.
Frankel then transferred the money to another account in the name
of Bloomfield Investments, which he controlled from his Connecticut
mansion.
</P>
<P>
   That cash was subsequently wired to United Bank of Switzerland,
through its branch in Stamford, Conn., and later to account number
70026 at Banque SCS Alliance in Switzerland, court records show.
Investigators have determined that money from that account has been
used to pay people who worked for Frankel, as well as to pay
vendors and other expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators in the five states have now seized the insurance
companies. Federal grand juries in Bridgeport, Conn., and Nashville
are hearing evidence in the case. The federal government has moved
to seize at least $13.8 million held in 14 separate accounts at
banks including Citibank, PNC Bank and Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel's whereabouts are unknown.

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ When Roberta Green applied for Social
Security, she was carded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man at the counter very patiently explained to me that you
have to be 61,'' she recalled. ``I loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   That was 40 years ago. Today, with her porcelain skin and a
crown of white, curly hair, Green, 101, looks younger than 70.
She's also a member of one of the fastest-growing age groups in the
United States _ people who live a century or more.
</P>
<P>
   A recent U.S. Census Bureau report estimates that nearly 70,000
centenarians live in the United States, about double the number
from a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving 100 years was easy, Green said, padding around her
apartment at the Overland Park Place Retirement Home in Kansas,
laughing about her younger days _ when she was only 70-something.
</P>
<P>
   She called that time her ``second middle age.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in my third middle-age now,'' she said. ``I've been
married two times.'' Then she added with a wink, ``but I've been in
love four or five times. Oh, I need a computer just so I can count
all my blessings these years.''
</P>
<P>
   While California, New York and Florida had the largest numbers
of residents 100 years old or older, centenarians make up a larger
percentage of the population in Midwestern states. Among them Iowa
is first, Kansas sixth and Missouri 13th.
</P>
<P>
   That's not because Midwesterners are necessarily hardier, said
Victoria Velkoff, co-author of the census report. It's because
young people looking for jobs have been migrating from the rural
Midwest to cities. Left behind are parents and grandparents, too
attached to their land and communities to move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mortality is going down, life expectancy is increasing,'' said
Velkoff. ``People are living to older ages.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaner drinking water, better sanitation, antibiotics to fight
infections and better treatments for chronic illness have all
contributed to longer life expectancy, said Linda Redford, a senior
research associate at the Center on Aging of the University of
Kansas Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   And of those living past 100, four out of five are women,
according to the new Census Bureau report.
</P>
<P>
   Green's secret? .MDNM/A little exercise. (She performs her own
version of ``aerobics,'' lifting her arms and legs and doing
sit-ups on the mattress of her bed.) And a belief in moderation.
But she's no faddist. No bottled water or tofu cakes. No handfuls
of vitamins or skin-firming elixirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A dab of baby oil every night, and it works fine,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And she doesn't drink or smoke.
</P>
<P>
   For her, aging means gaining more time to experience life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have anything to worry about except enjoying the
beautiful day God gives me,'' she said. ``I try to have fun, and I
think I can make my friends laugh. That's wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   A positive attitude is one of the secrets of living longer,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know everything there is to know about the nuts and bolts
of aging,'' said Walter Bortz, former president of the American
Geriatric Society and an associate professor at Stanford University
Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you get through with that, you ask, what's it all
about? What's the job description to living long? I think it's
believing that you're supposed to, especially if you have meaning
to your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Bortz wrote a book about growing old, ``Dare to Be 100,'' a
compilation of his studies with the elderly. Although there was no
one-size-fits all lifestyle, there were common traits among this
age group, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Enjoying life, having a reason for living, giving thanks for yet
another day of filling your lungs with air _ all are traits
centenarians share.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, life expectancy has soared in the 20th century, from
an average of 45 years for both men and women to about 63 for men
and almost 68 for women, according to the U.N. World Population
Revision for 1998. By 2050 the average life expectancy worldwide is
expected to hit 83.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States the population has been aging steadily for
decades. Last year, the median age was 35.2 years, the highest ever
recorded.
</P>
<P>
   In the next century, when the baby boomers reach old age,
perhaps 3 million of them may reach centenarian status, the Census
Bureau predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Better health care has helped people live longer, Redford said.
But medicine can do only so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Genetics have to play a major role,'' Redford said. ``Modern
medicine allows that genetic potential (for long life) to be
realized.''
</P>
<P>
   Life expectancy and lifespan are two different things, said
Bortz. Although life expectancy has increased, lifespan, the number
of years the human body can survive if not done in by disease or
injury, has not. Despite medical advances, the maximum lifespan of
the human body remains about 120 years.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest known human being, Jeanne Calment, of France, lived
to be 122 and died in 1997, five years after she quit smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can determine how long you will live except you,'' said
Bortz. ``Not your ancestors, your church, your doctor, your school.
How long you live is determined by how much living you have to do.
It's never too late to decide to live longer. It's a gift you can
choose.''
</P>
<P>
   Remaining active, developing new interests and maintaining
social contacts are common attributes of those who are aging
successfully, Redford said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not sitting home depressed,'' she said. ``When people
say they've lived too long, it's because they have outlived those
(social) connections. They don't feel they have the energy to make
new connections.''
</P>
<P>
   While their medical and nursing care can be costly, the very old
remain a great asset to society, Redford said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a link to the past, someone who has lived so long and
seen so much,'' she said. ``They can share that.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best gift centenarians and elders give to the world
is their attitude. Despite suffering the losses that inevitably
come with age, they overcome the emotional blues and forge onward.
They love life but do not fear death.
</P>
<P>
   For Roberta Green, living to 101 has meant she's learned one
precious skill: to laugh as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   And what does she look forward to now that's she's passed 100
years?
</P>
<P>
   Without missing a beat, she answers:
</P>
<P>
   ``Heaven, honey. Heaven.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have a good time there, too.''

 Quintiles could double KC area work force  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK P. COUCH and JULIUS A. KARASH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Quintiles Transnational Corp. is expected to
announce today a major expansion in Kansas City that could double
the size of its local work force.
</P>
<P>
   The North Carolina health-care company could add at least 500
jobs to the 500 it already has in Kansas City, according to several
sources familiar with the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan, Kansas City Mayor Kay Barnes and
several top Quintiles executives are expected to attend a 4 p.m.
news conference at Kauffman Legacy Park, 4801 Rockhill Road.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City's top economic-development officials and the mayor's
office declined to discuss the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Grebe, a Quintiles spokeswoman, confirmed that the company
would participate in the news conference. She declined to comment
further, referring questions to the Kansas City Area Development
Council.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Marcusse, president and chief executive officer of the
council, declined to comment, citing a confidentiality agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Quintiles paid $93 million for a chunk of Hoechst
Marion Roussel's operations here. About 500 Hoechst Marion workers
in its Kansas City drug development and approval operations became
employees of Quintiles at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Quintiles provides research, sales and marketing services to the
pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industries. The
company also provides health-care information management services
and conducts clinical drug research in Lenexa.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement today is expected to put flesh and blood on the
skeletal development plan Quintiles disclosed in February, when
state officials approved a $4 million bond issue for the company.
The bond money can be used to acquire property and equipment,
expand facilities and upgrade public infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Quintiles said it would use the bond money as part of a $19
million plan to expand facilities it agreed to buy from Hoechst
Marion.
</P>
<P>
   In its application for bond financing, Quintiles warned that it
would consider transferring its expansion plans to North Carolina
or California if Missouri didn't provide significant incentives.
Both of those states had ``informally promised'' Quintiles
significant benefits for expanding within their borders, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for the Missouri benefits, Quintiles said it would
add 532 new jobs to its Kansas City office. According to the
application, Quintiles would pay those workers an average annual
salary of $62,800. The total annual payroll for the new workers
would be about $33.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   According to the information submitted to the state, Quintiles
said it would add the 532 workers between 1999 and 2002. Quintiles
said it would add 143 workers in 1999, 120 in 2000, 132 in 2001 and
137 in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The group of new workers with the highest payroll would be 173
scientists earning an average starting salary of $75,800 a year.
The lowest average starting wage would be 166 technicians earning
$34,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Quintiles' expansion of its Kansas City office would not
surprise securities analysts who follow the publicly traded
company.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Miller, an analyst for Hambrecht &AMP; Quist in San Francisco,
said: ``They've always stated that their goal was to grow this
facility (in Kansas City). It's certainly a feather in your cap to
have Quintiles with such an important presence there.''
</P>
<P>
   Quintiles is benefiting from an explosion in drug development
and drug companies hiring other firms to handle the clinical trials
of new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Miller characterized Quintiles as a trendsetter in its field.
``They've been very aggressive in acquisitions. They've been the
leader in gathering under their umbrella all kinds of
pharmaceutical services companies'' and setting up ``one-stop
shopping'' for its customers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has a big presence internationally, Miller
noted. Quintiles, for example, announced June 1 that it had
acquired Minerva Medical PLC, a clinical research organization
based in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   The Quintiles expansion is occurring amid uncertainty over
Hoechst Marion's presence in the area. Hoechst Marion's parent
company, Germany-based Hoechst AG, is completing its planned merger
with Rhone-Poulenc SA of France.
</P>
<P>
   The new company would be called Aventis, and its pharmaceutical
unit would be known as Aventis Pharma. The merger could result in
Hoechst Marion's North American headquarters being moved to
Bridgewater, N.J., where Hoechst has a big facility, or to
Collegeville, Pa., the North American headquarters for the
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer pharmaceutical unit.
</P>
<P>
   Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc have said they will complete their
merger by November. Hoechst Marion has said its manufacturing
operations will remain in Kansas City, regardless of whether the
headquarters stays here.

FLEXTIME ISSUE RESURFACES ON CAPITOL HILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At a White House reception two years ago, President
Clinton pulled Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri aside and told him
that he wanted to sign some version of his bill that would allow
hourly workers to take time off to be with their families without
losing a day's pay.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft's legislation, which he called ``flextime,''
disappeared in the political chasm that traditionally divides
business and labor issues on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, was before the school shootings in Littleton,
Colo., and elsewhere sparked a national introspection about
children.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Congress suddenly sensitive to family concerns, and
with a pivotal election year looming, the issue has new life.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue whose time has come,'' said Ashcroft, a
Republican running for re-election next year. ``There are
exclamation points added over and over again about the need for
parents and children to be together.''
</P>
<P>
   His bill, the Family Friendly Workplace Act, would enable
employees and employers to work out flexible schedules to allow
parents more time for out-of-work activities, such as doctor
appointments for their children and school activities. If the
employer agreed, the employee could choose to be paid with
time-and-a-half compensatory time for overtime in lieu of
time-and-a-half pay.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also includes provisions that would permit workers,
with their employers' approval, to work biweekly schedules, as
federal employers are allowed. They could put in as much as 80
hours over a two-week period, with a 50-hour limit for any given
week. Unused time off would be converted to cash at the end of each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft reintroduced his bill last week.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Brundage of Jefferson City, who used to work in the Missouri
attorney general's office, said she would have liked that option.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ended up quitting my job to spend more time with my family,
because there wasn't flextime where I worked,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it was a visit to the pediatrician, or a Mother's Day
program at her child's day-care center, Brundage said she kept
having to use vacation time or to take time off without pay just to
be with her children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very important for me to be with my family, so we took
a financial hit, and I quit,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But organized labor strongly opposes the issue. They argue that
it is a threat to the 40-hour workweek.
</P>
<P>
   Some workers, like John M. Franiuk, a machinist from Tonganoxie,
Kan., who works at the Trans World Airlines overhaul base, said
they just do not trust employers to honor commitments they would
make under the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going to happen,'' Franiuk said, ``is there are
employers who will say, `Oh, yeah, I owe you 12 hours time off, but
you can only take that in two-hour increments, and only in Tuesdays
and Thursdays, unless it's the third week of month.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft's bill died two years ago, despite White House
interest, because pro-labor Democrats, such as Sen. Edward Kennedy
of Massachusetts, filibustered the issue. It never reached a vote.
</P>
<P>
   The political divisions remain unchanged: Business still likes
the idea, and labor still hates it.
</P>
<P>
   If it is to have any chance at passage, it could be because
Republicans may attempt to link its fate to an issue that their
business supporters largely despise and that labor covets _ raising
the minimum wage, which now stands at $5.15 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats maneuvered a two-step, 90-cent increase in the
politically charged congressional debates of the 1996 presidential
campaign. Supporters this year hope to raise it by another dollar.
House Republican leaders, acknowledging the political punch that
opposing a wage increase could carry, have already conceded that
the increase may pass.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Manley, a spokesman for Kennedy, the expected sponsor of a
minimum-wage increase, dismissed the idea of linking it to
flextime. Calling Ashcroft's proposal a ``labor-bashing poison
pill,'' Manley said: ``That's a nonstarter. I can predict it would
meet with opposition on the Senate floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Taylor, a congressional lobbyist for the AFL-CIO, said she
had not even heard the idea being talked about.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, even the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a strong
backer of flextime, is not keen on using the minimum wage to defang
Democratic opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are opposed, too,'' said Michael Bartlett, manager of
labor-law policy for the chamber. ``We are not in the business of
negotiating it.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, however: ``That is not a universally held position
among all employers. Where that will lead everyone remains to be
seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft also kept the door open. He did not rule out linking
the two issues but said the possibility was ``too hypothetical.''
He noted, though, that he supported a minimum-wage increase when he
was Missouri governor.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over both issues, however, is certain to reflect the
political mood and be a harbinger of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Alston, executive director of the centrist Democratic
Leadership Council, said: ``I think the balance of family and work
is going to increasingly become a cutting-edge issue in American
politics.''

MILOSEVIC TAKES MEASURES TO RESTRICT DEMONSTRATIONS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ The Yugoslav Parliament is expected to
meet on Thursday to lift the state of wartime emergency, but it
will also retain certain restrictions, passing them into law, to
deal with expected demonstrations by opposition parties, Yugoslav
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under emergency decrees issued on March 24, the first day of the
NATO bombings, government censorship was imposed on all media, men
of military age were forbidden to leave the country, demonstrations
were banned without prior permission and the police were given
sweeping powers of search and arrest to deal with potential spies
and war profiteers.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the need to ``reconstruct the country,'' the officials
said certain restrictions would be retained. The officials would
not specify them, but there has already been a government demand,
for example, that all radio and television stations continue to
broadcast authorized state news programs.
</P>
<P>
   The new laws, the official Tanjug news agency said Tuesday,
would ``create conditions'' for reconstructing the country.
Already, state television is running upbeat advertisements urging
people to unite to rebuild Yugoslavia's bridges and factories.
</P>
<P>
   An umbrella group of democratic opposition parties, the Alliance
for Change, has called for demonstrations this Saturday in central
Serbian towns like Kraljevo and Cacak, which is run by the
opposition. But the alliance is already having trouble maintaining
its unity.
</P>
<P>
   A key member of the alliance, Democratic Party leader Zoran
Djindjic, said Tuesday in London that the Yugoslav president,
Slobodan Milosevic, would survive for a time, but be ousted within
a year.
</P>
<P>
   The post-war problems of Yugoslavia ``will be very risky for
him,'' especially in a difficult winter, Djindjic said. ``But as an
opposition we must do something. It will not be automatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic urged peaceful protest, saying: ``Dictators like
violence. If you use violence against dictators they are happy. You
must undermine them by supporting positive democratic forces. Not
by creating conflict. Milosevic is good in conflicts.''
</P>
<P>
   And he urged Western governments to aid Serbia's cities directly
in reconstruction, bypassing the central government of Milosevic,
who has been indicted as a war criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic has been denounced in the official newspaper Politika,
along with other opposition figures, for having ``applauded the
successes of NATO missiles in their blind wish to get power.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic outlasted huge street demonstrations in the winter of
1996-97 that were led by Djindjic, Vesna Pesic, and Vuk Draskovic,
the leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement. While they won local
elections in about 30 cities, including Belgrade, their coalition
split because of their personal squabbling.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic later joined Milosevic in the federal government, but
was dismissed when he criticized the political parties of the
president and his wife, Mirjana Markovic.
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance for Change is trying to bring the relatively
popular Draskovic back in to a more unified opposition, officials
say, but Draskovic is considered unpredictable and untrustworthy by
many other democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition is a fractious grouping. Just on Tuesday, Nebojsa
Covic, who split with Milosevic to form the small Democratic
Alternative party, said he could not remain within the Alliance
because of ``serious political differences in opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   While he was not more specific, Covic, like another alliance
member, former army general Vuk Obradovic, sharply criticized
Djindjic for fleeing to Montenegro during the war instead of
remaining in Belgrade. Djindjic said he feared for his life; he has
not returned to Serbia. And Covic has also criticized Obradovic for
pomposity, for ``thinking he was born to be a hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic himself ruled out cooperation with the alliance
Tuesday, saying that all together, the coalition could not win much
of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic, who has called for new interim governments in Serbia
and Yugoslavia, early elections and a free press, said: ``We are
demanding very brave, very democratic changes in the country. We
are demanding democratic elections.'' He said he was prepared ``to
light the flame of change'' in Serbia. But it was not clear that he
was willing to cooperate with anyone else to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic also criticized the alliance's call for demonstrations
on Saturday, saying that his party ``doesn't want to call people in
the streets in these difficult times.'' He asserted that ``a
political agreement among the leading parties will lead to
elections.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a shift from his earlier statements that he would not
allow Yugoslav and Serbian authorities to lead the country into
``even deeper tragedy,'' suggesting he might resort to popular
protests to prevent this. His shift Tuesday is bound to create
further doubts about the depth of his opposition to Milosevic,
whose power could be at risk from mass demonstrations now.
</P>
<P>
   Senior officials close to Milosevic say early elections, as
called for by Draskovic and the alliance, are highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the state media featured an attack on Draskovic by
the ultranationalist Radical Party leader, Vojislav Seselj, for
running a corrupt city administration in Belgrade. That is one form
of threat, especially given the business interests of the family of
Draskovic's wife, Danica.
</P>
<P>
   But Draskovic's party also depends on the support of Milosevic's
party to remain in power in Belgrade, one more way that Draskovic
can be held in line by the regime. Running Belgrade is the prime
source of money for the party, and gives Draskovic control over the
city's television station, Studio B. Draskovic does not allow other
democratic parties ready access to the station, using it to promote
himself and his party.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign that the Milosevic government will not loosen
all restrictions on the press, the formerly independent radio
station, B-92, Tuesday fired 17 of its original journalists.
</P>
<P>
   The station was taken over by the regime in April, during the
war, and ran only authorized news. The Association of Independent
Electronic Media said the official explanation for the dismissals
was that the employees had not turned up for work.
</P>
<P>
   Veran Matic, B-92's original director who runs the association,
said the former employees would press the government to restore the
station to its pre-war status. ``We shall not give up and allow the
usurpers to falsify the history of B-92,'' Matic said.
</P>
<P>
   The government, having broken up small demonstrations in
Belgrade by Serbs fleeing Kosovo on Sunday and Monday, also
sentenced two of their leaders to 30 days in jail. The Serbs were
protesting what they called their abandonment by the government,
which has urged them to return immediately to Kosovo and suggested
that they are cowards.
</P>
<P>
   Svetozar Fisic and Slobodan Karaleic, both members of the
Democratic Party in Prizren, Kosovo, were sentenced to 30 days in
prison for leading the demonstrations, which had not been approved
in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party vice president Slobodan Vuksanovic called
Tuesday for their immediate release. ``Milosevic's regime, which is
responsible for hundreds of thousands of Serb refugees from
Croatia, Bosnia and now from Kosovo, is now arresting its latest
and biggest victims,'' Vuksanovic said.
</P>
<P>
   Tellingly, Vuksanovic said: ``Milosevic is more afraid of Kosovo
Serbs on the roads across Serbia than he is of the whole Serbian
opposition.''

SPORTS COLUMN: HOUSTON'S CALMNESS IS VERY COOL 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With all the sociological deliberation about who
Latrell Sprewell really is and what these ornery and resourceful
Knicks represent, there is one alluring image this spring that will
endure more than others: Allan Houston, with the ball, shoulders
stooped, eyes narrowed, face-to-face with a defender he is
increasingly certain he is about to beat.
</P>
<P>
   For me, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad that these championship games are played so deep
into the East Coast night, because Houston and Tim Duncan seem to
have a message for all impressionable adolescents, from Miami to
Maine. It is all right to be calm, cool to be cool, which is what
the most intriguing basketball players were about when I was a
teen-ager. Without apology, I don't mind saying I wish to see more
of them now.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier. Monroe. Oscar. Houston happened to mention these
particular Hall of Famers when someone asked him Tuesday about the
lack of intermediate offensive skills that has the National
Basketball Association dissecting its game like a mouse in biology.
``Those guys lived off that midrange jump shot because nobody could
do anything about it,'' Houston said, on the subject of his Game 3
daggers that sent a variety of Spurs defenders scurrying around and
led the Knicks out of the maze and back into the series.
</P>
<P>
   There are sexier shots for the sports television highlights and
there are players, Sprewell being one of them, more evocative than
Houston. On the other hand, every time the Knicks have been about
to meet their maker, it is Allan Houston who has faced up and
looked playoff mortality square in the eye.
</P>
<P>
   If Sprewell is the American Dream, then Houston _ strictly in a
basketball parlance _ is the Knicks' urban nightmare. Go tell the
Heat, the Pacers and now the Spurs that he is soft!
</P>
<P>
   ``When I used to guard him in Detroit, he'd just run you around
screens, like Dell Curry,'' said Steve Kerr, who was mismatched
against Houston for too long Monday night. ``Now he penetrates,
posts you up. That's the natural evolution. The fact that he has
that serene look, if he doesn't play well, people are going to say
he's soft. That's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   What the heck. Why consider the traditional process of working
toward a goal when we can attach a tacky label in this typecasting
culture? The always endearing Larry Johnson, who last Sunday cursed
out an African-American public relations woman who was trying to do
her job, Tuesday compared the Knicks to ``rebellious slaves.''
Sprewell shoots an effective sneakers commercial, and that somehow
becomes the litmus test for which side of the racial divide on
which one stands. Are you down with Spree? If not, you must be old,
white, conservative, or worse.
</P>
<P>
   Love him or hate him? That was the question raised by the weekly
sports magazine cover slipped through my mail slot recently,
without a box to check for none of the above. No way to avoid the
contrived morality play, to simply say: I respect Sprewell's
energy, his game, his thoughtfulness and, above all, his right to
pursue his career. I am tired of hearing how New Yorkers, black or
white, ``relate'' to Sprewell, as if they wouldn't have screamed
profanity at him had he come to Madison Square Garden in the
uniform of the Heat.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of reporters Tuesday were asking Don Chaney, the
Knicks' assistant coach, about how Sprewell has helped bring a
welcomed, my-turn aggression out of Houston. Absolutely true,
Chaney said. But I find it more interesting that nobody asks what
effect playing alongside Houston has had on Sprewell. Has Houston's
calm exterior helped Sprewell control his temper in this difficult
transition season, made him more the team player, a better
teammate? The Spurs' Jerome Kersey isn't talking about the episode,
but he could tell us a story about how Sprewell reportedly
threatened him with a two-by-four a few years ago at Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   There is strength in cool, and the Spurs will need Duncan's
Wednesday night as they try to debunk the looming Knicks destiny
theories in Game 4. Not everyone can be like Duncan or Houston, but
no one should be called a relic from the George Mikan era for
believing the sport needs more like them, for saluting their habit
of speaking with skill.
</P>
<P>
   There is a very fine line between flamboyance and bad taste, one
that has been crossed many times this decade by the likes of L.J. I
remember him dunking against Puerto Rico in the world championships
back in 1994, then caressing himself in front of the camera as play
moved to the other end. Allan Houston, in contrast, only wants us
to remember his shots, and we shall. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mike Piazza has not worn the same pair of socks or
eaten the same meal or left for the ball park at the same time on
consecutive days during his hitting streak because he believes
superstitions are silly. Piazza has watched other players obsess
over such trivial preparation, and he has promised himself that he
would never be so compulsive.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Piazza is casual, not compulsive, about the 23-game
streak he carried into Tuesday night's Mets-Marlins game.
</P>
<P>
   When Piazza was asked about a streak that started in Pittsburgh
on May 25, he might as well have interspersed his comments with
yawns. He insisted he has never measured his accomplishments by how
many games in a row he gets a hit, and besides, 23 might be a
career high, but it was premature to get excited. Piazza was more
animated about discussing an Iron Maiden compact disc he received
in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say if it ends tonight,'' Piazza said before he
batted Tuesday night, ``I won't have any problem getting to
sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Piazza lacks the kind of speed that comes in handy to
leg out infield hits, his performance was especially imposing. And
in addition to his offense, he handles the most demanding defensive
position on the field: catcher.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Tuesday night's series opener with Florida at Shea
Stadium, Piazza was 35 for 98, with 7 homers, 9 doubles and 17 runs
batted in during the streak and had raised his batting average a
modest 25 points to .327.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Piazza's nonchalance about his streak, he did know that
Benito Santiago has the major league record for consecutive games
with a hit by a catcher. When told that Santiago hit in 34 straight
with San Diego in 1987, Piazza remembered that Santiago set the
record in his rookie season.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Alomar Jr., who hit in 30 straight in 1997 with Cleveland,
is the only other catcher to reach the 30-game mark. Hubie Brooks
set the Mets' record of 24 in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did Pete Rose have, 44?'' asked Piazza, obviously agog
over that achievement, which came in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Valentine rested Piazza once during the streak,
against the Reds in Cincinnati nine days ago, and said he would
probably rest him again soon. Valentine could face a delicate
situation if he rests the catcher and then needs to use him as a
pinch-hitter late in a game.
</P>
<P>
   When Valentine asked Piazza about such a scenario, which would
put the streak in jeopardy because Piazza might only get one time
at the plate, Piazza told Valentine not to hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I take a day off and the game is on the line and I have to
hit, what the heck,'' said Piazza. ``It's not like I'm not going to
hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine evoked Joe DiMaggio's majestic 56-game hitting streak
by saying, ``I daresay, before he gets to 57, he's going to have a
few days off.''
</P>
<P>
   But Valentine obviously understands how difficult it is for a
catcher to hit safely in so many games. Piazza came into the season
as a .333 career hitter, so this is not a mirage. Still, it is much
easier to stand in right field for nine innings and strive for one
hit a game than it is to endure foul pitches off the fingers and
flash signs for 150 pitches and pursue a hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a pretty impressive character,'' said Valentine. ``I
think it's more impressive when you play one of the more difficult
defensive positions and you have to maintain both sides of the ball
to a high degree of excellence.''
</P>
<P>
   As Piazza fiddled with the Iron Maiden compact disc yesterday
and gushed about its three guitarists, he grudgingly admitted that
he might take the streak more seriously if he closed within a few
games of Santiago's record. Until then, Piazza will keep changing
his socks, eating whatever he wants and leaving for the ball park
whenever he wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, a hitting streak is not really one of those things that
you worry about,'' said Piazza. ``I haven't done that at any point
in my career. It's kind of cool. It's a nice little footnote.''

BUSH DENOUNCES GORE AS WASHINGTON INSIDER AT GOP FUND-RAISER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush huddled with
congressional Republicans on Tuesday, then milked a ballroom packed
with lobbyists out of an estimated $2 million for his presidential
campaign treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Before his back-slapping foray through Washington, the GOP
front-runner visited Richmond, Va., where he held another
fund-raiser and denounced Vice President Al Gore as a Washington
insider.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a Washington, D.C., person,'' Bush said of the vice
president, the current front-runner for the Democratic presidential
nomination. ``He thinks Washington has got all the answers. I
don't. I believe the answers are found in our communities.''
</P>
<P>
   When he reached Washington, Bush met behind closed doors at the
Capitol with 32 Republican senators, then later with more than 100
House members. When he emerged, he promised to stand with the GOP
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to bash Republican members of Congress,'' Bush
told reporters, dismissing suggestions that the GOP opposition to
stronger gun control might hurt his effort to win the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really pleased with the support I've received inside this
building,'' Bush said. ``I believe I'm going to be here to work
with them for a better tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's fund-raisers, Bush outlined his broad campaign
themes, pledging to show compassion for the disadvantaged,
strengthen the military, cut taxes, raise educational standards,
remove trade barriers and lead with integrity.
</P>
<P>
   The two events, both low-budget affairs, were Bush's ninth and
10th in two weeks. By the end of the month, he will have held 26
fund-raisers across the country as he tries to cement his GOP
front-runner position, not only with endorsements and opinion
polls, but in money.
</P>
<P>
   Aides predicted that by June 30, Bush's campaign treasury could
top $20 million, well ahead of his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question he is sucking all the oxygen out of the
room,'' said Bill Paxon, a former Republican congressman from New
York and now a lobbyist with the Akin, Gump law firm.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign ``seems to be pretty good at raising money,''
said Howard Opinsky, campaign spokesman for Sen. John McCain,
another Republican presidential hopeful. ``Raising money does not
guarantee you the nomination,'' Opinsky said. ``If money alone
makes you the nominee, then (publisher and GOP candidate) Steve
Forbes would be president.''
</P>
<P>
   Any concern that Bush's compassionate conservative message and
his repeated knocks on Washington politics would hurt him in the
nation's capital were dispelled Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,000 people crowded into the ballroom of the
Washington Hilton, where they dined on standard Bush campaign fare
_ hot dogs, popcorn and cookies served from a buffet. There were no
waiters, no tables, no chairs. The liquor was free for those who
paid $1,000 to get in. The room swam with mostly white faces,
well-coiffed hair and summer-weight navy and gray suits.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip Morrison, a Washington tax lawyer and former Treasury
Department official under President Bush, said it was the largest
crowd he had seen at the hotel. ``The night Ronald Reagan was
elected, there weren't this many people in this room,'' Morrison
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the candidate was dazzled. ``I am honored with this huge
turnout, and I'm grateful you are on my team,'' Bush said,
</P>
<P>
   Not even Bush's father, who spent almost 25 years as a
Washington insider, raised as much money in a single evening in the
capital when he ran for president in 1988 or for re-election in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   While in Richmond, Bush and wife, Laura, visited a city library
to tout reading programs and present the library with a copy of
``Hank the Cowdog,'' a children's book. Later, he spoke to a crowd
of supporters who donated about $350,000 to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Bush heads to Pennsylvania for fund-raisers and
campaign stops in Bethlehem, Philadelphia, Harrisburg and
Pittsburgh. then to Michigan and Florida. Next week, he's scheduled
for seven fund-raisers amid campaigning in California before flying
back to Austin, the capital of Texas, for another fund-raiser.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush was warmly embraced by
Washington's Republican establishment Tuesday as he swept from a
Capitol sit-down with senators to a meeting with about 100 members
of the House majority and finally to a glittering fund-raiser
attended by a veritable who's who of Republican power brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Eager for presidential coattails in 2000, congressional
Republicans were virtually swooning over the Texan who has quickly
become his party's presumed front-runner and unquestioned
fund-raising leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just look in his eyes,'' said Rep. Zach Wamp, R-Tenn.,
``and you can feel that he's prepared to serve.'' Rep. Jennifer
Dunn, R-Wash., said, ``He's really got the magic.'' And Sen. Kay
Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, who escorted the governor into the
midday meeting with senators, said, ``He has an openness.''
</P>
<P>
   The day was a tricky balancing act for Bush, adding to an air of
his inevitability as the party's presidential nominee but also
complicating his effort to portray himself as a Washington
outsider. Even as he collected $2 million at a reception of
Washington political strategists and lobbyists Tuesday night, he
took several swipes at the capital's bitter divisiveness, hours
after he had assured Republican lawmakers that he would not run
against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many across this land see Washington, and they don't like what
they see,'' Bush said. ``They see people more worried about who
takes the credit and who gets the blame than who gets results. The
purpose of politics is not to embarrass your opponents. It is to
advance your ideals, to make a difference, to make America a better
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   He drew one of his biggest ovations when he assured the crowd
that he did not make decisions on the basis of the latest public
opinion polls. ``It's time that the most important job in
Washington be the president,'' he said, ``not the president's
pollster.''
</P>
<P>
   This was Bush's first presidential-campaign fund-raiser in
Washington, and, as is customary at his fund-raising events, the
overhead was minimal. Tickets cost $1,000 each, but there were no
seats or tables for the guests, who munched on hot dogs, brownies
and cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, on his visit to the Capitol, Bush was spared
the one photo opportunity that Democrats so dearly wanted to see.
There was no tableau of the governor with a fellow Texas
Republican, Rep. Tom DeLay, the fiery House majority whip, who in
recent days has blamed everything from day care to contraception
for youth violence and complained that the government ``has decided
that schools cannot give kids the choice of learning about
creationism and evolution and then choosing what they believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., who is both DeLay's chief deputy whip and
Bush's point man in the House, said DeLay and the other senior
Republican leaders had been too busy with their weekly Tuesday
meeting to stop by the Library of Congress with 100 other House
Republicans to hear Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The governor assured those Republicans that he would not run
against them and their record. ``I said I'd work with them _ `I
intend to hold you up as good citizens,''' he told reporters. ``I'm
not going to bash the Republican members of the Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was not concerned that his embrace by congressional
Republicans, many of whom have already endorsed him, would prove a
liability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not so sure Washington itself is popular right now,'' he
said, ``but I intend to win, and I want to be able to work with
Congressmen because there's an agenda to pass.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor called DeLay ``a friend'' and said, ``I look
forward to working with him.'' He dismissed Democrats' references
to the ``Bush-DeLay team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think attempts to tie me to DeLay and all that stuff, I
don't think it's going to hunt,'' he said. ``I think what people
want to know is: `Can he lead? Who's the best leader for
America?'''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate session on his first appearance at the Capitol,
Bush drew 36 curious senators _ including, briefly, Orrin Hatch of
Utah, who had just told reporters that he had decided to jump into
the Republican presidential race himself.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told the senators that he expected to be working with them
in 2001. By the end of their 20-minute meeting, in the Senate
Foreign Relations committee room, he had another convert: John
Chafee of Rhode Island had become the 23rd Republican senator to
move to his side.
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance in Richmond, Va., before arriving here, Bush
endorsed the House's vote last week for a measure that would allow
the Ten Commandments to be posted in public schools. ``I have no
problem with the Ten Commandments posted on the wall of every
public place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also portrayed Vice President Al Gore as the real insider.
``He's a Washington, D.C., person,'' the governor said. ``He thinks
Washington has got all the answers. I don't. I believe the answers
are found in our communities. I believe that the answers are found
in faith-based institutions, in community organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats fought back by linking Bush to the Republican
Congress that he came courting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although he hasn't said much about his ideas, when you press
him for specifics Bush follows the far-right GOP Congress more than
he leads it,'' said Roy Romer, general chairman of the Democratic
National Committee.

IN FILMS, DIRECTOR OLIVER PARKER LIKES TO SHAKE UP CONVENTIONAL
THINKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Despite, or maybe because of, his long career in the
theater, director Oliver Parker doesn't take a reverential approach
when putting stage classics on film.
</P>
<P>
   For Oscar Wilde's ``An Ideal Husband,'' a witty Victorian
melodrama, his goal was to make ``a period screwball comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker's first film was a naturalistic version of William
Shakespeare's ``Othello,'' released in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed while on a tour promoting ``An Ideal Husband,''
which opens Friday, Parker says he braced himself for criticism for
cutting away at classic texts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the inspiration behind both `Othello' and `An Ideal
Husband' has been the desire to shake up the conventional attitude
toward the works. It's almost as if they've been seen solely in
academic worlds until now. I feel more loyal to the spirit of the
original than the original words.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I feel if you don't take some angle, if you don't find a
way to win your audience over, then you have even less of a chance
at delivering the essence of the piece. Striving to make the work
accessible drives one along almost as much as making complex ideas
accessible. The trick is to retain the complexity but make the text
less fearsome for people.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his relatively scant movie-making track record, Parker
has been able to corral great talent for both of his films.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Othello,'' it was Laurence Fishburne, Kenneth Branagh and
Irene Jacob.
</P>
<P>
   For ``An Ideal Husband,'' it's Cate Blanchett, Minnie Driver,
Rupert Everett, Julianne Moore and Jeremy Northam.
</P>
<P>
   Wilde's witty comedy of manners, moral values and dark secrets
that threaten a rigidly loving marriage at the turn of the century
seems timely today. The movie was the closing feature at the Cannes
Film Festival and played earlier this month at the Seattle
International Film Festival, winning Everett the festival's best
actor award.
</P>
<P>
   Blanchett plays Gertrude Chiltern, a devoted and do-right wife
to brilliant politician Robert Chiltern (Northam). They have
everything they could hope for _ love, ambition and a future. But
when the mysterious adventuress, Mrs. Chevely (Moore), reminds Sir
Robert of a letter that could prove to be his undoing, the couple's
carefully structured, perfectly manicured world falls apart.
</P>
<P>
   It's up to hedonistic, happy bachelor and arch best friend
Arthur Goring (Everett) to come to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Parker says he felt extremely lucky to get the cast. He waxes
especially enthusiastic about rising star Blanchett, who earned a
best actress Oscar nomination this year for ``Elizabeth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's fantastic. I was so pleased to have her because her role
is essentially the toughest part. I was amazed she was even
interested in doing it, though I always felt there was something
interesting to get hold of in Gertrude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who knows the play will, I think, be prejudiced
against her because she's normally the antagonist of the piece _
she stops everyone from having a good time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were quite keen to try and craft a slightly different route
for her in our film. Wilde had, perhaps, a different agenda in his
day. He satirized the bureaucracy and the upper middle class
through her and, in a way, we tried to get behind the scenes a
little more.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the main things we needed to dramatize was the battle
going on in her head. She has been brought up to believe in strict
moral codes, and she actually has feelings that are in opposition
to them when she learns the truth about her husband. In that very
moment, we get into her head and heart. Then there is interesting
drama.''
</P>
<P>
   The director says he purposefully cast an American to play the
antagonist, Mrs. Chevely. ``She's an outsider in the play so we
wanted a non-British person to play her, and Julianne has a
wonderful way of being hard, yet vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   So, is there one character in the play that embodies Wilde's,
well, wild personal philosophy?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' says Parker. ``The obvious character who stands as a
mouthpiece for Wilde is Goring. He's the reluctant hero who has no
morality at all, but by the end has saved everybody from their
terrible troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   Goring is ``a walking paradox'' and that is the ``heart'' of
Wilde, Parker explains. ``Even the main theme of the play was about
embracing the ambiguities in oneself, in a lover and in the world
we live in _ and not to be afraid of them because that's what makes
us human; that's what makes us unique.''
</P>
<P>
   And who does he personally relate to in ``An Ideal Husband?''
</P>
<P>
   He laughs. ``The butler, of course. He's a little bit like a
director, watching people come and go and opening and closing all
those doors.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, he says, a relief to direct a comedy of manners after a
tragedy like ``Othello.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was certainly a saving on the laundry bills,'' he says,
laughing. ``There was much less blood around because everyone was
still standing at the end of this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are parallels between the two plays, of course, but in
terms of tone, it's a lot of fun to be working with Wilde's wit
infecting the filmmaking community. I think it was a terrific
atmosphere to work in, and I always believed it was crucial to the
quality of the relationships onscreen. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel if you can encourage actors to relax and enjoy their
environment, you'll get their best. I have some lovely memories of
this cast and how they started to work together as a team, despite
their different backgrounds and cultures.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker draws on a huge theater background in bringing his
directorial techniques to the screen. ``I worked in a company of
Clive Barker's,'' he says. ``I'd been an actor and also involved in
stage management, and I wrote a play about William Blake with
another actor in the company. I ended up in the director's chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been interested in aspects of it. I enjoyed acting
immensely but I realized my weakness as an actor might be my
strength as a director.''
</P>
<P>
   He's scheduled to begin working soon on a third film _ a
fictional movie about Orson Welles from a script by John Sayles.

MARKET PLACE: SALON.COM AUCTION FAILS TO ENTHUSE INTERNET
INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Salon.com, an online magazine with meager
revenue, went public with a whimper Tuesday, as investors continued
to weigh not only the value of Internet issues themselves but also
that of the institutions leading them to market.
</P>
<P>
   Clouding the new stock's performance was the unusual method used
to set the opening price, a process called a modified Dutch
auction, which allows individuals to bid on the stock before it
begins trading publicly. The tepid response suggests the market's
lack of interest in Salon. But first-day enthusiasm may have been
undermined by the auction format, which eliminates the role of
traditional underwriters of stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The stock was priced Monday night by W.R. Hambrecht &AMP; Co. of San
Francisco at $10.50 a share, at the bottom of the anticipated price
range of $10.50 to $13.50 a share, and closed Tuesday at $10.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Tuesday's initial offering by Ramp Networks got off
to a roaring start. The company's product allows multiple users in
a small office to share an Internet connection, making it an
Internet infrastructure company rather than a provider of content
for the Internet. Its stock was priced at $11 and rose 61 percent
in the first day of trading to close at $16.75.
</P>
<P>
   The managers of Salon described the mood Monday as ``jubilant''
but business-as-usual as the staff celebrated the public offering
with a pizza lunch. The company, started by former staff members of
The San Francisco Examiner, wound up the day with a market value of
$107 million, having sold 2.5 million of 10.7 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   As remarkable as the valuation may seem given Salon's losses of
$6.5 million last year on $2.9 million in revenue, the offering is
a yawner by Internet standards. In March, for example, shares of
iVillage, a women's network, rose 300 percent the first day, while
stock in the financial news company TheStreet.com exploded 216
percent on its first day of trading in May. Both stocks,
underwritten by the venerable Wall Street firm of Goldman, Sachs,
have since given back much of their gains but remain well above
their offering prices, providing tidy paper profits for insiders.
</P>
<P>
   Salon chief executive Michael O'Donnell said the first-day price
had to be put into context, and he pointed out that the Internet
media ``sector is down 27 percent since we filed'' April 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``The objective of an IPO is to get company proceeds to grow,''
he said. ``If you're looking for a quick pop today, you may be
disappointed. We have nowhere to go but up.'' O'Donnell also said
that the auction attracted long-term investors, not day traders who
would put pressure on the company for immediate returns.
</P>
<P>
   For its stock to gain ground, Salon will need more advertising
and a bigger audience. Media Metrix reported that Salon attracted a
million individual visitors in May, substantially fewer than the
3.2 million who visited iVillage.com. TheStreet.com had 783,000
visitors in April, but it also derives revenue from more than
51,000 subscribers who pay $9.95 monthly or $99.95 yearly.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell said Salon would use $5 million of the $25 million
raised Tuesday to embark on a national television, radio and print
advertising campaign. Since it began in 1995, Salon.com has spent a
mere $200,000 on marketing, though it has generated Internet buzz,
partly because of well-known writers, including Isabel Allende and
Paul Theroux, and its literary journalism and political reporting,
particularly during the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Among the pleased shareholders is David Talbot, the former
editor of arts and feature articles at The Examiner who founded
Salon. Based on holdings reported April 15, Talbot, now the editor
in chief, has stock worth $3 million, and had options to buy
102,000 additional shares.
</P>
<P>
   The largest investor, with 26 percent of the magazine, is Adobe
Ventures, a venture capital firm, whose stake is now worth $28
million. Another prominent Salon investor is television mogul
Norman Lear, whose stake is now worth $2.57 million, excluding
25,000 warrants. O'Donnell's shares, in the form of options, are
worth $1.58 million. Hambrecht requires that Salon insiders hold
shares at least 90 days after the public offering.
</P>
<P>
   The Salon offering was the second auction from Hambrecht. The
first, in April, for Ravenswood Winery was also lackluster. Those
shares, which were also priced at $10.50, closed Tuesday at
$10.625.
</P>
<P>
   In Hambrecht's auctions, investors submit bids for how many
shares they are willing to buy and at what price. At the end of the
bidding period, Hambrecht starts awarding shares to the highest
bidders. It continues down the price list until all shares are
sold. The catch is that all bidders, regardless of what they bid,
pay only the price submitted by the lowest bidder in the winning
group.
</P>
<P>
   Hambrecht president Ian Zwicker said the Dutch auction was less
expensive for the issuing company. Traditional underwriters usually
charge 7 percent of the gross on a small stock offering like
Salon's, and Hambrecht charged 5 percent, or about $1.5 million,
Zwicker said.
</P>
<P>
   But, as with Salon, the company going public may forfeit the
first day liftoff. That is' because individual investors eager to
snap up Internet issues have already bid on the stock to help set
its market value.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Pasternak, the chief executive of Knight Securities
Inc., one of the nation's largest market makers, said an auction
made sense in the era of highflying Internet stocks. Institutions
appear to be setting prices too low given the demand of individual
investors, a problem the auction can mitigate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most IPO's don't properly reflect the pricing mechanics of
individual investors correctly,'' he said. In fact, TheStreet and
iVillage could be criticized for leaving money on the table, since
investors were willing to pay well above the offering price set by
their underwriters.
</P>
<P>
   Pasternak cautioned, though, that the auction method is still
untested, given the two small issues from Hambrecht, and its
success will be determined in coming months. The next issue from
Hambrecht will be for GreatFood.com.
</P>
<P>
   At least one investor and stock analyst was optimistic about
Salon. Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology
Stockletter and manager of a technology portfolio that bought 6,000
Salon.com shares in the auction, said, ``If this trades in the
teens as I expect, it could validate this as a way to go public.'' &QL;

MICROSOFT'S FINAL WITNESS ASKED TO REBUT U.S. CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Microsoft lawyer Tuesday led the company's final
witness at its antitrust trial through the long chain of charges
that the government has thrown at Microsoft through eight months of
trial and asked him to rebut each of them.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the witness, Richard L. Schmalensee, dean of
the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and Microsoft's expert economist, agreed that there was
no substance to any of the charges.
</P>
<P>
   He asserted that the Microsoft Corp. did not hold a monopoly in
personal computer operating system software, that it faced vicious
and serious competitors charging from every direction. And he said
there were no significant barriers preventing other companies from
selling operating systems that competed with Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who is hearing the case without a
jury, had nothing to say about most of the testimony. But he grew
animated when the discussion turned to the barriers to entering the
operating system business.
</P>
<P>
   The government contends that Microsoft's operating system
monopoly is protected by what is known as the applications barrier
to entry under which software companies will spend the money to
write programs only for the dominant operating system, not for
start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   To make the case that the barrier does not exist, Schmalensee
began using an analogy involving competing grocery stores. As he
spoke, the judge was shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have trouble with the grocery story analogy,'' he said at
last. ``You have a grocery,'' and then a smaller, competing market
opens. ``So you build a mega-market, and the potential competitor
is always playing catch-up.''
</P>
<P>
   That set off a long discussion of grocery stores as an analogy
to Microsoft and operating systems, and Schmalensee found himself
talking about a mega-market that constantly adds features to stay
ahead of the competition. ``That's what competition is about,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge disagreed. ``That's a benevolent despot,'' he
said. ``A monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   As the trial nears its end _ the last day of testimony is likely
to be on Thursday _ Jackson seems quite ready to speak his mind,
perhaps even show his hand, though David Boies, the government's
lead lawyer, made the point Tuesday evening that reading too much
into a judge's remarks is dangerous. In any case, most of the
judge's remarks have not been flattering to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the day, however, a line of argument pursued by a
Microsoft lawyer, Michael Lacovara, seemed to strike a chord. He
and Schmalensee were raising the specter of competition to
Microsoft from Web-based applications _ software programs like
calendars or even spreadsheets that reside on the Web and are used
while on line. This, the two of them said, was a serious threat to
Microsoft's power.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson asked several questions about the phenomenon, including
whether anyone on the Web could get access to his Web-based
calendar. Schmalensee said access would probably require a
password.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the judge, obviously enthusiastic, said, ``The concept,
to me, sounds very attractive, and I can't understand why''
software vendors ``aren't writing applications in droves.''
</P>
<P>
   That clearly cheered Lacovara, who has said that he likes to
hear what interests the judge so he can address it. With
Schmalensee back on the stand for more discussion with Lacovara
Wednesday morning, it appeared likely that Jackson will hear a lot
more about Web-based applications.

   STADIUM-OVERRUNS (Seattle) _ The Seattle Mariners seek mediation
with the stadium district over dispute on $100 million cost
overrun. The Mariners want a piece of the excess tax revenue that
is being raised to pay off the venue, and have asked the Public
Facilities District to seek all available bond funding from King
County. The district has said that it would not ask the county for
additional funds. Mariners now charge the PFD's refusal is ``a
breach of the PFD's statutory and contractual obligations.''

   ECOMMERCE (WILLIAMSBURG, Va.) _ As Colonial Williamsburg, the

appeal and lure tourists, the 3,000 staffers operate by a new
credo: enter the 21st Century without leaving the 18th. That means
the actors who portray residents of the village now tackle
contemporary topics, like slavery and church-state relations. It
means the organization's lucrative catalog business is moving
beyond its collection of authentic furniture replicas to offer a
new line of casual, family-oriented home furnishings inspired by
colonial tastes. And increasingly it means turning to the Internet.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
NEW YORK _ The names came easily, quickly. Speaking of the lost art
of the midrange jump shot, Knicks guard Allan Houston rattled off
New York icons Walt Frazier and Earl Monroe. He spoke of Oscar
Robertson and Michael Jordan.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And now, in an era when the NBA's game has grown so ugly that
special committees are assembled to consider how to slap on some
polish, Houston is making a name for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Spurs forward Tim Duncan has risen in the West, becoming
the NBA's best player even as far as Houston's coach, Jeff Van
Gundy, is concerned. But Houston has grabbed a huge chunk of the
postseason as well and taken it for his own. He has walked onto the
league's largest stage and shone in his own quiet way.
</P>
<P>
   He hit the running, last-chance jumper that eliminated the Miami
Heat. He dominated the Indiana Pacers in the Game 6 clincher of
that series. And with the NBA Finals quickly fading from the
Knicks' reach, Houston would not allow his team to lose. In New
York's 89-81 Game 3 win over the Spurs on Monday, he matched the
best postseason scoring game of his career with 34 points and
carried the Knicks through their rough patches, much like another
shooting guard who carried his team to six championships this
decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind I've always been that, and I will continue to be
that type of player,'' Houston said. ``That's the belief I have in
myself. The farther this team goes on a consistent basis hopefully
we'll be back here again, and hopefully people will consider
that.''
</P>
<P>
   While a side-by-side comparison to Jordan would be laughable, it
is not too much to say that Houston has arrived in this postseason.
The celebrated revivals of Latrell Sprewell and Marcus Camby
notwithstanding, Houston has been the Knicks' most consistent
scorer, their most steadily improving force. Even in the
offense-challenged Finals, he scored 19 points in each of the two
games in San Antonio before his Game 3 eruption.
</P>
<P>
   In a single minute of Monday's second half at Madison Square
Garden, Houston scored seven points by nailing three consecutive
jumpers and a free throw. But immediately after that, the Knicks
missed nine consecutive shots over a span topping six minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the dry spell, the Spurs forged a tie before seeming
to have a stop on defense. But New York's Kurt Thomas dived to pick
up a loose ball and sent it to Houston, who nailed his first
3-pointer of the series at the shot-clock buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of ironic,'' he said. ``When I first got to the
league, that's all I did _ shoot 3s. Now it's like I'm feeling more
comfortable taking the ball to the basket. It felt good to finally
make one.''
</P>
<P>
   On the next possession, Houston drove the lane, drew a foul and
pushed the Knicks' lead to five, single-handedly regaining New
York's control of a game it had to win.
</P>
<P>
   By extending his game well past the soft jump shot taught to him
by his father, former Tennessee coach Wade Houston, Houston has
become almost impossible to defend. And while the NBA, despite its
declining scoring, still has players who can make an open shot,
Houston has become one of the few who can get good shots for
himself and teammates at any time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doc (Rivers, the new Orlando coach who played with the Spurs)
always told us he (Houston) was the hardest guy on the team to
guard when he was isolated,'' said R.C. Buford, a Spurs scout and
assistant coach. ``He wasn't such a prevalent option, because
Patrick (Ewing) was always there on the low blocks. There was no
place to go get a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very good on a crossover. He can step back or spin back
into his fadeaway. Now they put him on the post more than he ever
was. He's big enough to shoot over you. If he gets a little space,
it's very tough to get back to him in time. He goes away from the
double team or he can back out of a trap, then go at you when you
leave him. We'd like to play him straight and then come at him once
he gets to the paint. But he never really gets to the paint. He
takes that shot in between the start (of his drive) and the
paint.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to improving his skills, Houston has changed his
mentality. Once happy to defer to others and their talents, he now
understands and exploits his own abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's finally finding out how good he is,'' said Brendan
Malone, a Knicks assistant coach who also was with Houston for two
of the player's three seasons in Detroit. ``In Game 6 of the
Indiana series, he said, `This is my night, and it's going to
happen.' He continued to say that throughout the game. That was the
game that I think was his breakthrough game in a big situation.
(Monday) night, he was having a good time. He was taking the ball
to the hole, posting up, hitting the open shots. You could see his
confidence build.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played a subordinate role when he first came here with
Patrick Ewing, in Detroit with Grant Hill. Right now, he's starting
to emerge. You're going to see him blossom as a super offensive
player.''
</P>
<P>
   It is telling, however, that Houston wants to be more than that.
He was always confident in his abilities, as evidenced by his
decision to sign with the Knicks as a free agent and assume the
pressure that comes with that. But now he wants to dominate and
might not even settle for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at a guy like Michael, even a guy like Spree, the
great players and the great scorers in this league. They're not
happy with 20 points,'' Houston said. ``If they have a great start,
they want to keep it going.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in my career I was little unselfish. I think you can do
both. That's what I've learned stay aggressive and stay hungry for
48 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this position, it's saturated. This position, you've got
the Steve Smiths, the J.R. Riders, the Reggie Millers. You can go
down the line. Even teams that are not great playoff teams have a
shooting guard. That's our job, to put the ball in the basket. The
first part of the position is shooting. That's what we do best. I
try to get to the point where people say, `He doesn't have any
weaknesses.' That's my goal. I try to be an all-around player.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent results would suggest he is succeeding and has taken his
game well beyond good.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between good and great in this league is two
things: consistency _ who can do it often _ and who can do it
late,'' Van Gundy said. ``That's what it comes down to. I think
Allan is doing it more consistently, and he's doing it late in
games.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's doing it on the greatest stage, giving him a sudden
chance to join the legendary names he dropped as easily as open
18-footers.

 &HT;    Houston scores 34 as Knicks climb back in NBA Finals
 &HT;    By Tom D'Angelo
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Put the brooms away, San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks are back in the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   With their season seemingly fading, New York battled back with a
89-81 victory Monday in Game3, breaking the Spurs' 12-game playoff
winning streak and keeping alive their bid for another stunning
post-season upset.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks rode a hot Allan Houston, who scored a
career-playoff-high 34 points and held off a late Spurs rally, to
crush the hopes of the Spurs' fans who were chanting, ``Sweep!
Sweep! Sweep!'' at the end of Game2.
</P>
<P>
   Latrell Sprewell had 24 points. Houston and Sprewell combined to
shoot 19-of-46.
</P>
<P>
   The undermanned Knicks _ who never trailed _ can tie the series
in Game4 Wednesday at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio cut a 10-point deficit to four with 3:11 to play but
consecutive baskets by Houston and Marcus Camby, who suffered
through one of his worst playoff games after making his first start
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks, who scored 32 points total in the fourth quarter of
the first two games, had 24 Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs, who lost on the road for the first time in the
playoffs, were led by David Robinson's 25 points. Tim Duncan had 20
points, but was scoreless in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Camby was the Knicks' energizer off the bench, but the move to
start him backfired. Camby, who has been in foul trouble throughout
the season coming off the bench, picked up his second midway
through the first quarter, both against Robinson. He was replaced
by Kurt Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   A frustrated Camby then picked up two fouls in the first 1 1/2
minutes of the third quarter, the first when he and Robinson pushed
and shoved with each being slapped with a foul and technical.
Seconds later, Camby fouled Robinson in the lane and went to bench
with no points and four fouls in 10 minutes. He fouled out with
five points.
</P>
<P>
   Camby had one highlight-reel play, a dunk in which he rose high
and shoved home a Houston miss. The play came early in the fourth
quarter and gave the Knicks a 69-62 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later he committed his fifth foul.
</P>
<P>
   Camby started at center, replacing Chris Dudley. Knicks coach
Jeff Van Gundy gave no thought to removing point guard Charlie Ward
instead, which would have made the Knicks bigger all around.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a radical change, but with any change you have to
do it because you believe in it, not because there's been a clamor
for it,'' Van Gundy said. ``We got here playing one way. Our style
is not going to change.''
</P>
<P>
   That style had not been nearly good enough to beat the Spurs,
whose two victories in San Antonio were easier than the scores
indicated.
</P>
<P>
   But New York finally resembled the team that upset Miami,
Atlanta and Indiana in the conference playoffs, playing its best
quarter of the Finals in the first Monday. Behind Houston, the
Knicks built a 14-point lead before Antonio Daniels' three-pointer
in the final second cut New York's lead to 32-21. Daniels, who
played four minutes in the first two games, had eight points in the
first 16 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   New York moved the ball, exploited mismatches in the backcourt
after Mario Elie left with two fouls, and made its shots. The
Knicks' six assists in the quarter were two less than they had in
all of Game 2.

UNIVERSAL TAKES ON DISNEY WITH ITS HIGH-TECH ISLANDS OF ADVENTURE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Photos available on NYT database) 
 
(Eds.: Also see Central-Florida-Islands, Central-Florida-Disney,
Central-Florida-Citywalk and Central-Florida-Parks) 
 
By SYD KEARNEY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Here's a news flash for Disney: You may never be
outdone by Universal, but you've definitely been ``out-funned.''
</P>
<P>
   Universal Islands of Adventure, which celebrated its grand
opening Memorial Day weekend, delivers more thrills, chills and
excitement than the combined efforts of Walt Disney World's four
themed parks.
</P>
<P>
   And Islands is just what the doctor, or should we say the teens,
ordered for central Florida. While the Magic Kingdom and the
Muppets kept the tots happy, and Mom and Pop lapped up the
educational hooey of Epcot, teens vacationing here previously were
relegated to eye rolling and making do with archaic rides such as
Space Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   No longer.
</P>
<P>
   With outstanding roller coasters, a revolutionary
three-dimensional thrill ride and a menacingly named Doctor Doom's
Fearfall, Islands of Adventure is targeting a young, sophisticated
audience.
</P>
<P>
   But it isn't ignoring the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   For the wee ones, there is Seuss Landing, a 10-acre tribute to
the memorable creations of Theodore Geisel.
</P>
<P>
   And for parents ... well, there's the entire park.
</P>
<P>
   Islands of Adventure is just one giant tip o' the hat to baby
boomers. Every corner of the 110-acre park is filled with feel-good
icons such as Popeye, the Cat in the Hat, Sinbad, Dudley Do-Right
and Spider-Man.
</P>
<P>
   The park is designed around five themed ``islands'' with the
adventure beginning at the exotic Port of Entry, a little chunk of
Marrakech dusted off for Orlando. Moving clockwise around the port,
the ``islands'' are Marvel Super Hero Island, Toon Lagoon, Jurassic
Park, the Lost Continent and Seuss Landing.
</P>
<P>
   From the park's entry, the most stunning sight is Jurassic Park.
Film fans will have a sense of deja vu as they look across the lake
at Universal's faithful re-creation of the building from the Steven
Spielberg blockbuster movie.
</P>
<P>
   Jurassic Park includes several interesting attractions such as
the Discovery Center, where you can watch a raptor hatch, and the
Triceratops Encounter, where you can pet a dinosaur. The area's
thrill ride, Jurassic Park River Adventure, also offers some close
encounters as riders must outrace a tyrannosaurus rex and survive
an 85-foot plunge into the water.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced animatronic technology makes these exhibits work. In
the intimately scaled Triceratops Encounter, a very real-looking,
24-foot dinosaur breathes, blinks, twitches and sneezes.
</P>
<P>
   Don't even think of trying the Pteranodon Flyers. This
slow-loading ride, which features a pair of chairs gliding over the
island, frequently requires two-hour waits for 80 seconds of air
time.
</P>
<P>
   But Universal anticipated long waits for star attractions such
as the Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man and Dueling Dragons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Queues are an opportunity for storytelling,'' explains Phil
Hettema, Universal's senior vice president for attraction
development. ``We didn't just build rides, we crafted legends.''
</P>
<P>
   Legends? That's a stretch. But Dueling Dragons certainly may
have one of the more satisfying queues in any theme park.
</P>
<P>
   Guests must wend their way through an enchanted forest, then
snake through Merlinwood Castle before boarding the roller
coasters. Along the way, would-be riders learn the tale of the Fire
Dragon and the Ice Dragon, two evil serpents each bent on the
other's destruction. The eerily lighted castle is filled with
ghoulish decor, including the sculls and wrecked bodies of fallen
knights.
</P>
<P>
   The ride is as satisfying as the wait. The coasters both begin
with a 125-foot drop and then separate into a tangle of tracks that
features five inversions and several near-collisions. Reaching
speeds of up to 60 mph, Fire Dragon dangles riders' legs a mere 12
inches from riders on the Ice Dragon.
</P>
<P>
   The Lost Continent also is home to arguably the most amazing
special-effects show produced by a theme park.
</P>
<P>
   Poseidon's Fury: Escape From the Lost City begins rather
innocuously. The Keeper, portrayed by an actor, tells guests the
story of evil water god Poseidon and his enemy, Zeus. Later the
audience is ``captured'' by Poseidon and, here's the awesome part,
forced to walk through a 42-foot water vortex. This glasses-fogging
effect is created with more than 17,000 gallons of water. The show
climaxes with a battle that features 25-foot fireballs and
drenching explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Drenching also is popular on Toon Lagoon, a colorful tribute to
the funny papers. This ``island'' is home to Dudley Do-Right's
Ripsaw Falls, a wild flume ride, and Popeye &AMP; Bluto's Bilge-Rat
Barges, a white-water raft ride.
</P>
<P>
   The best part of Toon Lagoon, however, isn't the rides. That
distinction belongs to the smile-inducing cartoon characters.
Nearly 80 characters from five decades of Sunday funnies are
depicted life-size here. A deli is dedicated to Dagwood; an
ice-cream parlor pays tribute to weight-conscious Cathy; and a
hamburger cafe is named for Popeye pal Wimpy.
</P>
<P>
   (Warning: We tried the line ``I will gladly pay you on Tuesday
for a hamburger today.'' It doesn't work.)
</P>
<P>
   Among other characters that pop up along Comic Strip Lane are
Beetle Bailey, Pogo, the kids from Family Circus and Hagar the
Horrible. Don't miss WossaMotta U., a shop with everything
Bullwinkle.
</P>
<P>
   Where Toon Lagoon is a garish splash of primary colors, Seuss
Landing is an inviting oasis of pastels.
</P>
<P>
   The characters and attractions here are taken from Geisel's
popular children's books. The elaborate Caro-Seuss-el features
seven whimsical characters including elephant-birds from ``Horton
Hatches an Egg'' and ``AquaMop Tops'' from ``One Fish Two Fish Red
Fish Blue Fish.''
</P>
<P>
   The latter book also is the inspiration for a ride of the same
name. Guests ride in red and blue fish that go around and up and
down. The trick is to listen closely to the ride's musical rhyme,
which tells riders when to fly high and when to go low. Riders that
don't listen to the lyrics get drenched by squirting fish.
</P>
<P>
   The Cat in the Hat ride is based on Geisel's most famous book.
Participants ride on couches for this fun attraction that retells
the visitors-run-amok story with more than 130 special effects and
animatronic characters.
</P>
<P>
   While Seuss Landing is all sweetness, Marvel Super Hero Island
has an edge. It is a macho attraction with three thrilling rides
and a teen-magnet arcade.
</P>
<P>
   While Doctor Doom's Fearfall, with its twin 200-foot towers,
will be familiar to theme park fans, even roller-coaster
aficionados are in for a surprise on the Incredible Hulk Coaster.
</P>
<P>
   The train ascends, as most coasters do, with a slow
clackity-clack up a steep track, but midway up, the train
accelerates as if it had been blasted from a cannon. There's no
slow anticipation of the first drop; riders go from zero to 40 mph
in two seconds. With seven rollovers, two underground dips and many
moments of weightlessness, the Hulk experience seems much longer
than its two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   We've saved the best for last.
</P>
<P>
   The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man is a ride for the next
millennium. It combines a motion-simulator car that moves along a
track with special effects and the latest 3-D film technology.
</P>
<P>
   Guests are along for the ride as Spider-Man battles bad guys
determined to steal the Statue of Liberty. Marvelous-looking scenes
unfold with the story, and encounters with villains usually include
a sensory effect such as heat or water. The ride climaxes in a
400-foot ``drop'' into darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Spider-Man is no Mickey Mouse attraction.

 &HT;    Education bill's passage is Laura Bush's first big move
 &HT;    By A. Phillips Brooks
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ On a humid day in April, the spotlight, as
usual, was on Gov. George W. Bush. Bush was playing host to the
mayor of New York, the latest in a procession of Republicans who
had come to the Governor's Mansion to express support for a Bush
presidential candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Away from the throng of reporters, Texas first lady Laura Bush
was quietly savoring a political victory of her own.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bush's education adviser had just informed her that key
lawmakers were lined up in support of her bill to create reading
readiness programs for preschoolers and to enhance the federal Head
Start education programs. Best of all, the legislators were ready
to ante up $17 million for the programs, $15 million more than she
had sought.
</P>
<P>
   Initiating her own legislation was a bold step that put
substance to her style in pushing reading.
</P>
<P>
   The passage of Senate Bill 955 _ signed into law last week by
the governor _ marks the first time Laura Bush pursued her own
legislative agenda. That she endorsed her husband's legislative
initiatives in 1995 and 1997 but claimed none as her own until now,
signals Laura Bush's movement onto the national political stage and
the agenda she intends to tackle if she becomes first lady in a
Bush White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing the making of a political spouse who wishes to
use that position to make a contribution,'' said Bruce Buchanan, a
University of Texas government professor. ``We are seeing her move
in staking out an area of independent activity.'' Laura Bush, 52,
said that if her husband is elected president, she will use her
position to advance other early-childhood education initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``If George is elected _ this is what I've always been
interested in, really,'' she said in an interview with the Austin
American-Statesman. ``That was my career as a teacher and
librarian.''
</P>
<P>
   The niche she is carving out focuses on equipping preschoolers
with the skills they need to prepare for reading, writing and other
areas of learning by the time they enter kindergarten. It
complements her husband's focus on reading in elementary grades and
is a safe bet politically, Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   But it is an ambitious step as those of Texas first ladies go.
Bush, like other first ladies before her, has promoted her cause of
choice _ reading. The former school librarian has raised about
$600,000 for Texas public libraries and is a sponsor of the Texas
Book Festival. But in venturing into the legislative process, she
has gone where no Texas governors' wives have gone.
</P>
<P>
   Former first lady Rita Clements restored the Governor's Mansion
and Main Streets across rural Texas. She promoted volunteerism,
education, historic preservation and tourism. She hit the campaign
trail with husband Bill Clements and was an active member of the
Republican Party before she married him. But as first lady, she
avoided direct involvement in the legislative process _ viewed
largely as men's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not lobby on my own or sponsor any legislation,'' said
Rita Clements, who had two stints in the Governor's Mansion, the
last ending in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Nell Connally, wife of former Gov. John Connally, who served
from 1963 to 1969, said she ``tended to the things that were my
duty,'' such as homemaking and gardening. Connally used her
interest in gardening to refurbish the mansion grounds. In her day,
she said, a governor's wife would be seen as ``getting in where she
shouldn't get in'' if she directly engaged in getting bills passed
.
</P>
<P>
   Ready to Read Under Senate Bill 955, the education commissioner
will award $2 million in grants, starting this fall, for the Ready
to Read Initiative. Public and private early-education programs
would be eligible for the grants, which could be used for a variety
of purposes, such as training or hiring reading instructors or
buying books.
</P>
<P>
   The reading readiness program is modeled on the Dallas-based
Margaret Cone Head Start Center, a collaboration of the Texas
Instruments Foundation and Head Start of Greater Dallas. Bush said
her intense interest in working with children from impoverished or
low-income families stems from her earlier years as a teacher in
predominantly minority Kennedy Elementary School in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Cone center children were scoring in the 75th to
80th percentile on national achievement exams by the time they
graduated from the two-year program. Those same children had scored
in the bottom 1 percent when they entered.
</P>
<P>
   On their visit to the Cone center in February, Laura Bush and
Rep. Sherri Greenberg, D-Austin, who carried Bush's bill, liked
what they saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very language-rich curriculum,'' Bush said. ``I said
my name was Laura, and one little boy said 'Oh, I have your same
letter _ L.' His name was Larry and he could immediately see he had
the same letter.''
</P>
<P>
   Another part of the bill aims to strengthen the educational
component of federally financed Head Start program, which targets
poor children. Head Start has largely focused on children's
nutritional needs and social development. The new money would go to
preparing preschoolers for the academic learning rigors of
elementary school and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation gives Texas children the best possible start
for a lifetime of learning,'' Laura Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   She also worked to revamp a parenting magazine published by the
state Department of Health, a proposal that was included in the
agency's budget.
</P>
<P>
   A low profile
</P>
<P>
   Bush kept a low profile during the session. She never testified
on the bill. Instead, she won support of key lawmakers, including
influential Democrat Paul Sadler, chairman of the House Public
Education Committee, with a pre-legislative conference on
early-childhood development.
</P>
<P>
   At the conference last December, Bush brought together some of
the nation's top experts on early-childhood development,
highlighting research that showed the importance of providing
language and reading skills to children before they start school.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were experts who confirmed the importance of early
education in brain development of very young children,'' said
Greenberg, who attended the conference. ``From there, myself, Mrs.
Bush and the governor's office continued to work together on
this.''
</P>
<P>
   The alliance with House Democrats proved key to passage of
Bush's legislation. It was Sadler who championed the Head Start
program, and his own pre-kindergarten programs, when Republican
senators moved to eliminate their funding to expand tax cuts that
were a key part of Gov. Bush's legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler's brinkmanship yielded $15 million for Head Start _and
about $200 million for pre-kindergarten and kindergarten programs _
included in a bill he co-authored.
</P>
<P>
   Now, early education programs are finding their way into the
presidential campaign. Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic
front-runner, announced early-childhood initiatives last week. And
Gov. Bush _ who skirted the issue during the legislative session
that ended May 31 _ is now talking in campaign speeches about
revamping Head Start to include phonics.
</P>
<P>
   If Gov. Bush wins the presidency, will Laura Bush promote
early-childhood education the way her famous mother-in-law, former
first lady Barbara Bush, promoted literacy?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I think definitely that I would, and George also is very
interested in paying attention to Head Start,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Would she take a more political role, such as trying to persuade
Congress to pass such education? ``We'll see,'' she said.

NEW YORK IS ALLAN'S TOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Madison Square Garden, always crawling with big names, rolled
out a celebrity lineup that could skunk the Betty Ford Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   It was Monday night, the gritty Knicks were in a Love-2 ditch,
and chatter about Must-Sweep TV was gaining momentum. The lingering
forecast was a shower of respectful applause and street clothes for
Patrick Ewing, who when he's healthy seems old enough to start
walking sideways any day now. Latrell Sprewell had returned from
Texas with an exhausted right elbow and a bill from the Alamodome
for a fortune in orange paint.
</P>
<P>
   Bar-stool strategists were even irritated with tragically heroic
Coach Jeff Van Gundy, who on a good day looks like actor Bronson
Pinchot after two years in an Istanbul slammer. Willis Reed was
still retired. Chris Dudley still wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Van Gundy couldn't be any more undermanned than the review
list for Oprah's Book Club.
</P>
<P>
   So how did he and New York reach San Antonio and get back in
this NBA Finals series?
</P>
<P>
   They went through Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Of course we're referring to Knicks shooting guard Allan
Houston, whose 34-point performance in Game 3 cut the Spurs' lead
in half, inspired a group exhale at NBC and bridged a potential
soccer-as-a-second-sport gap between the Finals and next
Wednesday's NBA Draft.
</P>
<P>
   If you've been paying attention, you already may be aware that
Houston is the Knick who doesn't quite fit the profile. He's the
Saint Knick. The Knick whose mug shot has not been shot in profile.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the nasty Knicks are entertaining in the same way it used
to be entertaining to loiter on a train trestle. Bad actors? Think
of the original casting call for ``Friends.''
</P>
<P>
   But Houston is an exception.
</P>
<P>
   Houston hasn't leaned on obscenity while sassing the sporting
press, as has Larry Johnson, the ex-UNLV sluggo whose nickname can
be upgraded to ``MGM Grandmama.'' He didn't pocket money from
agents to rewrite his school's record book, as Marcus Camby was
accused of doing while performing for UMass. He wasn't the subject
of a voodoo curse, as was ex-Spur David Wingate after an allegation
of rape.
</P>
<P>
   He seems to be slightly more under control than teammate Kurt
Thomas, whose tango with Dennis Rodman at the Forum earned The Worm
a media endorsement for a merit badge.
</P>
<P>
   And, as much as he might want to, he'd never wrap his hands
around P.J. Carlesimo's neck.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, while flirting with Lone Star blasphemy, it should be
noted that Houston seems to belong in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   But the Spurs may have more ``good guys'' than they can use. It
took the acquisition of tough guy Mario Elie, a native New Yorker,
to convince them to make beard stubble part of their uniform.
Thanks to Mario, they now realize ``swagger'' is not the name of a
discredited evangelist.
</P>
<P>
   Their ranking go-to good guy is David Robinson, who slam-dunked
the SAT on his way to Annapolis. Teammate Tim Duncan, the people's
choice for MVP, deserved big-brain props after writing a lively
column for USA Today following the 1997 NBA Draft.
</P>
<P>
   Even their low-post caddy, Will Perdue, attended Vanderbilt.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the Knicks aren't exactly knuckleheads. Dudley, for example,
attended Yale. And Camby, of course, is the pride of UMass, which,
um, can be found in the same state as Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   For the sake of the series, let's hope Houston finds his way
back to the state of stardom.
</P>
<P>
   As a reluctant star in New York, his only crime has been failing
to realize how good he can be.
</P>
<P>
   Is he Hall of Fame timbre, as NBA history requires in its
championship heroes? Nah. But we're not talking about the Knicks
actually winning this series. This is America; it simply wants to
be entertained.
</P>
<P>
   However, for the Knicks to keep it interesting, even push the
series back to Texas, Houston must continue punishing Elie. Yeah,
Elie's a willing defender, but he's not enough of an offensive
threat to make Houston work on defense. And Spurs coach Gregg
Popovich could continue promoting any theatrical value the series
may possess by allowing Steve Kerr to match up with Houston in a
reprisal of doomed strategy from Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   Popovich helped save NBA fans the indignity of following the
lockout with a Finals sweep. Of course, most of us knew New York
couldn't be swept.
</P>
<P>
   It's much too sticky.

HUGE GROWTH KEEPS DISNEY IN COMPETITION 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ Never let them see you sweat.
</P>
<P>
   That's hard to do on a summer day in central Florida, but give
the folks at Walt Disney World Resort credit for effort.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what effect the opening of Universal's highly awaited
Islands of Adventure might have on the Magic Kingdom, Disney
officials are nonplussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there a new park around here?'' responds Judson Green,
chairman of Walt Disney Attractions, with tongue in cheek.
</P>
<P>
   Green says Universal is merely following the leader, but he adds
that any new attraction ``just makes central Florida a stronger
destination.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Universal may be building new parks, Green says 1999
is the biggest year of growth in the Disney resort's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something new in every corner of the World,'' Green
gushes, declaring this the Disney Decade. ``We are always looking
at changes and adjustments, things we can do to increase customer
satisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   The Disney World Resort encompasses four theme parks: the Magic
Kingdom, Disney's Animal Kingdom, Epcot and MGM-Disney Studios;
three water parks; the Disney Institute; Downtown Disney, a retail
and entertainment district; 17 hotels, five golf courses, a racquet
club; and two mini-golf complexes.
</P>
<P>
   So what's new for 1999?
</P>
<P>
   _ Well, Test Track _ Disney's fastest ride _ finally is on track
after two years of stops and starts. Created in partnership with
General Motors, the $60 million Test Track takes riders over hills
and bumpy roads, through hairpin turns, arctic cold and desert heat
and finally into an exciting 65-mph blast down a 50-degree banked
curb.
</P>
<P>
   Now if they can only overcome the attraction's frequent
breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   _ Disney's Animal Kingdom grew by an entire continent this
spring. Guests cross a bridge to enter Asia, where they will find
several new attractions. Kali River Rapids is the ubiquitous raft
ride and Flights of Wonder is an aviary show starring macaws,
ibises and pelicans.
</P>
<P>
   The best of the new lures is the Maharajah Jungle Trek, a
splendid self-guided tour through a rain forest with crumbling
temples and palaces and fantastic species such as the tiger, tapir
and Komodo dragon. Don't miss the giant fruit bats, a marvel to
watch.
</P>
<P>
   Along the lushly landscaped trek, guests meet Disney cast
members who hail from Nepal, India, Thailand and Indonesia. These
enthusiastic young people are eager to share information about the
exhibits and their homelands.
</P>
<P>
   _ Opening mid-July at MGM-Disney Studios will be the Rock 'n'
Roller Coaster, which will further enhance the movie-themed park's
teen appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The roller coaster will feature three inversions, speeds up to
60 mph and a rocking soundtrack created especially for Disney by
those metalmen Aerosmith. The coaster's 24-passenger trains will be
outfitted with 120 speakers for a pulsing rock beat.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to MGM-Disney Studios also should give the Twilight
Zone Tower of Terror another try. After a couple of years of
tweaking, Disney imagineers have gotten it right. Enhanced visuals
and multiple drops will have you screaming for more. Or screaming
to get off.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Magic Kingdom embraces the chubby little cubby with a new
ride. Geared for tots, the Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh takes
guests on a storybook journey through the Hundred Acre Woods.
Another new kiddie ride is Buzz Lightyear's Space Ranger Spin.
</P>
<P>
   _ Evening entertainment around the World gets a boost, too. Most
exciting is a new show created by Cirque du Soleil and presented in
a special permanent theater at Downtown Disney.
</P>
<P>
   ``La Nouba'' is a high-energy show that blends circus,
theatrical arts and zany street entertainment with a high-tech
stage, dazzling lighting and an urban musical score. Like most
Cirque productions, ``La Nouba'' is presented by an international
cast of 60. While the aerial ballet and high-wire acts are
stunning, it is the young performers with their ``diabolos,'' or
Chinese yo-yos, that bring the crowds to their feet.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the World, the Magic Kingdom is paid a visit by
Disneyland's original Main Street Electrical Parade and Scorcerer
Mickey battles laser enemies in ``Fantasmic,'' a production at
Disney-MGM Studios that features animated fountains, balls of fire
and a timeless musical score.

A MIXED DAY FOR COKE IN EUROPE'S ILLNESS SCARE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The European crisis for Coca-Cola began to ease in
France Tuesday, but the 15-nation European Union announced plans to
carry out health inspections of its own in plants in Belgium and
France that had produced soft drinks blamed for outbreaks of
illness early this month.
</P>
<P>
   While the French ban on Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Light, Fanta and
Sprite canned by a Coca-Cola factory in Dunkirk, France, could be
lifted as early as Wednesday, Pietro Petrucci, a European Union
spokesman, said European inspectors would visit that plant and one
in Antwerp, Belgium, and might not finish their report until next
week.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgium, where the government was brought down June 13 in a
scandal over contamination of animal-feed grains by cancer-causing
dioxin, authorities maintained a nine-day-old ban on Coca-Cola,
Fanta and Sprite. The ban continued even after the company's
chairman, M. Douglas Ivester, met with the caretaker health
minister Monday night and apologized to Belgian consumers in
newspaper advertisements Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The problems began in Belgium after 30 schoolchildren apparently
became sick after drinking Coke from cans on June 7, and fears
quickly spread to France, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Italy and
Spain. Today the anxiety spread to Portugal, where several thousand
cans of Coca-Cola were recalled after consumers there complained of
finding a black residue that the company later said was harmless
carbon particles.
</P>
<P>
   In all, about 200 cases of stomach pains, nausea and
hyperventilation have been reported. France and the Netherlands
have loosened an earlier ban, limiting it to sales of cans of
Coca-Cola, Fanta and Sprite shipped through Belgium, but Luxembourg
is barring all Coca-Cola products.
</P>
<P>
   French tests of the beverages canned in Dunkirk produced no
evidence of contamination, the French government said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Kouchner, the health minister of France, said that
examiners had looked into 10 causes of people who became sick after
drinking Coca-Cola, but concluded that there were no links between
the illnesses and the beverage. Kouchner suggested that
psychosomatic causes were a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that health inspectors had found ``no relation in
particular'' between the death of a seven-month-old baby in the
mother's womb and any Coca-Cola that she might have drunk. But, he
said, a few empty cans in her possession had been put under seal as
part of the usual judicial inquiry into the death.
</P>
<P>
   Marylise Lebranchu, the consumer minister of France, said that
the government food safety agency could give the all-clear to
Coca-Cola in France on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola officials in Brussels with Ivester and Henry
Schimberg, chairman of Coca-Cola Enterprises, the bottling
subsidiary, did not return telephone calls Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister of Belgium, Jean-Luc Dehaene, resigned a week
ago after his coalition government lost the national elections,
acknowledging that he had not handled the crisis over contaminated
animal feed properly. European Union authorities have accused the
Belgians of delaying action for weeks before withdrawing chicken,
eggs and later meat from the market until they could certify which
producers had not used the tainted feed.
</P>
<P>
   Belgian authorities arrested the head of an animal fat
processing company in southern Belgium Monday night, and Nicole de
Rouck, a spokeswoman for the public prosecutor's office in Ghent,
said Tuesday that it was possible that the company had mixed motor
oil with frying fat that had been used to enrich animal feed
grains. The company, Fogra, is the second to be investigated in the
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola has blamed a bad batch of carbon dioxide, used to
carbonate its soft drinks, for the problems in Antwerp. Aga Gas,
the Swedish company that said it had supplied the gas, has denied
that there was anything wrong with the gas.
</P>
<P>
   Cans from Dunkirk that were shipped to Belgium and Luxembourg
may have picked up phenol and other chemicals used to protect
shipping pallets, Coca-Cola said, but French authorities who tested
both cans and pallets from Dunkirk said they had found no trace of
such impurities.
</P>
<P>
   What effect the scare and the full-page advertisements Coca-Cola
has taken out in European newspapers this week to try to counter it
have had on the company's sales in Europe or elsewhere were among
the many questions that the company's officials could not answer
Tuesday. Analysts in New York said it was difficult to estimate how
much money Coca-Cola was losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The $64 million question is, how effective their effort to
restore confidence in their brand is,'' said Marc Cohen, an analyst
for Goldman Sachs. An analyst for CS First Boston has said the ban
is costing Coca-Cola Enterprises some $3.4 million in revenues per
day.
</P>
<P>
   Belgian authorities lifted a ban on Nestea, Aquarius, Bon Aqua,
Lift and Minute-Maid drinks last week.
</P>
<P>
   And all Coca-Cola products, except those made in Dunkirk, are
back on the shelves and in vending machines in France.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Coca-Cola controls only 7 percent to 8 percent of
the French soft drink market, the government earlier this year
barred Coca-Cola from buying Orangina, a carbonated orange drink
owned by Pernod Ricard SA, because it feared a more intrusive
American presence in the nonalcoholic beverage business.

ROSE BOWL OPPOSES PLAYOFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA -- A Swiss corporation's multi-billion dollar proposal
for a 16-team, NCAA Division I-A college football playoff is either
a threat to the integrity of college sports or a potential boon for
universities around the country.
</P>
<P>
   One thing appears certain. The Rose Bowl's future as the premier
venue for college football would be in peril if a playoff is
instituted -- the main reason Rose Bowl officials are speaking out
against the latest playoff proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we go to a playoff, what this city has learned to love will
be gone,'' Harriman Cronk, head of the football committee for the
Tournament of Roses, said Tuesday. ``We could wind up as just a
quarterfinal game.''
</P>
<P>
   In light of recent developments, college football playoffs are a
real possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Since December, International Sports and Leisure -- a
Swiss-based marketing and licensing firm -- has been approaching
athletic directors and university presidents around the country
with an eight-year, $3.06 billion plan for a 16-team playoff.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal calls for a playoff system beginning in 2003, said
Jim Wheeler, ISL's vice president for college athletics. Under the
plan, the Rose Bowl could host the finals every fourth year.
</P>
<P>
   The championship would rotate among the bowls in the Bowl
Championship Series: Rose, Sugar, Fiesta and Orange. The final game
would take place the weekend before the NFL's Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a passionate subject, and you try to get people to
look at the facts,'' Wheeler said.
</P>
<P>
   ISL is already financially involved with the World Cup, the
Association of Tennis Professionals, the Olympics, the
international basketball championship, CART auto racing and the Big
Ten Conference, Wheeler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We handle all the marketing rights, licensing and media for
those events,'' Wheeler said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is sold on Wheeler's plan, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our conference is very supportive of the bowl system. It's
been good to us and to college football,'' said Jim Muldoon, an
assistant commissioner with the Pac-10. ``It would take a lot to
change our minds. I haven't seen any groundswell among our
(university) presidents ... there's no support at that level.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their ongoing relationship with ISL, the Big Ten isn't
going for the proposal, either, right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the same page with most of the major conferences,''
said Sue Ryan, a Big Ten assistant commissioner. ``The ISL group
has pitched their proposal, but we believe in the tradition and
history of the bowl system. We are committed to the BCS and our
involvement with it. A playoff system -- now or in the near future
-- is something we are not interested in.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the NCAA, ``The Division I board has indicated there's
not an interest in a playoff at this time,'' said Dennis Poppe, the
NCAA's director of championships. ``But there's still an open
door.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the closest college football fans get to an actual
championship is through the BCS. The series promises that the top
two teams in the country will play for the national championship
during New Year's week.
</P>
<P>
   BCS standings, an inexact science at best, are determined by a
combination of national polls, win-loss records, strength of
competition and computer rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Getting a playoff in place by 2003 could be tough. The BCS runs
three more years, but the Big Ten and Pac-10 conferences have a
contract with the Rose Bowl for three years after that.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler isn't fazed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the presidents of the Pac-10 and Big Ten decide they want a
playoff, that can be worked out,'' he said.

 &HT;    Show-And-Tell At PC Expo
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Making his bluntest public assessment of Compaq
Computer Corp.'s problems, Michael Dell said Tuesday there is a
``massive state of confusion'' around his cross-state rival, and he
suggested Compaq is hemorrhaging corporate customers to Dell
Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a full account-acquisition mode,'' the chief
executive of Dell said during a briefing with reporters at the Four
Seasons Hotel. ``Sounds like a party for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell Computer, Compaq and hundreds of other hardware and
software companies that make up the personal computer industry are
in New York for PC Expo, the annual trade show that this year
attracted an estimated 75,000 participants to promote and evaluate
the latest products for businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The 34-year-old Dell's almost gleeful reference to Compaq's
battle to reduce operating costs, improve manufacturing efficiency
and adopt a more Dell-like model of marketing and assembling
computers underscores the bitter rivalry between the two Texas PC
giants. Compaq, based in Houston, is the No. 1 PC company in total
PCs shipped. But Dell is rapidly closing the gap and has taken over
the No. 1 slot in such key segments as small business, according to
research company International Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Compaq announced last week that it might lose $250
million this quarter and that it plans thousands of layoffs in the
wake of the April firing of Chief Executive Eckhard Pfeiffer and
resignation of a handful of senior executives that followed. The
company also warned Wall Street that it would take a $2 billion
charge against earnings this year as it reorganized.
</P>
<P>
   Dell said that a $2 billion charge coupled with a $5 billion
charge the company took last year, in part because of its
acquisition of Digital Equipment Corp., would ``wipe out'' all the
company's profit since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq spokesman Alan Hodel said the company declined to comment
on Dell's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Mazzucchelli, vice president of investment banking company
Gerard Klauer Mattison &AMP; Co. Inc. in New York, said Dell has been
aggressively trying to capitalize on Compaq's problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were them, I'd be doing the exact same thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dell also said Tuesday that his company plans to offer online
auctions of personal computers and will launch an Internet service
provider program. He declined to provide details.
</P>
<P>
   While Dell relishes what he called the ``perfect competitive
environment'' with Compaq, his tone was more of the joyful victor
than vindictive enemy. He said market-share data suggest that Dell
is taking business away from other competitors as well as Compaq,
and he displayed his usual confidence in Dell Computer's prospects
in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Showing a chart of Dell's 50 percent to 60 percent growth in PCs
shipped from 1996 through the first quarter of this year, Dell said
the industry's rate of growth actually slowed in 1996, 1997 and
1998 without Dell Computer's shipments.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in the Internet will continue to drive the PC industry,
Dell predicted, and high-speed Internet connections such as cable
modems or ADSL lines will prompt users to upgrade their PCs to more
powerful models. Various industry projections say there soon will
be a proliferation of small, digital appliances connecting people
to the Internet, e-mail, stock prices and weather reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would serve the purpose of giving you information where
you are, essentially addicting you to information, but none of
these devices are a replacement for the PC,'' Dell said.
</P>
<P>
   For millions of digitally connected households, the common PC
will be a server that allows those devices to work in concert.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more data-addicted people are, the more PCs will
flourish,'' Dell said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Dell said the industry ``is at the beginning of a huge
wave'' of companies trying to plug into the potential of Web sales,
or e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Dell also said that three growth areas _ consumers, enterprise
services and expansion into industrialized countries where PC use
is less than 10 percent of the population _ offer Dell additional
revenue of $10 billion each ``over the next several years.''
</P>
<P>
   The company, which some analysts expect to reach $26 billion in
revenue this year, could grow to a $90 billion company by reaching
20 percent share of the PC industry, Dell said.

 &HT;    Computers can follow path of TV sets, Andreessen says
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Powered by the lure of the Internet, personal
computers have the potential to become as ubiquitous as television
sets in time, but first the industry must make them vastly more
user-friendly, Marc Andreessen said Tuesday at the PC Expo trade
show.
</P>
<P>
   Andreessen, a co-founder of Netscape Communications Corp. who is
now chief technology officer at America Online Inc., said it took
only five years for the Internet to reach 5 million users, which
was eight years faster than television achieved that level of
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   But convenience is critical to its continued growth. Just as
consumers don't care what microchip controls their microwave,
they're indifferent to the chip that runs their computers,
Andreessen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers don't care about the technology,'' he said. ``It all
has to be just completely push-button. It all has to be
point-and-click.''
</P>
<P>
   In a keynote address at the annual PC trade show, Andreessen
described e-mail as a ``tornado application.'' That is an
industry-changing software program whose value increases as more
people use it.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail and the World Wide Web are classic examples, he said.
They started slowly, but their attraction and potential grew as
more PC owners began using them.
</P>
<P>
   Andreessen criticized the PC industry's focus on hardware and
technology instead of the end user. That has created such
non-user-friendly requirements as holding down two or more keys on
a keyboard to perform certain functions.
</P>
<P>
   He cited the television as a model of convenience and ease of
use that the PC industry might follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to overestimate how important this is,'' Andreessen
said.

   WILLIAMSBURG, Va. _ As Colonial Williamsburg, the reconstructed
capital of colonial Virginia, tries to broaden its appeal, its
3,500 employees operate by a new credo: enter the 21st century
without leaving the 18th.
</P>
<P>
   It means actors who portray colonial residents of the village
now tackle contemporary topics, like church-state relations. It
means the organization's lucrative catalog business is moving
beyond its collection of historical replicas to offer a new line of
casual, family-oriented home furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   And increasingly it means turning to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A federal commission on electronic commerce met here Monday and
Tuesday to debate whether to permit taxation of Internet shopping.
The dilemma is of great importance to Washington state, home to an
unusual concentration of electronic commerce businesses, but also
highly dependent on sales tax revenues to finance services such as
schools and police.
</P>
<P>
   The new commission, established and appointed by Congress, has
10 months to come up with a recommendation to Congress on whether,
and how, to tax sales made over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   To understand how widespread electronic commerce has become,
look at the role the Internet plays in promoting and funding this
tourist attraction, where 800 actors spend their days re-enacting a
time before electricity. The recording a caller to Colonial
Williamsburg hears when put on hold says it all: ``Need to send a
message to Colonial Williamsburg? Don't worry, the Internet has now
transcended time, reaching back into Colonial Williamsburg.''
</P>
<P>
   Log on to www.history.org, and you can buy a variety of
colonial-era collectibles: for $19.95, a hand-thrown bird bottle,
for $32 a salt-cured, hickory-smoked Virginia ham, for $3,675 an
oversized carpet like the ones Persian shahs sent to impress
European royalty. You have to dial a phone number to provide your
credit card number, but soon Williamsburg expects to move fully
online.
</P>
<P>
   Buy an item at one of the many gift shops here, and you must pay
Virginia's 4.5 percent sales tax. Buy the item via the Internet and
the tax isn't imposed.
</P>
<P>
   Tax policy always has been a hot debate in Williamsburg _ the
American Revolution arguably was triggered by colonial hostility to
British tax policy _ and the debate was reborn this week at the
307-year-old campus of the College of William and Mary, just down
the road from the colonial capitol where early Virginians debated
the controversial stamp tax.
</P>
<P>
   Among the questions facing the new commission: Should electronic
commerce sales be taxed? What about sales of digital goods, rather
than physical goods? How to simplify the taxation system?
</P>
<P>
   At this first meeting, Washington Gov. Gary Locke and Dallas
Mayor Ron Kirk led the charge against granting the electronic
commerce industry a blanket exemption from the sales tax on which
so many state and local governments depend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make sure that we're protecting and promoting the
growth of electronic commerce, but at the same time be cognizant of
the fact that so many local, county and state governments depend on
sales tax collections to pay for police, fire and schools,'' Locke
said.
</P>
<P>
   Locke warned that allowing a broad exemption from taxes for
Internet companies would not only disadvantage traditional
retailers, but also undermine government's ability to fund schools
as the percentage of commerce conducted over the Internet rises.
The Internet generated about $300 billion in revenue last year,
according to the University of Texas. Electronic commerce now
accounts for less than 1 percent of the nation's retail economy,
but is expected to grow rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our country is a world leader in technology ... because of the
education of the visionaries,'' Locke said. ``It would be ironic if
the growth of electronic commerce erodes our ability to educate the
innovators and leaders of tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirk warned that if sales tax revenues to state and local
governments fall, there will inevitably be a push to increase other
taxes, such as property and income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Several commissioners expressed skepticism about allowing any
taxation of Internet sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not here as tax collectors for the current tax
regimes,'' said commissioner Stanley Sokul, a consultant to the
Association for Interactive Media. ``The 13 colonies' first attempt
at government collapsed because of the states' parochial tax
motives.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, a clear majority of the commission seemed ready to
support allowing the taxation of goods sold over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe that physical-distribution stores should be
disadvantaged by tax advantages for e-commerce,'' said commissioner
David Pottruck, president of the Charles Schwab stock brokerage.
And John Sidgmore, vice chairman of MCI Worldcom, said the Internet
industry doesn't need special tax breaks and that ``it is not
feasible to tax Main Street differently from the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington state's e-commerce companies, which are not directly
represented on the coalition, although one member has worked as a
registered lobbyist for Microsoft, are divided over whether they
should be taxed.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which sells software and services over the Internet,
has joined an industry group called the Internet Tax Fairness
Coalition in expressing a willingness to pay sales taxes if they
are not higher than those imposed on traditional retailers and if
the nation's patchwork of sales tax systems is simplified, which is
likely to be a major focus of the commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry view is that we support a fair tax policy, an
administrable tax system, with certainty as a result,'' said Bruce
Reid, director of state and local tax policy for Microsoft, who
attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But Amazon.com, the giant Seattle-based online retailer, is more
reluctant to participate in sales taxes. The company collects sales
taxes from customers in Washington state, as required by law, but
not elsewhere in the country. Amazon is one of the largest
e-commerce companies in the world, with 10 million customers and
$610 million in sales last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would not want to see anything happen that makes it more
expensive for people to access the Internet or participate in
e-commerce,'' Bill Currie, an Amazon spokesman, said in a phone
interview. ``The benefits of online shopping are convenience, a
selection far greater than anything in the physical world, and
lower prices, and it would be a shame to see taxes on Internet
access or any other kind of Internet tax deprive people of
e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington, one of just a handful of states without an income
tax, derives 48 percent of its revenues from sales taxes. The
state's revenue director, Fred Kiga, said the state estimates it is
losing $150 million a year in tax revenue, of which as much as $25
million is uncollected taxes on Internet sales. The rest is is
uncollected taxes on catalog sales.

WORLD BANK AND TREASURY NOMINEE AT ODDS OVER LOAN TO CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a rare public conflict between Washington and
the World Bank, Treasury Secretary-designate Lawrence Summers said
Tuesday that the United States would vote against a controversial
loan to China that would resettle poor Chinese farmers to land that
Tibetans claim as their own.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Clinton administration's objections, World Bank
officials said that they expected that the loan would probably be
approved at a meeting of the bank's board on Thursday. Originally,
the vote was scheduled to take place Tuesday, but it was delayed so
that James Wolfensohn, the bank's president, could preside over
what has become a highly politicized debate over the institution's
role in China.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States opposes the loan, as Summers indicated it
would during his confirmation hearing Tuesday, it would probably
further strain relations with Beijing. Chinese officials have said
that the American efforts to block the loan constitute an
interference in China's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   It will also mark a open disagreement with Wolfensohn, a
strong-minded former investment banker who was the administration's
choice to run the bank _ a job Summers once sought. He has resisted
pressure to change the terms of the loan, arguing that it aids some
of the poorest people in China, exactly what the bank's
poverty-alleviation programs are intended to do.
</P>
<P>
   World Bank officials say that the effects of the voluntary
resettlement of 58,000 farmers on the ethnic makeup of the region
have been vastly exaggerated by pro-Tibet groups. Their complaints
have carried the day in Congress, however, where Tibet's resistance
to Beijing's mandates are a popular cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States will be voting to oppose the project because
of concerns in the environmental areas and concerns in the
resettlement areas,'' Summers said Tuesday. The Treasury Department
represents the United States on the bank's board, where Washington
holds 18 percent of the votes _ not enough to block a loan unless
it wins over many allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this may pass over the American objections,'' one
senior member of the bank's board said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the bank would lend China $40 million to move
the farmers from an overcrowded and badly eroded area in the
northeastern corner of Qinghai Province to a sparsely populated,
somewhat less poor region in the province 300 miles west.
</P>
<P>
   Qinghai lies just north of the Tibet Autonomous Region on the
Tibetan Plateau and was settled by Tibetan and Mongolian people.
Today, however, most of its 5 million residents are ethnic Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   The Tibetan groups that have campaigned against the World Bank
project say that it will help Beijing dilute Tibetan culture.
American officials clearly have their doubts about that argument,
but they were unwilling to defend the loan and appear to be siding
with Beijing. Forty percent of the proposed settlers would be
ethnic Chinese, while the rest would be Hui Muslims and others,
including some ethnic Tibetans. The bank says it believes the
effects on Tibetan culture would be negligible.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States often abstains from voting for World
Bank projects, especially those involving China, it is rare for
Wolfensohn to be caught in such open disagreement over China policy
with the administration. It could be a costly fight: Support for
both the bank and its sister institution, the International
Monetary Fund, is scarce in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The American opposition to the loan may also inflame opinions in
China, where anti-American demonstrations following NATO's bombing
of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, last month led to
claims that the United States is trying to undercut the Beijing
government. China already regards the whole debate as an effort to
back followers of the Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader.
</P>
<P>
   But a senior American official said Tuesday that ``World Bank
projects by definition affect the internal developments of a
state.'' The official said that some of the American objections
arise from the fact that a number of standard procedures, including
an evaluation of the environmental impact of the resettlement
project, were not followed in this case.

ELLIOTT WORKS HARD TO SHED A `SOFT' LABEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are detailed manuscripts devoted to players'
abilities _ and liabilities _ in this league. You can't find them
at Walden's or Barnes &AMP; Noble, and few assistant coaches would risk
their jobs by handing over a copy. But like labels and perceptions,
they're out there, imperfect career blueprints. The pages contain
more information about a player's tendencies and weaknesses than
any cable breakdown segment can show.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Elliott knows. No matter how much he would like to rewrite
it, the book on him has been in its third printing. Quick first
step. Good finisher. Injury prone. And, yes, susceptible to
disappearing the more rugged his opponent plays defense against
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' he said when asked if players had tried to
capitalize on the label. ``I had plenty of guys that tried to get
into me physically and lost that battle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you still fighting the battle?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs forward was sitting up straight on a chair along the
Eighth Avenue baseline of Madison Square Garden Tuesday after San
Antonio finished practice. Wednesday night, Elliott, the team's
third-leading scorer, Tim Duncan and David Robinson will match
their skills and heart against that of Allan Houston, Latrell
Sprewell and Larry Johnson in Game 4 of the National Basketball
Association finals at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott does not consider himself a full-fledged member of San
Antonio's Big 3 for a variety of reasons; the most obvious is
Duncan and Robinson are 7-foot superstars. And on any given night,
Mario Elie or Jaren Jackson can become that third option that
catapults the Spurs to victory.
</P>
<P>
   While he may not admit it, playing well in the crucible of the
finals _ in the middle of a Garden madhouse _ would finally give
Elliott credence for changing an outdated perception about him.
</P>
<P>
   He went a long way in the Western Conference finals, burying
that outrageous 3-pointer in the final seconds of Game 2 against
Portland, a shot that demoralized the Trail Blazers. And hardly
anyone knows how hard he has worked to rehabilitate his body from
injury after injury the past few seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But labels are labels. And when you go 3 for 9 in Game 3 at the
Garden, and wonder the next day why you didn't get more favorable
calls from the officials, the people not enamored with your game
come out in droves again.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Elliott is like Houston _ a carefree, easygoing soul
forever called soft. Houston has overcome the perception by putting
the ball on the floor and parlaying one clutch playoff shot into a
bevy of 30-point nights. They were teammates in Detroit during
Houston's rookie season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the same personality types,'' Elliott said when asked if
there were any similarities. ``I think with Allan in Detroit, he
would hardly say anything and I would hardly say anything. In that
sense, we're probably pretty close.''
</P>
<P>
   He added of Houston, ``I think his personality is quiet. He's
not a Generation X type player. If you're not a Generation Xer,
then you're considered soft, low key and mellow. I think he plays
hard. Soft guys don't go out and score 30 points in the finals.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott ended up in Detroit at a time when the Bad Boys had lost
their swagger and were turning into a nasty bunch of curmudgeons.
If had to battle a bad back and aching knees, he also had to battle
a culture of pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not fit in,'' said Don Chaney, the Knicks assistant and
former Piston coach. ``He and Isiah really didn't blend in as
teammates. Detroit was known at the time for banging and knocking
people around. And Sean came in basically as a West Coast player, a
finesse type guy. So a lot of the players wanted him to become that
guy. And that's not who he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a knock on him, but it wasn't a great mesh there in
Detroit.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Elliott, ``I was maybe a different type of player, but I
fit in well there early on. It was just after that, it wasn't very
good.''
</P>
<P>
   He went back to San Antonio, persevered through injuries and
eventually became one of the key reasons why this team is playing
for its first NBA title. San Antonio just lost its first game in
more than a month, and nearly 20,000 people will pack the Garden
tomorrow to see if they can shake, rattle and tweak the Spurs once
more.
</P>
<P>
   If Elliott cracks, the criticism begins anew, the book on him
due for another printing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays, you look at what a player is good at and then you
always look at what he's not good at,'' Elliott said. ``You always
see a breakdown of a player. You always see pros and cons. When I
was coming up, you never saw that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always talked about how good a guy was.'' &QL;

UNIVERSAL CREATES RESORT AS THE ULTIMATE `ESCAPE' 

</HEADLINE>

By SYD KEARNEY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ As part of its plan to create a destination
resort, Universal is putting together Universal Studios Escape,
encompassing two theme parks, an entertainment complex and three
hotels. And with the opening of Islands of Adventure, most of the
pieces are in place.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Universal Studios CityWalk began welcoming
guests to its collection of restaurants, nightclubs, specialty
shops and 20-screen movie theater. This summer, Portofino Bay Hotel
will be the first of three Universal resort hotels to open.
</P>
<P>
   CityWalk is a welcome improvement over its California cousin.
While CityWalk Hollywood is a claustrophobia-inducing canyon that
funnels folks from door to door, the Orlando complex is spread over
30 acres. Wide, multilevel boulevards accommodate crowds and allow
space for alfresco dining and street entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Pick your theme:
</P>
<P>
   _ The cavernous Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville boasts three
bars, a large indoor stage and a prop plane buzzing above the fray.
The menu is skewed to Key West tastes with specialties such as
conch fritters and calamari. The cheeseburgers are, of course,
paradise.
</P>
<P>
   _ The first NASCAR Cafe is drawing race fans with its rare
artifacts and race simulator. The food is pretty good, too. Try the
revved-up pork chops or the enormous rack of baby-back ribs.
</P>
<P>
   _ The sounds of the Temptations, the Supremes and the Jackson 5
fill the Motown Cafe, which displays music memorabilia and presents
live performances. Check out the Big Chill Lounge after you've
feasted on meatloaf and chicken-fried steak.
</P>
<P>
   _ The world's largest Hard Rock Cafe has a 1959 pink Cadillac
twirling above the bar, which is surrounded by an extensive
music-memorabilia collection. You know the menu: burgers, burgers,
burgers. Rock on.
</P>
<P>
   _ The cuisines of 21 nations have inspired the menu at the Latin
Quarter, which spotlights live salsa, merengue and Latin-rock bands
every night. Among menu staples: plantains, black beans, pork and
yellow rice.
</P>
<P>
   _ The culinary star is Emeril's Restaurant. Instead of live
music, the kitchen staff provides the entertainment: The dining
room is configured around an open kitchen. The Creole-inspired menu
features specialties such as turtle soup, grilled veal chop with
cheesy grits and andouille crusted redfish.
</P>
<P>
   CityWalk nightspots include the reggae-saturated Bob Marley: A
Tribute to Freedom, CityJazz, Pat O'Brien's Orlando and the groove,
a 21st-century nightclub with historically themed lounges.
</P>
<P>
   A highly anticipated addition to CityWalk is NBA City. Scheduled
to open in late summer, the 17,000-square-foot tribute to the
National Basketball Association will feature a restaurant
specializing in contemporary American cuisine, a sports bar, an
interactive playground with an arcade, a retail store and a private
dining room that is expected to be a magnet for visiting NBA stars.
</P>
<P>
   With a weathered-brick and glass exterior and a polished-wood
interior, the building is meant to evoke a sense of basketball
history. Diners will be treated to audio and video programming
produced specifically for NBA City, while sports-bar patrons will
be able to tune in live men's and women's basketball contests or
select from a library of classic games.
</P>
<P>
   While NBA City is causing a buzz, Universal's slam dunk is the
Portofino Bay Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Designed to resemble an Italian seaside village, the 750-room
luxury hotel is expected to welcome its first guests in early
September. A Lowes Hotel property, the resort will boast five
restaurants, several bars and lounges, a coffeehouse, a
full-service spa, pools and whirlpools, a business center and
retail shops.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hotel features guests will enjoy is curbside
check-in. Guests will be greeted at their car doors by staff
members who will see to their bags and escort them to their rooms,
bypassing the front desk.
</P>
<P>
   Portofino Bay guests also will be provided free transportation
(by water taxi or bus) to the theme parks and CityWalk, early
admission to the parks, priority seating at many restaurants and
shows, and free package delivery from the parks to the hotel. In
addition, resort ID cards will function as charge cards at
restaurants and shops at CityWalk and the theme parks.
</P>
<P>
   Standard room rates for Portofino Bay will start at about $275
per night. Villa Rooms and Suites will offer butler service,
Continental breakfast and evening cocktails and hors d'oeuvres.
</P>
<P>
   For reservations, call 888-322-5541.

ADVERTISING: GILLETTE BEGINS SEASONAL PUSH OF WOMEN'S RAZORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gillette Co., seeking to take advantage of the bare-leg season
of summer to increase sales of women's razors at a time when its
overall business has stalled, recently began a $35 million
advertising campaign for its Sensor Excel razor for women.
</P>
<P>
   The television campaign is intended to encourage women to use
the refillable razor this summer for smooth legs and highlights its
two-blade technology. The commercials, created by BBDO New York,
part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of Omnicom Group, use the tag line
``Sensor Excel _ smoother'' and feature women in summer fashions
that suggest the need for a closer shave.
</P>
<P>
   They began appearing in June during popular television shows
like ``Dawson's Creek'' and ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and are
also running in Europe and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The company's goal is to persuade more women to try the razor
and build brand awareness, said Mary Ann Pesce, vice president of
global business management for female shaving at Gillette.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette is in serious need of strategies to increase sales
because business has stalled, prompting management to warn
investors not to expect much improvement anytime soon. But a new
advertising campaign for an already familiar brand hardly seems to
be enough of a push from a company that has had a habit of
disappointing investors.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Gillette unexpectedly announced last week that
profits in the current quarter would most likely decline 20
percent. The company has been hurt by weak economies in some
countries overseas and poor performance of some of its peripheral
products, like Braun electric shavers and Waterman pens.
</P>
<P>
   While still profitable, the company has been struggling to
regain its momentum since it reported a 20 percent earnings drop in
the third quarter of last year _ its first quarterly decline in
eight years. And besides the warning about the bleak earnings
projection _ the company's third such announcement in four quarters
_ its revenue and profit were flat in the last quarter, hurt in
part by weakness in the Braun business.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette has long prided itself not only on the strength of its
Sensor line of razors and blades but also on its global reach and
consistent delivery of double-digit earnings growth. And management
promises that it will return to its typical growth rate of about 15
percent to 20 percent by the second half of this year. But
investors, who have sent the company's stock tumbling 12 percent
below its level at this time last year, so far are not sold.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that Gillette must either shed its poor performing
lines or increase their appeal to consumers through new features or
catchy marketing. As important, Gillette management must regain
credibility on Wall Street by delivering more consistent results.
</P>
<P>
   But as it seeks to return to the lofty level of earnings growth
it is known for, Gillette may have missed a huge opportunity to
drive sales: a year after the company introduced Mach 3, a
three-blade shaving system for men that took $375 million and more
than five years to develop, it has not extended the technology to
products for women.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette said it planned to begin offering new products for
women but declined to give a time frame for rolling them out or any
other details. ``We are fast at work on the next generation of
shaving systems for women,'' Ms. Pesce said. But, she added, ``We
can't talk to what our future plans are.''
</P>
<P>
   Mach 3 quickly took share from other shaver systems when it was
introduced in April 1998 and now has an estimated 17 percent of the
U.S. market and 13 percent of the worldwide market despite a
premium price of 35 percent above the Sensor line.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have said that Gillette will almost certainly come out
with a Mach 3-type product for women. And Ms. Pesce acknowledged
that ``there are tremendous expansion plans'' for the product,
saying, ``It's not like we launched it and we're done.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillette, though, is about to face new competition for its
three-blade razor. A competitor, American Safety Razor Co., has
started shipping a cheaper triple-blade product called Tri-Flex
razor to retailers in the United States and parts of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at this competitive product to ascertain what
it truly is,'' said Jill Fallon, a company spokeswoman. She said
from what Gillette knows of the product so far, the company does
not consider it a significant threat to Mach 3. Customers, of
course, may disagree and buy based on price rather than brand.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Gillette is still the top seller of razors and blades,
with 73 percent of the worldwide market. It is counting on its
entire family of shavers, like a razor called Dazzlers that it
introduced in April for teen-age girls, and the rest of its product
arsenal, which includes Duracell batteries, to reinvigorate the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette introduced a new ``ultra'' line of batteries this week
that it says lasts 20 percent longer than last year's versions.
Gillette plans to support the product with about $140 million in
advertising and promotions this year, though the company has not
yet disclosed a timetable or details of the planned campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Gillette could get a much needed lift if its marketing
can convince consumers that yet another new battery will keep
flashlights flashing and boom boxes booming longer than, say, the
competing brands with the pink bunny spokesman. But with $10
billion in annual sales, a ``new and improved'' battery, even if it
becomes a best seller, would still not be enough for the company to
break out of its slump.

AKIDE IS NIGERIA'S CELEBRITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DON'T mistake honesty for arrogance. If you do, you'll have a
hard time understanding ``Marvelous'' Mercy Akide of Nigeria's
women's national soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   She says things like, ``They're the whites and we have the
blacks, so we're not afraid,'' in reference to the U.S. team,
Nigeria's opponent in its World Cup game Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt Akide is outspoken, nor is there any doubt
she's a celebrity in her own right.
</P>
<P>
   Mia Hamm of the U.S. team films TV commercials with Michael
Jordan, but Akide is perhaps treated more like Jordan in her
homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like being a celebrity,'' says Akide proudly. ``They call me
Miss Marvelous at home and people give me gifts walking along the
streets.''
</P>
<P>
   You can see why Akide's becoming the rising personality of this
summer's Women's World Cup tournament. She has a loose tongue, an
easy-to-spot presence and has already performed her rhythmic goal
dance after a 2-1 victory over North Korea Sunday at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Akide is an international personality,'' U.S. assistant coach
Lauren Gregg said. ``She's someone who can take over a game.''
</P>
<P>
   And ``by the grace of God,'' says Akide, the Super Falcons will
upset Team USA in Thursday's crucial Group A match in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   First, though, Akide will stop for a manicure, then add more
hair color to the cool green-and-blonde streaks she received before
the North Korean match.
</P>
<P>
   She's not arrogant. Nor is she looking for attention. She's just
having the time of her life. She's as much a tourist as a World Cup
standout.
</P>
<P>
   When she saw herself on the cover of Sunday's World Cup program,
she tucked it away like a kid appearing in a newspaper for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   Ask her about her stay in Los Angeles and she'll tell you how
much she loved the french fries.
</P>
<P>
   We got our first look at Akide in February. She was on the FIFA
Women's World Cup all-star team that beat the U.S. in a friendly
hyping the World Cup draw in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Akide had doughnuts and coffee with a group of
reporters, asking as many questions as they asked her.
</P>
<P>
   Since Nigeria was placed in the U.S. group, the obvious
questions turned to her team's chances against the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   She spoke softly, smiling all the time, but the words coming out
of her mouth gave writer's cramps to those around her.
</P>
<P>
   She said, ``We're going to surprise the world.''
</P>
<P>
   And later, ``We have God on our side, and with Him, we can beat
anybody, including the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   She was also a fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait to play them so I can meet players like your No.9
(Mia Hamm) and No.13 (Kristine Lilly) and the goalkeeper (Briana
Scurry).''
</P>
<P>
   We can't wait to see Nigeria again and see what they will do
next.
</P>
<P>
   Also interesting are the Nigerian fans, who make up one of the
largest traveling contingents of the tournament. They purchase
seats, but rarely sit, preferring instead to sing and dance for 90
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   And this game could turn out to be the most exciting of the
tournament. A score of 3-2 or 4-3 is likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the all-stars can beat the U.S., Nigeria can do it, too,''
said Akide one more time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it. They're (Nigeria) a force to be reckoned
with,'' said Gregg, who scouted the Nigerians in Los Angeles. ``I
think they're playing with confidence off their result with China
(a 4-3 friendly victory). They're clearly here to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, it should be fun to watch.

JOHNSON INSISTS KNICKS ARE NOT MAINSTREAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two days after he ignored a request by league
officials to speak at an interview session, Larry Johnson provided
a loquacious response to those who have cast the Knicks as an
unlovable band of misfits.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of railing against the image, Johnson embraced it in a
rather interesting way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of rebellious slaves on this team,'' Johnson
said Tuesday. ``We don't have a lot of mainstream; we don't go with
the mainstream. We're in a different stream on this team. We've got
a lot of rebellious slaves. We don't go along with the masses.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was referring to himself, as well as a few teammates. On
Sunday, Johnson went on an obscene tirade after two league
officials asked him to stop shooting for a few minutes to grant an
interview during a mandatory session. The rant cost him $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, Johnson doesn't care what anyone thinks of the Knicks,
outside of his own teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't like you; and that's been my motto my whole life,
growing up,'' Johnson said. ``I don't like that person, and that
person don't like me. Fine. Have mutual respect and stay away from
each other. Don't come to me and smile and then stab me behind my
back.''
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate his point, Johnson referred to his days at UNLV.
That team was also criticized for its behavior and ties to
controversy. And the Runnin' Rebels were also loathed by many. But
in the end, Johnson's team wound up with a NCAA championship.

 &HT;    A 'genius' and his love affair
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Rose
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ David Hillis' love affair with the animal
kingdom sounds like an evolutionary tale:
</P>
<P>
   At age 6, he caught lizards and snakes in the African jungle. At
16, he published his first scientific journal article,
``Cannibalism among cornsnakes.'' At 24, he scaled a cliff in the
Andes to discover a new species of frog.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just about to give up when I saw its head poke out from
a tree,'' said Hillis, now 40.
</P>
<P>
   Giving up is not his forte. This is a man who discovered a new
species of snake in Ecuador after a landslide blocked the road,
tossed rocks on his car and left him with nothing better to do.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the MacArthur Foundation announced that Hillis is
among 32 new winners of MacArthur Fellowships in recognition of his
brilliance in evolutionary biology. Hillis, a University of Texas
professor who helped to identify the Barton Springs salamander as a
species seven years ago, is the only Texan this year to win the
so-called ``genius grant.'' His prize: $295,000 over five years to
spend any way he wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrilled,'' said Hillis, who has been at UT since 1987.
``It's not something I ever expected.''
</P>
<P>
   When he got a message last Thursday to call the foundation, a
private organization that has been making the awards since 1981,
his first thought was, ``a colleague was pulling my leg,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``David is extremely unassuming,'' said David Cannatella, a
friend of Hillis' for 20 years, a colleague and a curator at the
Texas Memorial Museum. ``If you just met him on the street, there's
no sense of pretense or affectation, but his mind is incredibly
clear. He just thinks about things in very different ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillis is known nationally among biologists for his work in
phylogenetic analysis, the study of the genetic makeup of living
things by which a scientist is able to reconstruct the organism's
evolution. That kind of analysis not only gives insight into how
animals evolved, it can also help doctors trace the origins of
diseases and help police identify murder suspects.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, Hillis assisted prosecutors in a Louisiana trial in
which a physician was accused of injecting his lover with the AIDS
virus. Hillis was able to determine that the virus came from one of
the doctor's patients. The physician was convicted of attempted
murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an exceptional man doing exceptional work,'' said Daniel
Socolow, director of the fellows program.
</P>
<P>
   The awards, given annually to scientists, artists, musicians and
others whom the program considers creative, come with no strings.
That frees people, either by easing financial worries or by
providing them the wherewithal to pursue their passions, program
spokesmen said.
</P>
<P>
   Hillis, a graduate of Baylor University and the University of
Kansas, caught the attention of an undercover talent scout who
suggested him for the award. Hillis said he has no idea who
nominated him.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way the program is supposed to work, said Socolow. At
any one time, 100 nominators spread around the country spend a year
secretly identifying potential winners.
</P>
<P>
   Hillis is the sixth UT faculty member to get the award, UT
spokeswoman Nancy Neff said. Ten UT students also have gone on to
win, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone in my whole knowledge of people deserves an award
like this, he does,'' said Mary Ann Rankin, dean of the College of
Natural Sciences. ``We're so lucky to keep him on the faculty.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillis was being courted simultaneously this school year by
Harvard and the University of California at Berkeley, Rankin said.
He chose to stay at UT.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have such good colleagues who have helped me,'' Hillis said.
``A lot my success has been because of my colleagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillis also said he stays because he loves Austin and its music
scene; enjoys traveling to small Texas towns with his wife, Ann,
and two sons; and likes to garden at his 300-acre ranch in Mason
County. He also hunts deer with a bow-and-arrow.
</P>
<P>
   The son of scientists and the director of UT's new School of
Biological Sciences, he grew up abroad, living in such diverse
places as Denmark and Africa. He plans to throw a party for his lab
this summer and expects to spend much of the rest of the money on
research trips. He wants to study animals in South America,
Australia and Madagascar.
</P>
<P>
   But Hillis said he that neither the award nor his new
administrative duties will take away from his other passion:
teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's awesome,'' said Laurie Dries, one of Hillis' graduate
students and teaching assistants. ``Every little accomplishment you
make is a big deal. . .He has no ego.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillis also is fun and has no inhibitions about climbing a tree
to catch a lizard, no matter who's watching, she said. At
Christmas, he gets his students to serenade the office staff with a
favorite Robert Earl Keen song, ``Merry Christmas From the
Family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great reward for him,'' Dries said. ``He's really
good at what he does and he loves it.''
</P>

Texas.

COASTERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY TAKE VISITORS TO NEW HEIGHTS 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ While Disney and Universal _ the big cheeses of
central Florida _ battle it out, other theme parks across the
country are luring guests with new attractions.
</P>
<P>
   The granddaddy of themed attractions, Gatorland in Orlando,
Fla., celebrates its 50th birthday this summer. To mark this
achievement, Gatorland premieres its new Jungle Crocs of the World
Theater, where visitors will be able to observe the hunting skills
of Cuban crocodiles. Also new is a 500-square-foot hatchery, where
guests can view a mother gator and her young, and a Gator Jumparoo
show that features alligators springing from the water to snatch
raw chickens.
</P>
<P>
   Leaping lizards? Gatorland calls it ``old Florida
entertainment.'' Hmmm.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Florida, Gwazi, the new double wooden roller
coaster at Busch Gardens in Tampa, pits two big cats in a battle of
coaster supremacy. The tracks for the Gwazi Lion and the Gwazi
Tiger intertwine, setting up six close encounters while riders
reach speeds of 100 mph.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
AROUND TEXAS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ In Houston, Six Flags AstroWorld ratchets up the excitement
with its 11th roller coaster. Boasting more than 2,170 feet of
steel track, Serial Thriller reaches heights of 102 feet and
approaches speeds of 55 mph. It is the only suspended looping
coaster of its kind in the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Next door, WaterWorld is serving up some new activities,
including Hook's Lagoon, an interactive treehouse, and the Big
Kahuna, an exciting raft ride that features multiple high-banked
turns.
</P>
<P>
   _ In San Antonio, the Steel Eel is electrifying visitors to Sea
World of Texas. A 15-story dive is a highlight of this stunning
coaster that reaches speeds of nearly 65 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Also new for this season is ``Fools With Tools,'' a
``home-repair nightmare'' starring the comical sea lions Clyde and
Seamore, and a Beluga Interaction Program that puts guests in the
water for encounters with the fascinating white whales.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also in San Antonio, two new coasters _ Poltergeist and
Boomerang _ are earning fans at Fiesta Texas, which debuted 15
rides and attractions this season.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other new attractions is the 1 million-gallon Lone
Star Lagoon, the state's largest wave pool, and the Texas
Treehouse, a five-story playland that features more than 75
drenching gadgets as well as a 1,000-gallon cowboy hat that
periodically dumps H20 on unsuspecting guests.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Dallas, Six Flags Over Texas' newest coaster is Batman the
Ride, an inverted coaster with a 77-foot-tall vertical loop. The
new coaster and its 32-passenger trains are located within the
Wayne Foundation Industrial Park, also the site of Mr. Freeze, the
tallest, fastest roller coaster in the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have a need for speed, check out the park's new
live shows, which include a Batman-themed stunt show called
``Gotham City Carnival of Chaos and Illusionaria,'' featuring a
master magician and four tricky assistants.
</P>
<P>

CALIFORNIA DREAMING &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Take a hike, Swiss Family Robinson. The jungle now belongs to
Tarzan.
</P>
<P>
   Disneyland in Anaheim has retooled the old Swiss Family Robinson
Treehouse, which debuted in the park's Adventureland in 1962. Last
week, the 70-foot-tall faux tree was rechristened Tarzan's
Treehouse. (It is probably no coincidence that Disney's new
animated film, ``Tarzan,'' also opened last week.)
</P>
<P>
   The new and improved treehouse offers visitors a
``climb-through'' experience with a creaky suspension bridge,
handmade musical instruments and wooden staircases salvaged from a
shipwreck.
</P>
<P>
   Also new for the summer season is the Mulan Parade, a tribute to
the Chinese heroine (also a Disney-animated star). The pageant
features jugglers, acrobats and a 150-foot-long people-powered
dragon.
</P>
<P>
   _ The nation's newest theme park also may be its most
delightfully low-tech. A celebration of creativity and the little
primary-colored plastic blocks of our childhood, Legoland in
Carlsbad, Calif., opened in March. While it is a hit with the
under-10 crowd, the park has taken some hits from parents irked by
slow lines and high prices.
</P>
<P>
   The 238-acre park cost $130 million and is constructed from more
than 30 million Lego blocks. Park highlights include Miniland,
which features replicas of famous structures from New York,
Washington and New Orleans; a Fun Town, constructed from the larger
Duplos building blocks; and a few kiddie rides.
</P>
<P>
   _ Universal Studios Hollywood unveils the world's largest 3-D
screen this summer as it debuts ``Terminator 2: 3D,'' a 12-minute
film created by Oscar-winning director James Cameron. The film,
enhanced with explosive live action, stars Arnold Schwarzenegger
and Edward Furlong, who reprise their roles from the ``Terminator''
film series.
</P>
<P>
   _ Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, Calif., debuts its new
Bugs Bunny World, a six-acre interactive complex dedicated to tots.
Among attractions: the Looney Tunes Lodge, a colorful playground
with multiple slides; Taz's Trucking Company, where the pint-sized
pilot big rigs; and Pepe Le Pew's Tea Party with its cups of
swirling fun.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kids also rule at Paramount's Great America in Santa Clara,
Calif. The 100-acre park recently opened KidZville, an interactive
play area with a children's coaster, construction site and a
``Scooby-Doo'' live show.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
AROUND THE COUNTRY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio, which boasts more roller
coasters than any other U.S. theme park, adds another to its
bone-rattling roster. Woodstock Express makes No. 13. The Peanuts
cartoon-themed coaster is designed for little thrillseekers and is
the centerpiece of a family playland called Camp Snoopy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Elsewhere in Ohio, Paramount's Kings Island in Cincinnati adds
to its more than 100 thrill rides and attractions. New this summer
is Face/Off, an inverted roller coaster, and Drop Zone, the world's
tallest gyro drop that spins guests on a 30-foot ring as they
freefall 26 stories.
</P>
<P>
   _ A sister park, Paramount's Kings Dominion in Richmond, Va.,
also adds a new coaster this summer. Volcano: the Blast Coaster is
the world's fastest suspended roller coaster.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Charlotte, N.C., Paramount's Carowinds offers high-flying
thrills with Top Gun: the Jet Coaster, an inverted roller coaster
that includes six inversions and two underground tunnels.
</P>
<P>
   _ The speed craze continues in Virginia, where Busch Gardens
Williamsburg introduces Apollo's Chariot. The new attraction claims
to be the world's largest hypercoaster with nine vertical drops.
The coaster's passenger seats are elevated above the car to create
a ``free-flight'' sensation.
</P>
<P>
   _ While Silver Dollar City in Branson, Mo., has long been known
for its live music and dance shows, the pioneer-themed park quickly
is earning a reputation for its thrill rides. New for 1999 is the
country's first liquid coaster. BuzzSaw Falls is a water rapids
ride that promises the speed of a conventional dry coaster.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Exterminator provides the newest chills at Kennywood in
West Mifflin, Pa. There is no peeking on this subterranean roller
coaster that delivers riders into a tunnel of terror with giant
rats. (Actually it's underground with the park's water and sewer
lines; now that's scary.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Six Flags Great Adventure in Jackson, N.J., spent more than
$40 million on expansions and improvements this season, including
25 new rides and attractions. Most awaited among these is the
Medusa, a floorless roller coaster. With their toes dangling just
inches from the track, riders are flipped upside down seven times
while traveling at speeds of more than 60 mph.
</P>
<P>
   For the less adventurous, the park offers its new Looney Tunes
Seaport, a children's section with 10 rides, water play areas and
attractions. &QL;

32 RECEIVE GRANTS FROM MACARTHUR FOUNDATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By NEIL MacFARQUHAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The annual grants popularly known as the genius awards announced
Tuesday by The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation were
heavily weighted toward the New York area, home to about a third of
the 32 recipients.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a clump there this year because we just couldn't pass
them up,'' said Daniel J. Socolow, director of the MacArthur
Fellows program.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City area recipients included a community
organizer, a couple who are both architects, a reporter, a history
professor, a computer scientist and several artists.
</P>
<P>
   The grants, awarded this year to 17 men and 15 women, ranged
from $235,000 to $375,000, depending on the age of the recipient.
The youngest recipient was 28 and the oldest was 66. Since 1981,
when the program started, 563 Fellows have been named.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than genius awards, the foundation prefers to think of
them as grants to experts who are particularly gifted in their
fields. The recipients are selected anonymously _ there is no
application _ and given the money over five years to pursue
whatever interests they desire. Recipients do not have to produce
anything for the foundation, and they get free health insurance.
</P>

 &HT;    GM's, players meet to fix NBA...yeah, right
 &HT;    By Kirk Bohls
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A collection of NBA coaches, general managers and
players given a mandate to fix pro basketball convened Tuesday, met
for six hours, discussed everything from abolishing the illegal
defense to converting the lane into a trapezoid or the shape of
Gheorghe Muresan. After serious and candid dialogue, the 16 members
entrusted with making the game more aesthetically pleasing, less
rough and potentially higher scoring came away with the following
consensus:
</P>
<P>
   Please, come back, Michael. Please. We beg you.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the committee was more productive than that. It did
come up with a few minor tweaks, such as loosening the rigid
defensive rules, petitioning the referees to whistle more of the
physical play in the lane regarding cutters and screeners, and
instituting a 5-second rule to eliminate or limit the boring,
back-in isolation play, which will be known as the Charles Barkley
rule. No word yet on whether Barkley or Mark Jackson have retired.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, these measures likely will do little to boost scoring,
which has been in precipitous decline for the last 10 years. Just
because Avery Johnson might be able to tiptoe through the lane now
without getting clotheslined, don't expect the scores to return to
the vicinity of the 100s after a season in which Sacramento's Kings
were the only team to average that many points. Scoring is out,
snoring is in. Nothing that the committee suggested will help bad
shooters shoot better.
</P>
<P>
   The measures the committee unveiled Tuesday will be fine-tuned
and implemented during summer league play and are expected to go
before the NBA's Bored of Gover, uh, Board of Governors for
immediate approval before next season.
</P>
<P>
   Marine boot camps have been more free-flowing than NBA games
this season. The Nielsen ratings are not yet in for game three of
the NBA Finals, but they have been so low that even Nielsen isn't
watching. NBC could stick O.J. on a moped in Beverly Hills and more
viewers would turn in.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, NBA stands for No Basketball Allowed. It's become a
rugby scrum, hand-to-hand combat that represents a deterioration of
the game to alarming levels. Average points for a team have fallen
from 106.3 per game for 1990-91 to an all-time low of 91.6 this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the game is in trouble,'' NBC broadcaster Doug
Collins told me. ``It's just become stagnant. The illegal defense
and the three-point shot lead to too much standing around. But if
scoring goes up 10 points a game and the game is played the same
way, it's still not good. We've seen a greater emphasis on strength
than skill.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it, the league has too few Allan Houstons and too
many John Starks. Too much slashing and not enough swishing. Does
anybody teach the mid-range jumper any more?
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at a lot of the great players, Walt Frazier and
(Earl) Monroe and Oscar Robertson,'' Houston said. ``Those guys
lived off that mid-range jump shot because nobody could do anything
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee is trying to bring back the fast break and cut
back on the amount of contact in the lane. These experimental rule
changes are a start, but they're only going to continue to cover up
drastic deficiencies in this new brand of athletically gifted
players who are bigger and stronger but lack the skills of
yesterday's players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it football or basketball? Or is it a mishmash?'' Spurs
Coach Gregg Popovich asked rhetorically. ``In my mind, it's a
finesse game. But you can't move from A to B without getting
chucked.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not all about scoring. As analyst Jack Ramsay said,
``There's nothing magical about 100 points. I'd like to see better
movement of the ball and players, and that might result in more
scoring.''
</P>
<P>
   Were David Stern really serious about fixing the game, here are
some no-brainers _ which, if the physical nature of the game is
allowed to continue, is what many NBA players like Luc Longley will
become:
</P>
<P>
   _ Make Karl Malone pay for all plastic surgery for his victims.
</P>
<P>
   _ Move in the three-point line two more feet to encourage
mid-range jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make shooters stay out of the crease. Oops, sorry, wrong
broken sport.
</P>
<P>
   _ Forget widening the lane. Raise the basket a foot. You saw
Marcus Camby get a foot above the rim on his rebound dunk in game
three.
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlaw the back-in play. As Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy said,
``I hate the back-in. To me, you don't go to basketball camp and
learn the back-in move. Usually you learn jump hooks and
whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Have NBA players actually practice free throw shooting in the
off-season between making movies, taping CDs and suntanning in
Belize.
</P>
<P>
   _ Get rid of the illegal defense. No one understands it anyway.
Allow zone defenses. Although Collins said he detests ``gimmicky
defenses'' like the box-and-one or triangle-and-two, I disagree. Go
with the parallelogram-and-one. Innovative defenses are one of the
things that separate the prettier college game from the ugly pros.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hire Tim Duncan to conduct the Bank Shot Camp. Attendance
would be mandatory for Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   _ Buy Larry Johnson a dictionary to expand his vocabulary.

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Here's a news flash for Disney: You may never be
outdone by Universal, but you've definitely been ``out-funned.''
</P>
<P>
   Universal Islands of Adventure, which celebrated its grand
opening Memorial Day weekend, delivers more thrills, chills and
excitement than the combined efforts of Walt Disney World's four
themed parks.
</P>
<P>
   And Islands is just what the doctor, or should we say the teens,
ordered for central Florida. While the Magic Kingdom and the
Muppets kept the tots happy, and Mom and Pop lapped up the
educational hooey of Epcot, teens vacationing here previously were
relegated to eye rolling and making do with archaic rides, such as
Space Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   No longer.
</P>
<P>
   With outstanding roller coasters, a revolutionary
three-dimensional thrill ride and a menacingly named Doctor Doom's
Fearfall, Islands of Adventure is targeting a young, sophisticated
audience.
</P>
<P>
   But it isn't ignoring the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   For the wee ones, there is Seuss Landing, a 10-acre tribute to
the memorable creations of Theodore Geisel.
</P>
<P>
   And for parents ... well, there's the entire park.
</P>
<P>
   Islands of Adventure is just one giant tip o' the hat to baby
boomers. Every corner of the 110-acre park is filled with such
feel-good icons as Popeye, the Cat in the Hat, Sinbad, Dudley
Do-Right and Spider-Man.
</P>
<P>
   The park is designed around five themed ``islands'' with the
adventure beginning at the exotic Port of Entry, a little chunk of
Marrakech dusted off for Orlando. Moving clockwise around the port,
the ``islands'' are Marvel Super Hero Island, Toon Lagoon, Jurassic
Park, the Lost Continent and Seuss Landing.
</P>
<P>
   From the park's entry, the most stunning sight is Jurassic Park.
Film fans will have a sense of dj vu as they look across the lake
at Universal's faithful re-creation of the building from the Steven
Spielberg blockbuster movie.
</P>
<P>
   Jurassic Park includes several interesting attractions, such as
the Discovery Center, where you can watch a raptor hatch, and the
Triceratops Encounter, where you can pet a dinosaur. The area's
thrill ride, Jurassic Park River Adventure, also offers some close
encounters as riders must outrace a tyrannosaurus rex and survive
an 85-foot plunge into the water.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced animatronic technology makes these exhibits work. In
the intimately scaled Triceratops Encounter, a very real-looking,
24-foot dinosaur breathes, blinks, twitches and sneezes.
</P>
<P>
   Don't even think of trying the Pteranodon Flyers. This
slow-loading ride, which features a pair of chairs gliding over the
island, frequently requires two-hour waits for 80 seconds of air
time.
</P>
<P>
   But Universal anticipated long waits for such star attractions
as the Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man and Dueling Dragons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Queues are an opportunity for storytelling,'' explains Phil
Hettema, Universal's senior vice president for attraction
development. ``We didn't just build rides, we crafted legends.''
</P>
<P>
   Legends? That's a stretch. But Dueling Dragons certainly may
have one of the more satisfying queues in any theme park.
</P>
<P>
   Guests must wend their way through an enchanted forest, then
snake through Merlinwood Castle before boarding the roller
coasters. Along the way, would-be riders learn the tale of the Fire
Dragon and the Ice Dragon, two evil serpents each bent on the
other's destruction. The eerily lighted castle is filled with
ghoulish decor, including the sculls and wrecked bodies of fallen
knights.
</P>
<P>
   The ride is as satisfying as the wait. The coasters begin with a
125-foot drop, then separate into a tangle of tracks that features
five inversions and several near-collisions. Reaching speeds of up
to 60 mph, Fire Dragon dangles riders' legs a mere 12 inches from
riders on the Ice Dragon.
</P>
<P>
   The Lost Continent also is home to arguably the most amazing
special-effects show produced by a theme park.
</P>
<P>
   Poseidon's Fury: Escape From the Lost City begins rather
innocuously. The Keeper, portrayed by an actor, tells guests the
story of evil water god Poseidon and his enemy, Zeus. Later, the
audience is ``captured'' by Poseidon and _ here's the awesome part
_ forced to walk through a 42-foot water vortex. This
glasses-fogging effect is created with more than 17,000 gallons of
water. The show climaxes with a battle that features 25-foot
fireballs and drenching explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Drenching also is popular on Toon Lagoon, a colorful tribute to
the funny papers. This ``island'' is home to Dudley Do-Right's
Ripsaw Falls, a wild flume ride, and Popeye &AMP; Bluto's Bilge-Rat
Barges, a white-water raft ride.
</P>
<P>
   The best part of Toon Lagoon, however, isn't the rides. That
distinction belongs to the smile-inducing cartoon characters.
Nearly 80 characters from five decades of Sunday funnies are
depicted life-size here. A deli is dedicated to Dagwood; an
ice-cream parlor pays tribute to weight-conscious Cathy; and a
hamburger cafe is named for Popeye's pal Wimpy.
</P>
<P>
   (Warning: We tried the line ``I will gladly pay you on Tuesday
for a hamburger today.'' It doesn't work.)
</P>
<P>
   Among other characters that pop up along Comic Strip Lane are
Beetle Bailey, Pogo, the kids from Family Circus and Hagar the
Horrible. Don't miss WossaMotta U., a shop with everything
Bullwinkle.
</P>
<P>
   Where Toon Lagoon is a garish splash of primary colors, Seuss
Landing is an inviting oasis of pastels.
</P>
<P>
   The characters and attractions here are taken from Geisel's
popular children's books. The elaborate Caro-Seuss-el features
seven whimsical characters, including elephant-birds from ``Horton
Hatches an Egg'' and AquaMop Tops from ``One Fish Two Fish Red Fish
Blue Fish.''
</P>
<P>
   The latter book also is the inspiration for a ride of the same
name. Guests ride in red and blue fish that go around and up and
down. The trick is to listen closely to the ride's musical rhyme,
which tells riders when to fly high and when to go low. Riders that
don't listen to the lyrics get drenched by squirting fish.
</P>
<P>
   The Cat in the Hat ride is based on Geisel's most famous book.
Participants ride on couches for this fun attraction that retells
the visitors-run-amok story with more than 130 special effects and
animatronic characters.
</P>
<P>
   While Seuss Landing is all sweetness, Marvel Super Hero Island
has an edge. It is a macho attraction with three thrilling rides
and a teen-magnet arcade.
</P>
<P>
   While Doctor Doom's Fearfall, with its twin 200-foot towers,
will be familiar to theme park fans, even roller-coaster
aficionados are in for a surprise on the Incredible Hulk Coaster.
</P>
<P>
   The train ascends, as most coasters do, with a slow
clackity-clack up a steep track, but midway up, the train
accelerates as if it had been blasted from a cannon. There's no
slow anticipation of the first drop; riders go from zero to 40 mph
in two seconds. With seven rollovers, two underground dips and many
moments of weightlessness, the Hulk experience seems much longer
than its two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   We've saved the best for last.
</P>
<P>
   The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man is a ride for the next
millennium. It combines a motion-simulator car that moves along a
track with special effects and the latest 3-D film technology.
</P>
<P>
   Guests are along for the ride as Spider-Man battles bad guys
determined to steal the Statue of Liberty. Marvelous-looking scenes
unfold with the story, and encounters with villains usually include
a sensory effect, such as heat or water. The ride climaxes in a
400-foot ``drop'' into darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Spider-Man is no Mickey Mouse attraction.

LEHMAN BROTHERS' EARNINGS RISE ABOVE EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Tuesday reported second-quarter
earnings that were far above analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, which has been broadening from its traditional base as a
bond house into equities and investment banking, said it earned
$330 million in the three months ended May 31, up slightly from the
$324 million profits in the second quarter of 1998. Earnings per
diluted share were $2.09, down from $2.12 a share in the second
quarter of 1998, but well above the $1.68 consensus of 11
securities analysts surveyed by the First Call Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman had second-quarter revenue of $1.455 billion, down
slightly from $1.473 billion in the period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Four analysts told First Call on Tuesday that they were raising
their 1999 earnings estimates for Lehman to an average of $6.73 a
share, up from the previous estimate of $5.85.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the unexpectedly high profits, shares of Lehman Brothers
fell $3.6875, or 6.11 percent Tuesday, to $56.625, on volume of
more than 4 million shares _ more than four times the daily average
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The closing price was off exactly one-third from its $85 high on
July 13, but also well above its 52-week low of $22.625 on Oct. 8,
as investors fled the stock following worldwide financial turmoil
that put a crimp in Lehman's bond and equities underwriting
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman was the first major Wall Street firm to report earnings
for its second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Moszkowski, who follows investment house stocks for Salomon
Smith Barney, said investors can expect strong results later this
week when Goldman Sachs Group and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co.
are scheduled to issue their second-quarter returns, next month
when Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., PaineWebber and other brokerage firms
whose second quarter ends June 30 report their results.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman has been retaining earnings to build its capital,
Moszkowski said. This policy was shown in a rise in book value to
$40.58 a share, up from $35.93 a year earlier, and a drop in return
on equity to 26.3 percent in the second quarter from 29.9 percent
in the period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds accounted for slightly more than one-third of total
revenue, down from more than half five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman has been expanding operations in Europe, which accounted
for 27 percent of total revenue in the quarter, said Chief
Financial Officer John L. Cecil. He noted that Lehman expected to
collect $70 million for advising in Olivetti SpA's purchase of
Telecom Italia SpA, but counted only $14 million of that revenue in
the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years we were thought of as a fixed income-oriented
firm,'' Cecil said. ``We have been following a path of growing our
equities and investment banking businesses and growing our European
franchise and what you see in this quarter's numbers is very clear
evidence of all of that coming to fruition.''
</P>
<P>
   Profits in the latest quarter were also enhanced by a sharp drop
in the company's effective tax rate, to 27 percent from 32 percent
in the second quarter of 1998, part of which Cecil attributed to
the fact that profits earned in Europe, which are subject to
national corporate income taxes, but not to the equivalent of
American state and local corporate income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Compensation and benefits consumed 50.7 percent of revenue, a
ratio the company said it has maintained for 17 consecutive
quarters.

EDITORIAL: A DEAL TO DEMILITARIZE THE KLA 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial Wednesday, June 23: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With Serbian troops gone from Kosovo, the most important
challenge to peace in the province comes from the ethnic Albanian
guerrillas, the Kosovo Liberation Army. On Monday, NATO and the KLA
agreed that the group would demilitarize more quickly than
previously planned _ but in exchange, NATO would give ``due
consideration'' to making the KLA an army in the style of a
National Guard. The agreement, while imperfect, will contribute to
the safety of Kosovo's Serbian citizens and NATO peacekeepers by
disarming the KLA. In the long run it may increase chances that
Kosovo will enjoy moderate, civilian leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the claims of KLA leaders, the agreement does not
promise that the group will become an army, only that the issue
will be discussed. That promise was made because NATO rightly felt
that forcibly disarming the KLA was unrealistic, and it needed
something to encourage the KLA to give up its heavy weapons
voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA, like virtually every ethnic Albanian in Kosovo, wants
an independent state, an option opposed by NATO nations, who are
wary of changing borders in the Balkans. But the National Guard
analogy removes the implication of Kosovo sovereignty, as American
states have them.
</P>
<P>
   Although its political leader has called for Serbs to return to
Kosovo, the KLA, or at least some of its units, is apparently
trying to strengthen the case for independence by driving out the
province's few remaining Serbs. There have already been many
incidents of ethnic Albanians' looting and destruction of Serbs'
homes, in at least one case while NATO peacekeepers stood by
awaiting reinforcements. This is inexcusable, and NATO's commander
has apologized. But there are not yet enough NATO peacekeepers in
Kosovo to protect Serbs from intimidation, beatings or worse. The
agreement will help by speeding KLA disarmament and warning Kosovar
Albanians that the international community will be considering
their behavior as it contemplates whether to allow the
establishment of an army.
</P>
<P>
   The long-range danger posed by the KLA is that its members could
turn Kosovo into a hard-line military dictatorship. While the KLA
is popular, many ethnic Albanians fear its rule, well aware of the
ruthlessness and criminal acts of some leaders and fighters. Kosovo
has plenty of competent civilians, many of whom spent years helping
to run a shadow government and are well prepared to lead. The deal
signed on Monday bars the guerrillas from setting up checkpoints
and conducting other military-style activities. NATO will be the
only military power, which should strengthen Kosovo's civilians.
</P>
<P>
   So far, fewer than half the promised NATO troops have reached
Kosovo, which leaves many villages unpatrolled and makes verifying
KLA demilitarization difficult. The remaining troops are urgently
needed, as Serbs are now deciding whether to stay in Kosovo or
leave. The chance for a multi-ethnic Kosovo soon may vanish
completely.

SENATE APPROVES BILL ON DUES PAYMENTS TO U.N. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to insert new 11th graf for elaboration, beginning: If the
legislation ... Inserts `chief' in 14th graf.)  (mk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate overwhelmingly approved a bill Tuesday
authorizing the payment of more than $800 million in back dues to
the United Nations but cutting future American contributions to the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has agreed to support the bill, after
deciding in the spring to drop its opposition to a provision that
requires the United States to reduce its share of the regular U.N.
budget from 25 percent to 20 percent. The administration reversed
its position as part of a deal to try to win confirmation for
Richard Holbrooke to the chief American diplomat's post at the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate vote to approve the overall bill, 98-1, does not mean
that the United Nations is about to receive a big check from
Washington. Far from it. The legislation, a $6.4 billion two-year
State Department spending bill, now moves to the House, where
conservative Republicans saddled a similar bill last year with
antiabortion language. That led to a veto by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are expected to try to resurrect an antiabortion
provision that would bar American aid from being provided to groups
that lobby abroad for abortion rights, raising the threat of
another veto.
</P>
<P>
   The bill approved by the Senate Tuesday would provide the United
Nations with $819 million in back dues over three years and forgive
$107 million that the organization owes the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The bill requires that in exchange for providing the money, the
United States would cut its overall contribution to the regular
U.N. budget to 20 percent, and the American share of the budget for
peacekeeping operations from 31 percent to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The reductions would be imposed unilaterally on the United
Nations, which is expected to balk at the provisions. The United
Nations has in the past opposed efforts by the United States to
trim its share of the organization's budget.
</P>
<P>
   After originally balking at the proposed cuts in the American
contribution to the U.N. budget and other conditions imposed on the
repayment of the back dues, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
agreed to support the legislation if only to secure Holbrooke's
confirmation as the U.S. representative at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional officials said the Republican chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Jesse Helms of North Carolina,
had threatened to block the nomination until he received Albright's
commitment to support the bill, which he sponsored along with Sen.
Joseph Biden of Delaware, the committee's ranking Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and the United Nations continue to argue over
exactly how much money is owed to the organization. According to
the United Nations, the United States owes about $1.6 billion; the
United States says the figure is closer to $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   If the legislation is adopted, the United States would open
negotiations with a special committee at the United Nations that
determines how much each of the member nations is billed for dues
each year. ``We'd go to them with the message that Congress won't
pay any more than 20 percent of the budget, and the committee will
have to find a way to deal with that,'' said a State Department
official.
</P>
<P>
   The only lawmaker to vote against the bill, Sen. Paul Sarbanes,
D-Md., said that it was wrong for the United States to impose
conditions on the repayment of its back dues. ``It's simply
unacceptable that the richest nation on earth is also the biggest
debtor to the United Nations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Biden said that the bill offers the only hope for repayment
of the back dues owed by the United States. ``In an ideal world I'd
like to pay our arrears to the United Nations in full with no
conditions,'' he said. But he added, ``Our choices are this or
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Holbrooke, who now seems assured of confirmation as
chief U.S. delegate to the United Nations, reaffirmed his support
of the provisions in the Senate bill and pledged to the Senate
``that I will make it my highest sustained priority to make it
work.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second of three days of confirmation hearings before the
Foreign Relations Committee, Holbrooke, a veteran diplomat and the
former American ambassador to Germany, said Tuesday that
``budgetary discipline will be my watchword.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed by the Senate also calls for $3 billion to be
spent over the next five years to step up security at American
embassies around the world, an amount requested by the Clinton
administration in the aftermath of the bombing last year of the
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.

EDITORIAL: BUDGET FINALE IN ALBANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, June 23: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Without the pressure of deadlines, Gov. George Pataki and the
legislature would be arguing about this year's New York State
budget until Halloween. But since a raft of previously enacted
Medicaid cost reductions are due to expire next Wednesday, wiping
out savings that state and local governments were counting on, a
strong incentive exists for all sides to reach an agreement soon.
In a welcome step, Sheldon Silver, speaker of the
democratic-controlled assembly, has scaled back his spending
demands. It remains for Pataki to compromise by dropping proposed
cuts in school aid and health care payments and promising not to
veto at least some of the items desired by the lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The stalemate results from an unusual set of financial
circumstances. Prosperity, particularly on Wall Street, has created
a state budget surplus of at least $2 billion. But because the
governor and the legislature have enacted budgets in past years
with tax cuts and expenses that balloon in size, the state is
projecting multibillion-dollar deficits in the future. Pataki was
thus in the odd position of demanding austerity for the lean years
ahead at a time when the state is flush. However prudent his
position might seem fiscally, it has not succeeded politically.
Even the Republican-controlled Senate has made it clear it would
reject the governor's proposed cuts in health and education.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's $73-billion budget, announced in January, was
punitive in many respects. It reneged on commitments to help New
York City, and its cuts in school aid, college tuition assistance
and payments to hospitals, nursing homes and health clinics hit New
Yorkers of modest means the hardest. Silver has been right to
oppose the worst of these cuts, but his opening bid of adding $2.6
billion in spending was too much for the governor and the state
Senate. His request is now said to be in the range of $1.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That seems like a reasonable number for Pataki to accept without
resorting to gimmicks or raiding independent state funds. The first
priority should be schools, especially in the city. The governor
and the legislature should then make sure that Medicaid
reimbursement rates are sufficient to maintain health care for the
poor and uninsured. There should be some funding also for vital
mental health programs, especially for potentially unstable people
released from mental hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers wondering why any cuts at all are necessary in
prosperous times need look no further than the enact-now, pay-later
strategy of their elected leaders. The governor's zeal for cutting
taxes is appreciated by voters, and he has indeed forced a
fundamental change in New York's fiscal policy. But New Yorkers
have also never been given an honest accounting when it comes to
tax cuts. At some point they will have to realize that the price
for tax cuts may be unacceptably large spending cuts in areas of
vital interest. First, the governor and the legislature have to get
through this year. A spirit of compromise would help.

TAX DEBATE, THIS TIME ON ONLINE COMMERCE, IS REBORN IN
WILLIAMSBURG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSBURG, Va. _ As Colonial Williamsburg, the reconstructed
capital of colonial Virginia, tries to broaden its appeal, its
3,500 employees operate by a new credo: enter the 21st century
without leaving the 18th.
</P>
<P>
   It means actors who portray colonial residents of the village
now tackle contemporary topics, like church-state relations. It
means the organization's lucrative catalog business is moving
beyond its collection of historical replicas to offer a new line of
casual, family-oriented home furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   And increasingly it means turning to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A federal commission on electronic commerce met here Monday and
Tuesday to debate whether to permit taxation of Internet shopping.
The dilemma is of great importance to Washington state, home to an
unusual concentration of electronic commerce businesses, but also
highly dependent on sales tax revenues to finance services such as
schools and police.
</P>
<P>
   The new commission, established and appointed by Congress, has
10 months to come up with a recommendation to Congress on whether,
and how, to tax sales made over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   To understand how widespread electronic commerce has become,
look at the role the Internet plays in promoting and funding this
tourist attraction, where 800 actors spend their days re-enacting a
time before electricity. The recording a caller to Colonial
Williamsburg hears when put on hold says it all: ``Need to send a
message to Colonial Williamsburg? Don't worry, the Internet has now
transcended time, reaching back into Colonial Williamsburg.''
</P>
<P>
   Log on to www.history.org, and you can buy a variety of
colonial-era collectibles: for $19.95, a hand-thrown bird bottle,
for $32 a salt-cured, hickory-smoked Virginia ham, for $3,675 an
oversized carpet like the ones Persian shahs sent to impress
European royalty. You have to dial a phone number to provide your
credit card number, but soon Williamsburg expects to move fully
online.
</P>
<P>
   Buy an item at one of the many gift shops here, and you must pay
Virginia's 4.5 percent sales tax. Buy the item via the Internet and
the tax isn't imposed.
</P>
<P>
   Tax policy always has been a hot debate in Williamsburg _ the
American Revolution arguably was triggered by colonial hostility to
British tax policy _ and the debate was reborn this week at the
307-year-old campus of the College of William and Mary, just down
the road from the colonial capitol where early Virginians debated
the controversial stamp tax.
</P>
<P>
   Among the questions facing the new commission: Should electronic
commerce sales be taxed? What about sales of digital goods, rather
than physical goods? How to simplify the taxation system?
</P>
<P>
   At this first meeting, Washington Gov. Gary Locke and Dallas
Mayor Ron Kirk led the charge against granting the electronic
commerce industry a blanket exemption from the sales tax on which
so many state and local governments depend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make sure that we're protecting and promoting the
growth of electronic commerce, but at the same time be cognizant of
the fact that so many local, county and state governments depend on
sales tax collections to pay for police, fire and schools,'' Locke
said.
</P>
<P>
   Locke warned that allowing a broad exemption from taxes for
Internet companies would not only disadvantage traditional
retailers, but also undermine government's ability to fund schools
as the percentage of commerce conducted over the Internet rises.
The Internet generated about $300 billion in revenue last year,
according to the University of Texas. Electronic commerce now
accounts for less than 1 percent of the nation's retail economy,
but is expected to grow rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our country is a world leader in technology ... because of the
education of the visionaries,'' Locke said. ``It would be ironic if
the growth of electronic commerce erodes our ability to educate the
innovators and leaders of tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirk warned that if sales tax revenues to state and local
governments fall, there will inevitably be a push to increase other
taxes, such as property and income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Several commissioners expressed skepticism about allowing any
taxation of Internet sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not here as tax collectors for the current tax
regimes,'' said commissioner Stanley Sokul, a consultant to the
Association for Interactive Media. ``The 13 colonies' first attempt
at government collapsed because of the states' parochial tax
motives.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, a clear majority of the commission seemed ready to
support allowing the taxation of goods sold over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe that physical-distribution stores should be
disadvantaged by tax advantages for e-commerce,'' said commissioner
David Pottruck, president of the Charles Schwab stock brokerage.
And John Sidgmore, vice chairman of MCI Worldcom, said the Internet
industry doesn't need special tax breaks and that ``it is not
feasible to tax Main Street differently from the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington state's e-commerce companies, which are not directly
represented on the coalition, although one member has worked as a
registered lobbyist for Microsoft, are divided over whether they
should be taxed.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which sells software and services over the Internet,
has joined an industry group called the Internet Tax Fairness
Coalition in expressing a willingness to pay sales taxes if they
are not higher than those imposed on traditional retailers and if
the nation's patchwork of sales tax systems is simplified, which is
likely to be a major focus of the commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry view is that we support a fair tax policy, an
administrable tax system, with certainty as a result,'' said Bruce
Reid, director of state and local tax policy for Microsoft, who
attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But Amazon.com, the giant Seattle-based online retailer, is more
reluctant to participate in sales taxes. The company collects sales
taxes from customers in Washington state, as required by law, but
not elsewhere in the country. Amazon is one of the largest
e-commerce companies in the world, with 10 million customers and
$610 million in sales last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would not want to see anything happen that makes it more
expensive for people to access the Internet or participate in
e-commerce,'' Bill Currie, an Amazon spokesman, said in a phone
interview. ``The benefits of online shopping are convenience, a
selection far greater than anything in the physical world, and
lower prices, and it would be a shame to see taxes on Internet
access or any other kind of Internet tax deprive people of
e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington, one of just a handful of states without an income
tax, derives 48 percent of its revenues from sales taxes. The
state's revenue director, Fred Kiga, said the state estimates it is
losing $150 million a year in tax revenue, of which as much as $25
million is uncollected taxes on Internet sales. The rest is is
uncollected taxes on catalog sales.

TERRORISM SUSPECT CHARGES AT JUDGE, BUT IS TACKLED 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: N.Y., Texas)   (bl)  
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A defendant in a federal terrorism case leaped out of
his chair in a Manhattan courtroom Tuesday and raced toward the
judge, yelling and causing chaos in the court before he was tackled
and subdued by a U.S. marshal.
</P>
<P>
   The accused terrorist, Wadih el-Hage, got to within about 10
feet of U.S. District Court Judge Leonard Sand, who had moved
behind his chair, as marshals swept into the well of the courtroom.
Some of them threw themselves on top of a second defendant, seated
in the jury box.
</P>
<P>
   One of the five defendants shouted ``Allah akhbar!'' _ Arabic
for ``God Is Great.'' The defendants, charged in connection with
terrorism against Americans, had been placed in the jury box for
the pretrial hearing before the judge because there was not enough
room at the crowded defense table.
</P>
<P>
   El-Hage and the other defendants were removed from the courtroom
after the incident, and were escorted back around 20 minutes later
in handcuffs and guarded by extra marshals. When el-Hage returned,
there were two bloody welts on the left side of his forehead.
</P>
<P>
   As he took his seat in the jury box, surrounded by marshals, he
shouted out again, saying he was angry that Sand had refused to
read aloud a letter he had sent to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many restrictions, too many restrictions,'' el-Hage called
out. ``I've never been part of any violent acts in my life.'' He
added: ``This is the first time I do this because of so many
restrictions. Keep on doing this and you turn this country into a
police country.''
</P>
<P>
   Sand said he would not read el-Hage's letter out loud because
the courtroom was not a ``vehicle for public declarations'' by the
defendants. He also cited the highly restrictive conditions under
which they are being held, barred from communicating with virtually
all outsiders. Federal rules allow prison officials to limit an
inmate's communications to prevent ``acts of violence and
terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge said he was concerned that the letter might contain
coded language, and he would therefore only summarize it. He said
el-Hage had contended that officials of the U.S. government could
have acted sooner, based on information they had, to prevent the
bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last August.
</P>
<P>
   Sand, asked by el-Hage's lawyer to release the letter, said
prosecutors would first have to review it to determine whether its
contents posed a threat.
</P>
<P>
   The late-morning incident occurred during legal arguments after
a routine arraignment of el-Hage and the four other defendants on a
new indictment in the government's investigation into the embassy
bombings and other acts of terrorism that prosecutors say were
orchestrated by the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   The government has described el-Hage, of Arlington, Texas, as
bin Laden's former secretary.
</P>
<P>
   The other defendants sat quietly during the incident, with one,
Ali Mohamed, a former sergeant in the U.S. Army, shaking his head
and looking grim.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Smilon, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White, said
that her office was reviewing the incident. He refused to comment
further.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors may be weighing additional charges against el-Hage
and Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali, who was accused by marshals of
grabbing at one of the marshals, tearing his suit jacket, to
prevent him from reaching el-Hage.
</P>
<P>
   El-Hage's lawyer, Sam Schmidt, said after the court session that
he could not conceive of his client intending to attack the judge,
saying it would be ``totally inconsistent with what I know of him
and what others have told me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's obviously very upset and under great stress,'' Schmidt
said, ``and I'm hopeful that in two days everybody will see the
letter and how innocuous the letter is that has caused this
brouhaha.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Joy, the lawyer for al-'Owhali, had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   When el-Hage bolted from his seat he was not far from an exit
door. But the U.S. marshal in Manhattan, Martin Burke, said his
deputies concluded that el-Hage was running in the direction of the
judge's bench before he was tackled by Deputy James Howard.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Rosenberg, a courtroom artist seated close to where el-Hage
was tackled, said: ``I was scared. I was shaking. I saw him jump
over the rail. He leaped like Tarzan.'' She grabbed her pastel box,
she said, and ducked behind her chair.
</P>
<P>
   Sand issued a statement through his secretary late Tuesday,
expressing ``admiration for how swiftly and ably the U.S. marshals
dealt with the incident.''

 &HT;    Attempted steal sends Lopez to disabled list
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A team already walking with a decided limp, the Braves
were staggering Tuesday after Javy Lopez, the club's hottest
hitter, was diagnosed with a sprained right knee. He will be placed
on the 15-day disabled list today and the club was undecided on who
would take his roster spot.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve catcher Eddie Perez, who started only his 19th game
Tuesday, is about to become a very busy man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I should have had another cheeseburger,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (Perez also needed medical attention Tuesday. A collision at the
plate left him with a bleeding eyebrow. He returned to the game.)
</P>
<P>
   Lopez just finished a .400 (10-for-25) road trip with five home
runs and nine RBIs in seven games, a stark contrast to Perez, a
career .265 hitter who was batting .222 entering Monday's game with
two RBIs and no homers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not disappointed. I'm frustrated,'' Lopez said. ``It's a
time I can say I'm hitting the ball the way I want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez went down attempting to steal second base on his own
Sunday night with the Braves leading Arizona 7-3 in the seventh. He
was easily thrown out and jammed his knee into the dirt short of
the base while trying to dodge Jay Bell's tag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked in here with no limp, no pain or anything,'' Lopez
said. ``I thought it was just a bruise or something. But they tell
me there's a sprain in there and that I should be careful. It could
get worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves will call up either Pascual Matos (.215, 0 HR, 12
RBIs) from Class AAA Richmond or Fernando Lunar (.235, 1 HR, 14
RBIs) from Class AA Greenville.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss waits
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Walt Weiss remained on the disabled list Tuesday,
though he was eligible to be activated. His left quadriceps has
been slow to respond to treatment and the team will not push him,
for fear the injury could worsen. Weiss has missed 21 of the last
24 games.All-Star update
</P>
<P>
   Updated tabulations on the NL All-Star voting did nothing to
improve the Braves' chances for a starting position. Third baseman
Chipper Jones has received more votes (281,265) than any Atlanta
player but is still running more than 75,000 behind Arizona's Matt
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez is running third at catcher behind New York's Mike Piazza
and Pittsburgh's Jason Kendall; Bret Boone is third at second base
behind Houston's Craig Biggio and Arizona's Jay Bell; and Weiss is
third at shortstop behind Cincinnati's Barry Larkin and New York's
Rey Ordonez. Andruw Jones is seventh and Brian Jordan ninth in
outfield balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Lockhart made his sixth start of the year at second base.
Starter Boone, who was 4-for-28 (.143) during the last road trip,
has lost 33 points off his average to .251. ... Former Brave Mike
Mordecai, in his second season with the Expos, has already
established career-highs this year with four homers and 14 RBIs in
his first 93 at-bats.

NBA SEEKING CHANGES IN RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ From the former Bad Boy point guard, Isiah Thomas, to
the take-no-prisoners coach, Pat Riley, a 16-member committee of
coaches, players and owners convened Tuesday with essentially one
job: to transform the roughhouse NBA back into an esthetically
appealing game.
</P>
<P>
   The overly physical and predictable nature of NBA play was
displayed for the committee in a video showed by Rod Thorn, the
league's senior vice president of operations.
</P>
<P>
   With forearm shivers and hip checks increasing, and scoring and
shooting percentages declining, the videotape of the NBA's
evolution over the last three decades and the discussion that
followed may have helped pave the way for some of the most
significant rule changes of the league's modern era.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crisis is a little strong, but there was a strong mandate from
our Board of Governors to try and make some improvements,'' Russ
Granik, the NBA's deputy commissioner, said. ``And that was
expressed up front by me to the committee today. There certainly
was a perceived need to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I think we all realize there are some problems we
need to address as far as how the game is played.''
</P>
<P>
   The videotape was not a watershed, Granik said. But he added
that showing the committee the evolution of officiating through the
last three decades was particularly effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sentiment was we have to have less contact,'' he said.
``As the game has evolved, there is too much contact away from the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the rule changes will not be made final until later
this summer, the committee came up with four significant proposals
during the all-day session at a midtown Manhattan hotel:
</P>
<P>
   _ Reduce contact below the foul line and away from the ball. The
usual grabbing, holding and impeding of progress that has become
ritual could cease by the 1999-2000 season. Players won't be
allowed to use their forearms when they are defending on the
perimeter, and officials will be instructed to call games more
closely. Players like Reggie Miller and Allan Houston would not
have to spend most of their time on offense fighting off their
defenders to get through and around screens, while teams that
clutch and grab in the lane, like Utah, would have to change some
of their approach. ``All the chucking in the lane, the having to
push off your guy to get a shot, we're going to try and do
something about that,'' Thorn said. ``Those kind of things could
eventually be considered fouls again.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The illegal defense guidelines will be made more
understandable so that coaches do not exploit them. ``The coaches
have caught up with the guidelines,'' Granik said. ``The feeling of
the coaches is that it's to their advantage to isolate a player on
the post the majority of the time in order to take advantage of the
illegal-defense guidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   _ A five-second rule will be added to stop the litany of players
who isolate themselves on one side of the court and then take
between 10 and 15 seconds off the shot clock to back their defender
into the post. With only five seconds to make a move, players such
as Charles Barkley and Mark Jackson may have to diversify their
games a bit.
</P>
<P>
   _ And, finally, a 14-second rule will most likely be added to
the game. Instead of the shot clock being reset to 24 seconds in
the front court after a foul or a violation, the committee proposed
that the clock be reset to 14 seconds if the amount of time left on
the shot clock is less than 14 seconds. If 20 seconds remained on
the shot clock, then the clock would be reset to 20 seconds. Thorn
justified the proposed change this way: ``The theory being that
once you get the ball into the front court, you don't need the
extra time in order to get up a shot and this would get you four or
five more possessions in the course of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee was unanimous in deciding against altering the
dimensions of the court, changing the configuration of the lane,
the location of the 3-point line or the 24-second clock, Thorn
said. Granik said the rule changes could be voted on by the Board
of Governors and put into effect as early as July, when the NBA's
Atlanta summer league begins.
</P>
<P>
   Among others serving on the committee are the broadcasters Hubie
Brown and Doug Collins; the players Antonio Davis, Greg Anthony and
Steve Smith and the general managers Dan Issel, Billy King, Kevin
McHale and Donnie Walsh. &QL;

SYMINGTON FRAUD CONVICTION OVERTURNED ON JUROR MATTER
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES KELLY 
 and JERRY KAMMER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bank and wire fraud convictions that pushed Gov. Fife Symington
from office two years ago were tossed out Tuesday by federal judges
who said a troublesome juror shouldn't have been dismissed while
the jury was deciding the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled juror Mary Jane
Cotey, then 74, should not have been replaced, although her fellow
jurors said she was too befuddled and obstinate to do her job.
</P>
<P>
   Symington, 53, who was sentenced to 2{ years in prison, may be
tried again on the original charges. He was free during the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The only sitting Arizona governor in history to be criminally
prose cuted, Symington reacted to the decision with quiet
jubilance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a great day,'' Symington told reporters at a
noon-hour press conference under a shade tree on the steps of a
political consulting firm near Third Avenue and Roosevelt Street.
``It may sound funny, but I always thought that we were right, but
I wasn't sure that was going to be enough for a reversal.''
</P>
<P>
   Symington cannot resume his term as governor, but he could run
for office again.
</P>
<P>
   During the press conference, Sy mington showed the
self-possessed style that has often led others to describe him as a
classic old-money Eastern blueblood.
</P>
<P>
   Casual in khaki pants and a button-down blue shirt, Symington
calmly said he believed he would ``do a lot better'' if he were to
be retried on the charges, and he hinted that he wouldn't
plea-bargain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm innocent, and I don't think you ever compromise
your principles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 9th Circuit's decision was the latest chapter _ and probably
not the last _ in the saga of Symington, scion of a wealthy
Maryland family whose career illustrates the boom-and-bust cycles
of business and politics in modern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Symington ap peared to be a high-flying developer.
In 1991, he was elected governor. In ensuing years, his
developments foundered. In 1995, he declared bankruptcy. In 1996,
he was in dicted on 23 counts of bank fraud, wire fraud, attempted
extortion and perjury.
</P>
<P>
   During a four-month trial two years ago, prosecutors alleged
Symington had lied desperately to try to rescue his collapsing
projects in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, they said, he misled banks about his net worth
in order to get new loans and avoid paying old ones, running his
debts up over $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Symington said the flaws in his financial statements were
mistakes that should have been noted and brought to his attention
by his accountants.
</P>
<P>
   After eight days of deliberations, members of the jury
complained about Cotey to U.S. District Court Judge Roger Strand.
They said she was inattentive, confused about the evidence, and
unbending when she took a position.
</P>
<P>
   Strand ruled that she was unwill ing or unable to continue with
deliberations and replaced her with an alternate. The jury began
its deliberations again.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 3, 1997, Symington was convicted of seven counts of
bank and wire fraud, but one of those convictions was later tossed
out by the judge. Prior to the verdict, the judge had dismissed two
counts. The jury deadlocked on 11 counts and found Symington not
guilty of three counts.
</P>
<P>
   Symington appealed his convic tions, saying his right to an
impar tial jury had been violated.
</P>
<P>
   On a 2-1 vote, the 9th Circuit agreed.
</P>
<P>
   A judge cannot drop a juror for being unwilling to deliberate if
there is a reasonable possibility that the reason is the juror's
views, the court said. Instead, the judge must declare a mistrial
or order more delibera tions, it said.
</P>
<P>
   ``While there may have been some reason to doubt Cotey's abili
ties as a juror, there was also considerable evidence to suggest
that the other jurors' frustrations with her derived primarily from
the fact that she held a position oppo site to theirs on the merits
of the case,'' said Judge Betty Fletcher, who wrote the majority
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Judge James Fitzgerald, who dis sented, said there was
overwhelming evidence to back up Strand's conclu sion that Cotey
was failing to take part in deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   The lead prosecutor in the case said his office will consider
whether to ask for further review of the case or, possibly, to
refile charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're obviously disappointed with the majority's opinion,''
said David Schindler, assistant U.S. at torney in Los Angeles,
whose office handled the Symington case. ``We also feel bad for the
12 jurors who worked so diligently.''
</P>
<P>
   Schindler's office must now de cide from among several options:
ask for review by the entire 9th Circuit panel, appeal directly to
the U.S. Supreme Court, retry the case in Arizona, or drop the
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have to analyze the Ninth Circuit's opinion and decide
whether to seek further review,'' he said. He also turned aside
specula tion that the office might decide to trim the case down.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we retry the case, it is my expectation that we would keep
all the counts'' on which the jury returned guilty verdicts as well
as the counts on which the jury hung, he said.
</P>
<P>
   John Dowd, Symington's chief defense attorney, said he was de
lighted with the 9th Circuit rul ing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just very happy the system worked,'' said Dowd from his
office in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   He said he will ask the prosecutors to drop the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough is enough,'' he said. ``There is a very serious issue
of fairness and justice here. This man has lost public office, and
he and his family have expended a king's ransom. The government has
expended enormous resources too.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to respond to Dowd's statement that the case should be
ended, Schindler said he saw only one way to end it quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always said that if Mr. Symington is willing to plead
guilty to felonies, we are willing to listen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, juror Harold Thomp son said he also thought Strand
was right and reacted with shock to the 9th Circuit decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe it,'' said Thomp son. ``If they were going to
over throw it, at least they could have had a good reason. I don't
know how in the world they thought Mary Jane Cotey was a good
reason. I know what she said and I know what she did, and I know it
was the right thing to dismiss her from that trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Marla Hackett, an alternate juror in the trial, also said she
disagreed with the appellate court's decision because she viewed
Cotey as eccen tric.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that unfortunately she may have some problems,''
Hackett said. ``From the outset, she was disruptive. She was
bringing news papers in. She was doing everything we were told not
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett added that the ruling ``sets a different set of
standards for people with money, position and influence and it just
leaves the general public (with a) justice system that just serves
the well-off.''
</P>
<P>
   Cotey, however, said she felt the Appeals Court decision
vindicated her and was a just one for Syming ton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not proven in court that he was guilty of those
charges,'' Cotey said, ``and he did not cheat anyone out of
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Cotey has said that before to reporters, but at times has contra
dicted herself, saying she might have voted to convict Symington on
some charges.
</P>
<P>
   Gerard Lynch, a professor at Columbia Law School, said cases
involving questionable jurors always create a quandary: Is the
juror incompetent or just hardheaded?
</P>
<P>
   ``The holdout juror is the hero of the system. Twelve Angry Men,
right?'' Lynch said. ``Right or wrong . . . the holdout takes his
posi tion. The problem is, it's very difficult to separate out
who's crazy or not.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the phenomenon usually occurs during
deliberations, where ``one sees just about every kind of weirdness
you can imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the trial judge is closer to the situation, Lynch said,
``It's unusual for an appellate court to second-guess what a trial
judge decides.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Fletcher's vote to overturn was not entirely unexpected,
based on her approach to the case when the three-judge panel heard
oral arguments on the Symington appeal last November in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Fletcher raised strong doubts about Cotey's dis
missal.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher cited ``a disturbing kind of dialogue'' between Cotey
and the other jurors, who had complained to the trial judge that
she was unable to maintain focus on their discus sions.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher asked federal prosecutors how willing the trial judge
should have been to believe the 11 other Symington jurors, who
complained in a closed hearing about Cotey's inability to fulfill
her duties as a juror.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much do we need to credit jurors who say that she isn't
basing it (her opinion) on the evidence?'' asked Fletcher, who at
76 is the same age as Cotey. ``She could come out of the last day
of evidence in the courtroom, and she knows that it's a thin case,
and she's just not going to convict on it. Now, there is nothing
wrong with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher then noted that other jurors had pressed Cotey to
explain her positions onthe case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Must she give her reasons?'' she asked. And if Cotey had
agreed with the other jurors, she asked, would the other jurors
have sought explanations?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they might have,'' federal prosecutor George Cardona
replied, prompting Fletcher to retort quickly, ``Would they be
entitled to do that?''
</P>
<P>
   Then Fletcher said, ``This is a very disturbing kind of dialogue
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Symington defense attorney Ter ence Lynam argued that the real
reason the jurors were frustrated was that Cotey wanted to acquit
Symington of all charges.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Cardona said the panel should defer to the judgment
of Strand because the judge had ``very carefully listened'' to all
12 jurors in separate discussions before dismiss ing Cotey.
</P>
<P>
   Symington said Tuesday that his view of Cotey was that ``the
person who was standing against the tide got run off the jury.''
</P>
<P>
   Symington lauded Cotey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember reading stories at the time when she was run off
the jury that she was being pictured as sort of out of it, and off
base, and all kinds of derogatory comments. She was right, and
she's just a very courageous person, and I admire her.'' &QL;

EDITORIAL: LOAN FOR A LAND GRAB 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, June 23: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank's board of executive directors ought to reject a
loan package to China that would be used to relocate about 58,000
impoverished Chinese and Hui Muslim farmers to a remote area on the
Tibetan plateau traditionally inhabited by Tibetans and Mongolians.
In the past, China has used migration policies to tighten control
over Tibetan areas and to diminish the viability of the distinct
Tibetan culture. The World Bank should not be in the business of
financing this destructive scheme.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government has rejected criticism of the project and
insists on going forward. But approving this loan may violate the
bank's own guidelines for assessing the social and environmental
impacts of its projects. Dozens of international environmental
groups, Tibetan activists and 60 members of Congress have written
to James Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank, to oppose the
resettlement. The Clinton administration has also announced its
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The ostensible purpose of the project is to give desperately
poor farmers in western China a better life. But this plan would
move them from badly eroded land to a barren high-altitude plain,
currently used by nomads, that is itself environmentally fragile.
Even though the project would involve construction of a dam and
extensive irrigation works, it did not receive a full environmental
assessment. Nor does it appear that the plan fully complies with
World Bank policies designed to protect ethnic minorities and
indigenous peoples from the adverse effects of development.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank has worked hard to overcome its reputation for
insensitivity to local cultural and ecological concerns. Approval
of this loan would be a significant step backward.

EDITORIAL: PROTECTIONISM AND THE AMERICAN STEEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, June 23: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It appears that the Senate may not go along with the House of
Representatives in voting to impose import quotas to protect the
steel industry. That is a welcome rebuff to protectionist impulses
that remain strong even while the American economy is booming.
</P>
<P>
   A procedural vote in the Senate Tuesday indicated that
supporters of the quota bill, which was passed by the House
overwhelmingly earlier this year, do not have enough support to
push the bill through. Only 42 senators voted to cut off debate and
force a vote, far fewer than the 60 needed.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would impose quotas on steel imports, in direct
violation of the country's obligations as a member of the World
Trade Organization. It would be likely to damage the nation's
economy both by provoking retaliation and by hurting the exports of
American products that include steel.
</P>
<P>
   The steel industry nonetheless has scored some major successes
in its efforts to keep out inexpensive foreign steel that flooded
into this country after the Asian economic crisis slashed demand
for steel in other countries. Responding to the pressure, the
Clinton administration has aggressively sought to enforce
anti-dumping laws, which allow high tariffs on products sold either
below the cost of production or for less than the exporting country
charges at home. This week, Commerce Secretary William Daley
announced more dumping investigations. The result of such efforts,
combined with incipient Asian recovery, has been a sharp fall in
steel imports.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of world recession has eased since last summer. But
such countries as Argentina, Brazil and Indonesia, which are
targeted in the latest round of dumping investigations, are in
recession, and efforts to dampen their exports could weaken their
economies even further. While the Commerce Department should
enforce the law, it should take care not to act unfairly just to
pacify a politically powerful domestic steel industry.

B.C. GOVERNMENT SETS ASIDE 3.35 MILLION ACRES FOR PARK LANDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Under fire from environmentalists, the British Columbia
government on Tuesday responded by preserving 3.35 million acres of
land, creating 35 new provincial parks and expanding several
existing parks.
</P>
<P>
   But while protecting key wild valleys and wildlife habitat
across northern B.C., the government did not designate much new
parkland along the U.S.-Canada border _ where extensive logging is
taking place near or adjacent to parks and wilderness areas in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty grim (along the border),'' said Joe Scott,
conservation director of the Northwest Ecosystem Alliance, a
Bellingham, Wash.-based conservation group. Scott recently found
logging and road building in the Pasayten River, just over the
border from Washington's largest wilderness area.
</P>
<P>
   Only one small area near the boundary was protected in Tuesday's
announcement. A portion of the historic Dewdney and Whatcom trails
_ which led from Bellingham to the Cariboo gold fields of British
Columbia _ will be added to Manning Provincial Park.
</P>
<P>
   But overall, British Columbia environmentalists had much to
cheer about Tuesday. The government's announcement brings to 11.3
percent the area of British Columbia that is now preserved in
parks, wilderness conservancies or ecological reserves. Only 6.6
percent of the province was protected at the start of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   British Columbia Premier Glen Clark hinted that the government
may go beyond its goal of protecting 12 percent of the province's
land. ``Twelve percent is a goal, but not a ceiling,'' Clark told a
briefing in Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   ``By no means is what the government's doing perfect, but they
are following through in what they have chosen to protect,'' said
Bill Wareham, executive director of the Sierra Club of British
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Clark has been under fire from the province's more radical
environmental groups for easing regulations on loggers under the
new Forest Practices Code. The British Columbia timber industry
endured severe cutbacks last year after losing markets in Asia's
economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bits and pieces are put into parks and, in return, industry
gets speeded-up access to other places,'' Joy Foy of the Western
Canada Wilderness Committee, a frequent critic of the government,
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The places preserved may not be household words, but the parks
announced in British Columbia Tuesday are particularly important
for wildlife. These include:
</P>
<P>
   _Northern Rockies: A 1.6 million-acre park in the northern Rocky
Mountains, near Fort Nelson, will protect a portion of the largest
unroaded area in North America south of the Yukon. Taking in the
Muskwa and Prophet rivers, it is an area where the relationships of
predators to prey have not been altered by human intrusion.
</P>
<P>
   A nearby 230,000-acre preserve, Denetiah Park, also protects a
predator-prey environment of moose, caribou, stone's sheep,
mountain goats, wolves and grizzly bears.
</P>
<P>
   _Nahatlatch River: A low-elevation valley, just west of the
Fraser River canyon north of Hope, is part of the most healthy
remaining grizzly valley in southwest British Columbia. The park
protects a major wetland.
</P>
<P>
   _Babine River: A new park in northern B.C. will protect a
52-mile stretch of the Babine River, major sockeye salmon and
steelhead habitat in the Skeena River system, the province's second
largest fishery.
</P>
<P>
   _Brackendale Eagles: A park near Squamish, south of the Whistler
ski resort, will preserve a section of the Squamish River that is a
major winter bald eagle habitat.
</P>
<P>
   _Kakwa: Located about 50 miles northwest of Jasper, an expanded
410,000-acre Kakwa Provincial Park protects a wilderness section of
the Rocky Mountains considered equally beautiful to crowded, nearby
national parks.
</P>
<P>
   _Spipyus: A small new park on the Sechelt Peninsula, north of
Vancouver, protects about 8,500 acres of old-growth forst and prime
habitat for the marbled murrelet, an endangered sea bird.
</P>
<P>
   _Entiako River: The province has protected 115,000 acres of
caribou winter range in the Entiako River valley, on the east
slopes of the Coast Mountains. The new area is adjacent to
Tweedsmuir Park, the province's largest protected area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not finished yet,'' Clark declared Tuesday. The premier
described the new parks, which will be formally established by the
B.C. Legislature, as ``the strongest possible measure government
can take to ensure preservation of these areas for future
generations.''
</P>
<P>
   But conservationists noted that areas along the border have
largely been cut out of British Columbia's rapid park creation.
</P>
<P>
   The provincial government is planning to allow logging of
Eighteen Mile and Twentymile creeks, two wilderness tributaries of
the Skagit River just north of the border. An additional 240 acres
of clearcutting is planned in already heavily logged Depot Creek,
the upper reaches of which are parts of America's North Cascades
National Park.
</P>
<P>
   The Pasayten River is of major concern. It runs into the
Similkameen River, which recrosses the U.S.-Canada border and feeds
into the Okanogan River. Salmon runs of the Okanogan River were
recently classified as endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``The river runs crystal clear when it crosses into Canada,''
Scott said. ``Within three miles, due to erosion from logging and
roads, the water is brown.''

DR. LOUIS R. WASSERMAN, 88, AUTHORITY ON BLOOD  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dr. Louis Robert Wasserman, an authority on the
diagnosis and treatment of blood diseases and the founder of one of
the nation's foremost hematology training programs, died on Monday
at Danbury Hospital in Connecticut. He was 88 and lived in Sandy
Hook, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Wasserman's association with New York's Mount Sinai Medical
Center and School of Medicine as a physician, teacher and
researcher spanned nearly 60 years, and the hematology program he
established there has attracted specialists from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote or collaborated on some 200 papers on the red blood
cell, iron metabolism and the remediation of blood disorders
through radiation, antibiotics and nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   One of Wasserman's most important contributions was his research
into polycythemias, a class of disorders that occur when the bone
marrow oversupplies the blood with red cells, resulting in a wide
array of abnormalities.
</P>
<P>
   Wasserman led an international study group that established the
standards for the treatment of polycythemia vera, to the benefit of
thousands of patients. The American Society of Hematology gave his
name to a lectureship.
</P>
<P>
   A native New Yorker, Wasserman graduated from Harvard College in
1931 and received his medical degree at Rush Medical College of the
University of Chicago in 1935. Two years later he joined the staff
of Mount Sinai Hospital as a research fellow in hematology.
</P>
<P>
   He directed its division of hematology from 1953 to 1972 and was
named to the faculty of the medical school when it was organized in
the 1960s. He was chairman of its department of clinical science
from 1967 to 1972, when he became the school's second Distinguished
Service Professor. He was appointed to the Albert A. and Vera G.
List Professorship of Medicine in 1977, and was named its emeritus
professor when he retired in 1979. He continued his investigations,
writings and editing well into the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Wasserman was a member of many professional organizations, and
held such leadership positions as president of the American Society
of Hematology and vice president of its international affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 42 years, Julia Wheeler Wasserman,
and a sister, Natalie W. Wolf, of Newbury, N.H.

A COUNTRY NOW READY TO LISTEN  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 27) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER WATROUS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Late one night a few years ago, Robert Ferris Thompson, who as a
professor of African and African-American Arts at Yale University
is considered the dean of African studies in the New World, was at
S.O.B.'s, the Manhattan club whose name stands for Sounds of
Brazil. He was standing next to an English rock critic. ``What am I
doing in this white skin?'' the critic asked in a moment of
self-doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson laughs about the story, but he uses it to help explain
the endless interracial and transcultural movements that have
occurred since Columbus arguably began the mulatto civilization of
the Americas, one based on the triumvirate of the Native-American,
African and European cultures. It's a triumvirate that undergoes
seismic readjustment once in a while, and at the end of the
millennium it's undergoing a big one, with the main producer of
cultural product, the United States, suddenly seeing itself
differently.
</P>
<P>
   After 500 years of denying the family's Hispanic hue, the
Anglo-Saxon United States is recognizing its darker cousin. And one
way Americans are doing so is by consuming Latin culture,
especially its music.
</P>
<P>
   ``What took so long? is the question I always ask,'' Thompson
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the change in both the way Latin culture
is perceived and the way Latin culture represents itself was
inevitable. Centuries of immigration, from Mexico and Central
America, have altered American life, from what we eat to how we
talk. The influx of Puerto Ricans, Cubans and Dominicans over the
last century has profoundly changed the face of New York City and
the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Latinos, it's often noted, will become the dominant minority in
the United States in the next several years. It seems logical,
therefore, that second- and third-generation Latino immigrants,
tugged between the country's various cultural poles, should have
come to some conclusion about how to exist in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting more and more requests from Latinos who are young
and don't speak Spanish that well,'' said Bruce Polin, the owner of
Descarga.com, the leading online retailer for tropical Latin music.
``These are people who may have grown up listening to Led Zeppelin
and the Who and suddenly realize that the music of their parents,
and by extension their own culture, is pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   For Emilio Estefan, one of the most successful Latin pop
producers in the United States and an architect of the current
sound of high-gloss Latin pop (his wife is the singer Gloria
Estefan), the change has been radical.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started out, 20 years ago, people in the music industry
told me to get rid of the congas and horns on my records, if they
bothered to talk to me at all,'' he said. ``Now, if I had a dollar
for every time a record label head has called me in the last few
years, I'd be rich. In two years the entire way the music industry
relates to Latinos has completely changed. I'm really proud to be a
Latino. It's our time.''
</P>
<P>
   From Puerto Rico to the Texas border, Latinos are flowering in
circumstances markedly different from those their parents knew.
Fifty years ago a Mexican-American child was caned for speaking
Spanish in school; today, try not speaking Spanish in the Rio Grand
Valley and see how far you get.
</P>
<P>
   In Puerto Rico today there's a debate brewing about recouping
what's left of its culture, and there are more groups playing
bombas and plenas, the local rhythms of Puerto Rico, than there
have been in years. As these Latin populations grow in the United
States, and the effects of prejudice slowly slip away, it isn't
surprising that a talented, bilingual group of performers _ from
Selena to the extraordinary salsa singer Victor Manuelle, and
including Ricky Martin, Jennifer Lopez, India and Marc Anthony _
should appear, along with an audience that wants to hear the music.
The law of averages is in such performers' favor.
</P>
<P>
   While there is a tendency to see the huge success of Ricky
Martin as indicative of the crosscultural appeal of Latin
performers, it has to be remembered that his current hit, ``Livin'
La Vida Loca,'' apart from the title, is in English. But the
success of the Grammy-winning album ``Buena Vista Social Club''
points to an audience different from the one Martin is reaching.
</P>
<P>
   The album, a collection of pre-revolutionary Cuban songs
performed by a group of elderly musicians, was marketed in the
United States with the so-called National Public Radio audience in
mind _ a well-educated and mostly well-off group. Sales have been
strong (nearly a half-million in this country), suggesting that
there is a large, disenfranchised audience in America looking for
something new.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from East St. Louis, which is arguably the blackest
city in America,'' said Warrington Hudlin, a filmmaker who heads
out to salsa shows regularly. ``What I know is that modern black
pop, especially hip-hop, has very little in it that reflects my
culture. I go to salsa shows because salsa hasn't abandoned the
dancers. That interaction between live musicians and the dancer is
essential to black music, and it doesn't exist in hip-hop. It's
sad.''
</P>
<P>
   David Bither, a senior vice president of Nonesuch Records, which
has been the marketing force behind the ``Buena Vista Social Club''
in the United States, agrees. ``Nothing's happening in
English-speaking pop,'' he said. ``I'm 44, and I grew up on pop
music, and I haven't cared about anything I've heard in 10 or 15
years. I've remained interested in music, but I'm not interested in
music made and marketed for 18-year-olds. If you still love music,
and freshness and honesty, you don't have that many places to go.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bither has a point. Perhaps the reason that Latin music in its
various forms is appealing to English-speaking intellectuals and
trend setters is that much of American rock is simply less
interesting than it once was. A resolutely suburban music, rock is
as ahistorical as the suburbs themselves, and it has lost any sense
of time or place.
</P>
<P>
   The punk esthetic, which elevated the amateur, has contributed
to the incompetence of musicians; much of the songwriting has been
reduced to the self-absorbed whining of suburban children. How much
complaining can a person stand? Hip-hop, for all its rhythmic
pleasures and sense of humor, has replaced sensuality with
sexuality, and as a consequence has remained the music of
adolescents.
</P>
<P>
   All of pop, black and white, whether it be country music or
hip-hop, is parochial. America has so dominated global
entertainment over the last 100 years that a byproduct of the
so-called American century is that American producers of mainstream
pop culture have become utterly uninterested in other cultures,
ages, places or experiences, if not completely unaware of them.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the wells that gave rise to so much American music
have seemingly dried up. Blues culture is dead. Country has been
deracinated, and gospel has seemingly little more to offer than the
already heard.
</P>
<P>
   The opposite is happening in music across Latin America. There,
the information explosion in the form of MTV and the Internet has
made awareness of new ideas more possible than ever before, often
in places that only a few years ago saw the world through virtually
pre-Columbian eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian pop, in particular, is enjoying an extraordinary
period of creativity. Carlinhos Brown's new album is an amalgam of
everything from Bahaian drumming to Beatles melodies. Caetano
Veloso's last studio album integrates the sound of Europe in its
orchestrations with the drum-based sound of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Bloque, a group from Colombia, combines rock with native Indian
and African rhythms; indeed, there's an entire movement of
Colombian musicians merging African styles like soukous and juju
with indigenous Colombian music. Hip-hop shows up in Mexican pop,
but performed in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, which has been cut off from much of the world by a
repressive government and an American blockade, musicians are
blending their own music with the limited information they get from
outside.
</P>
<P>
   There is a sense throughout Latin music that new technology and
improved communications are contributing to an unprecedented
cross-fertilization of styles. As a consequence, Latin musicians
are engaging in a kind of creative balancing act. They want to make
music that is both international yet true to their own cultural
identity. The results have amounted to some of the most powerful
pop music around.
</P>

   David Byrne, who was a master of American pop as the leader of
the Talking Heads in the 1980s, has changed his career and become,
among other things, the owner of Luaka Bop, a record company that
specializes in world music.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole Anglo-Saxon `Don't touch yourself, don't have a good
time or God will smack you upside the head' idea is such a big part
of America that drives Americans crazy,'' he said in an interview.
``People who have grown up here sense that something's missing, not
only in music but in our culture, and are looking to replace what's
missing to make their lives fuller.''
</P>
<P>
   This new interest in Latin music may have something to do with a
kind of millennial insecurity, with Americans longing for music
more rooted in a certain place and produced more honestly. If
American music has become narrow in scope and repetitive, then
Latin music at its best sounds ample, literate and international _
part of a polyglot future.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a transcendental, religious quality to the music
that at the dawn of the next millennium is clearly attracting
people. ``Do you sense religiosity in rock?'' asked Thompson of
Yale. ``Mambo, salsa and merengue constantly make reference to the
saints of Yoruba religion. When Machito sang a tune that made
reference to religion, he was suddenly using sacred medicine; he
wasn't just an anonymous black man lost in an angry sea of America.
Maybe people are looking for guidance. There's power in that sort
of conviction, and it comes across.''

 &HT;    Banged-up Braves fall to Expos
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It is true the Braves lost to Montreal 2-1 Tuesday
night. It is not true the club has established a new statistical
category: body count.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Maddux (6-5) gave up two runs (one earned) in seven
innings, allowing eight hits with two walks and three strikeouts.
But it was first baseman Randall Simon's throwing error that
allowed Manny Martinez to score the deciding run from second base
on an infield single in the fifth that decided the night.
</P>
<P>
   The more pressing issue was whether the Braves would have enough
players to finish the game. Javy Lopez is headed for the disabled
list, Brian Jordan was taken out by a fastball to the right wrist
and Eddie Perez was bloodied but unbowed in the first of 17 games
against NL East clubs. At this rate, they'll call their own blood
drive by week's end.
</P>
<P>
   With catcher Javy Lopez slated for the disabled list with a knee
sprain, the Braves watched Brian Jordan leave the game after five
innings. He was struck in the right wrist by Montreal starter Mike
Thurman in the fourth. X-rays were negative, and Jordan is listed
as day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Eddie Perez went down in the sixth after a collision
with Montreal rookie Michael Barrett opened a gash next to his
right eye. Barrett attempted to score from third on a chopper by
Orlando Cabrera and crashed into Perez's shoulder, catching him in
the head with his batting helmet and leaving Perez dripping blood
down the side of his face. With Lopez unavailable and no other
catcher on the roster, the game was held up more than five minutes
while the wound was bandaged.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux was cleaning up after himself most of the night. He
allowed five hits and nine baserunners in the first five innings,
five reaching scoring position. The Expos didn't catch up to him
until two out in the fifth, when Vladimir Guerrero sent a
check-swing bouncer down the first base line.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Randall Simon failed to backhand the ball deep behind the
base, allowing Thurman to score from third, and Simon compounded
the misplay by throwing wildy at Maddux covering first with little
chance of catching Guerrero. The ball skipped across the infield,
letting Manny Martinez come home with an unearned run for a 2-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves appeared on the verge of reaching Thurman in the
fourth, when Chipper Jones opened the inning with a double, just
his third extra-base hit in 33 at-bats. Thurman followed with a
fastball that rode in on Jordan, striking him flush on the back of
the right hand, a team-high fifth time Jordan has been struck by a
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   But Ryan Klesko bounced into a double play and Andruw Jones, who
is just 6-for-30 with a runner at third and two out, popped out
weakly to Cabrera in shallow left field.

THE HUMBLING OF THE MEGASTARS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 27) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Julia RoBerts, in a television interview promoting her hit movie
``Notting Hill'' recently, said she could slip out of the house and
go unrecognized at the market and the laundromat. The laundromat?
When was the last time anyone making $20 million a film went to a
laundromat?
</P>
<P>
   Let's not quibble about the details (even in cramped New York
City, plenty of middle-class people have washers and dryers in
their buildings). What matters is that Julia Roberts wants the
public to think she goes to the laundromat, just like them.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy echoes the plot of ``Notting Hill,'' in which the
Roberts character, a movie star, walks into the life of a bookish,
ordinary man played by Hugh Grant and decides to stay, prodding the
audience to think: aren't we lucky to be average?
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Roberts does more than that. On the screen and while
promoting the film, she offers a prime example of how the concept
of fame has shifted in the past decade. Her strategy suggests the
answer to an essential question: what happens now that Andy
Warhol's ``everyone will be famous for 15 minutes'' has become a
cultural cliche? Today the Warholian trajectory of fame has been
reversed: instead of the ordinary becoming famous, the famous seem
to become more ordinary, more like us.
</P>
<P>
   In entertainment, politics and social mores, the high and mighty
are tumbling all around us, or so true celebrities would have us
think. Martha Stewart may have her own television show and
magazine, but she also has a line of products at K-Mart, suggesting
she goes bargain-hunting, too. Prince Edward chooses to be known as
Edward Windsor, television producer, as if he were a commoner.
</P>
<P>
   This apparent reversal of fame is, of course, an illusion. The
popularity of Tom Brokaw's best-selling book ``The Greatest
Generation'' comes partly from its flattering concept that the
average American soldier in World War II, who returned to a most
ordinary life, is the truest hero. But would the book be selling
nearly as well without its famous anchorman author?
</P>
<P>
   Fame's post-Warhol era owes a great deal to cable television,
which in its rush to fill time with personalities (from CNN
profiles to A&AMP;E's ``Biography'') makes the famous familiar. An
exploding media culture also fosters the myth that everybody is an
insider, whether they're inside show business (with television
shows like ``Entertainment Tonight'' and magazines like
Entertainment Weekly) or big business (financial news channels like
CNBC).
</P>
<P>
   And the downward spiraling of fame would seem likely to expand
with the Internet, that great equalizer, which allows any
computer-literate nobody to become somebody with a Web site. This
leveling is yet another fantasy; let's face it, Bill Gates' Web
site will always be bigger than yours.
</P>
<P>
   However much it is based on illusion, though, the new attitude
is a real cultural force, profoundly altering the way we think
about celebrity. If everyone is inside, no one is outside; if
everyone is famous, no one is famous.
</P>
<P>
   To appreciate how radical a shift this is, look at Salman
Rushdie's current novel, ``The Ground Beneath Her Feet.'' The
narrator describes a rock star at the moment her celebrity begins,
back in the late 1960s. ``Her dark skin had a burnished quality to
it: a heightening,'' he says. ``It was a gleam created by the
brilliant gaze of the public eye, the first rough licks of the
tigerish tongue of fame.''
</P>
<P>
   What a quaint notion! The novel is one of the most serious and
artful dissections of fame in recent years, dazzling on its own
terms. But its view of celebrity seems a beat behind the times. It
may be true to the period of the heroine's success, the '60s
through the '80s, but now megastars go out of their way to pretend
they're not glowing at all.
</P>
<P>
   Princess Diana was the transforming figure in this fake
democratization of fame. Despite the fairy tale imagery and glamour
that surrounded her, one of the pivotal Diana images is the
videotape, replayed endlessly on cable television, of the princess
in exercise clothes driving herself to and from the gym.
</P>
<P>
   Surely the royals could have installed an exercise room in some
palace or other if she had wanted one. But Diana was sending a
message that she preferred to be ``normal.'' Bulimia and a bad
marriage, even more than glamour, were the true secrets of her
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   When Prime Minister Tony Blair called her ``the people's
princess'' soon after her death, it was brilliant: the phrase is
pure oxymoron, an illogical combination that perfectly reflects
Diana's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Following Diana, fame itself has become a newly charged subject.
The heroine of the Rushdie novel, the rock star Vina Apsara,
inspires Diana-like, media-crazed mourning when she dies. And the
idea that the paparazzi had hounded Diana to death gave Peter
Galassi, the Museum of Modern Art's chief curator of photography,
the impetus for a new exhibit that considers the cultural import of
celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fame After Photography,'' opening at the museum on July 8,
charts how photographic images have altered the way the public
regards and interacts with fame.
</P>
<P>
   As the show's curators, Marvin Heiferman and Carole Kismaric,
explained in a recent interview, the distance between the famous
and the ordinary has shifted back and forth as it has evolved from
19th-century still portraits through television and Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s, for instance, magazines like Life and the old
Vanity Fair created glamorized images of movie stars, who had
already seemed larger than life on screen. Television brought an
immense change, as even movie stars literally became smaller and
more accessible. They were visitors to our homes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the television clips in the MOMA show (displayed on
monitors throughout the exhibit) is the 1950s Edward R. Murrow
interview series ``Person to Person,'' in which viewers got to
return the visit and enter the homes of the famous (and an eminent
war reporter chatted up celebs long before the shaky line between
news and entertainment became a concern).
</P>
<P>
   Other clips feature the game show ``Queen for a Day,'' in which
contestants told sob stories and the most pathetic person won a
major prize like a new kitchen. The losers got a prize, too: a
bottle of a perfume called Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Even as fame was being passed around in a bottle, though, the
distance between the celebrated and the ordinary still seemed a
vast expanse the average person could scarcely hope to cross. Among
the exhibit's more recent artifacts is the jacket to Jane Fonda's
early 1980s workout videotape, which suggests that ordinary people
can look like a star. As Ms. Kismaric said, ``The barrier between
`us' and `them' gets thinner and thinner,'' over the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While ``Fame After Photography'' charts the history of celebrity
within the museum's walls, its evolution goes on all around us.
Fame has become a series of vanishing lines. Though the difference
between the celebrated and the average only seems to be
diminishing, for the famous some lines are genuinely blurring:
between public and private lives, politics and show business,
notoriety and fame.
</P>
<P>
   In this era of ever faster and more relentless media, the famous
morph from one kind of celebrity to another in a flash. Jesse
Ventura translates minor fame as a wrestler into a job as a radio
talk-show host, parlays that into his election as governor of
Minnesota, then is played by an actor in a bad NBC television movie
based on his life, all in a few quick years.
</P>
<P>
   O.J. Simpson's resume is a catalogue of how fluid celebrity is:
football hero and star of television commercials, accused murderer
and star of his own endlessly televised trial. However dimmed his
star, his fame will not go away. Recently, the fifth anniversary of
the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman brought a
flood of retrospective television reports, along with one
especially bizarre scene.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of Simpson's new girlfriend appeared on an MSNBC talk
show pleading with her daughter, ``You deserve better.'' She may be
proof that some people get only 5 minutes of fame, not 15, but
there is no more convincing evidence that Warhol's idea has taken
hold in the most banal way.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder fame's more dynamic movement is in the other,
anti-Warholian direction. The humbling of the famous is most
evident in the way politics, show business and celebrity culture
have merged. Where the private lives of the famous used to be
glossily contrived by Hollywood studios and softball television
interviewers, today's gossip culture charts every visit to drug
rehab and every rumored eating disorder.
</P>
<P>
   We know more about Bill Clinton's sex life than any stranger
should, as the line separating the government-financed Starr report
from Vanity Fair and other celebrity-gossip-mongering media has
blurred.
</P>
<P>
   When Monica Lewinsky appeared on ``Saturday Night Live'' playing
herself last month, a common response was, ``Aren't her 15 minutes
up yet?'' but that misses the point. The elevation of Ms. Lewinsky
to celebrity status is nothing. A more powerful cultural jolt came
from a year's worth of television chatter that cast the president
as the average, cheating husband next door (is he sorry enough?
will Hillary forgive him?). The change flows directly from and
feeds back into the idea that celebrities are just like us.
</P>
<P>
   But those who die by the sword of celebrity can pick up that
sword and live again; that is one result of the fluidity of fame.
Among the photographs in the MOMA show is Hugh Grant's mug shot, a
reminder of his arrest after a Hollywood escapade with a
prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   Even more memorable than Grant's fall was the savvy way he
redeemed himself in public opinion, appearing on ``The Tonight
Show'' and abashedly telling Jay Leno he had made a foolish
mistake. He displayed no hint of movie star prerogative or bad boy
glamour, just the sense that he was a regular guy who was sorry.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was Hugh Grant who pioneered the culture of public
apology that Bill Clinton latched onto in the wake of the Lewinsky
affair. Maybe not. But throughout the impeachment furor the only
question I wanted someone to ask President Clinton was the one Jay
Leno asked Hugh Grant: ``What the hell were you thinking?''
</P>
<P>
   Politics and show business have so completely bled together, the
question seemed more commonsensical and to the point than anything
Congress cooked up. With every star and politician trying so hard
to be ordinary, why not ask the question you would ask your best
friend?
</P>
<P>
   Of course that would work only if the ratcheting down of fame
were a fact rather than an illusion. ``The fame thing isn't really
real, you know,'' Ms. Roberts' character says nonsensically in
``Notting Hill,'' trying to talk the Grant character into giving
her a second chance (and proving her desperate need for better
lines).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a girl standing in front of a boy asking you to love
her.'' Well, of course she's more than that and of course the fame
thing is real. What isn't real is the idea that fame is actually
spiraling downward, that the next time we're at K-Mart we might run
into Bill Clinton and Martha Stewart buying detergent so they can
join Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts at the laundromat. But they might
not mind if we believed it.

CECILIA DANIELI, 56, PIONEER OF STEEL MINIMILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Cecilia Danieli, the granddaughter of a scissor maker who
helped revolutionize the world steel industry by developing the
compact steel mills known in the industry as minimills, died June
17 of cancer. She was 56.
</P>
<P>
   Though women made broad strides in Italian business in her
lifetime, Ms. Danieli was one of a handful who reached the top in
the male domain of heavy industry. Her presence at the top, she
once said, meant that Danieli consistently boasted a higher
percentage of women in management posts than Italian companies of
comparable size.
</P>
<P>
   The company she ran, Danieli Group, from her family's hometown
of Buttrio in northern Italy, developed in the 1950s from a small
manufacturer of scissors and shears to a supplier of compact steel
mills to small Northern Italian steelmakers that mainly supplied
the steel reinforcing bars that were the sinews of postwar Italian
reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the 1970s, the company began shipping its engineers
abroad to build mills in places like Mozambique to produce steel
bars or rolling mills in the United States. These mills
revolutionized steelmaking and tilted the market away from the
developed world by giving scores of countries in Africa, South
America and the East Asia the means to produce steel cheaply and
efficiently. They ultimately led, in highly industrialized
countries like the United States, to the decline of traditional big
steel mills and their replacement by smaller, more flexible
minimills.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Danieli, one of four sisters, was forced to take charge of
the family company founded by her grandfather in 1914 in the
mid-1970s, when the oil price increases in the first half of that
decade drained the capital to invest in steel and scuttled further
expansion. In 1976, the company posted its first loss ever. That
year, she assumed the top position of managing director next to her
father, Luigi, who remained president of the company but
concentrated on the engineering side of the business.
</P>
<P>
   She quickly rejuvenated Danieli's management, then gained a
major breakthrough when the company captured a $240 million
contract for a steel mill in East Germany from its nearest
competitor, the giant Krupp group of West Germany. She also
expanded sales in North and South America, Asia and the Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its Italian headquarters, the company, with
roughly 3,000 employees, had affiliates in Youngstown, Ohio, and in
Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, to keep the company financially as well as
technologically fit, Ms. Danieli took the unusual step for Italian
family-run companies, and against the opposition of her more
traditional father, of listing Danieli on the stock exchange. About
54 percent of the company remained controlled by her and Gianpietro
Benedetti, her companion, with whom she shared management of the
company in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Danieli entered the company in 1969 after earning a degree
in economics at nearby Trieste University. A fluent English
speaker, she once worked as a student for a summer on a truck farm
near Schuylerville, N.Y. She avoided the limelight often favored by
Italian executives. But Danieli's business success reflected her
drive for technical superiority and her untiring sales efforts. A
passionate student of history and a mountain climber, in the
mid-1990s she once spent Christmas Day in the mountains of Iran to
negotiate a sale.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by Benedetti and three children. &QL;

   Baseball Greats Shine in New Fields
</P>
<P>
   New York at its finest: YOGI BERRA went to the Metropolitan
Museum of Art Tuesday to look at baseball cards. TOM SEAVER went to
Alice Tully Hall to be the emcee at an orchestral concert.
</P>
<P>
   First, Berra and the Met, which many years ago became the
repository for a collection of more than 300,000 baseball cards
dating from 1887. The museum has displayed dozens of the cards in
its American Wing since 1993, rotating the exhibit every six
months.
</P>
<P>
   This week, it changed to honor one of Berra's former Yankee
teammates, Joe DiMaggio, who died in March. Among the images of
Honus Wagner, Dizzy Dean and Ty Cobb were seven of DiMaggio,
including an unusual composite card in which a photo of his face is
mounted on a cartoon body.
</P>
<P>
   There was also one of Berra, the Hall of Fame catcher, arrayed
with three other 1953 teammates, Billy Martin, Phil Rizzuto and
Mickey Mantle.
</P>
<P>
   Berra viewed the DiMaggio cards reverently, then reminisced
about his own collection, long gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to flip 'em,'' he said, adding that he no longer had a
full set of Yogi Berra cards, if he ever did.
</P>
<P>
   On the way out, past the banner advertising ``From Cezanne to
Van Gogh: The Collection of Dr. Gachet,'' someone asked Berra who
his favorite painter is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know the painters,'' he said. ``I look at the picture.
If I like it, I like it. Then I ask who the painter is.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seaver had a busy day, rushing down to New York from the Mets'
farm team in Binghamton to be the host of a concert by the American
Russian Young Artist Orchestra, which brings together conservatory
musicians from both countries for two weeks of rehearsals and
concerts.
</P>
<P>
   Seaver, the Hall of Fame pitcher for the Mets who now broadcasts
their games, said that until Tuesday night the only word of Russian
he knew was ``nyet.'' A word he could not muster when his daughter,
SARAH SEAVER, the orchestra's deputy director, asked him to be the
host of the event, which benefits the orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `Dad, you're going to do this.' I said, `I don't
know about my schedule.' She said, `Dad, you're going to do
this.'''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Seaver agreed to broaden his vocabulary and speak a
full Russian sentence as he introduced Stravinksy's ``Firebird''
suite. The sentence was written out phonetically for him. It meant:
``I want to marry your tractor.'' At which point a young Russian
violinist tugged on his sleeve and explained that the joke was on
him. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Peter Vallone's Air of Authenticity &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The speaker of New York's City Council, PETER F. VALLONE, took a
busman's holiday Tuesday. From 12:30 to well after dinner time, he
portrayed a fictional New York City councilman in a Miramax film
called ``The Yards,'' which was being shot at Bronx Borough Hall.
Never mind that the yards refer to Queens, Vallone's home borough.
The director, JAMES GRAY, liked the Depression-era grandeur of the
Bronx building.
</P>
<P>
   Gray also liked his casting director's idea to approach a
certified politician. ``That's great _ he's the real deal,'' Gray
said.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the plot: An act of industrial sabotage in the rail yards
ignites a political corruption scandal implicating the borough
president, a character named Arthur C. Mydanick.
</P>
<P>
   The actor MARK WAHLBERG, who, as a tough guy named Leo Handler
served time for a murder he did not commit, has the goods on
Mydanick and is called to testify before a council committee whose
chairman is Vallone.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone spoke lines like:
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you please state your name for the record?'' And, ``We
would like to thank you, Handler, for your courageousness in coming
forward this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   By 6 p.m., with more shooting still to come, Vallone said, ``I
was supposed to be out of here a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Does it make politics seem easy?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say that,'' Vallone replied.

   NEW YORK _ In a heavy blow to the embattled management industry
for co-ops and condominiums in New York City, the Manhattan
district attorney announced the indictments of 30 owners, agents
and contractors Tuesday on charges arising from what prosecutors
say is a widespread bid-rigging scheme that has driven up
maintenance costs for thousands of homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney, Robert Morgenthau, said the scheme has
generated nearly $4 million in kickbacks from contractors for work
at 74 buildings.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the pervasiveness of corruption in the industry,
prosecutors said, Jeffrey Gold, the vice president of Marvin Gold
Management and a man who helped draft ethics guidelines for the
industry after a scandal five years ago, was among those charged
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The indictments Tuesday came almost five years to the day after
Morgenthau rocked the residential real estate industry with the
indictment of more than 72 companies and agents who managed some of
the city's most elite buildings on Park and Fifth Avenues.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the subsequent convictions and fines totaling $4
million, the corruption and collusion between apartment managers
and contractors continued unabated, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the people in the industry get the message that this is
an ongoing investigation,'' Morgenthau said. ``They apparently did
not get the message after the 1994 indictments.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest indictments, two of the largest
management companies in the city _ Marvin Gold and Elm Management
Associates _ functioned as criminal enterprises, taking millions of
dollars in payoffs from contractors for work at luxury Park Avenue
cooperatives and low-income buildings in Queens alike, although
most were middle-income buildings throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
   By making the payoffs, the indictments charge, contractors and
suppliers could eliminate their competition and charge higher
prices. The kickbacks usually amounted to 10 percent of the
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Marvin Gold Management and Elm Management did not
return several phone calls seeking comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   An architect, a superintendent, two directors of cooperatives in
Queens, eight contractors and 18 managing agents were indicted on
charges relating to bid-rigging and kickback schemes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bid-rigging and kickbacks have obviously been a way of life
for many years in the residential real estate industry,'' said
Edward Kuriansky, commissioner of the Department of Investigation,
who was involved in the investigation along with the district
attorney's office. ``But by violating their positions as managing
agents, building superintendents, and co-op board members to divert
tenant funds into their own pockets, the defendants siphoned off
the scarce resources that co-ops and residents need to make
critical repairs to their buildings and to pay off their
mortgages.''
</P>
<P>
   In a surprise move Tuesday, one of the 30 people indicted,
Bernard Ehrlich, a former managing agent at Marvin Gold, pleaded
guilty to a charge of grand larceny for taking more than $3,000 in
kickbacks at a Queens cooperative.

LEGISLATORS SUGGEST SYMINGTON COULD RESUME POLITICAL CAREER
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By HAL MATTERN

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The room was strangely silent when the news was
announced Tuesday morning to a group of House Republicans that Fife
Sy mington's bank fraud conviction had been overturned.
</P>
<P>
   No applause, no shouts of joy from the GOP lawmakers, many of
whom were loyal followers of Sy mington during his years as Arizona
governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they were in shock,'' said House Majority Whip Jim
Weiers, R-northwest Phoenix, who made the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until later that the news began to sink in, prompting
emo tions ranging from relief that their former leader had finally
scored a legal victory to anger that the federal government pursued
the case in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans suggested that Symington now has a future in
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through this decision, he has the ability to rehabilitate
himself,'' said Sen. Scott Bundgaard, R-Glen dale. ``He's done an
excellent job for this state. I think time will heal those wounds
created by the mob that went after him.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Rusty Bowers, R-Mesa, agreed, saying he
hoped Symington would consider another run for governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was a great governor and I hope he runs again. Chef
for governor,'' Bowers said, referring to Symington's enrollment in
cooking classes at the Culinary Institute in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republican lawmakers expressed anger at federal prosecu
tors for spending six years getting Symington convicted and at the
federal judge who dismissed a juror for failing to take part in
delibera tions.
</P>
<P>
   The removal of the juror led the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals to overturn Symington's 1997 bank fraud conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was just outrageous that they didn't test her for
. . . mental illness before throwing her off the jury,'' said Sen.
John Hup penthal, R-Chandler. ``It was perse cution of a
Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic lawmakers were equally shocked at the news and could
be heard speculating about the political future of their former
nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be surprised to see him do something (politically)
down the road,'' said Senate Minority Leader Jack Brown, D-St.
Johns. ``I wouldn't count him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Senate Minority Leader Chris Cummiskey, D-central Phoe
nix, described Symington as the ``Bill Clinton of Arizona
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just when you think the guy is down for the count, he gets his
conviction overturned by the federal courts, who he has railed
against for years,'' Cummiskey said.
</P>
<P>
   As governor, Symington once referred to the federal courts as a
member of the ``three amigos of the anti-culture.'' The other two
were universities and the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Cummiskey said that it was premature for Symington's support ers
to completely vindicate the ex-governor but acknowledged that talk
of his running for office again already had begun Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``People already are asking each other in the hallways, `Do you
think he'll run for governor?' '' he said. ``We've got a ways to go
before 2002. But this breathes new life into the guy, that's for
sure.''
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Jeff Groscost, R-Mesa, one of Symington's
staunchest legislative supporters, said it will be difficult for
Syming ton to polish his tarnished political image.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, it's never good when justice and politics
collide,'' Groscost said. ``Usually the first thing to go overboard
is justice. The real travesty here is, where does the man go to get
back his good name?'' &QL;

SYMINGTON BANKRUPTCY TRIAL TO CONTINUE DESPITE APPEALS DECISION

<P>
   It's not over yet.
</P>
<P>
   While federal prosecutors decide whether to retry Fife Symington
on charges of criminal fraud, lawyers in the former governor's
bankruptcy case are preparing for the first phase of a trial, now
set to begin in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the two sides keep their July 8 date in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court may depend on how they
</P>
<P>
   interpret Tuesday's 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling, which
overturned Symington's conviction in the crimi nal case.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Manning, who represents a group of union pension funds
trying to force Symington to make good on a $10 million loan, said
Tuesday that he may seek to delay the trial in light of the Appeals
Court ruling, scrapping plans to try the case in several parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ruling has a pretty direct impact on the case because both
the mini-trials that were scheduled were based on existence of a
criminal conviction,'' Manning said. ``We may now be looking at a
full trial, where all the issues get done at once.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rob Shull, Symington's bankruptcy attorney, said he sees no
reason to change plans because ``it's our opinion the bankruptcy
case is not dependent on the criminal case either way, whether
there's a conviction or a reversal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intent at this moment is to go forward and we hope to be
successful,'' he said. ``There's another portion set for the middle
of August, and we hope to be successful with that. We'll kind of
knock them off as they come.''
</P>
<P>
   The criminal and bankruptcy cases were winding through federal
courts independently until U.S. Dis trict Judge Roger Strand, in
sentenc ing Symington on the criminal counts, based financial
restitution on the outcome of the bankruptcy trial.
</P>
<P>
   But because Tuesday's ruling doesn't address the bankruptcy
case, Manning said he doesn't foresee any effects on the pension
funds' ability to collect a future judgment should they prevail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just means the whole process will take more time,'' he
said. ``It doesn't make our case more diffi cult. In fact, even
though the case has been overturned, there is a record with people
testifying under oath. There are admissions Mr. Symington was
forced to make under oath that are tremendously valuable to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Shull said ``the facts and the lay of the land haven't really
changed'' as a result of the court ruling, a position he believes
has been backed up by the bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pension funds literally within weeks of the conviction in
1997 argued that the case should be over on the basis of the
criminal conviction,'' Shull said. ``The judge denied that motion.
He said certain issues to be tried in bankruptcy court are
different. We're ready to go try this.''
</P>
<P>
   If the two sides agree to move ahead as scheduled July 8, bank
ruptcy Judge George Nielsen will hold a five-day trial, the first
in a series of steps that will finally decide whether Symington
must repay the money the pension funds lent him to build the
downtown Mercado project.
</P>
<P>
   The case is important because it will determine whether or not
Sy mington is still on the hook for what the pension funds say has
ballooned to more than $18 million with interest. If Nielsen
decides he is, the judge also will determine how much Symington
still owes the funds.
</P>
<P>
   The debt dates to June 1990, when a Symington partnership bor
rowed $10 million to refinance a development loan that built the
Mercado, a mixed-use office and retail project at Seventh and Van
Buren streets.
</P>
<P>
   The project was unsuccessful from the day it opened. By 1995,
the loan had gone into default, and Symington was unable to back
his guarantee. The pension funds sued and won an $11.5 million
Superior Court judgment against Symington.
</P>
<P>
   When Symington filed for bank ruptcy on Sept. 20, 1995, the
pension funds immediately sought to block discharge of the Mercado
debt by arguing that Symington had fraudulently obtained the loan
by misrepresenting his net worth in financial statements completed
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   One of the criminal convictions overturned Tuesday was based on
charges that Symington used those financial statements to hide his
worsening financial condition from the pension funds, then managed
by Calfornia-based McMorgan &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the funds argue Symington inflated his assets and
hid some of his liabilities to obtain the financing for the
Mercado. The funds would not have approved the deal had they known
Symington was saddled with so much debt, the attorneys claim.
</P>
<P>
   Symington's attorneys say that the pension funds agreed to back
the Mercado financing long before the 1990 statement was filed and
that the fund managers did not check the statement's accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome, Syming ton long has insisted that he is
unable to pay the claim.
</P>
<P>
   Although the former governor still enjoys an affluent lifestyle,
it is based largely on the independent wealth of his wife, Ann, an
heiress to the Olin Chemical fortune. Her fortune is out of reach
of Syming ton's creditors. Symington has not had any substantial
income since resigning as governor in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   If the pension funds win their bankruptcy case, any future
salary and income from family trusts and inheritances could be
garnished un til the debt is satisfied. Manning believes Symington
stands to inherit as much as $4 million when certain East Coast
relatives die.
</P>
<P>
   When Symington filed Chapter 7 personal bankruptcy in September
1995, he claimed $25 million in debts and only $61,795 in assets.
</P>
<P>
   The court since has discharged Symington's debts, but the
challenge by the pension funds would reinstate that portion of debt
owed. &QL;

NEIL JACOBSON, 50, RESEARCHER OF MARITAL DISCORD AND THERAPY  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Neil Jacobson, a psychology professor at the
University of Washington who was well known for his research on
domestic violence, marital therapy and depression, died on June 2
in his hotel room in Las Vegas, Nev. He was 50 and lived in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson died after a heart attack, said his wife, Virginia
Rutter. He was in Las Vegas to give a lecture on domestic violence,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson spoke frequently about domestic violence and was an
advocate of court-ordered treatment for men convicted of physically
abusing women. He and a colleague at the University of Washington,
John Gottman, conducted an eight-year study in which they observed
couples fighting and gauged their emotional states and responses.
They also wrote a book, ``When Men Batter Women: New Insights Into
Ending Abusive Relationships'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson had two large clinical trials under way for depression
treatments and for marital therapy. And a book he wrote with Andrew
Christensen of the University of California at Los Angeles,
``Reconcilable Differences,'' is to be published by Guilford in
February.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson was born on Feb. 23, 1949, in Milwaukee. He earned a
bachelor's degree from the University of Wisconsin and a doctorate
in psychology from the University of North Carolina in 1977. He
taught for two years at the University of Iowa before joining the
University of Washington psychology department in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, he is survived by a son, Matthew Hempleman of
Spokane, Wash.; two daughters, Emily Jacobson and Jesse Jacobson,
both of Seattle; his parents, Lloyd and Marjorie Jacobson of
Milwaukee; and two brothers, Tom Jacobson of Brooklyn, N.Y., and
John Jacobson of Milwaukee.

MARIO SOLDATI, 92, FILM DIRECTOR AND WRITER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Italy)  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mario Soldati, a prolific Italian writer and film director, died
on Saturday at his home in Tellaro, near La Spezia. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   Although Soldati became a household name in Italy as the
director of 29 films from 1931 to 1960, writing was thought to be
his stronger talent.
</P>
<P>
   In a career spanning nearly 70 years, he successfully tried his
hand at journalism, short stories, poetry, novels and screenplays,
many of which celebrated the quirkiness of human nature.
</P>
<P>
   Born into an aristocratic family in Turin and educated by the
Jesuits, Soldati spent his youth rebelling against his controlling
mother, his narrow-minded upbringing and a severe church school.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote his first theater work _ a farce about Pontius Pilate _
while studying art history at Turin University and gained critical
recognition with the 1929 publication of ``Salmace,'' a collection
of short stories. But it wasn't until ``America Primo Amore,'' an
amusing account of his two-year stay in New York on a fellowship,
that he came into prominence.
</P>
<P>
   New York, and Times Square in particular, provided Soldati with
colorful material for his writing. When his money ran out, he
accepted a teaching position at Columbia University and
contemplated seeking U.S. citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Upon returning to Italy with an American wife, he found that he
was unable to get work as a journalist because of his refusal to
join the Fascist Party. Instead, he began working as a screenwriter
in Rome and soon was directing his own pictures.
</P>
<P>
   His films, which included ``La Provinciale'' (1952), starring
Gina Lollobrigida and based on a novel by Alberto Moravia;
``Piccolo Mondo Antico'' (1940) and ``Malombra'' (1942), were
widely popular.
</P>
<P>
   He also directed light operas.
</P>
<P>
   When his first marriage ended, he married an actress named Jucci
Kellerman, with whom he had three sons. He eventually left Rome to
work as a full-time writer, settling in a villa on the Ligurian
coast. In 40 years of writing he produced a string of novels and
short stories, among them ``The Emerald,'' ``The Capri Letters,'' a
study of two Americans in post-World War II Italy, and ``La
Confessione.'' His ``L'Attore'' (``The Actor''), a study of
psychological evil, won Venice's Campiello Prize in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1950s, he decided to explore the new medium of
television and started making documentaries, including ``Travels
Along the Po Searching for Genuine Food.'''
</P>
<P>
   He was also considered the father of Italian television
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Until his death, he continued to contribute short stories, at
the rate of two a month, to the Milan newspaper Il Giorno.
</P>
<P>
   His last book, ``Un Viaggio a Lourdes,'' in which he contrasted
religious skepticism and faith, was published earlier this month.

B.C. GOVERNMENT SETS ASIDE 3.35 MILLION ACRES FOR PARK LANDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Under fire from environmentalists, the British Columbia
government on Tuesday responded by preserving 3.35 million acres of
land, creating 35 new provincial parks and expanding several
existing parks.
</P>
<P>
   But while protecting key wild valleys and wildlife habitat
across northern B.C., the government did not designate much new
parkland along the U.S.-Canada border _ where extensive logging is
taking place near or adjacent to parks and wilderness areas in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty grim (along the border),'' said Joe Scott,
conservation director of the Northwest Ecosystem Alliance, a
Bellingham, Wash.-based conservation group. Scott recently found
logging and road building in the Pasayten River, just over the
border from Washington's largest wilderness area.
</P>
<P>
   Only one small area near the boundary was protected in Tuesday's
announcement. A portion of the historic Dewdney and Whatcom trails
_ which led from Bellingham to the Cariboo gold fields of British
Columbia _ will be added to Manning Provincial Park.
</P>
<P>
   But overall, British Columbia environmentalists had much to
cheer about Tuesday. The government's announcement brings to 11.3
percent the area of British Columbia that is now preserved in
parks, wilderness conservancies or ecological reserves. Only 6.6
percent of the province was protected at the start of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   British Columbia Premier Glen Clark hinted that the government
may go beyond its goal of protecting 12 percent of the province's
land. ``Twelve percent is a goal, but not a ceiling,'' Clark told a
briefing in Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   ``By no means is what the government's doing perfect, but they
are following through in what they have chosen to protect,'' said
Bill Wareham, executive director of the Sierra Club of British
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Clark has been under fire from the province's more radical
environmental groups for easing regulations on loggers under the
new Forest Practices Code. The British Columbia timber industry
endured severe cutbacks last year after losing markets in Asia's
economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bits and pieces are put into parks and, in return, industry
gets speeded-up access to other places,'' Joy Foy of the Western
Canada Wilderness Committee, a frequent critic of the government,
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The places preserved may not be household words, but the parks
announced in British Columbia Tuesday are particularly important
for wildlife. These include:
</P>
<P>
   _Northern Rockies: A 1.6 million-acre park in the northern Rocky
Mountains, near Fort Nelson, will protect a portion of the largest
unroaded area in North America south of the Yukon. Taking in the
Muskwa and Prophet rivers, it is an area where the relationships of
predators to prey have not been altered by human intrusion.
</P>
<P>
   A nearby 230,000-acre preserve, Denetiah Park, also protects a
predator-prey environment of moose, caribou, stone's sheep,
mountain goats, wolves and grizzly bears.
</P>
<P>
   _Nahatlatch River: A low-elevation valley, just west of the
Fraser River canyon north of Hope, is part of the most healthy
remaining grizzly valley in southwest British Columbia. The park
protects a major wetland.
</P>
<P>
   _Babine River: A new park in northern B.C. will protect a
52-mile stretch of the Babine River, major sockeye salmon and
steelhead habitat in the Skeena River system, the province's second
largest fishery.
</P>
<P>
   _Brackendale Eagles: A park near Squamish, south of the Whistler
ski resort, will preserve a section of the Squamish River that is a
major winter bald eagle habitat.
</P>
<P>
   _Kakwa: Located about 50 miles northwest of Jasper, an expanded
410,000-acre Kakwa Provincial Park protects a wilderness section of
the Rocky Mountains considered equally beautiful to crowded, nearby
national parks.
</P>
<P>
   _Spipyus: A small new park on the Sechelt Peninsula, north of
Vancouver, protects about 8,500 acres of old-growth forst and prime
habitat for the marbled murrelet, an endangered sea bird.
</P>
<P>
   _Entiako River: The province has protected 115,000 acres of
caribou winter range in the Entiako River valley, on the east
slopes of the Coast Mountains. The new area is adjacent to
Tweedsmuir Park, the province's largest protected area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not finished yet,'' Clark declared Tuesday. The premier
described the new parks, which will be formally established by the
B.C. Legislature, as ``the strongest possible measure government
can take to ensure preservation of these areas for future
generations.''
</P>
<P>
   But conservationists noted that areas along the border have
largely been cut out of British Columbia's rapid park creation.
</P>
<P>
   The provincial government is planning to allow logging of
Eighteen Mile and Twentymile creeks, two wilderness tributaries of
the Skagit River just north of the border. An additional 240 acres
of clearcutting is planned in already heavily logged Depot Creek,
the upper reaches of which are parts of America's North Cascades
National Park.
</P>
<P>
   The Pasayten River is of major concern. It runs into the
Similkameen River, which recrosses the U.S.-Canada border and feeds
into the Okanogan River. Salmon runs of the Okanogan River were
recently classified as endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``The river runs crystal clear when it crosses into Canada,''
Scott said. ``Within three miles, due to erosion from logging and
roads, the water is brown.''

MERCADO AND ESPLANADE: SYMINGTON'S REAL ESTATE LEGACY
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL MULLER 
 and CATHERINE REAGOR  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former Gov. Fife Symington's real estate legacy is reflected in
a tale of two projects _ the Mercado in downtown Phoenix and the Es
planade at 24th Street and Camel back Road.
</P>
<P>
   While Symington developed, and ultimately lost, more than a
dozen projects, the Mercado and Espla nade are the most enduring
symbols of his former empire _ one as a crashing failure and the
other as a stunning success.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercado, at Fifth and Van Buren streets, is a ghost town.
The only sounds are the wind and the Mercado's decorative fountain,
which burbles at the occasional passer-by.
</P>
<P>
   Perry Monge, who owns a hair salon in the Mercado, says things
are pretty lonely, though his busi ness is doing well. His only
neigh bor is an arts and crafts store.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last six or seven years, it's been like this,'' said
Monge, eating a fast-food lunch in the Mercado's deserted
courtyard. ``We'd love to stay, but maybe they're going to sell the
property.''
</P>
<P>
   The sprawling complex also houses the ASU Downtown Center, the
Downtown Phoenix Partnership and the Sunray Charter School. It is
managed by McMorgan &AMP; Co., which took over after Symington and his
partners defaulted on a $10 million loan to a consortium of union
pension funds.
</P>
<P>
   McMorgan has been unable to replace the restaurant tenants who
fled over the years. It gave the Southwest-style buildings a paint
job and improved the parking. Nothing seems to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see is kind of what it is,'' said Paul Morton, a
senior vice president at McMorgan.
</P>
<P>
   Morton said there are no big announcements coming, though he
continues to pursue ``every reason able option that presents
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Esplanade _ once described by Symington as the
``crown jewel'' of his development career _ has thrived since
Syming ton sold out in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The project is home to the Ritz-Carlton Phoenix, two original
office towers and a third tower recently completed by developer
Opus West.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Symington spent so much money on the project, that
it would not have been a moneymaker for him had he kept it.
</P>
<P>
   The two Esplanade towers, the Ritz-Carlton and land for the addi
tional towers sold recently in sepa rate deals. The total price was
less than what Symington financed them for in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Esplanade was destined to be a winner just because of its
location, but the market still hasn't caught up to what it cost to
develop,'' said Stanley Paul Cook, a real estate analyst with
Phoenix-based Landiscor Aerial Information.
</P>
<P>
   The original financing on the towers, retail space and hotel
totaled about $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the first two office towers at the Esplanade, built in
1987 by Symington, sold for $87 million. Last year, Host Mar riott
paid almost $75 million for the Ritz-Carlton, at the height of the
Valley's investment market.
</P>
<P>
   Parcels for a third and fourth office tower were recently pur
chased for about $10 million by Opus West. Together, those sales
add up to $172 million, well below what it cost Symington to
develop them.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Fijan, an office broker with CB Richard Ellis, said all of
Symington's high-profile projects were viable, except for the
Mercado.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether he would have made money on them if he could have
weathered the downturn in the markets, is doubtful,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Many developers like Symington were building high-end projects
for big bucks in the mid-1980s, when the market came crashing down
due to a change in real estate laws that devalued many projects
almost over night.
</P>
<P>
   Symington developed numerous projects in the late '80s and kept
most of them in his portfolio until he was elected governor in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   After that, property after property fell into financial trouble.
In Janu ary 1993, Symington said his real estate empire was
virtually wiped out and that his net worth was ``zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Symington development projects include:
</P>
<P>
   The Scottsdale Seville, a mixed-used shopping and office
project, at Scottsdale and Indian Bend roads, which cost almost $26
million to build in the early 1990s. The project is thriving, full
of restaurants, shops and big-name office tenants.
</P>
<P>
   The Scottsdale Centre, an of fice project south of Seville on
Scottsdale Road. It has changed hands a few times since being
developed for $26 million in the late 1980s. With its central
Scottsdale location, the building is almost full and charging high
rents.
</P>
<P>
   A five-building, 20,000-square-foot office complex at 1002 and
1010 E. Missouri Ave. Phoenix publisher Preston McMurry says he
``loves'' the development, which he purchased from the state
retirement system in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   McMurry paid $1.29 million for the complex, which he estimates
is worth between $3 million and $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Alta Mesa shopping center in Mesa, which Symington sold for
a $1.5 million loss in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Symington developed the center at 5761 E. Brown Road in 1987
with a $2.5 million loan from First Interstate Bank, now Wells
Fargo. In 1991, he sold the center to a family trust headed by
Californian Warner Scharff for $965,000. Scharff sold the center in
late 1996 to Cole Cos. for more than $2 million. Cole believes the
property has since appreciated significantly.
</P>
<P>
   A 70,000-square-foot office building at 5050 N. 40th St. in
Phoenix. Symington financed the building, which eventually went
into foreclosure, with a $10.6 million loan from Citibank. Citibank
sold the building in 1993 to a partnership led by Phoenix
businessman Steven Sherman for $1.6 million. Sherman estimates the
property is worth about $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a first-class building, he did a great job,'' Sherman
said of the property and its developer. ``His timing was just a
little off.''

<P>
   Maybe it was the noontime heat or maybe it was the heat of the
mo ment, but former Gov. Fife Sy mington was having trouble with
his memory.
</P>
<P>
   It had only been a couple of hours since Symington found out the
9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had overturned fraud convictions
that would have sent him to prison for 30 months.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Symington was dizzy with happiness. Confused.
Distracted. Inatten tive.
</P>
<P>
   Sort of like his new best friend, former juror Mary Jane Cotey.
</P>
<P>
   The 9th Circuit ruled, 2-1, there was a ``reasonable
possibility'' that Cotey, who'd been removed from the Symington
jury for failing to take part in delibera tions, actually may have
been yanked be cause she disagreed with other jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Now Symington, in an open-collar blue shirt and backed by the
young men in suits who once formed his inner circle, was saying how
``absolutely stunned'' he was by the judges' ruling.
</P>
<P>
   And how this was ``a very emotional event for me and my
family.''
</P>
<P>
   And how he just wanted to enjoy the moment and not dwell on the
future or, for that matter, the past. Particularly, those days not
long ago when Symington said federal judges ``rule over the nation
like so many philosopher kings,'' protect ing ``all manner of
anti-social behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Fraud, for instance. &QL; 
ERASED COMPLAINTS
</P>
<P>
   Symington furrowed his brow when asked Tuesday about how he'd
trashed judges very much like the ones who'd temporarily removed
him from the hook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember all these com plaints,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like the time he said, ``Through the considerable intellectual
gifts of well-edu cated lawyers, liberals have won in the courts a
long list of policy changes they could never achieve in the
democratic process.''
</P>
<P>
   I wonder if that would include over turning convictions on
technicalities?
</P>
<P>
   The former governor faced a tight semicircle of reporters from
all the local news organizations Tuesday. He was al most as
deferential to them as he now is to judges, an attitude far removed
from a speech he gave only a few years back in which he called
judges, teachers and jour nalists ``the three amigos of the
anti-cul ture.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the evil three have ``galloped off to a Brave New World,
dragging a confused and divided society behind them.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was the relief he felt at not having to gallop off to
the federal deten tion center at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada
that prevented him from recalling such a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Or, for that matter, his complaints about ``a warmed-over
version of 30-year-old, liberal-left sociology that has never been
of much value in the fight against crime.''
</P>
<P>
   These statements have appeared in the papers before. They've
been reprinted by guys like me before. This time, perhaps Symington
will cut out the article and save it, to refresh his memory. &QL; 
MATTER OF CONVICTION
</P>
<P>
   The judge who wrote the opinion in Symington's favor was a Jimmy
Carter appointee, the kind of judge Symington once blasted for
being soft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Criminals destroy the peace and hap piness that mankind was
meant to enjoy on Earth,'' the tough old Symington said. ``That is
why they forfeit their right to be among us. That is why they are
locked away in prison cells. That is why the worst of them are
taken to remote places and hanged from sturdy oaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that was before his trial and conviction. Before he
was forced to re sign from office. Before Symington him self needed
``the considerable intellectual gifts of well-educated lawyers'' to
beat a rap for which 12 other jurors believed he was guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Do you recall when the former gover nor said, ``After 30 years
of consistent policy failure, the public is no longer moved by
arguments for leniency and soft rehabilitative responses to
criminals''?
</P>
<P>
   No. Of course you don't remember. And neither does Symington.
</P>

CORRECTABLE IMPAIRMENTS SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED DISABILITIES, HIGH
COURT RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: CORRECTS to United Airlines, instead of Air Lines thruout) (See also SCOTUS-ADA, SCOTUS-EMPLOY-DISCRIMINATE) 
(rm) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Resolving one of the most pressing questions of
federal disability law, the Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that people
with physical impairments who can function normally when they wear
their glasses or take their medicine generally cannot be considered
disabled and therefore do not come within the law's protection
against employment discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   By a surprisingly wide 7-2 margin, the court took a restrictive
view of the definition of disability under the Americans With
Disabilities Act of 1990. Employers greeted the decision with
relief, saying it would prevent an uncontrollable expansion of the
law, while advocates for people with disabilities said the court's
definition of disability would remove the law's protection from
millions of people who needed it.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled in three separate cases, rejecting the
discrimination claims in each one by the same 7-2 vote. The
dissenters in each case were Justices John Paul Stevens and Stephen
G. Breyer; Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote two of the majority
opinions and Justice David H. Souter wrote one.
</P>
<P>
   The losing plaintiffs were: two nearsighted women, twin sisters
with vision correctable to 20/20, whom United Airlines turned down
for jobs as pilots; a truck driver with functional vision in only
one eye, who saw normally for most purposes but who was dismissed
for not meeting the federal vision standard for driving commercial
vehicles, and a hypertensive automobile mechanic, whose blood
pressure kept him from meeting federal standards for driving a
truck but, when controlled by medication, left him able to hold
non-driving mechanics' jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate ruling Tuesday, the court interpreted another
provision of the Americans With Disabilities Act to give states the
obligation to care for people with mental and other disabilities in
group homes or other non-institutionalized settings, when medically
appropriate and not an unreasonable burden on the a state's
resources.
</P>
<P>
   In the trio of employment discrimination cases, there were
several secondary issues but there was one central question: should
a ``disability'' be measured in its untreated state or in light of
any corrective measures that can enable a person to function
normally?
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor answered the question in the leading case, the suit by
the twin sisters against United Airlines. The sisters flew as
pilots for regional airlines, and met federal vision standards for
airline pilots, but were turned down by United because they did not
meet its standard for uncorrected vision of 20/40.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said that three provisions of the disability law led to
the conclusion that people with remediable conditions were not
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   First, she said, was the law's definition of disability as an
impairment that ``substantially limits one or more of the major
life activities,'' a definition expressed in the ``present
indicative verb form,'' O'Connor noted. ``We think the language is
properly read as requiring that a person be presently _ not
potentially or hypothetically _ substantially limited in order to
demonstrate a disability,'' she said, adding that ``a `disability'
exists only where an impairment `substantially limits' a major life
activity, not where it `might,' `could,' or `would' be
substantially limiting if mitigating measures were not taken.''
</P>
<P>
   A person with a corrected impairment still has the impairment,
O'Connor said, ``but if the impairment is corrected it does not
`substantially limit' a major life activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, she said, the law requires that people be assessed on
the basis of their individual conditions, not as members of a group
that is usually affected in a particular way by an uncorrected
impairment.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, O'Connor said, the findings that Congress incorporated
in the text of the law included the statement that ``some
43,000,000 Americans have one or more physical or mental
disabilities.'' O'Connor said that while the source of this figure
was uncertain, Congress could not possibly have meant to include
all the people who wear glasses or have some other correctable
problem, because the number in that case would be closer to 160
million. ``The 43 million figure reflects an understanding that
those whose impairments are largely corrected by medication or
other devices are not `disabled' within the meaning of the ADA,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the dissenting opinion in this case, Sutton vs. United
Airlines, No. 97-1943, Stevens, joined by Breyer, said that ``in
order to be faithful to the remedial purpose of the act, we should
give it a generous, rather than a miserly, construction.''
Congress's use of the 43 million figure may have been a form of
``legislative myopia,'' Stevens said, that should not be invoked to
determine the scope of the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the purpose of the ADA is to dismantle the employment
barriers based on society's accumulated myths and fears,'' Stevens
continued, ``it is especially ironic to deny protection for persons
with substantially limiting impairments that, when corrected,
render them fully able and employable.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, referring to the sisters in the case: ``If United
regards petitioners as unqualified because they cannot see well
without glasses, it seems eminently fair for a court also to use
uncorrected vision as the basis for evaluating petitioners' life
activity of seeing.''
</P>
<P>
   The criticism from advocates for people with disabilities
mirrored Stevens's dissent. Professor Chai Feldblum of Georgetown
Law School, one of the drafters of the law, said the decisions
``create the absurd result of a person being disabled enough to be
fired from a job, but not disabled enough to challenge the
firing.'' Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who was one of the chief Senate
sponsors, said the decision ``undermined one of the most basic
principles of the ADA,'' which he said was to ``eliminate
discrimination against every individual with a disability.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stephen Bokat, general counsel of the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, praised the court's interpretation for avoiding a ``huge
growth in the number of cases.'' He said the most important aspect
of the rulings from an employer's perspective was the court's
conclusion that ``creating physical criteria for a job ordinarily
does not violate the ADA.'' He added: ``The statute protects you
from discrimination in a class of jobs, but it does not guarantee
you a particular job.''
</P>
<P>
   David Fram, director of the National Employment Law Institute,
an organization here that trains corporate managers and others on
how to apply the disabilities law, called the decisions ``a great
victory for management.'' He said he was ``shocked'' by the court's
``very hard line.'' He noted that most lower courts, as well as the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, had taken the opposite
view.
</P>
<P>
   In her opinion in the United Airlines case, O'Connor said ``an
employer is free to decide that physical characteristics or medical
conditions that do not rise to level of am impairment _ such as
one's height, build, or singing voice _ are preferable to others,
just as it is free to decide that some limiting, but not
substantially limiting, impairments make individuals less than
ideally suited for a job.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor rejected a suggestion in the dissenting opinion that
even people with artificial limbs would not be considered disabled
under the majority's analysis. People may be highly functional with
prosthetic devices but still be ``substantially limited'' in such
activities as walking or running, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that under another provision of the law, people with
correctable impairments may still be covered as disabled if an
employer ``regards'' them as disabled. However, the majority's
analysis of the law's ``regarded as disabled'' prong appeared to be
somewhat limiting; to come within this section, O'Connor said, a
person would have to be regarded as ``unable to work in a broad
class of jobs,'' not just the job in question.
</P>
<P>
   The other two cases were Murphy vs. United Parcel Service, No.
97-1992, and Albertson's vs. Kirkingburg, No. 98-591. Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M.
Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined the
majority opinions by O'Connor and Souter.

3COM POSTS EARNINGS ABOVE PREDICTIONS

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ 3Com Corp. on Tuesday reported fourth-quarter
earnings that came in 1 cent above analysts' expectations based on
strong growth in products used to manage data flow over networks.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended May 26, 3Com had net income of $87.5
million, or 24 cents a diluted share, up 38 percent from $63.6
million, or 17 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales
rose 3 percent, to $1.42 billion from $1.375 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expected 3Com to earn 23 cents a share, according to
First Call Corp., which tracks company earnings.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, 3Com had earnings of $403.9 million, or $1.09 a
share, compared with $30.2 million, or 8 cents a share, in the 1998
fiscal year. Sales for the year were $5.8 billion, up from $5.4
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings for the 1999 fiscal year included a charge of $12.7
million associated with the acquisitions of Smartcode Technologie,
certain assets of ICS Networking Inc. and NBX Corp. and a credit of
$21.8 million related to changes in previously recorded merger and
reorganization expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Before 3Com reported its results, its shares closed at $31.50,
up 56.25 cents, 38 percent off their 52-week high. In after-hours
trading, the company's shares slipped to $31.125.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, 3Com on Tuesday announced an alliance with America
Online Inc. intended to give America Online users access to their
e-mail through Palm Pilots. The two companies also said they would
explore distribution of America Online-branded wireless hand-held
organizers based on the Palm Pilot and ways to develop software for
the Palm that would allow subscribers access to AOL e-mail and
other features.
</P>
<P>
   3Com said fourth-quarter sales of systems products increased 17
percent, to $784.7 million, but sales of client access products,
which include modems and network adapter cards for personal
computers, decreased 10 percent, to $630.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   3Com has struggled in recent quarters because the parts of the
networking market where it is strongest have matured and slowed,
and it remains a distant second to Cisco Systems Inc. in the
fast-growing sector of data communications equipment. Although
3Com's Palm Pilot hand-held device had enjoyed rapid growth, it
still accounted for less than 10 percent of the company's sales.
</P>
<P>
   Client access products account for 45 percent of 3Com's revenue,
and the company expected sales to continue to fall, said 3Com chief
financial officer Chris Paisley in a conference call with analysts.
Those declines mean that the company's growth rate will fall below
the network industry average and that sales for the first half of
the 2000 fiscal year may trail the period a year earlier, he said.
</P>
<P>
   3Com has been the subject of rumors about a potential buyout,
and several analysts have suggested that the company sell its
underperforming units. But 3Com management ducked questions about
potential divestitures on the call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is worth more in pieces than it is together,'' said
Al Tobia, an analyst with Banc of America Securities. ``Everyone
knows a list of companies that have dealt with these slow and
maturing businesses, and the stock never advances during that
period,'' he said. ``It becomes very hard to manage earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   3Com president and chief operating officer Bruce Claflin said in
a telephone interview that 3Com had no plans to exit any
businesses. ``The businesses that we think are long term more
attractive are becoming more of our mix,'' he said. ``The aggregate
for next year will probably look a lot like this year, but the
first half will be less favorable and the second half will be more
favorable, because the mix increasingly works in our favor.''

ECONOMISTS FORECAST EMPLOYMENT GROWTH FOR CALIFORNIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Propelled by a robust real estate sector and flush
with a staggering infusion of stock market muscle, California's
economy will continue expanding through 2001, albeit at a slightly
more moderate pace than the recent past, according to a widely
watched UCLA forecast.
</P>
<P>
   The real estate boom, being driven by strong sales and, to a
lesser extent, new home construction, has boosted employment in
related manufacturing operations such as building materials,
furniture and fixtures.
</P>
<P>
   These factors should add up to a job growth rate this year of
3.2 percent, just 0.4 percentage points less than the 1998 level,
said the quarterly economic forecast from UCLA's Anderson School.
</P>
<P>
   Job creation should taper off to 2.5 percent and 2.2 percent in
2000 and 2001, respectively, the forecast said.
</P>
<P>
   Thank the real estate sector for some of the employment growth,
said economist Tom K. Lieser, author of the California report.
</P>
<P>
   He said an estimated 15 percent of home buyers in California are
using profits from the stock market for down payments. And at least
100,000 jobs created in the past year are related to real estate.
</P>
<P>
   Personal income has been growing at an annual rate of 5 percent
or more since 1995, in part because of the equity amassed by state
residents with stock portfolios. It is expected to grow 7.4 percent
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley, the big New York-based investment bank, recently
estimated the value of the U.S. stock market at $13 trillion.
``It's a good bet that California's share of that pie is
proportionately larger than, say, the state's 13 percent share of
national income or output,'' Lieser said.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatively estimating the state's share at 15 percent would
mean California's total stock portfolio is about $2 trillion, about
twice California's gross product.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly not saying the stock market is the only thing
driving California. The (economic) fundamentals are good and the
underlying trends are positive,'' Lieser said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the expansion of individual and corporate wealth can't
be sustained forever, and in fact a slowdown could be just over the
horizon. UCLA's national outlook calls for flat or slightly
decreasing corporate profits through the end of next year. Over
that same period of time, the Federal Reserve Board is expected to
raise interest rates by about three-quarters of a percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will take some of the exuberance out of this stock
market. No one is predicting a crash but the kinds of returns some
investors have come to expect _ 25 percent to 30 percent a year _
don't look like they can continue,'' Lieser said.
</P>
<P>
   Other economists concur with UCLA's assessment.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Williams, chief economist in the state Legislative
Analyst's Office, noted that UCLA's personal income forecast is
based on the most recent data available. ``The wealth effect is
having a positive impact on the California economy and it's a theme
we had earlier this year.''
</P>
<P>
   One puzzling aspect of the forecast is the modest gains expected
in home construction. During 1998, permits for 125,000 new units
were issued, less than 8 percent of the nationwide starts. The
number should grow to 208,000 by 2001. But that falls far short of
the annual pace of a quarter of a million annual units in the late
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sales are at all-time highs so you would think that the demand
would be out there for a stronger level of home construction than
we are seeing. Maybe there are some supply-side constraints at
work; the builders can't get the land or workers,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some study highlights:
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment industry employment is at about 190,000 workers,
the level it ended 1997 with. The sector should grow by 2 percent
this year and 3 percent next year. It's gained about 10,000 jobs
since last August.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County will have a more moderate growth rate than
the state. And the county remains several hundred thousand jobs
behind the level it reached in the early 1990s before the defense
sector contracted.
</P>
<P>
   The ongoing consolidation of banking likely will continue the
job-shedding process for several years. Job losses have been offset
by gains at brokerages, mortgage companies, real estate sales
offices and insurance companies.

FEN-PHEN LAWSUIT REPORTEDLY SETTLED FOR $6 MILLION TO $7 MILLION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RON NISSIMOV 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The nation's first fen-phen wrongful death trial ended
in Harris County state district court Tuesday with a reported
settlement of $6 million to $7 million, and most jurors said
afterward they would not have awarded the plaintiffs any money at
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we did the best we could for the kids,'' said Sandra
Stom of Friendswood, Texas, whose daughter Mary Marisa Smith, 35,
died in September 1997 of complications from a rare lung disease,
allegedly caused by the ``fen'' part of the diet drug combination.
</P>
<P>
   Stom was referring to Smith's children, 9 and 4 years old. Other
plaintiffs were Smith's husband, Michael, and father, Michael Stom.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys involved would not discuss the settlement, which is
supposed to be confidential. Lawyers said two other Harris County
fen-phen cases, which did not involve deaths, also settled for
confidential amounts Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A source who asked to remain anonymous said the Smith settlement
was between $6 million and $7 million, and the three settlements
were $7.5 million to $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Smith case was closely watched because it could shed light
on whether juries will blame American Home Products of Madison,
N.J., for contributing to the death or injury of fen-phen patients.
About 6 million people took one form of the two types of fen drugs
the company sold. The company said in March that more than 2,600
suits had been filed nationwide. More than 600 have been filed so
far in Harris County.
</P>
<P>
   American Home is accused of deliberately downplaying the risks
of the two fen drugs, both of which were removed from the market in
September 1997 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration after they
were linked to heart valve problems, a condition Smith did not
have.
</P>
<P>
   Company lawyers said they felt vindicated by a poll the 12
jurors and one alternate took privately after being excused by
state District Judge Katie Kennedy. Several jurors said that there
were eight votes for American Home, three for the plaintiffs and
two undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a scientist, and I was leaning for the defense because of
the science,'' said juror Dave Sawicki of Houston, 47, who works in
oil and gas. ``There were a lot of emotional adjectives and adverbs
during the trial, but I kept looking at the risk of the disease,
and it was rare. I didn't feel there were any good guys or bad
guys, it was just a tragic situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Juror Gaetne Pauwels, who cried during testimony describing
Smith's death and the children's suffering, said she felt ``exactly
the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Evidence showing the company was negligent was flagrant,''
said Pauwels. ``I'm the same age as Mrs. Smith was and I have two
children about the same age, so I could relate to what they would
go through.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Paul Stallings said he found the straw vote
``interesting'' because the defense was only into its second day
and the plaintiffs had two weeks to present their evidence. He said
the straw vote will have no bearing on what the company does in
other cases. Plaintiffs' attorney Graham Hill said he was surprised
by the straw vote. He said the outcome would have been different
after jurors deliberated.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said that before the settlement was reached, Kennedy had
allowed into evidence a memo written by a top FDA official saying
the company had manipulated the agency, reversing her prior ruling
keeping it out.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, he said, also allowed evidence that the company
threatened to sue a pharmacy that tried to warn customers about the
drug's possible risks with a boxed warning on its pharmacy
envelopes.
</P>
<P>
   A top American Home official testified Monday that the risks of
the fen drug that Smith took outweighed the benefits if taken
longer than three months. Smith took it for year.
</P>
<P>
   No jury has yet deliberated on a fen-phen case, and the Smith
case was the furthest any such case has progressed. The first case
to go to trial did not involve anyone's death and was settled for a
reported $500,000 on April 8 in Cleburne.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' lawyers have said that American Home wants to avoid
a jury decision while it is trying to negotiate a settlement of all
fen-phen litigation. The company has refused to discuss those
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who weighed about 270 pounds, took the drug fenfluramine,
brand named Pondimin, and phentermine for about a year and lost 70
pounds. Her prescribing doctor, Leo Borrell, was also sued, but he
was dismissed by the plaintiffs last week.
</P>
<P>
   Smith died of a blood infection caused by a catheter used to
pump in a drug to widen her pulmonary blood vessels, which the suit
said had become constricted by Pondimin.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' attorneys have said that about 5 percent of the
fen-phen cases involve similar constrictions, called primary
pulmonary hypertension.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the fen-phen cases allege heart-valve leakage problems,
while others claim ``neurotoxicity,'' which has various symptoms,
such as fatigue and headaches.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 European study said long-term users of prescription diet
drugs had a 23-fold greater risk than the general public of
incurring primary pulmonary hypertension. But even for long-term
diet drug users, the annual risk was low, estimated to be 23 to 46
per million users, and there is no widely accepted biological
mechanism linking the drugs to the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The two fen drugs sold by American Home Products were Pondimin
and Redux, or dexfenfluramine.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's attorneys claimed that for much of the early 1990s,
American Home Products greatly underreported the associations of
Pondimin with primary pulmonary hypertension to get FDA approval of
Redux in 1996. Until 1997, Pondimin's label said the drug had been
associated with four cases of the disease and one death. Company
officials testified that they were aware of at least five
associations as of 1991 and 62 associations and 11 deaths in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the trial, company officials conceded the label was
inaccurate, but said the FDA knew about all the reported
associations and had never demanded it be changed. They said part
of the reason they did not change it was that they were awaiting
the results of the European study.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' attorneys also tried to show the company sought to
avoid the most serious type of warning label, bordered by black
boxes, because it would drastically cut sales.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said the boldfaced warning that was used was
adequate and approved by the FDA, which had determined that the
drugs' benefits outweighed the risks.
</P>
<P>
   Phentermine, the phen part of the combo, was never associated
with the same risks and is still available.

KNICKS' SPREWELL, FOR ONE, HAS PUT THE PAST BEHIND HIM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Allan Houston might have owned Game 3. But make no
mistake, Latrell Sprewell owns New York.
</P>
<P>
   Because The City That Never Sleeps also is The City That Loves
to Forgive and Forget, the controversial Sprewell's past is
invisible and his persona everywhere as the NBA Finals head into
tonight's Game 4 against the San Antonio Spurs at Madison Square
Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Like Darryl Strawberry, Lawrence Taylor and George Steinbrenner,
the hellion New York Knicks forward has at least temporarily put
aside his black hat to become the most popular person in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spree's the man around here if you haven't noticed,'' said
Houston, whose 34 points Monday night helped the Knicks narrow
their Finals deficit to 2-1. ``Some of it is cult-hero stuff, but
there's also a genuine appreciation of him as a person, and a
player. He spills his heart and plays his butt off on the floor,
and these fans fall in love with those types of players.''
</P>
<P>
   With dangling corn rows, funky glasses and gum-chomping
cockiness, Sprewell is hotter than Ricky Martin and Capri pants on
Madison Avenue. He has Knicks fanatic Spike Lee wearing his No. 8
jersey and companies like Hugo Boss and Calvin Klein begging him to
endorse their products. In a surprisingly popular television
commercial, he even boasts to being ``the American dream'' to the
backdrop of Jimi Hendrix's Woodstock version of ``The Star-Spangled
Banner''.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, I'm as shocked as anyone to be standing here in
this situation,'' Sprewell said. ``I've been through a lot in the
past couple of years, and I think people appreciate that. It would
have been different if none of it had happened. For one thing, I
probably wouldn't be as popular as I am now.'' In the past Before
his relentless energy and fearless creativity led the Knicks to an
unlikely Eastern Conference championship and a belief they can
rally to upset the Spurs in the Finals, Sprewell seemed to be the
poster boy for all that's wrong in the NBA. On his laundry list of
transgressions:
</P>
<P>
   He once threatened Spurs forward Jerome Kersey with a 2-by-4
when they were teammates in Golden State;
</P>
<P>
   He shrugged off his pet Doberman's mauling of his daughter's ear
and face, saying ``accidents happen'' and deciding to keep the dog;
</P>
<P>
   He was sentenced to house arrest in his hometown of Milwaukee
last summer and forced to wear an ankle monitor after recklessly
driving an elderly couple off the freeway;
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, he choked his coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's old news,'' said Sprewell, who has never personally
apologized to Golden State Warriors coach P.J. Carlesimo for the
infamous attack that led to Sprewell's unprecedented one-year
suspension from the league on Dec. 1, 1997. ``We've all made
mistakes. I'm no different.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the glare of the Big Apple and in a series against the
Spurs' squeaky-clean God Squad, Sprewell apparently has persuaded
New Yorkers to laugh with the sinners rather than cry with the
saints.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was fined $25,000 by the Knicks earlier in the season
after his agent went public with a demand to start or be traded,
Sprewell has been a model teammate and one of the reasons Hope
Floats at the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been great to coach, great to be around,'' said Knicks
coach Jeff Van Gundy. ``The only difference we've had was that he
wanted to start earlier in the season, but everybody wants to play
more. I didn't know exactly what to expect with him coming in, but
I couldn't have asked for anything more from him.''
</P>
<P>
   After his highly publicized trade to the Knicks, Sprewell
provided only a glimpse of his talent before suffering a stress
fracture in his heel that caused him to miss 13 games. Now healthy
and starting, he is providing his team offensive octane and his
fans with an anti-Duncan. While Spurs center Tim Duncan quietly
scores on bank shots, baby hooks and all the flair of a statue,
Sprewell seemingly exorcises demons with every wide-eyed drive to
the hoop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an emotional guy and that's the only way I know how to
play,'' Sprewell said. ``I guess I'm a good fit for this city.''
What might have been After an ugly third quarter in Game 3 in which
he missed all five of his field goals and 4-of-6 from the foul
line, Sprewell didn't stop running, didn't stop shooting. Like a
teen-ager on a sugar rush, he scored 10 of his 24 points in the
fourth quarter, including an acrobatic, arching, left-handed layup
over Duncan that gave the Knicks a five-point lead and reason to
believe they could finally beat the Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a greyhound that just never gets tired,'' said Spurs
guard Mario Elie. ``Sometimes you can see him just pulling those
guys along, whether they want to run or not.''
</P>
<P>
   And to think, Sprewell was almost a Spurs player.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very, very close,'' said Sprewell, who pushed for a
trade to San Antonio just days before his choking of Carlesimo. ``I
remember we played the Spurs and I kept running by and telling Pop
\RSpurs coach Gregg Popovich\S to pull the trigger. It's funny how
things work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Popovich, who coached Sprewell as an assistant to Don Nelson
with the Warriors, wanted Sprewell, but Spurs owner Peter Holt was
leery of the move in the wake of Dennis Rodman's unstable stay in
San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Spree fan, and everybody knows that,'' Popovich said.
``I love his competitiveness. He's going to do anything he has to
do to win and that's pretty obvious to everybody. But I especially
love his honesty. Whether you agree with this kid or not, he is
going to tell you straight-up _ between your eyes, to your face _
what he's thinking every second of the day. I like that a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sprewell bandwagon is fully en vogue because the only thing
New Yorkers love more than their heroes is their heroes with scars.
Scoring Spree While the Spurs' Twin Towers of Tim Duncan and David
Robinson have owned the paint in the NBA Finals, New York's Allan
Houston and Latrell Sprewell have been just as dominating on the
perimeter. A look at the point production and percentage of offense

SHINING STARS SERVE AS BEACON FOR RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ They stayed up late and watched the deciding
game. They saw the parade highlights. They listened to the cheers
on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Rangers admit, it's their turn to win ``the Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   They share the same owner. The same club president. The same
character-first philosophies.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, it's the trophy cases that are different.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars stand at the top of the hockey world. The Rangers are
at the summit of Planet AL West.
</P>
<P>
   One has the Cup. The Rangers still have only the salad bowl.
</P>
<P>
   It's going to be a hot summer, anyway, at The Ballpark in
Arlington. And after what happened the other night in Buffalo, it
just got a tad hotter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's fair to say there's more pressure on us,
because it's two totally different games, two totally different
teams,'' left fielder Rusty Greer said last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think, after seeing what's been done with the Stars over
the past few years, there is a good chance that the same things
could happen here. There's a feeling that if it comes down to
making moves at the right time, Mr. Hicks will do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't think there's any more pressure that could be
added by any outside person than what the 25 guys in this clubhouse
have already put on themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer is right. The Rangers realize, having heard general
manager Doug Melvin say it repeatedly, that a third division title
in four years will not be enough. The club needs to move, as Melvin
puts it, to ``the next level'' _ or the Rangers might as well be
the Vancouver Canucks.
</P>
<P>
   No one can accurately gauge how demanding team owner Tom Hicks
will be, now that he has ridden in a parade and owns a pair of
Stanley Cup boots. But the names John Mackovic and Tom Penders can
probably give us a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, baseball is rooted in some key differences. One
prominent hockey player _ one Ed Belfour _ can make an immediate
and conspicuous impact. In baseball, even a free-agent starting
pitcher gets to work only once every fifth day.
</P>
<P>
   In hockey, one random slap shot from the point can change an
entire game. In baseball, offense tends to more often be a
cumulative exercise.
</P>
<P>
   And another key difference _ in hockey, a little money can go a
long way. In baseball, there are lot of contracts like Brett
Hull's.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars just finished beating a hockey club whose payroll is
$20 million less than theirs. And that team made it to the Stanley
Cup Finals. In baseball, a Buffalo Sabres spend-alike doesn't make
it to the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   As we learned in the Todd Stottlemyre and Randy Johnson
courtings, the impact of a Tom Hicks in baseball is meaningful but
inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be provided with all the physical means in the world,
but it still comes down to evaluation,'' manager Johnny Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks has said that he understands that.
</P>
<P>
   But now he has some new boots. He has a Cup. He just rode in a
parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched what happened to the Stars, and my first thought was
that I was happy for the guys,'' shortstop Royce Clayton said
before last night's game with the Athletics. ``Second, I found
myself thinking that I want to have that experience here. I want to
know how that feels. That's what motivates me more than anything
else _ to be able to celebrate the way the Stars did.''
</P>
<P>
   From their hotel rooms in Boston last Saturday night, they
watched. On their TVs at home yesterday, the Rangers saw the
highlights and watched the entire community rise to cheer its
newest champions.
</P>
<P>
   As Oates correctly mused aloud, ``If they go that crazy for
hockey, just think what they would do here for a baseball
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be huge. The celebration would probably sprawl across
the two counties.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks could get yet another new set of boots.
</P>
<P>
   No pressure. Right?
</P>
<P>
   ``The selfish part of me wants to experience that and know how
it feels,'' Clayton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the owner's done his part. Now it's up to us.''
</P>
<P>
   At The Ballpark in Arlington tonight, the Rangers will get an
even-closer look at what the ``next level'' can be. A handful of
Stars players will be on hand to throw out the first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   They will be accompanied by the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   It's no salad bowl.

ECONOMISTS FORECAST EMPLOYMENT GROWTH FOR CALIFORNIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Propelled by a robust real estate sector and flush
with a staggering infusion of stock market muscle, California's
economy will continue expanding through 2001, albeit at a slightly
more moderate pace than the recent past, according to a widely
watched UCLA forecast.
</P>
<P>
   The real estate boom, being driven by strong sales and, to a
lesser extent, new home construction, has boosted employment in
related manufacturing operations such as building materials,
furniture and fixtures.
</P>
<P>
   These factors should add up to a job growth rate this year of
3.2 percent, just 0.4 percentage points less than the 1998 level,
said the quarterly economic forecast from UCLA's Anderson School.
</P>
<P>
   Job creation should taper off to 2.5 percent and 2.2 percent in
2000 and 2001, respectively, the forecast said.
</P>
<P>
   Thank the real estate sector for some of the employment growth,
said economist Tom K. Lieser, author of the California report.
</P>
<P>
   He said an estimated 15 percent of home buyers in California are
using profits from the stock market for down payments. And at least
100,000 jobs created in the past year are related to real estate.
</P>
<P>
   Personal income has been growing at an annual rate of 5 percent
or more since 1995, in part because of the equity amassed by state
residents with stock portfolios. It is expected to grow 7.4 percent
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley, the big New York-based investment bank, recently
estimated the value of the U.S. stock market at $13 trillion.
``It's a good bet that California's share of that pie is
proportionately larger than, say, the state's 13 percent share of
national income or output,'' Lieser said.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatively estimating the state's share at 15 percent would
mean California's total stock portfolio is about $2 trillion, about
twice California's gross product.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly not saying the stock market is the only thing
driving California. The (economic) fundamentals are good and the
underlying trends are positive,'' Lieser said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the expansion of individual and corporate wealth can't
be sustained forever, and in fact a slowdown could be just over the
horizon. UCLA's national outlook calls for flat or slightly
decreasing corporate profits through the end of next year. Over
that same period of time, the Federal Reserve Board is expected to
raise interest rates by about three-quarters of a percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will take some of the exuberance out of this stock
market. No one is predicting a crash but the kinds of returns some
investors have come to expect _ 25 percent to 30 percent a year _
don't look like they can continue,'' Lieser said.
</P>
<P>
   Other economists concur with UCLA's assessment.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Williams, chief economist in the state Legislative
Analyst's Office, noted that UCLA's personal income forecast is
based on the most recent data available. ``The wealth effect is
having a positive impact on the California economy and it's a theme
we had earlier this year.''
</P>
<P>
   One puzzling aspect of the forecast is the modest gains expected
in home construction. During 1998, permits for 125,000 new units
were issued, less than 8 percent of the nationwide starts. The
number should grow to 208,000 by 2001. But that falls far short of
the annual pace of a quarter of a million annual units in the late
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sales are at all-time highs so you would think that the demand
would be out there for a stronger level of home construction than
we are seeing. Maybe there are some supply-side constraints at
work; the builders can't get the land or workers,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some study highlights:
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment industry employment is at about 190,000 workers,
the level it ended 1997 with. The sector should grow by 2 percent
this year and 3 percent next year. It's gained about 10,000 jobs
since last August.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County will have a more moderate growth rate than
the state. And the county remains several hundred thousand jobs
behind the level it reached in the early 1990s before the defense
sector contracted.
</P>
<P>
   The ongoing consolidation of banking likely will continue the
job-shedding process for several years. Job losses have been offset
by gains at brokerages, mortgage companies, real estate sales
offices and insurance companies.

BRILLIANT DIGITAL ENTERTAINMENT TO BUY LONDON-BASED AUCTION
CHANNEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Brilliant Digital Entertainment, moving to take
advantage of the boom in Internet auctions, announced it will buy
the London-based Auction Channel for $7.3 million in stock.
</P>
<P>
   The deal vaults 3-year-old Brilliant, based in the Woodland
Hills community of Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley, into the same
league as Internet heavyweights such as Amazon.com and eBay in
offering online auctions. Brilliant is a software developer best
known for selling movies that contain potentially hundreds of
plot-twist choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brilliant is the perfect partner for The Action Channel,''
said Jason Gleave, founder and managing director of the channel.
``The company has the technology we can use to enhance auction
events and access to capital to support the accelerated growth of
our business.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal gives The Auction Channel a 9 percent stake in
Brilliant and comes five weeks after five high-profile investors
put $4.3 million into Brilliant, which obtained a $6 million line
of credit. Brilliant stock, which jumped 35 percent during that
single session to $6.75, was off 62.5 cents to $6.375 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gleave, in a telephone interview, said the deal is a fast-track
method of getting the channel into the U.S. market. ``We've been
focused on the European market because the stronghold on fine art
auctions is here, but it's become urgent for our auction partners
that we establish ourselves in the United States,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brilliant, which lost $1.9 million on revenues of $206,000 in
the first quarter, will add about 30 Auction Channel employees to
its work force of 70 and plans to open an Auction Channel office in
the Los Angeles area within the next 60 days, according to
president Kevin Burmeister.
</P>
<P>
   The privately held Auction Channel broadcasts live auctions _
now at the rate of two per week _ over satellite, cable and the
Internet with interactive bidding. In March, its British TV partner
Sky Sports attracted more than 750,000 viewers to its Soccer
Legends auction conducted by the Bonham's house. It recently
broadcast Christie's first televised auction of tennis memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   Burmeister said Brilliant, which began selling animated
Multipath Movies on the Internet and through retailers in December,
will set up joint ventures with telecommunications and media
partners for live auction broadcasts. Burmeister said the
acquisition is a logical way for his company to expand its 3-D
graphics and online business capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brilliant Digital has specialized in content that's immersive
and stimulates participation,'' he said. ``What was fascinating to
us about The Auction Channel was the level of participation from
viewers.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of Internet auctions has received a major boost from
eBay and from Seattle-based bookseller Amazon.com, which formed an
alliance last week with Sotheby's for an online service that will
start in September. Gleave insisted he has been cheered by the
popularization of the concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased to see these kind of announcements being
made,'' he said of the Amazon-Sotheby's deal. ``When I began
approaching houses in 1996, I got a lukewarm reception because it
was very difficult to explain that this was going to be a viable
business. It took us about two years of broadcasting auctions and
developing relationships to show that online auctions are part of
the future.''

FURNACE CREEK A HOTBED FOR GOLF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEATH VALLEY _ The first thing you're absolutely, positively
wondering when you step up to the No.1 tee is how accurate were
they when they named this course Furnace Creek?
</P>
<P>
   It's not yet 5 a.m. on the second day of summer and already the
air conditioner is churning in the pro shop. How hot can it get
here?
</P>
<P>
   ``Easily in the high teens to 120-plus degrees in the
summertime,'' said Jeff Knott, a visiting PhD who last year earned
a doctorate in geology for his formation map work in the nearby
Black Mountains. The lengthy groundwork, which once hospitalized
Knott with dehydration, also left him curious about how a golf
course could cope in such a hostile environment.
</P>
<P>
   He had come back with clubs to find out and wound up pleasantly
surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be dry with bare spots in the fairways,
especially in June,'' Knott said. ``But that wasn't the case at
all. The course was great _ very interesting, with a lot of
textures that can give you a bad bounce but also a good bounce. It
had a lot of character for a desert course _ one you might call the
ultimate desert course.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimate golf is definitely the early impression.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after watching Payne Stewart win the U.S. Open and an
hour before sunrise here, you stare at the bleak, baked countryside
surrounding Furnace Creek and think Pinehurst might have been on a
different planet.
</P>
<P>
   Then, you look back at the course and find many things aren't
really that much different from your regular course _ not even that
much less green.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to arguably the most-distinct golf site in the nation, a
natural oasis where 60-year-old tamarisk cedars and date palms
tower above fairways nurtured by natural springs that send nearly a
million gallons of water through the course daily.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be fooled by the greenery or water _ the lakes, ponds or
streams that are on or adjacent to six of Furnace Creek's 18 holes.
It is hot here, so hot the land surrounding the course cracks
noisily in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   But heat isn't the only unusual feature.
</P>
<P>
   Early-morning golfers _ and there are no other kind during the
summer in Death Valley _ are apt to lose a ball to a foraging
coyote on the hunt for breakfast near the water-guarded second
green.
</P>
<P>
   Hit a ball off the tightly cut, well-defined fairways and it
might bounce off the hard-baked desert floor and into a kangaroo
rat hole.
</P>
<P>
   There are tales of bighorn sheep coming down from the valley's
surrounding 1.8-billion-year-old rock formations to collapse and
die on a Furnace Creek green.
</P>
<P>
   There might also be golfers who feel they've died and gone to
heaven on those greens, which are a better-barbered version of
Furnace Creek's Bermuda fairways. Well-manicured and closely cut,
the greens are fast but true and absolutely the highlights of the
course.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors will get to play only the front nine at Furnace Creek
this summer, as course superintendent Dave Parkinson is in the
process of resodding the back nine with new greens expected to be
ready by November. That's prime time for Death Valley, with
temperatures in the 80s. But summertime, with a lower rate of $25
for all you can play (cart an extra $10), can be enjoyable, too,
providing you start early.
</P>
<P>
   Tee off at 5 a.m. and you could get in 27 or even 36 holes
before it gets too hot to play. The longer your shadow, the better
your comfort zone. In any event, you can't play in the summer after
1 p.m., when the course closes because of the heat.
</P>
<P>
   But keeping cool is not the most difficult thing at Furnace
Creek.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't believe how hard it is to grow grass out here,''
said head pro Rick Heitzig.
</P>
<P>
   Amfac Corporation, which also operates the ranch and luxurious
Furnace Creek Inn perched on a hillside above the course, made the
grass-growing considerably easier two years ago with a $1.3 million
renovation program.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that work, which closed the course for five months,
brought noted designer Perry Dye to Death Valley. He fine-tuned the
tee boxes and restructured five holes on the par-70, 6,215-yard
layout that now uses grass bunkers and mounds to good effect.
</P>
<P>
   But the centerpiece of that 1997 money injection was a
state-of-the-art irrigation system. The sophisticated, sensorized
computer system delivers water on time and (begin
ital)refrigerated(end ital) wherever it is needed on the course. No
one was happier about that than course superintendent Parkinson,
who had too many recent memories of working with his crew at night,
dragging hoses around the course and never getting enough water
coverage on any one day.
</P>
<P>
   Those planned irrigation improvements were the reason Parkinson
took the job at the course, which had not been fully able to take
advantage of its abundant water supply since it opened as a
three-hole recreation for Furnace Creek Inn clients in 1930.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been basically a Godsend,'' Parkinson said of the new
irrigation system. ``It's been the single greatest improvement
they've ever done on this course.''
</P>
<P>
   Fixing Death Valley's summer heat will probably take nothing
less than an ice age, but Furnace Creek can offer something else
almost as cool: At 214 feet below sea level, golfers can be
guaranteed that on this course they will shoot their lowest round
ever.

SUPPORT GROUP OFFERS THERAPY TO EASE FEAR OF FLYING 
</HEADLINE>
   (duplication warning: also sent with `t' code)  
 (bl)  
 By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Before Maureen Werner's flight takes off, she counts
the number of children, priests, nuns and rabbis who are among her
fellow passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are lots of little kids, I feel more confident that
we won't crash,'' said Mrs. Werner, 48, a homemaker from Rye. ``And
when it comes to religious leaders, I'll take anyone. I'm
nondenominational.''
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Laabs can't really say what she does when she flies; she is
too drugged to remember. ``I'm usually so sedated, I pre-board in a
wheelchair,'' said Ms. Laabs, a brokerage company employee who
lives in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   For all of his 68 years, Ron Strickland's fear of flying was so
intense that he looked down whenever an aircraft flew overhead. ``I
couldn't imagine stepping onto a plane,'' said Strickland, a
grocery store owner from Queens. ``I just assumed I'd never see
Europe in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Weary of the crippling fear and the missed travel opportunities,
these self-described aviophobes turned up at La Guardia Airport
earlier this month, joining two dozen others for a meeting of Fly
Without Fear, a support group that has been easing air travel
phobias for three decades.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when jet travel is about as exotic as a ride on an
escalator, those who fly with anxiety _ or are too petrified to fly
at all _ say they get little solace from friends, family and
especially employers. Many turn to such support groups, especially
this time of year, when out-of-town weddings, class reunions and
family vacations beckon.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the office, everyone's talking about their summer travel
plans to Prague or Turkey, which creates tremendous stress,'' said
Carol Cott Gross, who runs the La Guardia group wth her husband,
Herb. ``You can only take the train to Disney World so many
times.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that class size also spikes after aviation accidents
like this month's American Airlines crash in Little Rock, Ark.,
which killed 11 people. ``And whenever a disaster movie comes out
that features a plane crash, people really go nuts,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Fly Without Fear treatment regimen has changed little since
1969, when Mrs. Gross' father, Nate Cott, started the meetings with
her cousin, a psychiatrist. She and her husband took over the group
after Cott, an inventor and engineer, died in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   The program remains a homespun mixture of behavior modification,
relaxation techniques, Aeronautics 101 and Alcoholics
Anonymous-style confessionals in which members take turns venting
their anxieties, recalling in-flight panic attacks or vacations
aborted by fear. She said that almost all attendees fly within a
year of joining, many of them on special graduation flights to
Boston or Washington that the Grosses organize every few months.
Still, she says there is no such thing as a cure, and many clients
have ``touch up'' sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute for Psychology of Air Travel in Boston estimates
that 35 million Americans have an acute fear of flying. Dr. Albert
Forgione, the director, said that at least a third of all air
travelers are apprehensive about getting on a plane.
</P>
<P>
   Those who treat flight phobia agree that it is less a fear of
crashing and more related to disorders like agoraphobia and
claustrophobia. Others have a history of panic attacks and are
simply anxious that they will be afflicted.
</P>
<P>
   Aviophobes are also cursed with an overactive imagination.
Forgione said it was not uncommon for his patients to fear being
sucked out of the airplane's toilet, or that a wing will snap off.
Others think that being so high puts them within easy reach of God,
who will take advantage of the close proximity to snatch them up to
Heaven. ``People imagine the most absurd, ridiculous things,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who attended a recent meeting agreed that their fears were
highly fantastic. Strickland worried that the pilot would get lost
in the fog. One woman said she was afraid the plane might run out
of gas. Another woman fretted about tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Russo, an American Airlines pilot, coolly explained
aircraft mechanics and the principles of flight. Then in detail he
described every imaginable sound a passenger might hear and what it
means.
</P>
<P>
   Many said they were especially unnerved by turbulence, convinced
that even minor jolts could shatter their aircraft. Russo told them
planes can handle more volatility than the human body. ``If you
didn't see a kid fly from row 10 to row 20, you didn't experience
severe turbulence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A bubbly extrovert, Mrs. Gross enthusiastically talks about her
own neuroses. Phobias, she said, run in her family, ``like blue
eyes and cellulite.'' Planes, tunnels, bridges and tall buildings
all give her the jitters. ``My worst nightmare is a party at
Windows on the World,'' she said, referring to a restaurant near
the top of the World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   Members pay $30 a meeting; attendees tour La Guardia's air
traffic control tower and hear from flight attendants, mechanics,
radar specialists and psychologists. Each session ends with an
anxiety-busting climb aboard a parked plane.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gross repeatedly assures the group that the Boeing 727 will
not be going anywhere. ``The key word here is `stationary,''' she
said. Still, many find the visit jarring. As she walked beneath the
wing, Mrs. Werner visibly swooned. ``It's big,'' she said,
explaining the gobsmacked look on her face, ``and it shouldn't be
in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   The brave ones gingerly eased down the aisle. Several sat
towards the rear, their seat belts tightly fastened. Feeling
emboldened, Mrs. Werner poked her head in the cockpit and sprayed
Russo with questions: ``You know what all those lights are for? Is
it a struggle to fly? Why did that plane in Arkansas crash?''
</P>
<P>
   After three successful plane tours, Joanne Mongiello of Franklin
Square on Long Island said she was ready for the real thing _ a
graduation flight to Boston that returns the same day. Mrs.
Mongiello had not flown in three decades, and besides a trip this
August to visit her daughter in Los Angeles, she had another
incentive: ``My husband bought me a 25th anniversary diamond ring
and he won't give it to me until I fly,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday morning, she got her chance. Nearly two dozen
members bought tickets for the 9:30 a.m. Delta Shuttle to Boston;
only one woman failed to arrive. ``I never coerce anyone to board,
because there's always another flight,'' Mrs. Gross said.
</P>
<P>
   The group gathered an hour before the flight, put rubber bands
on their wrists (to snap away negative thoughts) and congratulated
one another for showing up. They boarded 15 minutes before other
passengers. Ms. Laabs sat in the front, headphones over her ears,
her bag stuffed with distractions.
</P>
<P>
   Then the doors closed and the jet engines whooshed.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of taking off, the plane crept along the runway for
half an hour. Anxieties edged up. Three times, Ms. Laabs grabbed
her things and started heading for the exit. Mrs. Gross didn't try
to stop her, but instead unleashed her distraction-by-chattering
tactic.
</P>
<P>
   It worked.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the pilot announced imminent takeoff. As the Boeing 727
accelerated, Wendi Waldman tried to comfort her friend, Tammy
Siffert, whose cheeks had begun to lose their color. ``It's only 30
minutes, it's only 30 minutes,'' Ms. Waldman chanted.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, the plane was airborne. The front of the cabin
erupted in cheers, Ms. Laabs and Mrs. Mongiello hugged and
Strickland beamed like a 4-year-old (though he wondered aloud if
the thick cloud cover might hinder navigation).

 &HT;    Psychic's drowning ruled accidental
 &HT;    By Joshua B. Good
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Psychic Madam Bell had a thriving business, partly
based on her advice on how to avoid bad luck.
</P>

   Early Tuesday morning, a jogger found Madam Bell's body floating
face down in a shallow reflecting pool behind the Ritz-Carlton
hotel in Buckhead. Investigators say she accidentally drowned.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see for others you cannot always see for yourself,''
said fellow psychic Mother Margaret.
</P>
<P>
   Police found Madam Bell's flowery black straw purse on a bench
and her shoes near the reflecting pool, said Atlanta police
homicide Sgt. Scott Bennett. Her black 1999 Mercedes 500-S was
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Inside her purse was cash she had planned to deposit at a bank,
said Betty Honey, an investigator with the Fulton County Medical
Examiner's Office.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy revealed the 54-year-old Madam Bell, who also went by
the names Judy Marks and Dina Adams, drowned. Finding no evidence
of foul play, investigators ruled her death an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett speculated she may have been wading in the pool, or
planned to cool her feet, and perhaps slipped and fell in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows what she was doing out there,'' Honey said.
</P>
<P>
   Madam Bell's family reported her missing at 3 a.m. The jogger
who found her in the pool, Bob Johnston, called 911 at 8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Madam Bell had worked as a psychic in Atlanta for 35 years. Many
customers were attracted by her late-night TV commercials.
</P>
<P>
   She specialized in upbeat predictions, but also warned customers
of evil influences and bad luck.

TO AUTHORITIES, `GIFTING' CLUB STACKS UP AS PYRAMID SCHEME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Conn.)   (bl)  
 By ROBERT HANLEY   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDISON, N.J. _ The club has a basic sales pitch to new members:
donate $2,000 as a ``gift'' and, if all goes well, collect $16,000
in return.
</P>
<P>
   No, says the group's founder, Linda Shepard, it is not an
illegal pyramid scheme, only a private social club with members
eager to help loyal and trusted friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not `get rich quick,' it's not `get rich overnight,'
it's `get rich,''' Ms. Shepard told a big crowd of new and
potential members June 17 at a cavernous exhibition hall at the New
Jersey Convention Center. ``It doesn't happen today or tomorrow. It
takes some time to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, she said 1,048 people were recruited, each
doling out their payments in $100 bills, for a total of $2,096,000,
to obtain the entry-level position of ``star'' on a ``ship,'' the
club's organizational structure.
</P>
<P>
   Each ship has 15 members on four levels _ eight stars at the
bottom, four all-stars above them, two superstars above them, and a
captain at the top. Only the captains receive money. This
particular night's collection allowed 131 captains to walk away
with $16,000 each, Ms. Shepard said. Each captain returns $500 to
the club for its expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The club, Amigos Associates Social Club of New Jersey Inc., is
20 weeks old and already seems well-entrenched in the state. In
May, Ms. Shepard filed papers with the state Treasury Department
incorporating it as a nonprofit organization.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shepard said it meets two or three times a week, usually in
a large restaurant or in the Garden State Exhibition Center in
Somerset, for newcomers to pay their $2,000. Security is tight.
Guards, some with metal detectors, search everybody for weapons.
Cameras and tape recorders are banned.
</P>
<P>
   The club has drawn the attention of law enforcement authorities.
State Attorney General John Farmer is investigating complaints that
six police officers in Plainfield who belong to the club illegally
recruited four merchants to join and pay $2,000, said Plainfield
Police Chief Edward Santiago. The merchants contend that the
officers solicited them while in uniform and on duty, Santiago
said. Police officers, he said, are barred from doing anything for
personal financial gain while on duty.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   To Union County Prosecutor Thomas Manahan, Amigos Associates is
a well-organized pyramid scheme that has shielded itself from
criminal charges with carefully worded disclaimers. Its promotional
brochure defines the club as a ``private optional gifting program''
whose members donate their $2,000 voluntarily and expect no money
back. In boldface type, the brochure states, ``There is never a
promise or guarantee of a monetary return.''
</P>
<P>
   When new members turn over their $2,000, the brochure says, they
must read aloud this statement: ``This is strictly a gift, and I
expect nothing in return.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey courts have ruled that pyramid schemes are theft by
deception, banned by the state's Consumer Fraud Act. But Manahan
said he would have a difficult time proving theft by deception in
cases where people hand over a $2,000 gift and say they expect to
get nothing for it. He said the Legislature must tighten the law.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shepard, 36, the owner of a music store in Somerset and a
former drama and speech teacher, said lawyers helped her organize
Amigos Associates. She said she has invited detectives to attend
club meetings. ``I said come and look,'' she said. ``We're real
people. We have a face and a name. We've showed them everything. We
believe it's legal and ethical, and we're helping people.'' But she
declined to say what law enforcement agency the investigators
represented.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials and mathematics experts predict Amigos
Associate will collapse, as all pyramid schemes do, because it will
eventually run out of recruits. Club rules require each new member
to recruit at least two more because as each ship captain collects
money and ``retires'' from the system, two new ships are created,
and other members move up a level. Membership must constantly
double to produce the $16,000 for each new captain. It takes eight
new recruits to pay a captain. For those eight people to get their
$16,000, the club must recruit 64 more people to pay $2,000 each,
or a total of $128,000. Club rules require that those 64 people
recruit 128 more, and that the 128 recruit 256 more. Fifteen rounds
later, the club will need more than 8 million recruits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just becomes completely impractical because it needs more
people than there are in the state,'' said Robert Berk, a professor
of statistics at Rutgers University. ``It's got to collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Ms. Shepard said: ``I don't believe we'll run out
of people. We recycle ourselves.'' She said most members who
collect $16,000 start again with a new payment of $2,000. But
experts said that would simply delay the inevitable collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said his
investigators have been in touch with detectives working for
Manahan to determine whether Amigos Associates is linked to a
similar club that has been operating in Stamford, Conn. He said
that if he learns the identities of the organizers in Stamford, he
will file a civil suit seeking a $5,000 fine for every $2,000
payment collected in Connecticut, where civil law bars such
payments as an unfair investment practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a classic, blatant pyramid scheme,'' Blumenthal said of
the Stamford club. ``The essential principle is there is a limited
pool of people so foolish and gullible to pay $2,000, so eventually
there have to be losers among those who sign up last.''

TENNIS' BATTLE OF SEXES IS NO CONTEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The women of Wimbledon offered what they termed ``a mild
protest'' Tuesday, a soft backhand slice in the name of equality.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody boycotted _ or girlcotted, as Bud Collins, no doubt,
would have called it. Nobody burned a sports bra. The show went on.
</P>
<P>
   With T-shirts and lapel pins bearing an ``equal'' sign and the
kicker ``Get the point?'' members of the Women's Tennis Association
quietly drew attention to the fact that at Wimbledon, as at the
French and Australian opens, the men have bigger purses.
</P>
<P>
   At Wimbledon, the women's prize money totals more than $4
million, which sounds generous until you realize the men's prize
money is more than $5 million. The women think they should get the
same as the men.
</P>
<P>
   They're wrong.
</P>
<P>
   They should be paid (begin ital)more(end ital).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, ``who deserves what?'' is a classic
depends-how-you-look-at-it question, whether you're talking about
an athlete, an actor or a barber.
</P>
<P>
   The Wimbledon hosts, grasping for a rational explanation for
this time-honored inequity, like to point out that men play
best-of-five-set matches while the women play best-of-three.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women get paid more per game,'' an officer of the All England
Club said on HBO, demonstrating that he does not get the point.
</P>
<P>
   As if athletes are, or ought to be, paid by the hour. Should
golfers be paid by the shot? John Daly would love that.
</P>
<P>
   If we were all on the clock, the average history teacher would
make more than the best relief pitcher and the argument could end
right there.
</P>
<P>
   Other explanations are less convincing than that one, if it's
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we paid women (equally), we wouldn't have so much to spend
on petunias,'' another Wimbledon officer said. Or on brandy.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, one of the leading men found the controversy
irresistible and stuck a grass-stained Adidas in his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're probably a bit greedy,'' said Tim Henman, the
leading English player. He added that the women ``should worry
about getting their own tournaments at a bigger and better level''
before asking the Grand Slam events for more money.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Henman should watch more women's tennis.
</P>
<P>
   Their tournaments (begin ital)are(end ital) bigger and better.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that if you look at tennis players as entertainers,
then this is one arena in which women deserve the bigger paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't women's basketball, whose pro league, the WNBA, sits
at the head table of American sports prematurely, paid for by a
rich father, the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't women's soccer, whose World Cup seems to be
succeeding despite falling short against the usual standards of
sports appeal _ uniquely entertaining play, a historical context,
familiar personalities.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't women's golf, which has never, for whatever reason,
been as popular as the men's.
</P>
<P>
   Tennis' women are as big as the men _ and they've earned that
stature.
</P>
<P>
   Their personalities certainly are bigger. From Wimbledon's first
seed, Martina Hingis, to its last, Anna Kournikova, to Venus
Williams and Mary Pierce in between, the women's side has more good
guys and bad guys than the guys'.
</P>
<P>
   Now that bad-guy Hingis is out of the tournament, it's hard to
find anybody to root against at the top of the women's draw, where
Steffi Graf is No. 2, Lindsay Davenport No. 3 and Monica Seles No.
4.
</P>
<P>
   But this is about more than personalities.
</P>
<P>
   The women's game is more fun to watch, particularly on grass
courts like Wimbledon's, where the men's rallies rarely last longer
than serve, off-balance return, put-away volley.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do the women play patty-cake, Chris Evert tennis anymore.
It's a muscular, athletic game now, a Navratilova bearing down on
every net at Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   As for the old knock about shallow talent _ ask Hingis, knocked
out Tuesday in the first round, in straight sets, by 16-year-old
qualifier Jelena Dokic of Australia.
</P>
<P>
   These days women's tennis is quite competitive. It's the men who
can't keep up. This is what passes for intrigue on the men's side
at Wimbledon: wide speculation that Pete Sampras is on his way
down, and general shock that Andre Agassi found his unreliable game
at the French Open.
</P>
<P>
   But if Sampras and Agassi, the biggest names in men's tennis,
meet in the July 4 final, it will be the first time they've faced
each other in any round of a Grand Slam tournament since Sampras'
victory in the 1995 U.S. Open final.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest names in women's tennis _ there are so many of them
_ face each other every day.
</P>
<P>
   Check the TV ratings. The women's matches usually dwarf the
men's. They probably will do it again at Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   Equal pay? It's the men who are probably a bit greedy. &QL;
