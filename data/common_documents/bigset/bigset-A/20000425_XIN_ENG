<HEADLINE> France Opposes Military Solution to Kashmir Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Visiting French Chief of
Defense Staff General Jean Pierre Kelche said here on Monday that
France believed there could be no military solution to the Kashmir
issue and the only way forward was through a dialogue.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference following his meeting with Indian Defense
Minister George Fernandes, the French general also described the
Kashmir issue as a bilateral matter between India and Pakistan
which France does not want to interfere with.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that India and France, after several rounds
of strategic dialogue, were poised to develop a "global
partnership" and a united strategy against international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
While France was giving top priority to building military and
strategic cooperation with India, it did not want Pakistan to be
isolated, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Cooperation between France and India and France and Pakistan
are at different levels," said the French general.
</P>
<P>
Denying that his trip had been prompted by defense deals, he
also asserted that many conventional weapons and military
technologies France could offer to India are advanced and viable.

<HEADLINE> S.Lankan Troops Retreat to Defend Jaffna Peninsula </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan troops had retreated
tactically from a strategic military base to defend the northern
Jaffna peninsula, Army Commander Srilal Weerasooriya said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Holding of the peninsula is our priority," Weerasooriya told a
news conference here Monday evening, adding that the retreat from
the Elephant Pass last Saturday was "in the larger interest of
safeguarding the Jaffna peninsula."
</P>
<P>
The Elephant Pass is a narrow causeway linking the Jaffna
peninsula with the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
Jaffna is the center of Tamil culture and was the rebel capital
until December 1995 when government troops captured the city and
dealt a big blow to the morale of the separatist Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the LTTE rebels said on Monday they had overrun
another government camp in northern Sri Lanka after their capture
of the Elephant Pass.
</P>
<P>
The rebels said they had smashed through government defense
lines at Soranpattu, just north of the strategic Elephant Pass.
</P>
<P>
However, Weerasooriya denied the rebel claim.
</P>
<P>
He also rejected the LTTE claim that more than 1,000 soldiers
had been killed in the weekend fighting, saying eight officers and
80 soldiers had been killed.
</P>
<P>
The defense ministry earlier said 625 troops were wounded.
</P>
<P>
Military officials said that troops were consolidating their
positions in new areas north of the Elephant Pass to ward off
fresh attacks to Jaffna by the LTTE rebels.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels, fighting since 1983 for a separate state for
minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east, also said Monday
they had seized a huge supply of weapons, ammunition and military
vehicles from the base at the Elephant Pass.
</P>
<P>
The rebels said 35 of their fighters had died in the fighting
over the weekend, while the government put the number of
separatists killed at around 200.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's main opposition United National Party (UNP) has
called for an emergency session of parliament to discuss the rebel
onslaught.
</P>
<P>
The party said it wrote to parliamentary speaker K.B. Ratnayake
to summon the assembly ahead of the scheduled May 9 session.
</P>
<P>
The clashes in the north came amid moves by Norway to bring the
Tamil Tigers and the Sri Lankan government to the negotiating
table.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the victory at the Elephant Pass gave the rebels
stronger bargaining power if they were to open talks with the
government.

<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian Political parties
and coalitions have started to register at the General Electoral
Committee to be qualified to compete in the third election of the
State Great Khural (Mongolian Parliament) scheduled for July 2,
2000.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last week, the Mongolian Democratic New Socialist
Party (MDNSP) was handed the first certificate to compete in the
upcoming parliament election.
</P>
<P>
The Mongolian Republican Party (MRP) and the Mongolian
Democratic Party (MDP) were listed today in names of parties that
would run for the July election.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the Mongolian Social Democratic Party (MSDP)
had separated from its coalition with the Mongolian National
Democratic Party (MNDP) and will run for the upcoming parliament
election independently.
</P>
<P>
According to the Parliament Election Law, political parties and
coalitions have to send programs and applications for
participating in the election to the General Electoral Committee
65 days before the election.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 24 political parties were officially registered in
Mongolia, of which only 3 parties, the Mongolian People's
Revolutionary Party (MPRP), the MSDP and the MNDP are ruling
parties.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest polling results organized by Sant Maral
Foundation, 51.7 percent of the voters will cast their ballots to

party, party of Civic Courage, which gets support of the 9 percent
of the voters.

<HEADLINE> Students Across Iran Protest Conservative Crackdown  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Iranian students in various cities
on Tuesday took to the streets to "defend the freedom of speech" as
the powerful conservatives have intensified crackdown on the
reformists and their publications.
</P>
<P>
The official Islamic Republic News Agency reported that
university students staged protesting rallies and sit-ins in
Tehran, Bandar Abbas of southeastern Hormozgan province, Yazd of
central Yazd province, Kashan of central Isfahan province, Shiraz
of southern Fars province and Hamadan of the western Hamadan
province.
</P>
<P>
The students condemned the closure of 13 reformist publications
and the state television's screening of selective parts of a
controversial conference on Iran in German capital of Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Students from Khajeh Nassir Tussi Technical University in Tehran
held a demonstration calling on President Mohammad Khatami to pay
more attention to the attempts underway to obstruct the reform
process in the country.
</P>
<P>
Elected Majlis (parliament) member Ali Akbar Musavi Khoeini
delivered a speech to the students, who issued a five-point
resolution in support of the reformist press and freedom of the
press.
</P>
<P>
The agency did not say how many people participated in the
demonstrations in the major cities while witnesses put the number
in Tehran at around 1,000.
</P>
<P>
Students also reportedly rallied at Tehran University overnight
after the conservative judiciary ordered the closure of 13
reformist dailies and periodicals, including two most popular
dailies--Fath (Conquer) and Asr-e Azadegan (Times of the Freed).
</P>
<P>
The closure of another prominent reformist daily Sobh-e Emrouz
(This Morning) was revoked later Monday night as its managing
director, Saeed Hajjarian, is still hospitalized after being shot
in an assassination attempt on March 12.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives, who control most of the country's powers,
suffered serious setbacks in elections in the past two years. They
seemed determined to revenge their humiliating defeat in the
February parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
The conservative watchdog Guardians Council announced on Tuesday
that it found errors in vote-recounting in Tehran, where the
reformists won 29 of 30 seats in the elections. It has already
deprived nine elected reformists of their eligibility.
</P>
<P>
The reformists were expected to take over the Majlis on May 28,
but the new Majlis can officially start its work only after a
minimum of 190 parliamentarians were confirmed by the Guardians
Council.
</P>
<P>
If the election results in Tehran are nullified, the new Majlis
must wait until the result of the run-off.
</P>
<P>
The Special Court for Clergy, also dominated by the
conservatives, issued an arrest warrant against the reformist
cleric Hassan Yussefi Eshkevari for his participation in a
conference on Iran in Berlin, Germany.
</P>
<P>
Eshkevari was charged with "actions against national security,
propaganda against the system, insult to and rejection of the
absolute sanctities of Islam, and behavior not befitting the
clergy."
</P>
<P>
Eshkevari, a supporter of Khatami's reform policies, was among a
group of reformist invited to the controversial Berlin conference
titled "Iran After February Elections."
</P>
<P>
Hard-liners have organized rallies throughout the country over
the past few days to denounce the Berlin conference and increase
pressure on the reformists.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF: Only Strong Political Will Can Roll Back Malaria in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF)on Tuesday appealed to African heads of
state to provide the leadership and resources to control malaria
throughout Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Malaria contributes significantly to the high death rates of
children and women recorded in Africa, even through we now have
the means to make major inroads against the disease," UNICEF
Executive Director Carol Bellamy said.
</P>
<P>
"We now have effective, affordable interventions to prevent
and cure malaria," she said. "But we cannot deploy the means if
the political will is lacking."
</P>
<P>
 The UNICEF chief made the appeal in Nigeria's administrative
capital, Abuja, where African government leaders are attending the
world's first-ever summit on Malaria.
</P>
<P>
 The summit is considering how to speed action to alleviate
the poverty and human suffering caused by the disease.
</P>
<P>
 Attending heads of state are expected to endorse the goal of
the global Roll Back Malaria (RBM) movement to reduce malaria
deaths by half by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
 UNICEF is currently supporting malaria control programs in 30
countries in Africa to reduce the toll of the disease on young
children and pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
 "we recognized that there are tremendous pressure on the
Governments meeting here," said Bellamy.
</P>
<P>
"But now we have a clear-cut opportunity. Together we can
prove that, with local participation and focused political will at
all levels, leadership on behalf of children is the most effective
key to progress in the new millennium," she added.

<HEADLINE> Italian Premier-designate Amato Nominates New Ministers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Italian Premier-designate Giuliano
Amato Tuesday nominated 24 ministers who should form the 58th post-
war Italian government after the approval of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Lamberto Dini remains as foreign minister, Sergio Mattarella as
minister of defense, treasury minister is former Finance Minister
Vicenzo Visco, Ottaviano Del Turco will be the finance minister,
former Foreign Trade Minister Piero Fassino moved to the ministry
of justice, Ministry of Foreign Trade will be canceled in Amato
government.
</P>
<P>
According to Italian news agency Ansa, lowering fiscal pressure
for both individuals and firms and taking a tough line on law and
order issues were two key planks in Amato government's program.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, one of Amato's main objectives is said to be that of
reducing the number of undersecretaries, which numbered 56 in
outgoing Premier Massimo D'Alema's first government, formed in
October 1998,rising to 66 in his second, put together at Christmas
time.
</P>
<P>
Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, who asked Amato to try
and form a new government on Friday evening, has stressed that he
would like to see a slim-line administration.
</P>
<P>
If he can muster up enough support in parliament and pass a
confidence vote in both houses, he will become the head of Italy's
58th post-war government, which could be sworn-in as early as next
week.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing Premier D'Alema quit his job last Wednesday after the
center-left suffered a humiliating defeat in Sunday's regional
elections, emerging with seven regions to the center-right's eight
and polling about 45 percent of the vote against the opposition's
51 percent.
</P>
<P>
Amato, 61, is a former Socialist who served as premier from
1992-93 and was a top aid to the late disgraced Socialist leader
Bettino Craxi.
</P>
<P>
His reputation was virtually unscathed by the corruption
scandals that toppled his political master and destroyed his party.

<HEADLINE> Syrian FM Tells France Syria's Analysis of Israeli Pullout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Syrian Foreign Minister
Faruk Shareh Tuesday told his French counterpart Hubert Vedrine
Syria's analysis concerning the pullout of Israel from southern
Lebanon and the consequences it would result in.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret said
that during his talks with Vedrine, Shareh also ``presented for a
long time the Syrian position concerning the Syria-Israeli part of
the peace talks as well as the reasons in his eyes for the failure
of the summit in Geneva (between Syrian President Hafez Assad and
U.S. President Bill Clinton).''
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman did not provide further details.
</P>
<P>
Shareh arrived here Tuesday afternoon on a mission representing
Syrian President Hafez Assad to inform France on Damascus's
position on the forthcoming Israeli withdrawal from southern
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He will be received by French President Jacques Chirac at the
Elysee presidential palace Tuesday evening and will deliver to
Chirac a ``written message'' from Assad to Chirac, said French
officials.
</P>
<P>
France is considering participating in a United Nations
peacekeeping operation in southern Lebanon once Israel pulls out
its troops from there by the end of July.
</P>
<P>
But France insists that such a peacekeeping operation should be
carried out in a safe condition and with the agreement of all
sides involved.
</P>
<P>
France has also repeatedly called on Israel to make such a
pullout within the framework of a peace agreement with both
Lebanon and Syria,rather than doing it unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
Syria, which has about 30,000 troops deployed in Lebanon, has
accused Israel of trying to fool the world by pretending to pull
out of the 850 square kilometers of territory in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
A senior official of Syria's Baath Socialist Party, Suleyman
Kaddah, said on Monday that Israel was creating a crisis in all
the parts of the peace talks with Arab countries by making a
unilateral pullout from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He also accused Israel of trying to separate Lebanon from Syria
in the talks and said that Damascus and Beirut would work together
to``consolidate the unity of the two parts'' of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between Israel and Syria on a total withdrawal
of Israel from the Golan Heights have been suspended since January.

<HEADLINE> Lockerbie Trial May Be Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The trial of the airliner
bombing over Lockerbie may be postponed after the request for
delay is considered on Thursday at Camp Zeist.
</P>
<P>
The Scottish Crown Office prosecution service said that an
application was presented to the High Court of Justiciary for
postponement of the trial originally scheduled to start on May 3
at Camp Zeist, the former Dutch air force base.
</P>
<P>
"The application has been made in the light of the intimation
by the defense on April 20 of a total of 119 defense witnesses and
of lists of defense productions (objects of evidence)," said the
Scottish Crown Office in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The application will be considered at Camp Zeist, where Libyan
suspects Abdel Basset al-Megrahi and Al-Amin Khalifa Fahima will
be tried for the 1988 bombing over the Scottish village of
Lockerbie of a Boeing airliner.
</P>
<P>
Pan Am flight 103 from Frankfurt to New York via London
exploded over Lockerbie, killing all 259 people on board and
another 11 on the ground on December 21, 1988.
</P>
<P>
A three-year investigation concluded to obtain a warrant for
the arrest of the two Libyan suspects, both staff of the Libyan
Arab Airlines in Malta in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Under a deal brokered by the United Nations last year, Libya
handed over the two bombing suspects to stand trial in the
Netherlands under Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
The defense witnesses reside in a number of countries including
Malta, Sweden, the United States, Germany as well as Libya.
</P>
<P>
"Given the number, apparent range and geographical location of
defense witnesses, the Prosecutor does not consider that he can
properly proceed to trial without the proper investigation of this
evidence," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
If the postponement was granted, the trial could be delayed by
weeks.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Allows Elian's Playmates to Visit Him </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking at a regular briefing, State Department spokesman
James Rubin said visa requests from the four will be dealt with on
an expedited basis once they are received. One adult will be
permitted to accompany each child.
</P>
<P>
The department issued visas almost three weeks ago to Elian's
former kindergarten teacher, a pediatrician and a male cousin,
Rubin noted.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. federal government seized the six-year-old Cuban boy
from the home of his Miami relatives in a predawn raid on Sunday
and reunited Elian and his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, ending a
five-month standoff between the government and Elian's Miami
relatives.
</P>
<P>
Despite the happy reunion of the father and son, some U.S.
politicians were critical of the administration's handling of the
case.
</P>
<P>
Defending the government's handling of the case, President Bill
Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno both indicated that the
authorities used force to remove Elian from his relatives in Miami
after they refused to surrender the boy voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
Elian, his step mother, his father and his half brother have
been staying at a residence at nearby Andrews Air Force Base. They
plan to move shortly to the Wye Plantation, located in a secluded
area on Maryland's Eastern Shore, while awaiting court action over
whether Elian should stay in the U.S. or return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Elian was rescued on November 25 of last year near a shipwreck
in the Atlantic sea off Florida after his mother and 10 others
were drowned when their boat capsized.

<HEADLINE> Strong Pound Hits Companies' Profitability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The strong pound and higher
interest rates have helped to send the profitability of British
companies declining to a two-year low, a new survey showed.
</P>
<P>
Despite improvements in productivity, the average return on
capital in Britain dropped to 13.14 percent in the last quarter of
1999, the lowest since the third quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest Corporate Health Check by Experian, the
West Midlands was the best-performing region and enjoyed the
highest level of profitability in the UK.
</P>
<P>
However, the information company cautioned that this could be
reversed later in the year in the wake of the break-up of Rover,
the car company in the region.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which analyzed the financial results of the country
's 2000 largest companies, suggested the fall in profitability was
broadly based.
</P>
<P>
Only four of 23 industry sectors studied - building and
construction, alcoholic beverages, food retailing and utilities -
reported an increase in return on capital in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
Over 1999 as a whole, the survey showed eight industry sectors
reported a profitability drop of more than 10 percent, including
IT, pharmaceuticals, transport, and chemicals and plastics.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Voices Deep Concern over United States' NMD System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Sweden on Tuesday
expressed its deep concern over the United States' plans for a
national missile defense (NMD) system, saying such a system could
run counter to efforts to halt proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) which is
held here from April 24 to May 19, Ms. Anna Lindh, Minister for
Foreign Affairs of Sweden, said proliferation must instead be met
by strengthening the non-proliferation regime.
</P>
<P>
"NMD system would put in question the Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty(ABM) which is repeatedly referred to by both States Parties
as being a cornerstone of strategic stability," the Minister said.
</P>
<P>
"There is a risk that such actions jeopardize this balance,
and have negative consequences for nuclear disarmament and non-
proliferation,' the Minister said.
</P>
<P>
She called on the States Parties to refrain from any
deployment that could create uncertainties.
</P>
<P>
 Welcoming Russia's ratification of the START II Treaty, the
Minister expressed deep concern that it still has not entered into
force seven years after being signed and that negotiations on
START III are not yet underway.
</P>
<P>
 "The Russian Federation and the United States must now assume
their special responsibility, bring START II and its protocol into
force without further delay and immediately begin negotiations on
a START III treaty," she added.

PRETORIA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin voiced here Tuesday evening his confidence that the African
rejuvenation will become a reality in spite of the difficulties
that the continent currently faces.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks at a banquet hosted by South African
President Thabo Mbeki in honor of Jiang, who is on a state visit
to the country.
</P>
<P>
Jiang cited the African renaissance idea advocated by President
Mbeki as the common aspiration of the African people for peace,
stability and development.
</P>
<P>
"This idea will contribute to greater cohesion, strength and

<HEADLINE> Chinese President on New International Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRETORIA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin Tuesday evening called for the establishment of a new
international political and economic order for the benefit of the
people in the world.
</P>
<P>
"It is the shared aspiration of all peoples in the world to
promote the lofty cause of world peace and development and to
establish an equitable and just new international political and
economic order," he told a banquet hosted by South African
President Thabo Mbeki in honor of Jiang, who is currently on a
state visit to the African country.
</P>
<P>
Jiang listed two major issues to be settled in the world, one
is to narrow the gap between the North and the South, and the
other is to ensure respect for the fundamental right of the people
of any country to determine their own fate.
</P>
<P>
"There would be no peace and tranquility on the planet where we
live if rich countries become richer and poor ones poorer, with
accumulation of wealth on the one side and greater poverty on the
other; and if some big powers indulge in interfering in other
countries' internal affairs and pursuing hegemonism and power
politics by relying on their economic, scientific and
technological and military strength while the vast number of
developing countries have been deprived of the right to
participate in international affairs on an equal footing and are
subject to unfair treatment or even unwarranted bullying," Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president stressed that the world affairs should be
decided through consultation by all governments and peoples in the
world, because " only by adhering to this principle, can world
peace and development be truly guaranteed."
</P>
<P>
The political multipolarization conduces to the implementation
of the above principle, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, certain countries or a very small number of them have
acted arbitrarily and dictatorially, Jiang said, adding that their
acts have constituted an out-and-out violation of the principle.
</P>
<P>
"To fight against hegemonism and power politics is a worldwide
struggle between pro-democracy and anti-democracy forces," Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
"As long as peoples in different countries work together, they
will definitely be able to have their own fate in their hands and
bring about a lasting peace and universal prosperity of the
world," he said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is the last leg of Jiang's five-nation tour, which
has taken him to Israel, Palestine, Turkey and Greece. He also met
with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in the Alexandria city of
Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Students Protest Conservative Crackdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Iranian students on Tuesday took to
the street to defend the freedom of speech as the powerful
conservatives have intensified crackdown on the reformists and
their publications.
</P>
<P>
Students from Khajeh Nassir Tussi Technical University in Tehran
held a demonstration calling on President Mohammad Khatami to pay
more attention to the attempts underway to obstruct the reform
process in the country, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Elected Majlis (parliament) member Ali Akbar Musavi Khoeini
delivered a speech to the students, who issued a five-point
resolution in support of the reformist press and freedom of the
press.
</P>
<P>
The agency did not say how many people participated in the
demonstration while witnesses put the number at around 1,000.
</P>
<P>
Students also reportedly rallied at Tehran University overnight
after the conservative judiciary ordered the closure of 13
reformist dailies and periodicals, including two most popular
dailies--Fath (Conquer) and Asr-e Azadegan (Times of the Freed).
</P>
<P>
The closure of another prominent reformist daily Sobh-e Emrouz
(This Morning) was revoked later Monday night as its managing
director, Saeed Hajjarian, is still hospitalized after being shot
in an assassination attempt on March 12.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives, who control most of the country's powers,
suffered serious setbacks in elections in the past two years. They
seemed determined to revenge their humiliating defeat in the
February parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
The conservative watchdog Guardians Council announced on Tuesday
that it found errors in vote-recount in Tehran, where the
reformists won 29 of 30 seats in the elections. It has already
deprived seven elected reformists of their eligibility.
</P>
<P>
The reformists were expected to take over the Majlis on May 28,
but the new Majlis can officially start its work only after a
minimum of 190 parliamentarians were confirmed by the Guardians
Council.
</P>
<P>
If the election results in Tehran are nullified, the new Majlis
must wait until the result of the run-off.
</P>
<P>
The Special Court for Clergy, also dominated by the
conservatives, issued an arrest warrant against the reformist
cleric Hassan Yussefi Eshkevari for his participation in a
conference on Iran in Berlin, Germany.
</P>
<P>
Eshkevari was charged with "actions against national security,
propaganda against the system, insult to and rejection of the
absolute sanctities of Islam, and behavior not befitting the
clergy."
</P>
<P>
Eshkevari, a supporter of Khatami's reform policies, was among a
group of reformist invited to the controversial Berlin conference
titled "Iran After February Elections."
</P>
<P>
Hard-liners have organized rallies throughout the country over
the past few days to denounce the Berlin conference and increase
pressure on the reformists.

BEIRUT, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Syrian army has thinned out its
presence in the Bekaa valley in central Lebanon, As Safir newspaper

</P>
<P>
Syrian army vacated its checkpoint at the entrance to the
village of Labwi, northeast of Baalbek, on Saturday and another
checkpoint at the entrance to the town of Brital, stronghold of

the Beirut-Baalbek highway on Friday, leaving a total of only three
Syrian checkpoints in the Bekaa region.
</P>
<P>
No explanation was given for the reduction of checkpoints and
the redeployment of Syrian troops in the Bekaa, which followed
Israel's formal declaration that it will withdraw from occupied
south Lebanon by July. Syrian army had earlier lifted several
checkpoints off the streets of the Lebanese capital of Beirut.
</P>

Syria has deployed about 35,000 troops in Lebanon ever since

<HEADLINE> Iran's Conservative Watchdog Find Errors in Vote- Count </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Guardians Council, dominated
by the conservatives, announced Tuesday that it found serious
differences while recounting votes of the February parliamentary
elections in Tehran constituency.
</P>
<P>
The election watchdog hinted that it may nullify the polling
result in the Iranian capital, where reformists allied with
President Mohammad Khatami won 29 of the 30 seats in the first
vote-counting.
</P>
<P>
"The serious differences between the recount and the previous
result were unprecedented in elections and cast a shadow over the
whole result," the council said in a statement, released by the
official Islamic Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
It suspected that some of the vote boxes had been opened and
votes inside changed in the constituency, the biggest and most
important one in the country. But it gave no evidence or proof.
</P>
<P>
The reformists won a landslide victory in the parliamentary
elections in February, which was humiliating to the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
The Guardians Council last week ordered another recounting of
some boxes in Tehran constituency, apparently in response to
accusations of election irregularities.
</P>
<P>
The council's announcement comes amid mounting conservative
crackdown on reformist press. The judiciary have closed down 13
reformist publications on Sunday and Monday and sent several
reformist publishers and journalists to prison at the same time.
</P>
<P>
The council said that it has confirmed the eligibility of 185
elected for the upcoming sixth, 290-seat Majlis (parliament), but
nullified that of nine others from seven constituencies.
</P>
<P>
The result of Tehran constituency will be announced soon and a
run-off for the remaining seats will be held within two weeks, the
council said.
</P>
<P>
The reformists were expected to take over the Majlis on May 28,
but the new Majlis can officially start its work only after a
minimum of 190 parliamentarians were confirmed by the Guardians
Council.
</P>
<P>
If the election results in Tehran is nullified, the new Majlis
must wait until the result of the run-off.
</P>
<P>
The council's depriving nine reformists of their eligibility
aroused a series of protests, which, however, were drowned by a
nationwide conservative condemnation of reformists and their deeds.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives blast the reformists for advocating "U.S.-
style reforms in Iran." The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,
rejected "U.S.-style reforms" and vowed to defend the Islamic
values and principles.
</P>
<P>
He further accused the reformist press of becoming "enemy
strongholds" inside the country.
</P>
<P>
The reformists hit back by accusing the conservatives of trying
to prevent the formation of the new Majlis and undermine the reform
process of the president.

The spokesman said that at 10:45 (0645 GMT), eight formations of
U.S. and British planes made 16 armed sorties over northern Iraq
and bombed two villages, Al-Erbeid and Abu Nashka, in addition to
the Al-Eidan filling station in the northern Neiveva province.
</P>
<P>
The driver, identified as Tahsein Hussein Mohammad, was killed,
and the truck he was driving was badly damaged, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that at 10:50 (0650 GMT) and 17:00 (1300
GMT) on Tuesday, 21 formations of U.S. and British jets made 28
armed sorties from bases in Saudi Arabia and 17 armed sorties from
bases in Kuwait, overflying the southern Iraqi provinces of Basra,
Misan, Thi-Qar, Qadissiyah, Wasit, Muthana and Najaf.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi air defense artillery challenged the enemy planes and
forced them to flee back, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. and Britain launched the Operation Desert Fox air
strikes against Iraq in December 1998, their warplanes have made a
total of 20,601 armed sorties, 16,799 from bases in Saudi Arabia
and Kuwait, 3,802 from bases in Turkey, over the two so-called no-
fly zones in northern and southern Iraq, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's attacks came at a time when Iraq lodged strong
protests to the United Nations over the continued U.S. and British
raids against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In two letters, one to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the
other to president of the U.N. Security Council, Iraqi Foreign
Minister Mohammad Said Al-Sahaf said that 295 Iraqi civilians have
been killed and 860 others injured in the regular bombings of the
U.S. and British planes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and British warplanes patrol the two no-fly zones in
what they maintain as an effort to protect the Kurds in the north
and Shiite Muslims in the south from "possible persecution of the
Iraqi government."
</P>
<P>
Iraq does not recognize the air exclusion zones for their lack
of explicit authorization from the U.N. Security Council.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Sounds Warning to Pro-Israeli Militia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 25 (Xinhua) -- A leader of the Hezbollah
guerrillas on Monday warned the pro-Israeli Lebanese militiamen
that they would face reprisal if they stay on after the scheduled
Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon, As Safir newspaper reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, secretary general of Lebanese
Hezbollah, said in an interview with Iran's official Islamic
Republic News Agency that the loyalty of the South Lebanon Army
(SLA) was to Israel, not to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"We do not regard the SLA as a Lebanese group. And if its
members stay behind in their position after the Israeli withdrawal,
this is regarded as aggressive action requiring a reply in the form
of resistance operations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"They either face trial for their acts or should leave the
country alongside their departing Israeli masters," he added.
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah said the SLA militiamen were Lebanese "only on paper"
and their long term plans were to serve the interest of not
Lebanon, but Israel.
</P>
<P>
If the SLA militiamen remained in Lebanese territory after the
(Israeli) pullout, they would be doing so to achieve Israeli
objectives, Nasrallah was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The SLA, funded and controlled by Israel, helps the Jewish state
patrol the 850-square-kilometer zone it has occupied in south
Lebanon since 1985.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian and Syrian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, and
other resistance forces are waging a war of attrition to end SLA
and Israeli control over south Lebanon, the last active Arab-
Israeli battle front.
</P>
<P>
Israel has formally declared that it will withdraw from occupied
south Lebanon by July.

<HEADLINE> Canada Urges Reaffirmed International Commitment to Nuclear Non-proliferation Regime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- It was the time to re-
affirm international commitment to strengthening the nuclear non-
proliferation regime, Canada said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) which
opened here Monday, Lloyd Axworthy, Minister of Foreign Affairs of
Canada, said re-affirmed international commitment to strengthening
the regime would offer the best guarantee of the common security.
</P>
<P>
The NPT Review Conference was an opportunity to identify
shortcomings, to renew determination to build an effective,
international regime, and to come to grips with the emerging
threats to be addressed by the regime, The Minister said.
</P>
<P>
"The tasks are clear. We must give new meaning to the basic
deal underpinning the NPT: a promise by those without nuclear
weapons not to acquire them, in exchange for a commitment by those
possessing such weapons to eventually give them up," the Minister
said.
</P>
<P>
"With that, we must give real meaning to the pledge of '
permanence with accountability" made when NPT was extended
indefinitely," said the Minister.
</P>
<P>
These were certainly Canada's goals, LLoyd Axworthy said. "
First, we are committed to promoting and protecting the Treaty's
universality. We must never slacken in our efforts to engage the
four remaining NPT holdouts of India, Pakistan, Cuba and Israel,
and to seek ways of obtaining their full adherence to the
provisions of the Treaty."
</P>
<P>
"Second, we will work to secure agreement on an updated five-
year Disarmament and Non-Proliferation Action Plan containing
concrete objectives and goals," LLoyd Axworthy said.
</P>
<P>
The Minster said the action plan should be designed to:
</P>
<P>
-- Complete work on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty by
finding a way to bring it into force sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
-- End deadlock at the Conference on Disarmament and begin
negotiations on a ban on fissile material production.
</P>
<P>
-- Continue START reduction in strategic and tactical nuclear
weapons arsenals.
</P>
<P>
-- Stress the need for Russia and the United States to
maintain the integrity of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
</P>
<P>
-- Call on other nuclear weapons states to enter into
disarmament negotiations once the number of U.S. and Russian
strategic warheads is reduced to the 1000-2000 range.
</P>
<P>
-- Extend the application of existing nuclear weapons-free
zones and encourage new zones particularly in areas of tension,
such as the Middle East and South Asia.
</P>
<P>
-- Promote universalization of comprehensive IAEA safeguards
in order to restrict the flow of materials and know-how needed for
the development of nuclear weapons, and
</P>
<P>
-- Further improve verification and inspection capacity and
effectiveness.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Confidence Falls Again In April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consumer confidence fell in
April after declining in March and February, the Conference Board
said in a survey Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board, a New York-based prominent research group,
said its Consumer Confidence Index is now 136.9 down from a
revised 137.1 in March.
</P>
<P>
"The recent volatility of the financial markets has clearly had
little, if any, impact on consumer confidence," said Lynn Franco,
Director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research Center. The
stock market has dropped sharply in recent weeks with the
technology heavy Nasdaq index falling in the bear market.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, while consumers rate current economic conditions less
positively than last month, their short-term outlook has improved.
The boost in optimism, coupled with tax refunds, should continue
to fuel spending."
</P>
<P>
Consumer sentiment is a barometer of the U.S. economy since
consumer spending makes up about two-third of the nation's
economic activity. The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates
five times since last June in an effort to curb consumer spending
which is viewed by the central bankers as an inflation trigger in
the hot economy.
</P>
<P>
The survey said consumer's appraisal of ongoing conditions was
less positive in April than in March. The percentage of
respondents that rated business conditions as "good" declined to
44.5 percent from 45.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The number of survey participants that claim jobs are "hard to
get" rose to 12 percent in April from 10.6 percent in March and
consumers who fell jobs are "plentiful" fell to 52.4 percent from
53.35 percent.
</P>
<P>
But optimism about the short-term outlook rose among consumers
in April, the survey said, adding that the percentage expecting
business conditions to improve during the next six months rose to
15.1 percent from 14.8 percent in the previous survey.

<HEADLINE> Greece Reiterates Stand Over Aegean Differences With Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Greece Tuesday reiterated its
position on its disputes with neighboring Turkey over the eastern
Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
In response to the recent statements by the Turkish Foreign
Minister Ismail Cem and Turkish armed forces chief Hussein
Kivrikoglu, Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said at a
press briefing that only the Aegean's continental shelf ranked as
an issue to be resolved between the two neighboring countries in
the specific maritime region.
</P>
<P>
Reppas stated that Greek-Turkish disputes must be dealt with
through peaceful procedures without the use of force or the threat
of the use of force.
</P>
<P>
If Turkey believed that there were problems it could appeal to
the International Court of Justice at the Hague, he added.
</P>
<P>
For decades, Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have been
at odds over their differences in the territorial waters, air
space limits and the delimitation of the continental shelf in the
Aegean.
</P>
<P>
The Greek side maintains that the only difference separating
the two countries in the Aegean is the issue of the sea's
continental shelf.
</P>
<P>
Since last June, the two long-time rivals have begun to take
steps to improve their strained relations by the holding of a
series of bilateral talks and the signing of a number of
agreements for bilateral cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Sino-U.S. Health Memorandum Signed in Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Two nongovernmental health
associations from the United States and China signed Tuesday here
a Memorandum of Understanding, which marked the beginning of a
collaborative relationship between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was struck between the American Public Health
Association (APHA) and the China Prevention Medicine Association (
CPMA). And Dr. Mohammad Akhter, Executive Director of APHA, and Dr.
Wang Hexiang, Secretary General of CPMA, signed the memorandum.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Wang said at the signing ceremony that China has a lot of
things to learn from the United States in the field of public
health management, and the agreement will help Chinese public
health workers strengthen their nonprofit public health
association, develop training and continuing education programs
for public health workers and tackle some of the country's bigger
health problems.
</P>
<P>
For example, three of the top public health concerns in China
today - tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and tobacco use - are challenges
that U.S. public officials have experience fighting for decades.
</P>
<P>
APHA is the world's oldest and largest public health
organization, and CPMA is a relatively young nongovernmental
organization. Both are working to develop effective public health
systems and programs in China and improve health throughout the
world.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Urged to Set Up Security Mechanism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has called on the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) to carefully
scrutinize the implications of establishing a COMESA mechanism on
peace and security by avoiding the duplication of duties.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Affairs Minister Kelly Walubita made this remarks when
he officially opened the first meeting of the COMESA committee on
peace and security in Lusaka on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Walubita observed that the duplication of duties and conflict
of interests between organizations should be avoided.
</P>
<P>
He noted that COMESA was a sum total of member states which
belonged to other sub-regional groupings adding that those groups
had already formed similar organs to deal with matters of peace
and security hence the need to avoid duplication of duties.
</P>
<P>
The Minister called upon the participants to look at the gaps
which other regional groupings had not covered and consider ways
in which COMESA could address them in search for lasting solutions
to peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the participants to recognize and consider
the important work and roles of the various systems of the United
Nations (UN) and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) with a
view to finding ways in which COMESA could play a role in the
maintenance of peace and security in the world.
</P>
<P>
Walubita urged the participants to explore modalities through
which COMESA could work together with other regional organizations
such as the Southern African Development Community (SADC) on
issues of peace and security.
</P>
<P>
He noted that peace, security and political stability were
vital preconditions for regional economic development and
integration.
</P>
<P>
"Vital aspects of regional economic integration and
development, such as free movement of goods, services, capital and
persons, cannot be attained in an environment of instability."
</P>
<P>
"We do not need to be reminded of the impact of conflicts on
our economies among which are displacement of persons, creation of
refugees and the destruction of the environment," he said.
</P>
<P>
And addressing the same meeting, COMESA Secretary-General
Erastus Mwencha observed that half of the COMESA member states was
involved in armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
He said as a result of those conflicts, the COMESA member
states would find it difficult to meet their goals because the
free movement of goods, capital and persons in the COMESA region
would be impeded by conflicts.
</P>
<P>
He however noted that Zambian president Frederick Chiluba was
already involved in the mediation of peace talks in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo while Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi had
also undertaken missions to Ethiopia and Eritrea as part of the
overall OAU peace strategy.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Center for Human
Settlements (Habitat) will host a preparatory committee session
here during May 8-12 this year in preparation for the U.N.
Conference on Human Settlements (or the City Summit) scheduled for
June 2001.
</P>
<P>
According to a news release issued here by the Habitat on
Tuesday, approximately 700 ministers, mayors and representatives
of non- governmental organizations from around the world are
expected to meet at the Habitat headquarters in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The preparatory committee session is to be held in response to
the second City Summit held in Istanbul in 1996, where 171
governments adopted the Habitat Agenda to highlight the importance
of urbanization and the role of cities.
</P>
<P>
During the next year's City Summit, the Habitat said, these
same governments will not only review and appraise the
implementation of the Habitat Agenda, but also present their
achievements on the promises they made in Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
During the coming committee session, the delegates will focus
on the scope of the review and appraisal process, and introduce
new and innovative ways in which to manage the problems of
urbanization.
</P>
<P>
Klaus Toepfer, Acting Executive Director of the Habitat, said
that over three billion people or half of humanity now live in
cities and towns, which means that the future of the planet is
closely linked to the successful management of our urban areas.

</P>
<P>
Jiang told Mandela that the Pretoria Declaration on the

</P>
<P>
Although China is far from Africa geographically, the two sides
are on intimate terms because "we have the similar historical

<HEADLINE> African Summit on Fighting Malaria Opens in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The first ever African summit on
fighting malaria opened Tuesday in the Nigerian capital Abuja,
attended by leaders from more than 40 African countries and dozens
of international agencies.
</P>
<P>
Opening the one-day summit aimed at refocusing attention on
malaria, Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo said the devastating
death toll from malaria in Africa called for a total cancellation
of the continent's debt to free resources to combat the deadly
disease.
</P>
<P>
"The gravity of the malaria problem with all its ramifications
provides a strong case for the forgiveness of all African debts,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the heads of state to implement a plan of
action aimed at reducing the incidence of malaria by half in
Africa by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika said in his
capacity as head of the Organization of African Unity that African
leaders could not remain indifferent faced with this challenge of
malaria.
</P>
<P>
Malaria, a mosquito-borne disease, is said to be a major cause
of human and economic underdevelopment in Africa. Current United
Nations statistics indicate that malaria kills at least one
million people each year, some 90 percent of them in African
countries.
</P>
<P>
The record also shows that "nearly 500 million people suffer
globally from acute malaria, 90 percent of the burden taking place
in Africa."
</P>
<P>
However, malaria is preventable and curable. The most effective
way is to avoid being bitten by mosquito which carries the
parasite.
</P>
<P>
The summit, proposed by Obasanjo last year, is co-sponsored by
the World Health Organization, the United Nations Children's Fund,
the United Nations Development Program, the World Bank and the
African Development Bank.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: African Summit on Fighting Malaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Leaders from more than 40 African
countries met in Nigeria's capital Abuja on Tuesday to make
strategy to confront one of the top killers across the African
continent -- malaria.
</P>
<P>
The one-day African summit on malaria, proposed by Nigerian
President Olusegun Obasanjo last year, was co-sponsored by the
Nigerian government and four United Nations agencies: the World
Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF), the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by the WHO recently, malaria
kills one child every 30 seconds in the world, with Africa getting
most of the death toll.
</P>
<P>
The statistics also show that malaria kills over one million
people each year globally, with 90 percent of the victims in
African countries.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,500 African children under the age of five die from
malaria every day; and whereas the disease is on the retreat in
other continents, it is spreading across Africa.
</P>
<P>
Malaria has worsened the already daunting poverty relief
situation in the African continent, where some two billion U.S.
dollars were lost annually due to the disease and related ones in
recent years, the UNDP said.
</P>
<P>
It said some families in African countries had to spend an
average of one-quarter of their income on malaria treatment.
</P>
<P>
According to Jeffrey Sachs, a renowned American economist who
is also in Abuja to attend the summit, the cost of malaria,
including lost work time and money, reduces the growth rate of
most sub-Saharan African countries by more than one percentage
point each year.
</P>
<P>
African nations have been making concerted efforts to contain
the human and economic scourge caused by the disease and their
efforts culminated in the endorsement of the Harare Declaration on
Malaria by African leaders in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
Their efforts were boosted by the WHO, UNICEF, UNDP and the
World Bank in 1998 when they jointly launched the Roll Back
Malaria Initiative. It was in order to further concretize the two
sides' cooperation that President Obasanjo proposed a summit on
the initiative.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, African leaders are expected to call on Western
governments and companies to step up their research into a vaccine
for malaria.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, international organizations have been on a
campaign for wider use of cheaper means to combat the disease such
as specially treated bed nets and effective medicines.
</P>
<P>
With a greater commitment from governments and donors, to the
distribution of mosquito bed nets and effective drugs the WHO
believes it can attain its target of reducing the incidence of
malaria by half in Africa by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that whatever declarations made at the Abuja
summit will be submitted to the next meeting of Organization of
African Unity (OAU) for adoption and implementation.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets S. African Vice President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRETORIA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
expressed his hope here on Tuesday that China and South Africa
should spare no effort to push forward the development of the
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
China is pleased to see that great progress has been made in
cooperation between the two countries although diplomatic ties
were forged only two years ago, Jiang said during his meeting with
South African Vice President Jacob Zuma.
</P>
<P>
Jiang is here on a state visit at the invitation of his South
African counterpart Thabo Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Jiang also praised the tremendous
achievement South Africa has scored in the economic and social
development since the apartheid was ended six years ago.
</P>
<P>
He told Zuma that the talks between the two heads of the states
on Tuesday morning turned out to be fruitful because the two sides
reached consensus on many issues.
</P>
<P>
Although the two countries have a short history of diplomatic
relations, the contacts between the two ruling parties began long
ago and they share similar views on major international affairs,
Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral partnership relations and the establishment of a
bi- national commission will help the two sides strengthen
coordination and cooperation, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of Zuma's contributions to pushing forward the
development of the Sino-South African ties, and invited him to
visit China at his convenient time.
</P>
<P>
Zuma extended his warm welcome to Jiang, saying that Jiang's
current South Africa visit is an important one.
</P>
<P>
It is of great significance for South Africa to pursue cemented
 cooperation with China because such relations will play an
important role in the African renaissance cause advocated by
President Mbeki, Zuma said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his thanks for China's support to South Africa's
struggle against the apartheid system.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is the last leg of Jiang's five-nation tour. The
visit has brought him to Israel, Palestine, Turkey and Greece.
Jiang also met with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in the
Alexandria city of Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Conservative Watchdog Find Errors in Vote- Count </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Guardians Council, dominated
by the conservatives, announced Tuesday that it found serious
differences while recounting votes of the February parliamentary
elections in Tehran constituency.
</P>
<P>
The election watchdog hinted that it may nullify the polling
result in the Iranian capital, where reformists allied with
President Mohammad Khatami won 29 of the 30 seats in the first two
vote-counts.
</P>
<P>
"The serious differences between the recount and the previous
result were unprecedented in elections and cast a shadow over the
whole result," the council said in a statement, released by the
official Islamic Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
It suspected that some of the vote boxes had been opened and
votes inside changed in the constituency, the biggest and most
important one in the country. But it gave no evidence or proof.
</P>
<P>
The reformists won a landslide victory in the parliamentary
elections in February, which was humiliating to the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
The Guardians Council last week ordered a third recount of some
boxes in Tehran constituency, apparently in response to accusations
of election irregularities.
</P>
<P>
The council's announcement comes amid mounting conservative
crackdown on reformist press. The judiciary have closed down 13
reformist publications on Sunday and Monday and sent several
reformist publishers and journalists to prison at the same time.
</P>
<P>
The council said that it has confirmed the eligibility of 185
elected for the upcoming sixth, 290-seat Majlis (parliament), but
nullified that of nine others from seven constituencies.
</P>
<P>
The result of Tehran constituency will be announced soon and a
run-off for the remaining seats will be held within two weeks, the
council said.
</P>
<P>
The reformists were expected to take over the Majlis on May 28,
but the new Majlis can officially start its work only after a
minimum of 190 parliamentarians were confirmed by the Guardians
Council.
</P>
<P>
If the election results in Tehran is nullified, the new Majlis
must wait until the result of the run-off.
</P>
<P>
The council's depriving seven reformists of their eligibility
aroused a series of protests, which, however, were drown by a
nationwide conservative condemnation of reformists and their deeds.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives blast the reformists for advocating "U.S.-
style reforms in Iran." The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,
rejected "U.S.-style reforms" and vowed to defend the Islamic
values and principles.
</P>
<P>
He further accused the reformist press of becoming "enemy
strongholds" inside the country.
</P>
<P>
The reformists hit back by accusing the conservatives of trying
to prevent the formation of the new Majlis and undermine the reform
process of the president.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia, Iran Keen to Maintain Stable Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia and Iran have
voiced keenness to maintain stable bilateral relations and forge
good ties between Iran and other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
states, the Saudi Press Agency monitored here reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement made Monday night in the western Saudi city of
Jeddah, Saudi Second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense
and Aviation, Prince Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz, said Riyadh is "
supporting good relations and cooperation between Iran and the GCC
states, especially the United Arab Emirates (UAE)."
</P>
<P>
The statement was made in a joint press conference after the
prince's meeting with visiting Iranian Defense Minister Ali
Shamkhani.
</P>
<P>
Both Abu Dhabi and Tehran declared sovereignty over the isles of
Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs, located in the mouth of
the strategic Strait of Hormuz. The islands are now controlled by
Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi prince voiced hope that the dispute would be settled
through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Shamkhani, who arrived in Jeddah Monday as the
first Iranian defense minister to visit Saudi Arabia since the 1979
Islamic Revolution, asserted that "the common geographic, historic
and cultural aspects of Iran and Saudi Arabia necessitate the
development of bilateral ties."
</P>
<P>
He also stressed keenness on strengthening relations, based on
mutual understanding, between Iran and the Arab countries,
including the GCC states--Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia and the UAE.
</P>
<P>
Shamkhani said Iran is earnestly looking forward to the visit of
Defense Minister Sheikh Bin Rashid al-Maktoum of the UAE, the first
GCC country that Shamkhani had visited.
</P>
<P>
Shamkhani is expected to meet later in the day with Saudi King
Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz and Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Saudi Arabia were in mistrust and discord for nearly
two decades because of Tehran's former policy of exporting the
ideology of its 1979 Islamic Revolution which toppled the late
shah's regime and brought about the clergymen's rule.
</P>
<P>
Their relations warmed up after Iran's moderate President
Mohammad Khatami took office in August 1997 and adopted a policy of
detente.
</P>
<P>
The past years have witnessed steady improvement in relations
between the two big Gulf powers in the political and economic
fields.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian defense minister is now in Saudi Arabia to "
negotiate a comprehensive agreement on security cooperation."

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Social Policy in Asia Faces More Challenges (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 25 (Xinhua ) -- Social policy in the Asia-
Pacific region has become more difficult with the ever-growing
population, increased globalization and technological advancement,
a group of senior Chinese and foreign social policy researchers
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Researchers also urged policy-makers in the region not to stay
complacent but be ready to break away from conventional paradigms
and search for innovative ways to address the ever-changing needs
of the community.
</P>
<P>
The ever-growing population of the Asia-Pacific region "will
inevitably bring about new challenges to governments," said
Secretary for Hong Kong Health and Welfare Department E. K. Yeoh
when addressing the opening ceremony of the Conference on
Repositioning the State: Challenges and Experiences of Social
Policy in the Asia-Pacific Region in Hong Kong Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that the population of the region will
increase from 3,693 million in mid-1999 to 4,523 million in 2020.
</P>
<P>
"And at the same time, two new factors - the increased
globalization and technological advancement - are increasingly
affecting the way in which we live and which will have an ever-
significant impact on social policy," Yeoh stressed.
</P>
<P>
Increased globalization means greater inter-state interaction
and interdependency, and technological advancement, in terms of
information technology and e-commerce, will open new opportunities
and present challenges for the delivery of social services
throughout the region, Yeoh explained.
</P>
<P>
As part of the global economy, the Asian financial turmoil
swept over Hong Kong, making its impact felt in the form of
negative economic growth, high unemployment, deflation and a
depressed property market, Yeoh said, adding that this has
inevitably resulted in the emergence of a host of social problems.
</P>
<P>
"The globalization will exert massive negative impacts not only
on the domestic social inequality but the enlarging of the
international gap between the developed and developing countries,"
said Guan Xinping, professor of China's Nankai University, in his
speech entitled "China's Social Policy in the Context of
Globalization."

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Social Policy in Asia Faces More Challenges (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Researchers believed that the European welfare state's golden
age in the early post-war years was under the condition of a
protected economy, which no longer functioned well after the 1970s
when more free trade and less restriction to capital's free
movement began to be implemented into the world economy by GATT's
negotiation mechanism.
</P>
<P>
They warned that the most of the Asian countries are more
vulnerable to any global crisis since they are a kind of exports-
based, open economies.
</P>
<P>
In a more open economy, the government faces pressures both
from the enlarging of its social welfare programs to deal with the
increasing urban unemployment and poverty caused by the
international competition and from the reduction of its social
expenditure in order to strengthen the economic competitiveness of
the country, Guan said.
</P>
<P>
After the future accession into the WTO, China's social policy
has to face more challenges than ever before, including stronger
international competition, increasing average income, higher
inequality and more poverty, higher demand in social protection,
and further restructuring of economic and social systems, as well
as the rapid aging population.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day discussion, researchers also suggested a
number of different measures to meet the future challenges in view
of different political and economic conditions of each country and
area in the region.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, the most pressing tasks are reforming the welfare
subvention system, developing a strategic needs assessment
mechanism, defining the role of individuals, families, the
community and the government, strengthening inter-sectoral
collaboration amongst various policy-makers and agencies, and
reforming the health care sector, they said.
</P>
<P>
In Japan, gender has become an important factor in social
politics in recent years, and it is now at the center of the
welfare state restructuring debate, according to Ito Peng, an
associate professor from the School of Policy Studies of Kwansei
Gakuin University in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Peng said that the post-war Japanese welfare state has
continuously shifted its positions on public child care by
weighing the country's economic needs for women's labor against
the various fiscal and demographic pressures.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Japanese government has no choice but to
consider ways to reconcile the contradiction of conservative and
highly gendered welfare state to extend social welfare,
particularly those related to the care of the young and the old,
she said.
</P>
<P>
Examining the income transfer to the elderly in the Republic of
Korea and China's Taiwan, Huck-ju Kwon, assistant professor of the
Sung Kyun Kwan University in Seoul, said that urgent policy is
necessary to prevent further deterioration in the living standard
of the elderly, especially in the wake of the economic crisis, and
public transfer will play a bigger role than now as the public
pension programs in the Republic of Korea come into full operation
in due course.
</P>
<P>
In China, researchers suggested that efforts should be made to
quicken the pace of the development of non-profit organizations in
all fields of social welfare, saying it has played an ever
important role since the country introduced the policy of reforms
and opening to the outside world. They called it the "third sector.
"
</P>
<P>
Over 30 scholars on social policy from Japan, the Republic of
Korea, China's mainland and Hong Kong and Taiwan, as well as other
countries and areas attended the two-day event.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians, Israel Discuss Interim Phase Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian and Israeli negotiators
concluded another round of talks on the interim-phase issues in the
West Bank city of Jericho Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
During their two-hour meeting, the two sides discussed the
release of more Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails, the
opening of a northern safe passage linking the West Bank and Gaza,
and the possibility of building another Palestinian airport in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
They also tackled economic and financial cooperation in
accordance with the interim Sharm el Sheikh agreement signed last
September in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Saeb Erekat, head of the Palestinian team, told reporters after
the meeting that the Israeli side promised to consider the list of
prisoners the Palestinians asked to be released.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, a top Palestinian official disclosed that
the Palestinian side would demand Israel to set free 230 prisoners,
including the elderly, the sick and those jailed prior to the
establishment of the Palestinian autonomous regime in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,600 Palestinians are still detained by Israeli
authorities.
</P>
<P>
On the airport issue, Erekat said the Palestinians prefer the
old tarmac in Kalandia to the north of Jerusalem to a new port in
Jericho. Gaza International Airport was opened for civil aviation
about a year and half ago to be the sole air transport outlet in
the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
"We agreed on every thing regarding Gaza harbor and the
construction process will kick off soon," Erekat said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm el Sheikh deal, the construction scheme in Gaza
sea port should have started early last October but was put off due
to lack of funds and the obstacles laid by the Israeli side.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, chief Israeli negotiator Oded Eran said "We may reach
an agreement over what we discussed today in two weeks from now."
</P>
<P>
The two sides, moreover, signed a joint message to be conveyed
to the United States Administration, asking for a 50-million-U.S.-
dollar aid to carry out the projects of the interim phase.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Jordanian King Discuss Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
visiting King Abdullah II of Jordan discussed the latest
developments of the Middle East peace process, particularly on the
Palestinian track, and bilateral ties in the West Bank city of
Ramallah Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
According to Voice of Palestine radio, Arafat briefed Abdullah
on his recent talks in Washington with United States President Bill
Clinton, while the Jordanian King outlined his Sunday meeting with
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in Eilat, southern Israel.
</P>
<P>
In a joint news briefing with Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdel
Ilah al-Khatib following the meeting, Palestinian Minister of
International Cooperation Nabil Shaath said the summit was "
important and positive," particularly as it took place after
Arafat's Washington trip and Abdullah's recent visits to Egypt and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Palestinian National Authority called for
an inclusive solution to all issues of the final-status talks with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that the Israeli side was not prepared in
this period to sign a final-status framework agreement which
involves such thorny issues as the fate of Jerusalem, borders,
Palestinian refugees, Jewish settlements and water.
</P>
<P>
Al-Khatib hailed the "distinguished" Jordanian-Palestinian ties,
reiterating Jordan's firm support for the Palestinian cause and the
establishment of an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah's visit to Palestine came within the continued
consultations between the two sides, he said, stressing that Jordan
has been pursuing a just and fair peace in the Middle East to the
common benefit of all parties.
</P>
<P>
King Abdullah returned home after the brief visit in the company
of Queen Rania and a number of top Jordanian officials. Arafat
awarded his guest the collar of "Bethlehem 2000" in appreciation
for the king's support for the Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Barak in Eilat, Abdullah stressed that
the Palestinian issue is the core of the Arab-Israeli conflict,
suggesting that Jerusalem could be a joint capital of Israel and
the future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Another round of Palestinian-Israel final-status talks is due to
kick off in Eilat on April 30 in a bid to conclude the framework
agreement in advance of a final peace treaty tabled to be signed
next September.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt Continues Attack on Abu Sayyaf Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government troopers
moved in closer Tuesday to the lairs of the Abu Sayyaf group which
holds hostage some 28 people, as air strikes continued in Mt.
Punoh Mahajid in the southern Province of Basilan, the authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Southern Command of the Armed Forces of the
Philippines (AFP) in Zamboanga city said in a statement that a
communication tower and two generators in the Abu Sayyaf camp were
destroyed on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They said three government troopers were killed in the initial
assaults and three others wounded. Meanwhile, government troopers
recovered 14 high-powered guns in the area left behind by Abu
Sayyaf extremists.
</P>
<P>
Southern Command Chief Major Gen. Diomedio Villanueva said the
operations will continue.
</P>
<P>
The military launched massive rescue operations last Saturday
and is continuing its assault, involving artillery and air attacks
in support of ground troops, said to be closing in against the
kidnap group.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, truck-loads of Citizens Armed Forces Geographical
Unit (CAFGU) members have also been mobilized by Basilan Governor
Wahab Akbar to augment military troopers.
</P>
<P>
The augmentation of the CAFGU personnel came after the military
suffered several casualties due to lack of knowledge of the
terrain in the province.
</P>
<P>
Akbar said the deployment of the auxiliary forces is to finish
the rescue operation the soonest time possible.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the AFP is giving itself until Wednesday to finish
the operations to rescue the 28 remaining hostages being held by
the Abu Sayyaf since March 20.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have warned they will behead their five remaining
male hostages, including a priest, if the military does not halt
its assault.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, who announced last week that they had beheaded two
male hostages, have demanded the freeing of Arab terrorists held
in jails in the United States, including the mastermind of the
1993 World Trade Center bombing.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf is the smaller but more radical of two Muslim
groups fighting for an independent Islamic state in the southern
Philippines. It has been blamed for numerous attacks on Christians.

<HEADLINE> S'pore Parliament Approves Chemical Weapons Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's Parliament Tuesday
approved a bill designed to implement the country's obligations as
a signatory to the 1993 Convention on the Prohibition of the
Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons
and on their Destruction (CWC).
</P>
<P>
The CWC is the result of 20 years of negotiations in the United
Nations Conference on Disarmament and it has been ratified by 129
countries including the United States and Russia. Singapore signed
the CWC in 1997 and ratified it in the same year.
</P>
<P>
In his second reading speech, Singapore Minister for Foreign
Affairs S. Jayakumar said that besides the obvious security
benefits in a world that is free of chemical weapons, there are
also other advantages to ratification.
</P>
<P>
As a member of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons (OPCW) established by the CWC, he said, Singapore can
obtain technical assistance from other member countries if
threatened with an attack by chemical weapons and ratification is
also expected to facilitate trade in chemicals which are
controlled by the Convention.
</P>
<P>
Jayakumar told parliament that the bill will have a limited
impact on the commercial operations of Singapore's companies in
the chemical and other industries.

<HEADLINE> New Study Shows Dinosaur Warmblooded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first-ever fossilized dinosaur heart seems to have four
chambers which indicate that dinosaurs were warmblooded animals,
like birds and mammals, scientists from the North Carolina State
University wrote in the latest issue of journal Science.
</P>
<P>
The dinosaur, called Thescelosaurus living 66 million years ago,
was unearthed in 1993 by professional fossil hunter Michael Hammer,
working with his son in South Dakota's Hell Creek, where they had
found dinosaurs earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
As he began emptying the chest cavity, Hammer saw a concretion
and suspected it was the heart because of the placement. Then, a
team of researchers from North Carolina State University began the
heart investigation, which led to the discovery of the four-
chambered heart.
</P>
<P>
Team member Dale Russell, a paleontologist explained that the
key finding was not the heart but the single aorta.
</P>
<P>
"This means that low- and high-oxygen blood were separated,"
Russell said, a signal that Thescelosaurus had much higher
metabolism than cold-blooded reptiles, which have two aortas and
mixed low- and high-oxygen blood.
</P>
<P>
"A higher metabolic rate means a higher activity level,"
Russell said, a trait commonly noted among warm-blooded animals
like birds and mammals.
</P>
<P>
Although the findings support the view that dinosaurs were warm-
blooded, Russell noted that research up to now has focused on
raptors and other small carnivores that display the strongest
evidence of a bird-dinosaur link.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Existing-Home Sales Rise in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Sales of existing homes rose 1.
5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.83 million
units in March, the second straight monthly gain, the National
Association of Realtors reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The increase in existing-home sales came despite the rising
mortgage rates. Many analysts had expected sales to fall 1.7
percent in March.
</P>
<P>
In February, sales of existing homes climbed nearly 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Americans have been feeling better off and in a buying mood
because of plentiful jobs, rising incomes, tame inflation and
stock market gains. And, there are lots of available financing
options in an environment of rising mortgage rates.
</P>
<P>
The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 8.24
percent in March, up from 7.02 percent for the same month a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
Economists expect home sales to slow this year but still remain
at healthy levels. Compared with the same month a year ago, March
sales were 9.2 percent lower.
</P>
<P>
In March, the median existing-home sales price, meaning half
sold for more and half for less, was 134,400 U.S. dollars, up 3.7
percent from the median price for the same month a year ago.
</P>
<P>
By region, the West posted the biggest sales gain, seeing
existing-home sales rise 10.7 percent last month to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 1.24 million units.
</P>
<P>
Existing-home sales rose 1.7 percent in the Northeast to a rate
of 600,000 in March, while sales in the Midwest rose 1.8 percent
to a rate of 1.11 million units. Sales in the South, however, fell
4.1 percent to a rate of 1.88 million units.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets With South African President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRETORIA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin met with South African President Thabo Mbeki here on Tuesday
to discuss a range of regional and international issues of common
concern.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders agreed that cooperation between the two countries
was complementary in many fields and had great potentials for
further expansion.
</P>
<P>
This, they said, called for a high-level mechanism to guide and
 coordinate such cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the establishment of diplomatic ties in early 1998
paved the way for cooperation between China and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said China and South Africa, both as developing countries,
exerted great influence in the Asian and African regions
respectively and shared a common goal of safeguarding the
interests of developing countries and pushing for the building-up
of a just and reasonable new international order.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said promoting and deepening Sino-South African
cooperation conformed with the long-term and fundamental interests
of both countries and would benefit world peace and development as
well.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China, which attached importance to the unique
role played by South Africa in regional and international affairs,
expected to develop long-term, stable and friendly cooperative
ties with South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Close cooperation between the two countries, he noted, was
particularly important at a time when chauvinism and power
politics posed a threat to world peace and security.
</P>
<P>
He lauded Mbeki's concept of "African Renaissance", saying this
idea was a follow-up and development of Pan-Africanism pursued by
the old generation of African leaders.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the idea, which reflected the sense of
responsibility displayed by South Africa to strive for the revival
of the African continent, would contribute to peace and
development in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, extending his warm welcome to Jiang, said his visit, the
first by a Chinese head of state since the establishment of
diplomatic relations, was of great significance to the development
of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa and China could cooperate in many fields
and such cooperation was important for the development of South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said there are no problems between South Africa and China
which enjoyed good cooperation. The only challenge for the two
countries, he said, was how to enhance bilateral ties to a higher
level of vitality.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between South Africa and China served as a good
example for other developing countries seeking inter-state
cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki stressed that South Africa and China should cooperate
more closely with other developing countries so as to exert
positive influence on the setting up of a new international
economic order. He reiterated South African support for China to
join the World Trade Organization at an earliest date possible.
</P>
<P>
Jiang arrived in South Africa on Monday for a four-day state
visit, the last leg of his five-nation tour which has brought him
to Israel, Palestine, Turkey and Greece. During his stopover in
Alexandria, Egypt, Jiang also met with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Appeals to Promote Sino-African Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRETORIA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said here Tuesday that China hopes to further its ties with
the African countries by hosting a ministerial-level meeting on
Sino-African cooperation this October in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, called the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation --
Ministerial Conference Beijing 2000, is the first of its kind both
in the annals of Sino-African relations and in the 50-year
diplomatic history of China, said Jiang during his talks with
South African President Thabo Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
Jiang cited the holding of the conference as an important
measure China adopts in the new millennium to consolidate the
Sino-African friendly cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China will invite ministers in charge of foreign affairs and
foreign economic cooperation and trade from African countries to
participate in the conference, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped South Africa, an important African country, to attend
the conference to make it a success and lay new foundation for the
further advancement of the bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said in response that his country is looking forward to
the convening of the meeting, and will dispatch a delegation to
attend the forum.
</P>
<P>
The conference will help the African countries resolve some of
their problems and boost the ties between Africa and China, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
He added that all African countries would like to consolidate
ties with China because China has not only stood on their side
during their struggle against the colonialism, but also helped
them in the construction of their countries after they gained
independence.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is the last leg of Jiang's five-nation tour which
has brought him to Israel, Palestine, Turkey and Greece. He also
met with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in the Egyptian city of
Alexandria.

said here Tuesday that China always adheres to the principles of
peaceful reunification and "one country, two systems" in the

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Russian Federal Troops Rebuff Fresh Rebel Ambush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal troops on Tuesday
rebuffed a fresh ambush mounted by rebels in the breakaway
republic of Chechnya, a ranking military official said.
</P>
<P>
A federal serviceman was wounded in the one-hour fighting when
his armored personnel carrier was hit, but the rebels were
subsequently "dispersed and partially eliminated," said Colonel
General Valery Manilov, first deputy chief of the Russian General
Staff.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's attack came just two days after another rebel ambush
that killed 13 federal servicemen.
</P>
<P>
The federal military convoy, which consisted of a unit of a
reconnaissance battalion and a motorized infantry company, was
moving from Urus-Martan to Shatoi when the ambush took place.
</P>
<P>
The rebels attacked the column about four kilometers from the
so-called Wolf Gates at the entrance to the Argun gorge near the
village of Yaryshmardy.
</P>
<P>
"The column instantly responded by launching an artillery
counterattack against the rebels' revealed firing positions. Mi-24
helicopter gunships urgently arrived at the scene and delivered a
strike against the rebel positions," Manilov said.
</P>
<P>
Russia launched the military campaign last September following
waves of armed Chechen incursions into neighboring Dagestan and a
spate of terrorist bombings that killed over 300 people in Moscow
and two other cities.
</P>
<P>
With most of Chechnya under federal control and only pockets of
rebel formations in the southern mountains, the Russian military
has declared that the military phase of the campaign has completed.
</P>
<P>
The accent is now being shifted to special operations, Manilov
said, noting that a little over 3,000 rebels remain in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
He said that the federal forces have killed 13,500 rebels since
August, including over 2,500 rebels that died between August and
October in the fighting in Dagestan and other areas bordering
Chechnya.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Swiss police started an
investigation on Tuesday into two bomb attacks in the capital of
Bern against the defense ministry and the government's new
intelligence coordinator.
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in the explosions and the damage was minor,
said the police.
</P>
<P>
According to Swiss Radio International, a left-wing extremist
group has claimed responsibility for Tuesday's explosions.
</P>
<P>
The radio report said the group, called the "Revolutionary
Perspective", sent a letter to the police claiming that it
launched the attacks aimed at an exhibition on the Swiss army due
to open in Basel this week.
</P>
<P>
The group hit the Belgian consulate in Zurich in a paint bomb
attack in 1998, said the report.
</P>
<P>
One of the two explosive devices was planted at the house of
the government's new intelligence coordinator Jacques Pitteloud,
and the other outside a building housing offices of the defense
ministry in the city of Bern.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the defense ministry condemned the attacks,
saying that the army exhibition would go ahead as planned.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Jirao, Chinese vice
minister of water resources, today inspected Beijing's water
control facilities and urged the importance of preparations for
possible flooding.
</P>
<P>

Relief Headquarters inspected the flood discharge and holding
projects in the Shijingshan, Fengtai, and Fangshan districts and
Daxing County in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that Beijing, the national capital, is prone to
floods and has been frequently struck by flood disasters through
history.
</P>
<P>
The importance of the anti-flood works in the Haihe River
Valley, which covers Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei Province, cannot
been underestimated, Zhang stressed.

His inspection will continue through April 28 in Tianjin and
Hebei.

Major dykes protecting downtown Beijing were reinforced after
the floods of 1998, the country's second worst flood disaster year.

dredging of river courses.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's water control officials have been devoted to both
flood prevention and drought relief efforts, since the capital
began suffering a severe drought at the start of this year.

HONG KONG, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special

an agreement on the transfer of sentenced persons as part of the
efforts to facilitate further cooperation in the enforcement of
penal sentences.

Being the fifth of its kind concluded by the HKSAR, the
agreement will enable sentenced persons of Hong Kong and Thailand
to be transferred back to their home countries to serve their
custodial sentences.

<P>
"This will facilitate the rehabilitation of sentenced persons,
as they would be able to serve their sentences in an environment
free of language and cultural barriers," said Secretary for
Security Regina Ip, who signed the agreement on behalf of the
HKSAR government.
</P>
<P>
The agreement represents another important step forward in
building cooperation between Hong Kong and Thailand in the area of
criminal justice and international law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are some 80 Hong Kong residents serving
sentences in Thailand, making up the biggest group of Hong Kong
residents serving sentences in a foreign country. Meanwhile over
30 Thai nationals are serving their jail term in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Oil to Be Main Source of Fuel in 15 Years: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Oil will be the main source of
transportation fuel for at least the next 15 years, and demand for
it is expected to increase in the transportation sector, predicted
a Kuwaiti energy expert Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Demand for oil in the transportation sector, especially in the
emerging economies in southeast Asia will increase by 4.5 percent
annually, said Dr. Mohmmed Al-Ramadan, executive assistant to the
managing board director of Kuwait Petroleum Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ramadan said this growth rate will offset the possible drop
in demand in the industrial countries who might begin using other
types of energy for their means of transportation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, oil will be the main source of fuel for 90
percent of cars within a 15-year period, as it will grow more
important that cars turn to use other types of fuel in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti expert said that in the past century global energy
consumption in the transportation sector, which rose by 2.7 percent
annually during 1971-1992, constituted half of the world oil
consumption.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the increased energy consumption in
transportation has led to environmental problems such as air
pollution and global warming.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ramadan hailed the efforts in the last couple of years to
protect the environment and reduce dependence on oil.
</P>
<P>
He said these efforts stressed on developing technology for
alternative means of ground transportation and discovering other
sources of energy than oil.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Keep its Nuclear Policy Ambiguous: Deputy DM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Israel will maintain its
strategy of ambiguity on the nuclear weapons issue, with neither
acknowledgment nor denial of the possession of nuclear weapons,
Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed by Israeli Army Radio, Sneh said that Israel has
followed the nuclear opacity policy for years in a formula that
Israel will not be the first country to introduce nuclear weapons
into the Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
"We don't say what we have or don't have, which leaves others to
keep guessing. It is good that this will remain so in the future,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Sneh was commenting on the ongoing United Nations review
conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which
opened at the U.N. headquarters in New York on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, which was aimed to prevent the spread of nuclear
weapons and technology, was signed in 1970 and is subject to
reviewing every five years.
</P>
<P>
At the 1995 NPT conference, it was extended indefinitely by a U.
N. landmark resolution, making it permanent.
</P>
<P>
Israel, the only country in the Middle East that has not signed
the NPT, did not dispatch delegations to attend the four-week
conference as observer, fearing that it will be singled out in the
forum as the major threat to a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Issam Mahoul, an Israeli Arab legislator who initiated an
unprecedented session of Israeli parliamentary debate on the
nuclear issue in February, said that Israel has 200 to 300 nuclear
warheads.
</P>
<P>
Since The Sunday Times of London published photos about Israel's
nuclear reactor in the Negev Desert town of Dimona in 1986, which
revealed that Israel has the sixth largest nuclear arsenal in the
world, the nuclear capability of Israel has been a worst kept
secret.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, competing with Israel for dominant military role in the
region, has launched a campaign at the NPT conference to secure a
special condemnation of Israel for its refusal to sign the treaty.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian delegation to the gathering includes two most
prominent nuclear disarmament experts, its ambassadors to Geneva
and Tokyo. The Egyptians are expected to address the conference on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In response to the development, Sneh said on Tuesday that
Egypt's behavior to undermine Israel's position at the conference
is unacceptable, antagonistic and unfriendly.
</P>
<P>
Sneh hoped that the United States, the major patron of Israel in
the world political arena, will side with Israel to defend Israel's
policy on the issue.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Defense Minister Urges Gulf Common Security  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIYADH, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Minister of Defense and
Armed Forces Logistics Ali Shamkhani categorically denied the
rumors about a schemed military revolt against the government of
moderate president Mohammed Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure from Tehran to Saudi Arabia on Monday
evining, Shamkani said, in an interview with London-based Saudi
Arabic Middle East daily printed on Tuesday, that the Iranian
people have been rapidly advancing toward civil community and
democracy as in the perspective of president Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
On the security and defense co-operation between Iran and the
Gulf Co-operation Council(GCC), he said Iran believes in the need
to establish a pattern of inclusive security co-ordination in the
region by the Gulf countries, stressing that the security of the
Gulf and the region should be the common responsibilty of the Gulf
states.
</P>
<P>
He repeatedly stressed Iran's stand against foreign presence in
the Gulf region, calling on the U.S troops to abandon the Persian
Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Such presence can provide mere short-run balance while Iran
hopefully aspire for permanent and firm regional security and
stability, he explained.
</P>
<P>
The western countries, which sell such huge arms arsenal
including the chemical weapons to the regional states, added to the
tension and insecurity there, he pointed out, stressing that Iran
holds the view that co-operation and solidarity are decisive in
maintaining stability and security in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Shamkahni, who later arrived in Riyadh, discussed in the Red Sea
resort of Jeddah on Monday evening with Saudi First Deputy Prime
Minister, Minister of Defense and Aviation Prince Sultan ibn Abd
el-Aziz the means to promote military co-operation between Iran and
Saudi Arabia.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Create New Body to Look Into Transport Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Tuesday that the Presidential Palace will soon create a new body
to look at the whole issue of the country's transport safety.
</P>
<P>
The government's move comes following the April 19 crash of Air
Philippines Flight 541 in Samal Island near Davao City that killed
all l31 passengers and crew aboard.
</P>
<P>
Press Secretary Ricardo Puno told reporters that the new
independent body will have the same functions as those of the
National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).
</P>
<P>
The NTSB, according to Puno, is a standing body created by law,
which automatically springs into action every time there is an
accident, whether it's a fatal or a non-fatal mishap or an aborted
takeoff in the case of airplanes.
</P>
<P>
Since the most recent incident involved air transportation,
Puno said the new body will initially cover the air safety
situation.
</P>
<P>
"Eventually it might also go to sea transportation and
eventually into land. But the details are now being worked out
with Secretary Vicente Rivera of the Department of Transportation
and Communication," Puno said.
</P>
<P>
He also made it clear that it is still the Air Transportation
Office that will handle the investigation of the Samal Island
crash and come out with the results of the inquiry in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
Puno said the creation of the body is a calculated effort which
will eventually result in some kind of an exhaustive appraisal of
the transportation situation in the country, including the various
carriers involved, their practices and their equipment, the air
controllers system, and airport facilities.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Farmers Call for WTO Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Zambian farmers are seeking the
support of the World Trade Organization (WTO) for subsidies to
enable them to compete effectively with farmers in developed
countries, Times of Zambia newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Zambia National Farmers Union (ZNFU) president Ajay
Vashee as saying his organization was seeking protection from the
WTO against the continued unfair practices where the farmers in
the industrialized world are being heavily subsidized on the
global market.
</P>
<P>
Vashee, speaking before leaving for the United States to attend
a WTO meeting, hoped that the world trade body put in place
measures that would help developing countries stand competition.
</P>
<P>
He said that the current trend that the farmers in the
developed world were heavily subsidized was detrimental to
agricultural producers in the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the WTO will put in place practices that will help the
farmers in the developing countries to continue producing since
our countries are denying subsidies under the auspices of
liberalization," Vashee noted.
</P>
<P>
The Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA)
assistant secretary-general Sindiso Ngwenya last month also
stressed the need for developing countries to consider subsidizing
their agriculture sector to enable them to compete effectively
with the industrialized world.

<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, April 25 (Xinhua) -- North China's Shanxi Province
will hold the China Datong Yungang Tourism Festival in the city of
Datong from August 8 to 28.
</P>
<P>
Located in the north of Shanxi Province, Datong is an ancient
town with a rich culture, and was the capital of the Northern Wei
Dynasty (386 to 534 A.D.) for 97 years.
</P>
<P>
Datong is also famous for the Yungang Grotto, one of four
largest grottoes in China, and the nine dragon wall built in 1392.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen kilometers west of Datong, the Yungang Grotto was hewn
out of a cliff side in a honeycomb pattern 1,500 years ago,
forming grottoes that stretch for one kilometer.
</P>
<P>
There are 1,000 grottoes and some 100,000 Buddhist statues, the
largest 17 meters high and the smallest two centimeters.
</P>
<P>
An official of the organizing committee said the tourism
festival will enhance Datong's status as a major cultural center.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the festival an exhibition and a seminar on
the grottoes will be held, along with various competitions such as
mountain climbing, a bicycle race, and dancing and other
performing arts.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi Province will apply this year to have its Yungang
Grottoes included on UNESCO's World Heritage List.

<HEADLINE> China Passes Guidelines for Tapping Underground Water in Arid NW Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 25 (Xinhua) -- China today passed guidelines for
searching for underground water resources in the dry northwestern
region, according to sources with the group for detecting
northwest underground water resources based in this capital of
Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines detailing plans for the next decade are aimed at
providing scientific strategies for making use of underground
water resources in the region, which covers some 3.3 million
square kilometers and includes Shaanxi, Gansu, and Qinghai
provinces, and the Ningxia Hui and Xinjiang Uygur autonomous
regions.
</P>
<P>
China began a project four years ago to tap underground water
to ease the water shortage for 80 million people in the northwest
region, and this has helped verify some one billion cu m of
underground water reserves under the Loess Plateau and the
Taklimakan Desert, equal to a combined holding capacity of ten
large reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
Experts with the program developed a technique for sinking
wells for karstic water located deep under the arid land. The
project now helps pump out 660,000 cu m of high-quality water
daily for the region.

<HEADLINE> North China Experiences Another Floating Sand Weather </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 25 (Xinhua) -- At around 2 pm today another
sandstorm hit north China's Tianjin Municipality.
</P>
<P>
A northwest wind of five to six degrees caused aged pedestrians
to go into shops immediately for shelter, and plants and flowers
on the roadsides waved in the strong wind.
</P>
<P>
Local meteorologists said that the wind will remain strong
through tonight, but is expected to abate tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Liu Angrang, director of the Tianjin Municipal Meteorological
Station, said that there has been floating sand weather in Tianjin
when sandstorms hit Beijing. The two cities are about 100
kilometers apart.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologist in Beijing said that all the seven previous seven
sandstorms that began hitting Beijing in early spring can be
attributed to sandstorms in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
in north China.
</P>
<P>
The region now is still feeling the eighth sandstorm, which
started yesterday afternoon, and has been the longest one so far,
said local meteorologists.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the region's civil affairs department said a
preliminary survey shows that the economic losses caused by this
time sandstorm is estimated to exceed four million yuan (about 480,
000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Liu Jingtao, chief engineer with the local meteorological
bureau, said that the highest wind speed for the region today
reached 27 meters per second, with visibility under 400-600 meters.
</P>
<P>
He added that the continuing sandstorm also caused floating
sand weather in provinces and autonomous regions to the south
including Gansu, Ningxia, Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Hebei.
</P>
<P>
The region's meteorologists predict another sandstorm for April
27 to 29, which will affect the areas of Beijing, Hebei, and as
far south as the Yangtze River basin.

<HEADLINE> China Increases Money Supply to Support Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Maintaining a balance between the
prevention of financial risk and the promotion of economic growth
is now at the top of the agenda for the central bank's monetary
committee.
</P>
<P>
The committee members met in Beijing recently and agreed that
great efforts will be made to boost the development of the country
's capital market and to accelerate the market-oriented reform of
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The central bank will utilize a variety of monetary tools to
support economic growth and to increase the money supply
moderately in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter, China witnessed an 8.1 percent economic
growth rate, and its broad money supply (M2) surged 13 percent
over the 1999 figure, with the narrow money supply (M1) jumping 18.
7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the exchange rates of the Chinese yuan remained
stable because of continuous growth of the country's foreign
exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
The committee said that Chinese banks will continue financing
infrastructure and technological upgrading projects, most of which
are funded with state debt, as well as promoting the development
of western China.
</P>
<P>
The central bank reiterated that the current financial policy
forbidding banks and securities companies from stepping into each
other's businesses was still in line with conditions in China.
</P>
<P>
The panel also suggested that the People's Bank of China (PBOC),
the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), and the China
Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) meet regularly to
coordinate arising issues.
</P>
<P>
Dai Xianglong, central bank governor and committee chairman,

<HEADLINE> Export Credit Has Great Potential in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Export buyers' credit enjoys
great development prospects in China as the country's status as a
world trade giant increasingly grows, according to Chinese and
overseas experts attending a seminar on export buyers' credit held
here today by the Export and Import Bank of China (Eximbank).
</P>
<P>
The experts said that, with the constant improvement of China's
overall economic strength, more and more Chinese enterprises are
competing in the international market with their new and high-tech
products.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the country's export buyers' credit business is
still in the primary stage of development in both scale and
sophistication. As a result, there is still much to do in this
financial sector.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Eximbank, China's only official organization
handling export credit, said that since the bank's founding in
1994 it has provided 13.12 billion U.S. dollars in export credit,
of which export buyers' credit made up only 3.3 percent, involving
13 projects and 470 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Today's seminar will focus on policy banks' support to the
export of domestic enterprises with export buyers' credit patterns
that meet international standards.
</P>
<P>
President of Eximbank Yang Zilin said that export buyers'
credit is a highly professional business with a very short history
in China. However, with increasingly more Chinese enterprises
participating in international competition, this sector will win
recognition from and be adopted by both importers and exporters.

hostage crisis because of reports that the kidnappers were
Filipinos and the victims were possibly brought to southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Mercado told reporters that acting Armed Forces chief of staff
Jose Calimlim briefed the meeting on the on-going search and
rescue operations of the kidnap victims.
</P>
<P>
"We went through the information we have gathered so far. In
our evaluation of the information we have concluded that there's
nothing we can confirm as of the moment as to the identities to
those who perpetrated this particular crime," Mercado said.
</P>
<P>
He also said neither could the authorities pinpoint where the
victims were brought.
</P>
<P>
He said the authorities expected the kidnappers to emerge to
make an announcement of their demands. "Whether it is for
political purposes or financial reasons, they will have to ask for
concession," Mercado added.
</P>
<P>
The victims, mostly foreign tourists, were snatched by some six
gunmen in the beach resort of Sipadan island, Sabah, Malaysia last
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Two reconnaissance planes of the Philippine Air Force and
several Philippine Navy ships combed the nearby Sulu Sea since
Monday to intercept the boat-riding kidnappers but there was no
trace of the victims, Calimlim said.
</P>
<P>
Calimlim also said he did not believe a claim by the Abu Sayyaf
terrorists that they were responsible for the kidnapping in Sabah.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf is under siege by the military in Basilan
province where the Muslim extremists are holding 27 civilian
hostages they abducted on March 20.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, who announced last week that they had beheaded two
male teachers, have demanded the freeing of Arab terrorists held
in jails in the United States, including the mastermind of the
1993 World Trade Center bombing.

<HEADLINE> SIA Secures Acquisition of 25 Pct of Air N.Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore Airlines (SIA)
Tuesday announced that it had reached an agreement with the
Brierley Investment Limited (BIL) to acquire 16.7 percent of Air
New Zealand, bringing to 25 percent its total holding in the New
Zealand's national carrier.
</P>
<P>
An announcement from SIA said the purchase is in the form of "B
" ordinary shares for 285 million New Zealand dollars (240
Singapore dollars or 141 million U.S. dollars) based on a price
of three New Zealand dollars per share.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came after SIA purchased 8.3 percent of the share
capital of Air New Zealand in the form of "B" ordinary shares for
141 million New Zealand dollars (120 Singapore dollars or 70.5
million U.S. dollars) on April 11, 2000.
</P>
<P>
With 25 percent of Air New Zealand, SIA will have a strategic
stake in both Air New Zealand and the Ansett Holdings Limited (
Ansett), Australia's No.2 carrier, as the New Zealand carrier
already owns 50 percent of Ansett and will acquire the other 50
percent soon.
</P>
<P>
A press release from SIA said the acquisition is subjected to a
number of conditions, including regulatory approvals, due
diligence, and Air New Zealand completing its acquisition of the
remaining 50 percent of Ansett.
</P>
<P>
If these conditions are satisfied, the transaction is expected
to be finalized by mid-2000, it said.
</P>
<P>
The press release quoted SIA Deputy Chairman and CEO Cheong
Choong Kong as saying:" As evidenced by our recent 49 percent
stake in Virgin Atlantic, SIA's objective is to become a global
group of airline and airline-related companies. This stake in Air
New Zealand and, indirectly, Ansett is another important step
towards the goal." SIA and Virgin announced that SIA would take a
49 percent stake in Virgin last December.
</P>
<P>
"The investment consolidated the commercial alliance created by
SIA, Air New Zealand and Ansett in 1997," Cheong was quoted as
adding.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said SIA was eyeing a 40 percent stake in the
New Zealand Airlines but it has no way to achieve the target as
New Zealand law bars a foreign airline from owning more than 25
percent of a domestic carrier. Under the law a group of airlines
can only own up to 35 percent stake in its carrier.
</P>
<P>
The reports also said buying into Air New Zealand which is soon
to take control of Ansett seems to shut off any likelihood of SIA
partnering Virgin in Australia despite Virgin hoped SIA would join
it in its planned no-frills Australian airline.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Over 9,000 Angolan rebels have
surrendered themselves to the government and joined the government
troops in the past few days, the Angolan Armed Forces (FAA)
announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Some high ranking rebel officers said that to continue serving
Jonas Savimbi, leader of the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), was the same as having a "lost
life", according to the Angola Press.
</P>
<P>
"The life of those individuals is a lost one. There is no
future on the other side," says colonel Luis Jorge, a former rebel
officer.
</P>
<P>
The FAA considered the surrender of those former rebel fighters
 as contribution to the government strategies to wipe out UNITA
military capability in the long-term civil war.

LUSAKA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern and

Community (SADC) have completed a joint study aimed at coming up
with a common road charge for heavy duty vehicles.
</P>

COMESA assistant secretary-general Sindiso Ngwenya has revealed
that the two regional groupings realized the importance of

</P>
<P>
"With SADC, we did a joint study on road user charges aimed at
coming up with what to charge on buses and trucks so that they pay
one fee based on the damage they do to the road. The charge will
focus on the individual contribution of the wear and tear of the
road," Ngwenya was quoted by Tuesday's Zambia Daily Mail newspaper
as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The common road user charge with SADC is just one in many

PARIS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Three boys aged from 14 to 15 set
fire on a playground outside a McDonald's restaurant last weekend
in retaliation for the refusal by the restaurant staff to offer
them French fries, said police on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The incident drew great attention from the public because it
came shortly after a bombing attack was staged against another
McDonald's in Brittany, western France, in which one woman
employee was killed.
</P>
<P>
The three boys admitted to police in Bayonne, southwestern
France, that they had also set a series of fire on dustbins and
post boxes this year.
</P>
<P>
The worst damage was done when they destroyed an electric
circuit system, causing a loss of some 200,000 francs (about 30,
000 U.S. dollars) in public properties.
</P>
<P>
The boys were arrested when they were setting fire on a dustbin

BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Seven software companies,
including the famous China Computer Software and Technology
Service Company, announced here today that they each plan to set
up centers to provide technical support and service to Linux
system users in China.
</P>
<P>
The plan, initiated by the China Computer Software Association

Industry (MII) and support from the Intel Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chong, deputy director of the department of electronics

Yang Tianxing, chairman of the CCSA, said that the purpose of
the plan is to promote Chinese software development on the Linux
platform, which will enhance e-commerce and network construction
in China's government and enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The Linux operating system for computers was invented by Linus
Torvalds in 1991. Its source code is open to the public and
people can download it from Internet freely.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese version of the Linux operating systems came into
the Chinese market last year and prospered quickly. Experts are
confident of its bright prospects due to its predominance in terms

<HEADLINE> China to Become Largest Projector Market in Asia-Pacific </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- China is likely to become the
largest market of computer projectors in Asia-Pacific region, a
senior official of the world's top projector producer said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Vincent Leung, Asia-Pacific marketing manager of InFocus, told
a press conference today that China has already surpassed
Australia as the second largest market of projectors in the region,
following Japan.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the market for projectors in China will grow
to 15,000 units of low-end products and 34,000 units of high-end
products this year.
</P>
<P>
Leung said that after its merger with the second largest
projector producer in the world by the end of June, InFocus will
continue to invest heavily in China because it is one of the
fastest growing projector market in the world.
</P>
<P>
For every 100 notebook computers sold in China market, 4-5
projectors are sold. Noting that since only 10 percent of personal
computers in China are notebook, Leung said that China will soon
catch up with the international average of 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said that China also has a big market potential of
connecting projectors with desktop computers and networks.
</P>
<P>
InFocus introduced the world's smallest notebook projector to

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-President Meets Former Japanese Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao
said today that statesmen of China and Japan should approach
bilateral relations from a long-term and strategic perspective.
</P>
<P>
Hu made the remarks here in a meeting with former Japanese
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and former Director-General of
the Economic Planning Agency Shusei Tanaka.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president also stressed that consensus and cooperative
agreements reached by Chinese and Japanese leaders should be
earnestly implemented, statesmen of the two countries should
promote exchanges and mutual understanding, eliminate problems and
obstacles, and make new contributions to Sino-Japanese friendship
geared toward the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He said that adherence to the principles enshrined in the Sino-
Japanese Joint Statement, the China-Japan Treaty of Peace and
Friendship and the China-Japan Joint Declaration as well as
correct understanding and treatment of such issues as historical
facts and the Taiwan issue are the political basis for the smooth
development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that high-level exchanges of visits between the two
countries have been frequent in recent years, and the two
countries have reached important consensus and opened up prospects
for bilateral cooperation in a variety of areas.

promote Sino-Japanese relations during and after his tenure.

and turns along the way. He said he hoped that any difficulties
will be overcome and bilateral relations will continue to grow.

Japanese friendship and cooperation.

of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, met here today with
Nyam-Osorin Tuyaa, visiting Mongolian minister of external

<HEADLINE> Internet to Help Introduce Traditional Medicine Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The combination of the Internet
and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) will provide convenience
and high-speed access for people seeking treatment using
traditional medicine.
</P>
<P>
"It has already become an inevitable trend that the
traditional Chinese medicine will enter the world with the help of
Internet," said Qian Guofeng of the Hong Kong TCM Network Company
Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Compared with western medicine, TCM has advantages in treating
chronic non-infectious diseases which are related to psychological
and social factors as well as diseases common among elderly people.
It can improve people's immune system with less side effects and
costs less. But these advantages are still not fully recognized by
western countries.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the major reasons for this are the slow
spread of information on TCM and basic cultural differences. It is
difficult for foreign people to accept theories of TCM which are
completely unlike those held by western medical professionals.
</P>
<P>
Qian suggested that the Internet be used to spread facts about
TCM to people across the world, and to provide information on
state policies, research findings and commercial events about TCM,
along with educational resources, available medical treatment and
e-commerce to professional personnel.
</P>
<P>
If the documents and literature on TCM produced over the past
several thousand years can be put into computers and get online, a
large human information resources center will be formed, said
Professor She Jing with the China State Administration of
Traditional Chinese Medicine.

<HEADLINE> China to Intensify Supervision over Customs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislature has vowed
to stamp out smuggling by increasing the power of customs and to
stop corrupt activities of customs officials by supervising them
more closely.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Keyu, a vice-chairman of the National People's Congress (
NPC) Law Committee, delivered the message in a report on the
revision of the Law on Customs to the 15th meeting of the NPC
Standing Committee, which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Many NPC Standing Committee members want to add a clause in the
draft which says: "Customs and their staff should accept
supervision by supervisory departments when they conduct their
administrative law-enforcement; anti-smuggle police should accept
supervision by people's procuratorates when they conduct
investigations."
</P>
<P>
Another suggested clause reads: "Auditing departments conduct
auditing and supervision on the financial income and expenditure
of customs in accordance with law, and have the right to carry out
special auditing and investigation on matters that are related to
the financial income and expenditure of the State."
</P>
<P>
Zhou said the NPC Law Committee and the Commission of
Legislative Affairs of the NPC Standing Committee had sent
investigation teams to Guangdong, Yunnan and Hainan provinces to
gather suggestions from official departments and foreign trade
companies.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative that the existing customs law be revised to
meet the needs of China's further opening up to the rest of the
world, setting up a modern customs system, cracking down on
smuggling, and ensuring the healthy development of the socialist
market economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
The NPC law committee proposed that an anti-smuggling public
security department be set up in the General Administration of
Customs, which will be composed of special anti-smuggling police.
If necessary, the customs anti-smuggling public security
department could ask public security departments of the State
Council to direct and coordinate other police forces to help deal
with smuggling cases, the committee proposed.

BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislature has urged
that the production, trade, and use of seeds be standardized to
protect the interests of those involved in the country's forestry
and farming sectors.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC),
which opened its 15th meeting here today, heard a report on
revising the draft of the Seed Law by the NPC Law Committee.
</P>
<P>
The Law Committee proposed that the state support the
protection of seed resources as well as the breeding, production,

</P>
<P>
The committee urged stricter controls on the breeding,
experimenting, and spreading of transgenetic plant seeds, and on
importing major seeds from abroad.
</P>
<P>
Farmers should be allowed to sell the extra seeds they have
produced, the committee proposed, and also suggested stepping up
the integration of the research, production, and trade of seeds by
various sectors.
</P>
<P>
Sino-foreign seed producing joint ventures should be allowed to
be established in accordance with laws stipulated for all Sino-
foreign joint ventures, the committee said.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Diplomats Suffering Liberian War to be Compensated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Seven officials of the Nigerian
foreign service are to be paid a total of some 125,000 US dollars
by the government in compensation for loss sustained during the
seven-year civil war in neighboring Liberia, reported the News
Agency of Nigeria Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Agency quoted a senior official of the service as saying
that the compensation is for the loss of their belongings during
the outbreak of violence in 1996 when their homes were invaded by
fighters loyal to Charles Taylor, then leader of the national
patriotic front of Liberia, one of the factions in the country's
civil war.
</P>
<P>
During the invasion, the affected officers lost all their
belongings and were only saved following the intervention of the
Nigeria-led West African Peace Keeping Force or ECOMOG in that
country.
</P>
<P>
Nigerians, whose country provided the bulk of the regional
peacekeeping force, were frequently the targets of violent attacks
during the seven year war which ended with internationally
supervised elections in 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
PRETORIA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and South African President Thabo Mbeki signed here Tuesday
a declaration on the partnership between the two countries.
Following is the full text of the document:
</P>
<P>
Pretoria Declaration on the Partnership Between the People's
Republic of China and the Republic of South Africa
</P>
<P>
We, the Heads of State of the People's Republic of China and
the Republic of South Africa, having gathered in Pretoria on this
25th Day of April in the Year 2000, hereby declare that we:
</P>
<P>
Recall the ties of friendship and the principles that have
brought together the peoples of China and Africa over many years,
as articulated 45 years ago at the Bandung conference and also
four years ago at the Headquarters of the Organization of African
Unity, when the five principles of Sino-African relations were
conceptualized as:
</P>
<P>
.Sincere Friendship
</P>
<P>
.Equality and Sovereignty
</P>
<P>
.Common Development on the Basis of Mutual Benefit
</P>
<P>
.Increased Consultation and Cooperation in International
Affairs
</P>
<P>
.Cooperation in the Establishment of a New International
Political and Economic Oder;
</P>
<P>
Commit ourselves anew to the spirit of partnership and
constructive dialogue between China and South Africa, and to the
position that there is but one China in the world and Taiwan is an
inalienable part of China, as articulated in the Joint Communique
on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations, and express
appreciation for the noble ideals embodied in the philosophy of
the African Renaissance;
</P>
<P>
Take cognizance of the moral imperative for developing
countries to strengthen capacity for cooperation and mutual
support in the international economic milieu;
</P>
<P>
Note with satisfaction the strong growth in political,
economic, scientific, technological and cultural relations between
our countries, and dedicate ourselves to the further development
of these relations on the basis of mutual benefit and in a way
that will support and strengthen each other;
</P>
<P>
Recognize that both China and South Africa share many
objectives with regard to key multilateral issues and on the
urgent need for the reform of the international multilateral
political, economic and financial architecture to reflect new
global realities.
</P>
<P>
Now, therefore we undertake that:
</P>
<P>
Firstly, the governments of China and South Africa will
endeavor to further enhance the existing partnership between them
by calling into being, through this Declaration, a high-level
Bi-National Commission.
</P>
<P>
This Bi-National Commission will meet regularly at mutually
convenient times and levels. This Bi-National Commission will aim
to guide and coordinate all government-to-government relations
between China and South Africa, and to consult on matters of
mutual interest in the bilateral and multilateral spheres. As
such, due cognizance is taken of the existing agreements and
arrangements on Bilateral Consultations and Joint Commissions and
that this Bi-National Commission will, in principle, safeguard and
incorporate those earlier agreements and arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Both Governments hereby also commit themselves to constructive
dialogue, the creation of wealth for their peoples, the
safeguarding of their national sovereignty, safety and integrity
through the proceedings of the Bi-National Commission. Both
Governments also agree that the modalities for the operation of
this Bi-National Commission will be confirmed through the
Diplomatic Channel and that the first meeting of the Commission
will be held at an early date;
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the Governments of China and South Africa will,
within the context of South-South Cooperation, endeavor to
develop, strengthen and diversify their economic relationship to
the mutual benefit of their peoples, by removing obstacles
impeding negatively on their bilateral trade, investment, service
and commercial relations. The two Governments will work hard to
primarily encourage and support closer cooperation between
enterprises of the two countries in the development of natural
resources, especially in the areas of mining and manufacturing;
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the Governments of China and South Africa will
cooperate constructively and effectively in the promotion of a new
Sino-African relationship on the basis of equality and mutual
benefit, by supporting the African continent in its efforts to
seek peace, stability and development and by promoting the
interests of Africa through multilateral fora such as the G-77 and
China, and the structures of the United Nations; and
</P>
<P>
Fourthly, the Government of China and South Africa will support
each other in efforts to create a new international political and
economic order. The two sides maintain that in this future New
Order, the diversity of the world should be respected; the
principles of sovereign equality and non- interference in the
internal affairs of other countries should be upheld; no country
should dominate others; the negative effects of globalization --
especially on developing nations -- should be reduced and
restricted; and harmony, democracy, justice and equality in
international relations should be actively pursued and fully
promoted.
</P>
<P>
This Declaration publicly states our common guiding vision for
the future and the fundamental principles for the forging of even
closer and stronger relations between the People's Republic of
China and the Republic of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
This Declaration is signed at Pretoria, on this 25th Day of
April in the Year 2000, in the Chinese and English languages, both
being equally authentic.

<HEADLINE> Man United Chief Drops Striker Hint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United chief executive
Martin Edwards said the club must balance its books, following the
signing of 18.5 million pounds Dutch striker Ruud Van Nistelrooy,
hinting that one of the club's existing strikers is likely to be
sold, though he refused to name names.
</P>
<P>
Van Nistelrooy, who is expected to undergo a medical before
completing his transfer on Tuesday, joins Dwight Yorke, Ole Gunnar
Solskjaer, Andy Cole and Teddy Sheringham at Old Trafford.
</P>
<P>
And speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, Edwards said five strikers
was too many for one club.
</P>
<P>
"Any decision would be down to the manager. He would have to
decide what striker he can get by without," he said. "But I do
not think you can seriously keep five strikers happy."
</P>
<P>
Edwards said the club had to maintain its profit margin and
warned that such a huge signing was a considerable financial
investment, even for Manchester United.
</P>
<P>
"Manchester United earns roughly 30 million pounds a year
profit. It then has to pay tax which is 10 million pounds and a
dividend of 5 million so we've roughly got 15 million to spend,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"But that's not just on players that's ground improvement and
everything else. So clearly to spend more than you actually earn
on one player doesn't make sense.
</P>
<P>
"And don't forget we've spent heavily this year already. It
therefore makes economic sense to balance the books," he said.

<HEADLINE> British Boxer Lewis Threatens Belt Bust-up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Lennox Lewis is considering giving
up his WBC and IBF heavyweight titles, following a contract row
with promoter Don King.
</P>
<P>
Lewis said he is so fed up with boxing's rulers that he is
considering handing back his remaining belts.
</P>
<P>
The Briton, whose win over Evander Holyfield last November
unified the heavyweight division and made him the undisputed king
of world boxing, had his WBA title taken away after a court battle
with King.
</P>
<P>
And Lewis claims he is so disenchanted at being told whom he
can and cannot fight he is contemplating throwing his titles back
into the ring and taking on whoever the boxing public want him to.
</P>
<P>
Lewis, set to fight Michael Grant in New York in defence of his
WBC and IBF titles on Saturday, said: "I have thought seriously
about giving up my titles - why should I fight who the
organisations tell me to when some decisions are clearly
influenced by fight promoters and managers?
</P>
<P>
"I might as well give back the belts and just get into the ring
with whoever the public want me to face. They are the guys who
matter; they pay the price of a big ticket on a big fight night or
phone the TV company to watch on pay-per-view," he told The Sun
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"Let the public choose. Their voices should be heard. They
want real fights, not fights that have been engineered," he said.

<HEADLINE> Welsh Fans Queue for Date with Rivaldo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Welsh fans were
expected to rush to create a potential sell-out for the match
against Brazil at the National Stadium next month.
</P>
<P>
The Football Association of Wales (FAW) released tickets for
the friendly on Tuesday priced 10 pounds - double the cost of the
friendly match against Finland.
</P>
<P>
But the increase is unlikely to deter many who will want to see
Mark Hughes' side take on world number one-ranked Brazilians on
May 23.
</P>
<P>
Some fans were queuing for tickets in Cardiff before 0500BST,
determined to be part of the unique atmosphere at the National
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
The FAW is hoping the attraction of the 30 million-pounds-rated
Rivaldo, Roberto Carlos and an array of other stars in the Brazil
team will attract a capacity 72,500 crowd.
</P>
<P>
Many other fans are drawn by the chance of seeing the national
side play at the National Stadium.

<HEADLINE> HK to Launch New Benchmark Indexes for IT Stocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Hang Seng Index (HSI)
Services Limited Tuesday announced it will launch two new indexes
on April 26 to meet the increasing demand for a benchmark to gauge
the performance of the information technology (IT) and
telecommunications sector of the local stock market.
</P>
<P>
The two new indexes, the Hang Seng IT Index (HSITI) and the
Hang Seng IT Portfolio Index (HSITP), have been devised to meet
different investors needs in view of market skewedness towards a
small number of stocks in the IT sector, Vincent Kwan, general
manager of the HSI Services Limited, told a media briefing Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Hang Seng IT Series of Indexes are backdated to April 1,
1999, with a base value of 1,000 for each index. The HSITI index
and HSITP index stood at 2,754.18 and 3,448.80, respectively, at
the close of business on April 20, 2000,
</P>
<P>
"Information technology and telecommunications companies are an
increasingly important sector of the local stock market," Kwan
said.
</P>
<P>
The market value of the HSITI's constituent stocks increased by
193 percent during the year ended April 20, 2000, compared with 32
percent for constituents of the benchmark Hang Seng Index, 59
percent for H-shares and 43 percent for China-affiliated companies
during the same period, according to Kwan.
</P>
<P>
"As at April 20, the market value of these stocks accounted for
29 percent of the total market capitalization of the Stock
Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK), and turnover of the HSITI stocks
also increased by 311 percent over the past 12 months," Kwan noted.
</P>
<P>
Kwan said both the new indexes comprise the same constituent
stocks but with different weightings. The constituents of the
HSITI are weighted at their full market capitalization based on
the total number of shares issued, while weightings of HSITP are
adjusted so that no stock will have a weighting exceeding 20
percent in the index, he said.
</P>
<P>
Weightings will be rebalanced at the end of each month, and the
new indexes cover 18 stocks listed on either the main board or
Growth Enterprise Market of the SEHK, Kwan said.
</P>
<P>
Eligible constituents must belong to one of the sub-sectors,
including fixed-line and wireless telecom services, computer
hardware and services, semiconductors, telecom equipment, Internet,
software, and e-commerce, which are selected among the information
technology and telecommunications classification groups of the
FTSE Global Classification System, an internationally recognized
stock classification system, he explained.
</P>
<P>
The indexes will be released daily from April until May 12,
2000, and from then onwards, the indexes will be released every 15
seconds on each trading day, Kwan said.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Stocks Ends Slightly Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong stocks closed
slightly higher Tuesday in thin trade volume, amid the weakness of
technology shares and a disappointing government land auction.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Hang Seng Index edged up 12.87 points, or 0.08
percent, to close at 15,380.01 with the turnover of only 7.001
billion HK dollars (898 million U.S. dollars), as against the
previous trading volume of 7.590 billion HK dollars (973 million U.
S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the overall market was quiet as investors took a
wait-and-see attitude. There was some dumping of high-tech shares
early in the afternoon, followed by some buying of old economy
blue chips.
</P>
<P>
Of the four sub-indices, Finance, Utilities and Properties
gained 0.40 percent, 0.67 percent and 0.28 percent, respectively,
while Commerce and Industry lost 0.19 percent.
</P>
<P>
Hang Seng China Enterprises Index went up 1.36 percent, while
the Hang Seng China-Affiliated Corp Index plunged 4.40 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong stock market closed on Friday and Monday because
of the Easter holiday. The blue chips were down 31.25 points, or 0.
20 percent, to open at 15,335.89 Tuesday. The stock prices
rebounded slightly and closed the morning session at 15.425.74.

<HEADLINE> HK Govt Gains HK$2.03 Bln From Land Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Two government lots of Hong
Kong land were sold for a total of 2.03 billion HK dollars (260
million U.S. dollars) at a public auction held by the Lands
Department Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The first lot, located at Kowloon Peninsular, is a site of
about 16,064 square meters. It was sold for only the opening bid
at 1.9 billion HK dollars (243 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The second one, a 1,925-square-meter site on Hong Kong Island,
was sold for 130 million HK dollars (16.7 million U.S. dollars),
as against the opening bid of 100 million HK dollars (12.8 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Market analysts took the land sale as disappointing. As
government plans to put more land to auction this fiscal year,
buyers adopt a wait-and-see attitude on the market.
</P>
<P>
Analysts also forecast some 10 percent decrease of housing
prices in the following months.

Joseph Tong, global CEO of MeetChina.com, said it was still
possible to do B2B (business to business) and B2C (business to
consumer) in China by integrating the facilities on the web and
those off the web. The conditions included provision of
information, verification of quality, settlement of accounts and
transportation, he noted.
</P>
<P>
China Daily, an English language newspaper based in Beijing,
quoted Frank Zarb, chairman of the US-based NASDAQ, as saying on
April 15 that the bursting of the high-tech bubble and the
plummeting of the NASDAQ stock market was a "market correction,
which is healthy."
</P>
<P>
"A prerequisite for that healthy growth is plenty of market
transparency and the availability of information investors can use
to assess risks and the performance of listed companies," Zarb
said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the latest rebound of the stock market, it was far off
from the previous bull run and remained bearish. However, the blue
chip stocks on the old economy board, such as DuPont, Wal-mart, J.
P. Morgan, Cisco, Dell, DEC, Intel, Eastman Kodak, P&AMP;G and
Citicorp went up.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the relations between the new and old economies,
many economists argued that these two would become interactive and
develop a new pattern and that the enterprises had to take into
consideration of both so as to avoid the fate of getting
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese newspapers and magazines kept referring to Prof.
Wu's advice these days. His most frequently cited warning was: "We
must be sober in assessing our high-tech industries. Should we
think they are approaching the United States and other such
countries and beginning to play a dominant role in our economic
development without stupendous efforts, that would be just an
unrealistic illusion. When the people, who hold this idea, refuse
to work in a down-to-earth manner but hype up the high-tech and
network stocks to lure people into the bourse with sky-rocketing
stock prices, I cannot but suspect their ulterior motives."

Mr. Huang from NASDAQ China remained optimistic, saying: "
NASDAQ rose over 80% last year and now we lost just about 25%." He
estimated that the NASDAQ composite index would not fall under 3,
200 points and might zoom to 4,000 points by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
But the American press asserted that the NASDAQ carnival could
not remain magnificent forever. All the unbridled prosperous
markets would ultimately fall under Newton's law of universal
gravitation, a newspaper claimed.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post said on April 15 that the feast was over,
according to William Frankenstein, manager of a hedge fund based
in Seattle. He said it was impossible for speculation to start a
storm anymore. Susanna Richardson, general manager of FBR.com,
said it would be very difficult to create a company, and even more
so to get it listed.
</P>
<P>
Xu Xiaonian, general manager of the China International Finance
Company's research department, drew attention to the high
commercial value and high risks of high-tech stocks and cautioned
against the bubble in the new economy. The actual purpose of
venture funds was to help enterprises expand and improve their
management, marketing, finance and other sectors so that they
would mature quickly, he added.
</P>
<P>
Zhai Minglei, another economist, stressed that the network
would not create wealth by itself but only save the expenses of
the traditional industries. He admonished the websites in China of
the need to be honest and sincere and follow a business model that
would satisfy the consumers' demands rather than just aim at
raking in the dough.
</P>
<P>
E-commerce was still a long way to go in China because a credit
system had not been completed and the central bank still did not
have a system for certifying the retailers on the web, he said.

<P>
The Economist based in London said on April 4 that the high-
tech stocks were losing their previous glamour but the companies
under the old economy were regaining their impetus.
</P>
<P>
But some people thought differently, such as Harry H. Huang,
chief representative of NASDAQ China, for one. Interviewed by
China Business, a newspaper in Beijing, on April 11 about the 7.6%
fall of the NASDAQ composite index, he insisted that the bubble in
the new economy was out of the question and that the network would
definitely play a decisive role in transforming the traditional
economy.
</P>
<P>
Such was the enthusiasm for starting websites that Jiang Feng,
vice-president of a net, reported some 15,000 Chinese language
sites that had mushroomed by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
While the online company proprietors were congratulating
themselves, NYSE and NASDAQ crashed on April 14, sending the high-
tech stocks into a free fall and smarting for a loss of 5.6% and 9.
67% respectively. US$2,000 billion vanished in the twinkling of an
eye. Yahoo! shrank by 50%, and Amazon 60%. Bill Gates personally
lost 11.1 billion US dollars, Amazon's chairman lost 2.4 billion,
Michael Dell of Dell Computer Corp. 2.3 billion, and Jerry Yang of
Yahoo! 1.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese companies did not escape unscathed. China.com, the
first to go public on NASDAQ, had its record share price of US$150
down to US$30. Sina opened at US$17, touched US$29 briefly and now
hovered around US$20. Some other Chinese Internet portals waiting
for listing on the NASDAQ stock market may have second thoughts at
the news.

<P>
Now, what the other participants in the debate had to say?
</P>
<P>
The Information Times based in Beijing quoted local economists
as suspecting that those craving to set up websites were actually
hankering after hot money through venture investment. The paper
also brought bad news to the overanxious founders of e-commerce
enterprises on the web that reliable sources in the U.S. predicted
three-fourths of those there would meet their demise.
</P>
<P>
Morgan Stanley had sounded an alert that the bubble in the
network would burst sooner or later, the economists said. The
network economy would become the new pattern of the future economy
in common understanding, they agreed. But this did not mean that
the bourse adventurers could stumble over a gold strike and become
millionaires overnight, the scholars stated.
</P>
<P>
Other economists quoted Barron's, a well-known financial weekly,
as saying in late March that 51 network companies listed on NYSE
were on the brink of collapse for running out of funds, including
Amazon, whose share price was cut by almost a half from US$113 to
US$65.
</P>
<P>
It was alarming that the total value of the 371 network
companies going public in the U.S. was estimated at 1,300 billion
US dollars, accounting for 8% of the total on the Wall Street and
impressing everyone as over-inflated, according to Barron's.
</P>
<P>
Rumors about frauds on the web were rife, some economists said.
They referred to an article by Elizabeth Weise, a columnist with
USA Today, that "The Chicken Hoax" spread by a BBS that the
Kentucky fried chicken was not real meat but a kind of headless
chicken created by a genetic engineering project. The hoax drew 10,
000 visits per day to the web page of the University of New
Hampshire's website.
</P>
<P>
Even many intellectuals and professionals were taken in by an E-
mail message that "You'll get US$245 when you pass around this
message to your friends, they will get US$243 when they pass it on,
and so forth."

"It is imperative to create the essential organizational
structures and related social and cultural environments to give
scope to China's human capital," he said. "These mean clearly
defining property rights, improving the talent market (covering
technicians and managerial staff), encouraging a new enterprise
culture, and making private investment the main body of venture
capital."
</P>
<P>
The two network whizzes, Jiang Qiping and Fang Xingdong, blamed
the economist for separating the new economy and the network,
jumping to a conclusion hastily, and ignoring the worldwide
recognition of the network economy, to mention just a few. They
quoted the Anderson consulting agency in the U.S. as showing that
the network industry in Latin America netted US$4.4 billion in
1999. One-third of the companies in Brazil, Argentine, Mexico,
Colombia and Venezuela would earn 20% of their revenues from the
web in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
"Why must you keep China from the trends toward networking?"
they demanded. "You are too rash in meting out a death penalty to
'a majority of the companies' while Texas University's research
report says the network economy in the U.S. grew 68% to reach an
annual product value of US$507 billion in 1999."
</P>
<P>
"Our conviction is that the new economy is an inevitable
revolution, in which the value of information will supersede the
value of industry eventually," Mr. Jiang and Mr. Fang declared.

<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua Correspondent Zhou Lifang) -- A keen
debate on high-tech stocks versus traditional industry shares
between economists and network wizards has been going on in China
for quite some time.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Wu Jinglian, a noted economist, has warned against the
bubble in the high-tech shares, which have been transacted on the
net. "Do we need systemization or the bubble in the new economy?"
he asked.
</P>
<P>
Two young scholars on the digital tribune have retorted: "Don't
pour cold water on the network, Mr. Wu! It's a revolution, mind
you!"
</P>
<P>
News media across the country are focusing their attention on
the debate, as it is vitally important to the trends of China's
economic development at a time when China is crossing into the new
century, which is expected to be even more challenging than the
outgoing millennium.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Wu was quoted by the South Weekend based in Guangzhou on
March 17, 2000, as saying that hyping up the high-tech shares
would lead to bubble to the detriment of the high-tech industries
and the mass media should stop adding fuel to the flames.
</P>
<P>
"I do not agree to the assertion that the bubble of the stock
market benefits the high-tech industries and that the bubble will
never blow up in the age of the 'new economy'," he added. "What I
mean by bubble is that the price of the stock shares is divorced
from their basic value."
</P>
<P>
Invoking the tulip mania of 1634 in The Netherlands, the
Depression of 1929 in the United States, and the crash of the real
estate and stock markets in Hong Kong in 1997 during the financial
crisis, the professor advised guarding against the bubble on the
high-tech board in the bourse.
</P>
<P>
He also reminded people in China that Bill Gates had admitted
to the bubble in the network stocks in America and that Alan
Greenspan of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board had time and again
appealed to people for reason in investment.

<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- China will take measures to
prevent the spreading of dust and sand in some areas and help them
reduce air pollutants.
</P>
<P>
Delegates to the 15th meeting of the Ninth National People's

<HEADLINE> Iraq Protests to U.N. Over U.S., British Aggressions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has lodged protests to the U.
N. over the continued U.S. and British aggressions against the
country, saying that a total of 295 Iraqi civilians have been
killed in their bombings from December 1998 till last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In two letters to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and
president of the U.N. Security Council, Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammad Said al-Sahaf said that the regular bombardments on Iraq
by U.S. and British warplanes have also injured 860 others over the
period, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On April 6, 14 civilians were killed and 19 others injured in
the bombings, one of the heaviest casualties Iraq has suffered
since December 1998, when the U.S. and Britain launched the four-
night Operation Desert Fox air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Sahaf stressed that the U.S. and Britain used internationally-
banned weapons containing depleted uranium during their attacks
against Iraq, causing great harm to the health of the Iraqi people
as well as the environment.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq will preserve its full right to adopt necessary measures
for defending the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the
Republic of Iraq, in addition to demanding compensation for the
human and moral damage Iraq has sustained due to such aggressive
acts," said the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been constantly sending letters to the U.N. and the
Arab League, protesting the U.S. and British bombings and airspace
violations by the two countries over the two so-called no-fly zones
and demanded their intervention to halt such aggressions.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led Western
coalition after the 1991 Gulf War, with the claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the
south from what they called possible persecution from the Iraqi
government troops.

<HEADLINE> Pilot Demobilization Project to Start in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia is to start a pilot
demobilization project in May in three provinces, according to a
press communique from the Council for Demobilization of Armed
Forces available Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,500 soldiers will be demobilized under the program.
</P>
<P>
The demobilization program is going to start after the end of
the registration process for the armed forces, said Svay Sitha,
the secretary general of the Council for Demobilization of Armed
Forces. And a total of 15,551 ghost soldiers and 159,597 ghost
children were removed from the military payroll during the
registration and verification process.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project will see 250 soldiers being
demobilized in Kampot province and this will be followed by
another 460 in Kompong Thom a little later. Once the efficacy of
the pilot program in Kampot and Kompong Thom is determined, a
further 790 will be laid-off in Battambang and Banteay Meanchey.
</P>
<P>
The armed forces personnel to be demobilized are from the
special target group, comprising chronically ill soldiers,
disabled, elderly and some regular forces. Most of those who are
to be demobilized are already not staying in the barracks and have
returned to their respective community.
</P>
<P>
Each demobilized soldier will be paid Cambodian riel equivalent
to 240 U.S. dollars, and get some community related projects to
help them resettle back into civilian life, as well as the skills
training of their choice.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that a total of 31,500 soldiers will be
demobilized from this year to 2002.

<HEADLINE> Vajpayee Rules Out Resumption of Talks With Pak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Pakistan has repeatedly violated the Simla Agreement and the
Lahore Declaration and we do not know what its intentions are,"
Vajpayee said in the Lok Sabha, the Indian lower house, here. "We
want friendly relations with Pakistan but it cannot be a one-way
traffic."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister asserted that Pakistan must create the "
appropriate and conducive atmosphere" for resumption of the
dialogue process by stopping "backing terrorist activities across
the border and ceasing violations of the Line of Control and
hostile campaign" against India.
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to talk to Pakistan but the peace process initiated
by India at Lahore was reciprocated by the Kargil incursions. We
do not want to undertake such travels anymore," said Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that judging from U.S. President Bill Clinton's
visit to India last month, "the attitude of the U.S. has changed
regarding Jammu and Kashmir."
</P>
<P>
"Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India and it will
remain so," he stressed.

<P>
SINGAPORE, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Minister for Home
Affairs Wong Kan Seng said Tuesday that the country's Speaker's
Corner is expected to be launched by the end of August this year.
</P>
<P>
Wong told the Parliament that the Speaker's Corner will be
operated with a minimum of rules, but speakers will be barred from
making speeches that will cause ill will or hostility among
different races.
</P>
<P>
"The speech should not be religious in nature, and should not
have the potential to cause feelings of enmity, hatred, ill will
or hostility between different racial or religious groups," the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
"The police will adopt a minimalist, hands-off approach towards
the Speaker's Corner. The police will not try to control
activities there as long as there are no law and order problems,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
A speaker will not be allowed to use a microphone, but can
speak on just about anything he want, Wong said.
</P>
<P>
The Speaker's Corner will be located at Hong Lim Park, a venue
chosen because of its history and location, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Park, close to the Business District and Chinatown which
are areas of high concentration of people and activities, is also
historically the site for political rallies and speeches.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Mark 17th World Candlelight Memorial to AIDS Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Uganda will join the rest of
world to mark the 17th International Candlelight Memorial on May
21, a day dedicated to people who have died of AIDS and those
living with HIV.
</P>
<P>
"The campaign against AIDS will bring together the people to
fight AIDS and value life," Margaret Egonda, an official with
Uganda AIDS Commission (UAC), told Xinhua in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
The national memorial to be held at Mandela Sports Stadium
Namboole in Kampala will include a symbolic bon-fire. Other
activities will include a procession through the city prayers,
talk-shows and newspaper supplements featuring stakeholders and
their tole in fighting AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"This campaign reminds us the importance of men and their
potential in contributing to the fight against the disease, and
the power they have in causing behaviour change," UAC Director
General Kihumuro Apuuli was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nearly two million Ugandans have been confirmed dead as a
result of HIV/ AIDS since the first case of AIDS was reported in
Uganda in 1982. The national AIDS prevalence rate was as high as
over 30 percent in late 1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Up to date the rate has dropped to 10 percent due to the
government's increasing efforts against the disease and great
enhancement of people's awareness in this regard. Uganda is the
only African country where AIDS prevalence rate is dropping, and
it aims to reduce the rate from the current 10 percent to 7.5
percent by the year 2005.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Oil States Get Enlarged Revenue Share </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Federal government has
begun implementing a constitutional but delayed revenue
allocation formula which entitles nine of its 36 states to an
enhanced share of national oil revenue,
</P>
<P>
the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The NAN quoted Nigeria's Minister of State for Finance, Jubrin
Martins- Kuye as saying Monday that all the states are in the
country's south east, the location of its vibrant oil sector
which accounts for some 99 percent of national income.
</P>
<P>
The payment is expected to end the controversy over the
disbursement of the fund and pacify its oil producing areas,
particularly the Niger Delta which accounts for most of the some
3 million barrels of oil produced daily and which has recently
become the bedrock of violent agitations.
</P>
<P>
The country's 1999 constitution, which came into effect with
the inauguration of civilian government in may last year, entitles
the country' s nine oil producing states to 13 percent of the
revenue from oil from this January.
</P>
<P>
Jubrin said in a statement that 11.95 billion naira (119
million U.S. dollar), consisting of 7.53 billion naira (75 million
dollars) in arrears for the first two months and 4.41 billion (44
million dollars) for the month of march has been paid to the
states in fulfillment of this constitutional requirement.
</P>
<P>
The beneficiaries include the States of Abia, Akwa Ibom,
Bayelsa, Cross River, Delta, Edo, Imo, Ondo and Rivers.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian House Speaker Lauds Regional Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The West African Parliament,
currently being canvassed by the sub-regional leaders, would
assist the region in solving some of the problems plaguing it,
said Speaker of Nigeria's House of Representatives, Alhaji Ghali
Umar Na'Abba Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Post Express, a leading Nigerian news paper Tuesday quoted
him as saying in Abuja, capital of the Africa's most populous
country that the move by the sub-region to integrate economically
would be more beneficial to countries with serious economic
problems.
</P>
<P>
He said, "the question of economic and political integration
in the sub- region had been like the age long problem of the egg
and the chicken, which one comes first," noting that "the
political structure, in this regard, the West African Parliament
can contribute positively to more economic integration."
</P>
<P>
Na'Abba assured that with the introduction of the West African
 Parliament, most of the countries in the sub-region would be
brought closer for the exploration of each other's potential.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed fears being expressed by some member countries,
saying " there's no magic about these things. I want you to take
into account the size of Luxembourg in relation to Germany or
France. These countries like Luxembourg and Belgium are small
countries among larger ones. These together with the larger ones
believed they should belong to a union to achieve their aim."
</P>
<P>
Na'Abba criticized attacks by the newly elected President of
Senegal, Dr. Abdoulaye Wade on Nigeria, concerning the
integration of West African countries, stressing that "Nigeria
can contribute a lot to the establishment of this West African
union, in that the size of Nigeria would be an advantage to
smaller countries."
</P>
<P>
He said that the resources of Nigeria would also be at the
disposal of the smaller countries within the sub-region, adding
that " we have a lot of resources which between us we don't even
know about."
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the West African parliament which was
canvassed by the sub-regional leaders at their summit last year
in Togo, would be beneficial to the countries within the
sub-region, irrespective of size.
</P>
<P>
The President of Senegal had criticized Nigeria, saying other
West African countries should resist Nigeria's membership of the
West African Union following the intimidating size and population
of the country.

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows More Swedes Against Joining NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The number of Swedish voters
opposing NATO membership has gone up markedly, in an apparent
backlash of the bloc's airstrikes on Yugoslavia last year,
Sweden's largest daily Dagens Nyheter reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a survey conducted between April 16 and 19 by TEMO, a
Swedish public opinion research institute, 45 percent of the
people polled said they were against the country's entry into NATO,
up by 9 percentage points compared with the result of a similar
survey in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Arne Modig, head of the institute, attributed the rise to
widespread antipathy to NATO's 78-day bombing in Yugoslavia last
year, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Among the 1,089 polled, only 28 percent favored the entry, with
10 percent neither for nor against and the remaining 17 percent
undecided.
</P>
<P>
Sweden stood non-aligned and neutral during World War II and
the Cold War period, but established "partnership for peace" with
NATO after the Cold War and increased military cooperation with
the alliance.

The price of Volvo's shares rose by 5.6 percent to 215.50
kronor when trading began following the announcement of the merger.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Turkish Ruling Coalition Proposes Presidential Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of Turkish ruling
coalition made a unanimous decision to recommend Ahmet Necdet
Sezer, chairman of the Constitutional Court, as their common
presidential candidate, the Anatolia News Agency reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said that Sezer has accepted the
offer made by the coalition partner parties following three rounds
of talks on Monday, which ran from 2.00 p.m. until 11.00 p.m. local
time.
</P>
<P>
Sezer was born in Afyon province in western Anatolia on
September 13, 1941. He was appointed as a member of the
Constitutional Court by former Turkish President Kenan Evren.
</P>
<P>
Sezer was responsible for a majority of the decisions made by
the Constitutional Court, including closure of the former Islamic
Welfare Party.
</P>
<P>
After officially announcing Sezer as a candidate of the ruling
coalition, Ecevit called for support from the main opposition
Virtue Party and True Path Party.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to receive the support of the two opposition parties in
this important matter of the state," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit dismissed claims that Sezer was a name from outside the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
"As the leaders of coalition partners parties, we have launched
an initiative sincerely. We were in an effort to find a solution on
behalf of Parliament as well as our own parties. Nobody has the
right to feel suspicion about our good will in this respect," he
said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the majority of deputies, regardless of
which party they belong to, are strongly against the nomination of
a candidate from outside Parliament.
</P>
<P>
If the oppositions fail to give support to Sezer, Ecevit said
that "We can think on it again. Now, all we think is that five
parties should act together. I have talked to the leaders of five
parties in my every step and have exchanged views with them."
</P>
<P>
According to the election procedure, the deadline for
presidential nominations expires at midnight on Tuesday as the
presidential election should be completed by May 15.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Court Issues Arrest Order for Reformer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Special Clergy Court (SCC)
on Tuesday issued an arrest warrant for reformist cleric Hassan
Yusefi Eshkevari for his participation in a conference in Berlin,
Germany.
</P>
<P>
Eshkevari's charges were "action against national security,
propaganda against the system, insult to and rejection of the
absolute sanctities of Islam, and behavior not befitting the
clergy," Ebrahim Nekoonam, the SCC prosecutor general, told the
Islamic Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said Eshkevari did not return to Iran after his participation
in the Berlin conference and that he will be detained as soon as he
returns home.
</P>
<P>
Eshkevari is a supporter of President Mohammed Khatami's reform
policies. He was one of a group of reformers that were invited to
attend the Berlin conference, titled "Iran After February
Elections."
</P>
<P>
The arrest order came amid a new wave of crackdown on the
country's reformist campaign by the powerful conservatives, which
has led to the closure of a dozen of reformist journals and jailing
of journalists.
</P>
<P>
Another prominent reformer, Akbar Ganji, was last Saturday for
attending the Berlin conference.
</P>
<P>
Ganji, a member the editorial board of reformist daily Fatah
(conquer), was sent to prison following several hours of
interrogation and after being informed of 10 complaints lodged
against him.
</P>
<P>
Hard-liners have arranged various rallies and demonstrations
throughout the country in recent days denouncing the Berlin
conference, organized by the Heinrich Boell Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The reformists were accused of advocating the U.S.-style reforms
in Iran at the conference, which was disrupted by members of
outlawed Mujaheddin Khalq Organization (MKO) who accused the
Iranian government of "crimes and human rights violations" in Iran
since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Iranian conservatives, who dominate most of the sensitive organs
but suffered a severe setback in February's parliamentary election,
said that the Berlin conference was religiously prohibited and the
judiciary has assigned the revolutionary court to probe the case
against Iranian participants.
</P>
<P>
Iranian reformists defended the Berlin conference and accused
the conservatives of trying to use the conference as a pretext to
stop the new reformist-dominated parliament from meeting and
undermining Khatami's reform programs.

BANGKOK, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is likely to be the

cigarettes and smoking on television, according to the official
Thai News Agency Tuesday.
</P>

Prakit Vetisathokkij, Secretary-General of the Bangkok-based

the Thai government is pushing for an amended bill through the
parliament to prohibit the practice of broadcasting smoking
advertisements and publicities on TV.
</P>
<P>
If the amended bill is promulgated, Thailand would be the first
country in Asia to ban TV publicities and advertisements of
tobacco products, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to speedily push for the enactment of
the amended bill, saying some developed countries in Europe and
North America have already had similar laws in place.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Aid Agency Calls for Concerted Efforts to Avoid Famine in Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland's Development Agency
has urged the international community, donors and the local
authorities to co-ordinate their efforts to avoid a repeat of the
famine in 1984/1985 in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
There are pockets of food shortage in the north of drought-
striken Ethiopia and the local population are leaving their
settlements in search of food, Jurg Zumstein, program coordinator
for the Horn of Africa with the Development Agency, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On return from a fact-finding mission to Ethiopia, Zumstein
said that the situation could reach a crisis point if the rain
does not set in the next few weeks. Although the situation now is
not yet as widespread as in 1985, he said, it is critical because
the strategic reserves of grain have been used up and the stocks
need to be replenished to avoid a disaster.
</P>
<P>
"Ethiopia is one of the least developed countries in terms of
land transport," Zumstein pointed out, "Even if there is a surplus
of food, it can often not be brought to the markets."
</P>
<P>
Switzerland has pledged 4.5 million Swiss francs (about 2.7
million U.S. dollars) for humanitarian aid for the needy in
Ethiopia for the current year. More than half of the money will go
towards the United Nations World Food Program. The Disaster Relief
Unit also has experts in the region to help increase the capacity
of the port of Djibouti and improve the road network in Ethiopia.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Sydney's Olympic organizers (
SOCOG) said on Tuesday they would continue with their plans to
send the Olympic torch into space.
</P>
<P>
Strong crosswinds at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida had
prevented the launch of the flight carrying the Olympic torch into
space.
</P>
<P>
A replica of the torch and an Olympic flag were stowed inside
the space shuttle Atlantis, which was set to embark on a mission
to repair the international space station.
</P>
<P>
SOCOG officials were hoping the space mission, during which the
torch would orbit the earth 15 times a day for a week, would help
promote the official Olympic torch relay which starts next month.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a setback and it's not going to delay the start of
the relay," a SOCOG spokesman said. "SOCOG remains confident that
the torch will be in space in time to promote the start of the
Sydney 2000 torch relay."

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Some 500 local people together
with 145 volunteers from the northern Japanese province of
Hokkaido on Monday planted 2,500 saplings in the Sino-Friendship
Forest at a scenic spot in Fuxin City of northeast China's
Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
The idea for the forest was initiated by Hokkaido Governor Hori
Tatsuya during Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to Japan in
November 1998.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the two countries reached an agreement on jointly
building the forest over a three-year period, starting from 2000.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Hokkaido volunteers are to travel to the
city to join their Chinese counterparts in planting 2,500 saplings
every year in the forest.
</P>
<P>
By 2002, they will have jointly planted 7,500 trees in the area,
meant to symbolize ever-lasting friendship between the Chinese and
Japanese people.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 Fuxin students, workers and government officials
planted trees with their Japanese guests.

BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua)-- Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman
Sun Yuxi said here today at a regular press conference that the
National People's Congress (NPC) of China will quicken the process
of ratifying the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Sun noted that the treaty has been submitted to the Standing
Committee of the NPC and needs to be examined and go through the
legal process.
</P>
<P>
Sun also said that the U.S. side should take concrete measures
to approve Permanent Normal Trade Relations for China in time and
without any conditions, otherwise it will greatly harm the
interests of American companies in China.
</P>
<P>
"It's no U.S. charity to China," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said that China is seriously committed to
carrying out the agricultural cooperation agreement between China
and the U.S., and that the careful implementation of the agreement
is already under way.
</P>
<P>
However, he emphasized that a comprehensive implementation of
the agreement requests efforts from both sides.
</P>
<P>
In response to a relevant question, Sun urged the newly-elected
Japanese prime minister to take lessons from Japan's history of
invasion.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that China has always hoped that Japan take the path
of peace and development, and treat its past history of invasion
with proper recognition and a right attitude, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
"Any responsible Japanese statesman should take lessons from
the history by actual deeds and sincere attitudes, so as to win
the trust of the peoples that had been victimized by its past
invasion, as well as of other Asian nations," he noted.

The Chinese government demands that the U.S. government conduct

</P>
<P>
The accountability review results provided by the United States
are not tenable and the Chinese government and people found them
unacceptable, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. should continue the investigations and provide
satisfactory explanations to the Chinese government and people, so
as to completely eliminate the negative impact on the issue of
Sino-U.S. relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
China's position on nuclear non-proliferation is consistent and

<HEADLINE> Forum on Nuclear Power Development Held in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of
Engineering (CAE) held a forum on the development strategy of
nuclear power in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Coal accounts for the majority of energy consumption in China,
which poses a big threat to the country's environment and
sustainable growth, said Pan Jiazheng, vice-president of the CAE.
</P>
<P>
Experts pointed out at the forum that to improve the energy
structure, develop waterpower, nuclear power and new kinds of
energy, and reduce environment pollution are the major issues
facing energy research and development.
</P>
<P>
A group of academicians of the CAE and experts in nuclear power
have been invited to give speeches at the forum to help Chinese
scientific and technological workers learn more about the newest
developments in nuclear energy.
</P>
<P>
In January, the CAE held a forum on biological chips, which
received an enthusiastic response from participants. The CAE plans
to hold more such forums to promote academic exchanges, spread the
latest information in engineering development and improve the
quality of young engineers.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 experts and scholars attended today's forum.

<HEADLINE> Water Situation Still Critical in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus had torrential downpours
during the last few days but the water situation on the
Mediterranean island is still critical.
</P>
<P>
According to Tuesday's Cyprus Mail newspaper, until Monday,
April 2000 was already being counted as one of the wettest April
since 1901 and the Meteorological Service of Cyprus was predicting
more rain for Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meteorological Service Director Cleanthis Philaniotis said this
month could yet prove wetter than the wettest April since the turn
of the last century, which was 1971, when 98 mm of rain fell
accross the island.
</P>
<P>
The average precipitation for the month is 30 mm.
</P>
<P>
After heavy rains every day since last Wednesday, the total
precipitation until Monday for this April reached 58.5 mm, some 196
percent of average.
</P>
<P>
According to Cyprus' Water Development Department, a total of 4.
2 million cubic metres of water rushed into dams between Thursday
and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
This injection of water brought the total stored behind dam
walls to 46.6 million cubic metres, or 17.1 percent of the dam's
capacity. At the same time last year, reservoirs were about 26
percent full.
</P>
<P>
Water officials warned that the water situation in Cyprus
remains tragic and is unlikely to change, even if the rains
continue.
</P>
<P>
"We might exceed the 1971 record this year," Philaniotis said,
adding that April 2000 was already one of the 10 wettest Aprils in
the last 100 years.

<HEADLINE> Trial of Prominent Iranian Reformist Assassination Suspects Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Iranian revolutionary court on
Tuesday opened trial on 10 suspects accused of involvement in the
failed assassination attempt against Saeed Hajjarian, a close
reformist ally of President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The trial was presided over by the newly-appointed conservative
judge Hussein Razqandi. Ahmad Hakimipour, who rushed Hajjarian to a
nearby hospital to save his life, also appeared at the court as an
eyewitness, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian, deputy chairman of Tehran Municipal Council, was shot
and severely wounded in front of the council building on March 12.
He has regained consciousness after a long coma, but is still
hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
Iranian authorities have claimed on several occassions that the
10 suspects have no affiliation to any group or guild or
foreigners, but they had carried out the assassination attempt on
their own and out of personal feelings and motivations.
</P>
<P>
Hakimipour was also temporally detained on April 15 on charge of
having a hand in the assassination, but was released on bail on
April 20.
</P>
<P>
Hakimipour, a reformist member of Tehran Municipal Council,
became a suspect in the assassination case because a letter handed
over to Hajjarian, which prepared the ground for the assassination
attempt, was signed by Hakimipour.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives claimed that the assassination attempt was an
internal dispute of the reformist camp after Hakimipour's arrest.
However, public opinion believed that the attempt was a revenge
against Hajjarian by the conservatives, who still dominate the
country's most sensitive organs.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian, managing director of the reformist daily Sobh-e
Emrouz (This Morning) and a former deputy intelligence minister,
played an important role in the reformist landslide victory in the
February parliamentary election, which humiliated the powerful
conservatives.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- U.N. Middle East special envoy Terje Larsen of Norway is due
to meet with senior Israeli officials in Jerusalem on Tuesday to
discuss Israel's plans to pull the Israeli troops out of south
Lebanon by July.
</P>
<P>
Government sources confirmed that Larsen will meet with National
Security Adviser Danny Yatom and probably Foreign Minister David
Levy. No meeting with Prime Minister Ehud Barak is planned,
although Larsen did hold impromptu talks with him on a previous
visit to Israel a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the Prime Minister's Office said Larsen's latest
visit to the region is apparently part of the U.N.'s preparations
for the proposed Israel Defense Forces (IDF) pullout. This was
confirmed by U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) official
Daljeet Bagga.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel's General Security Service (Shin Bet) has recommended
to Prime Minister Ehud Barak that all prisoners identified with the
Fatah organization and with other groups that are part of the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) be released as part of the
negotiations with the PNA.
</P>
<P>
The recommendation includes prisoners convicted of murdering or
wounding Israelis. Apart from isolated cases, Israel has so far
refrained from releasing Palestinian prisoners "with Israeli blood
on their hands" within the framework of the Oslo process.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Palestinian police and Israeli border police scuffled Monday
afternoon near the Kfar Darom settlement in the Gaza Strip, only
stopped when Israel Defense Forces and PNA liaison officials came
to end the brawl.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians have complained for some time that the Jewish
settlement's sewage drains ran near Palestinian houses, which
residents said stank and attracted harmful insects.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of local Arab residents, apparently supported by PNA
security officials, stated work to block the settlement's sewage
pipe. Israeli border police demanded that the unauthorized pipe-
obstruction work stop - and tussling then broke out, involving
curses, shoving and blows.
</P>
<P>
IDF sources estimate that Palestinians and Israelis have been
trying to create facts on the ground prior to the permanent status
talks.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Bank of Israel Governor David Klein surprised economists on
Monday by reducing the key lending rate by 0.3 percentage points to
9.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The reduction, the sixth in a row, was made possible by the very
low inflationary environment and the sustained strength of the
local currency, sources in the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
The move was seen as a surprise because of the combination of
increased interest rates in the U.S. and the volatility of the
world's financial markets.

<HEADLINE> Saudi, Iranian Defense Ministers Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIYADH, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Second Deputy Prime Minister,
Minister of Defense and Aviation, Inspector General Sultan ibn Abd
el-Aziz met with Iranian Minister of Defense and Armed Forces
Logistics Ali Shamkhani in the Red Sea resort of Jeddah on Monday
evening.
</P>
<P>
In the beginning of the meeting, Prince Sultan stressed that the
visit by Shamkhani is a reflection of the bilateral friendship and
will be conducive to co-operation between Iran and the Gulf Co-
operation Council (GCC), reported the Saudi News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Shamkhani said de-escalation and peaceful co-existence are
Iran's main approaches not only toward Saudi Arabia but toward all
brotherly countries of the GCC.
</P>
<P>
In a joint news conference after their meeting, Prince Sultan
told reporters that the high level visit exchanges between both
countries are the clearest evidence on the two-side pursuance of
proximity and better ties.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that they did not touch upon the Iraqi issue
because they were interested only in furthering the bilateral ties
and the Iranian-GCC relations.
</P>
<P>
On the Iran-U.A.E territorial dispute, Shamkhani said the issue
can be resolved through the continued talks between Tehran and Abu
Dhabi and the exchanged visits between the Iranian and U.A.E
officials.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been controlling the Gulf-based Islands of Minor and
Major Thomb and Abu Musa which are claimed by U.A.E as national
territories.

<HEADLINE> Couple Escaping Gunmen Abduction in Malaysia Suffer Shock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American-born James Murphy, 50, and his wife Mary, 49, who have
been living in Australia for two years, were staying at a
Malaysian diving resort when a group of heavily armed masked
gunmen attacked.
</P>
<P>
About 20 people, including foreign tourists, were captured from
Sipadan Island off eastern Malaysia and taken away on fishing
boats, apparently to the Philippines waters.
</P>
<P>
But the Murphys managed a bold escape after Mrs. Murphy
complained she could not swim and her husband refused to leave
without her.
</P>
<P>
Their son James, 26, said they had managed to run into the
jungle, and hid for 10 to 12 hours before the authorities arrived.
</P>
<P>
Once found, they returned to Malaysia's capital Kuala Lumpur to
recover from the ordeal.
</P>
<P>
The couple, originally from Rochester, New York, have kept in
regular contact with their three children, and told James they
expected to return to Australia later this week or early next week.
</P>
<P>
"They were scared, but now they're doing much better," James
said.
</P>
<P>
"Mum says she has lots of bites on her legs, after waiting in
the jungle for so long," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Murphy, who celebrated his 50th birthday in March, is a
technologies manager for Eastman Kodak in Sydney, and is involved
in preparations for the Sydney Olympic Games.  His wife does
volunteer work.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Wants WTO to Ensure Benefits to Developing  Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia wants the World
Trade Organization (WTO)'s existing rules and agreements to be
reviewed and amended, where appropriate, to ensure developing
countries benefit from trade liberalization.
</P>
<P>
"WTO must strive to bring more equitable benefits to developing
countries," Primary Industries Ministry Secretary General Harun
Siraj said Tuesday at the conference here on "International
Economic and Trade Liberalization: Challenges to Muslim Countries".
</P>
<P>
Developing countries must be given adequate time to understand
the issues and its implications before any new negotiation could
be considered, he said when presenting "Malaysia's Response To The
New Trade Agenda" at the conference.
</P>
<P>
He said "The consensus approach in the WTO need to be upheld
while the greater transparency in the WTO decision-making process
is needed towards engaging members, especially developing
countries."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the WTO director general has a crucial role in
ensuring that the interest and views of all members, particularly
developing countries, are taken into account when formulating the
WTO work program.
</P>
<P>
The WTO's work program must be realistic and manageable and
should not be overloaded, he said, adding contentious issues such
as trade facilitation, investment, competition policy, labour and
environment,on which no consensus was reached should not be
included.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia was prepared to join the emerging consensus to
include negotiations on market access for non-agriculture products.

<HEADLINE> ADB Meeting to Boost tourism in Northern Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Upcoming 33rd meeting of the
board of governors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in northern
Thai province of Chiang Mai early next month is expected to help
boost tourism and related businesses in this renowned resort
province, local TV station reported Tuesday.
</P>

The tour programs are mainly in the capital city of Chiang Mai
province and adjacent areas, including recreational places, as
well as local trade and cultural centers, it said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- China has made a major
breakthrough in expanding its total installed power generating
capacity to 300 million kilowatts, according to Gao Yan, president
of the China State Power Corporation (CSPC).
</P>
<P>
Gao Yan said that CSPC has made great headway in restructuring
its power generation industry and in technological renovation,
which boosted its plan to transform CSPC into a giant corporation
with modern operating methods and a share-holding system.
</P>
<P>
Along with the sharp rise in the country's total installed
power generating capacity, China has given bigger play or put into
operation the large-sized generating units with capacity ranging
between 300,000 kw and 800,000 kw.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the condenser tube generating units with generating
capacity less than 50,000 kw will be shut down gradually, Gao said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that CSPC expects to sell 845 billion kwh of
electricity and make a profit of 8.6 billion yuan by the end of
this year by restructuring the power industry and developing the
country's major power grids.

<P>
Also, China's power industry will undergo nationwide

<P>
The CIRC said in a press release that the Guangzhou and Beijing
regulatory offices will be launched soon.
</P>
<P>
CIRC chairman Ma Yongwei said at the opening ceremony of its
Shanghai office that the establishment of the three local offices
is an important part of the reform of China's insurance regulatory
system and will actualize the CIRC's regulatory function in China'
s most important three local insurance markets.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the three cities reported a total premium income of 34.
8 billion yuan, accounting for 25 percent of the nation's total.
</P>
<P>
An overwhelming majority of foreign insurance companies and
their representative offices are also located in the three cities,
though the CIRC has recently opened Tianjin, Dalian, Chongqing and
other cities to foreign insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
The CIRC is also considering to set up regulatory offices in a
few other cities, which are expected to be operational by the end
of the year.

<HEADLINE> Magazine Calls for Desert Control in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- One of China's leading
newsmagazines carries an article in its current issue calling for
greater efforts to curb the spread of desert and sandy wastes,
which now account for 40 percent of the country's total land mass
of 9.6 million sq. km, and are growing by 2,460 sq. km. annually.
</P>
<P>
The article in China Comment Biweekly, titled "Behind the
Sandstorms," discusses the causes and effects of the powerful
sandy winds and rains in Beijing, the Chinese capital, and many
other big cities in the country in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
It reveals that deserts in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region,
along with lingering drought conditions, are mainly to blame for
the atrocious weather. In fact, sandstorms have exacerbated the
drought situation, it says.
</P>
<P>
Deserts have resulted in an increase in the number of
sandstorms, it says. In the 1990s, China has experienced over 20
sandstorms a year, up from eight in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, sandstorms have caused direct financial losses
of 54 billion yuan annually, which is three times the revenue of
five northwestern provinces and ethnic autonomous regions in 1996.
</P>
<P>
A desert, referred to as the "heavenly desert", is now only 70
km from Beijing, and the recent sandstorms have pushed it one
meter closer to the Chinese capital, according to the article.
</P>
<P>
Liu Tuo, a desert-control expert from the State Forestry
Administration, said that to launch a desert-control project
focused on protecting and planting trees and grass is the best way
to control sandstorms.
</P>
<P>
He urged that vegetation in the desert areas be protected
through planting trees and grass, which would create natural walls
against the desert advance. Meanwhile, more should be done to
establish comprehensive control over the deserts and increase the
area of oases.
</P>
<P>
Local governments in Beijing, Hebei Province, and Inner
Mongolia are planning to accelerate their pace of expanding
forests and grassland so as to form a multi-purpose green shelter
around the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
China's environment is expected to improve in 10 years, if
progress can be made in policies, laws, science and technology,
and people's way of thinking on the matter, according to Li Yucai,
deputy director of the State Forestry Administration.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- China's product quality has been
further improved during the first three months of this year, with
the qualification rate reaching 80.2 percent, the latest survey
shows.
</P>
<P>
This is the highest product qualification rate over the past
four years, according to the State Bureau of Quality and Technical
Supervision.
</P>
<P>
The quality of 31 varieties of products, including
refrigerators, detergent, pressure cookers and household gas ovens,
has been greatly improved. And the quality of cosmetics and other
ten categories of products remains good, compared with former spot
checks.
</P>
<P>
However, low quality rate was reported for 18 types of goods,
among them vegetable seeds, wood furniture and porcelain dishware.
</P>
<P>
An official from the bureau said that inferior products are
mostly produced by small-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The sample examination also indicated that China should
readjust the product mix in some sectors, such as color picture
tubes for TV sets, batteries and steel wire.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Carrier Discovered Through Pre-marriage Checkup in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- An unidentified young woman in
Beijing has become the first person in the Chinese capital to test
positive for the HIV virus during a routine pre-marriage medical
check-up, the Beijing Morning Newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted sources with the Beijing Birth Control
Institute as saying the woman, a Beijing resident, was found to be
HIV-positive, and was told to postpone her marriage application.
</P>
<P>
The girl was then sent to a local venereal disease treatment
center for another medical checkup, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the institute show the incidence of venereal
diseases among those undergoing the required pre-marriage physical
checkup reached 6.7 per 10,000 in 1999, almost double the number
in 1998, or 3.6 per 10,000, it said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the venereal diseases reported in the group are pointed
cindyloma (verruca acuminata) and syphilis.
</P>
<P>
About 140,000 to 160,000 adults register for marriage each year
in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, China has 17,316 registered AIDS
carriers, 677 of which were women.

<HEADLINE> Most China-Made Cosmetics of Good Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The latest random sampling of
China-made cosmetics shows that most get points for good quality
and none contained excessive heavy metal elements.
</P>
<P>
The spot check, conducted by the State Bureau of Quality and
Technical Supervision among 83 varieties of cosmetics produced and
sold in six provinces and municipalities, determined that 98.8
percent of the products were up to state standard.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, 66 types of cosmetics were tested for their
content of heavy metal elements, and 100 percent were up to the
state standards, the bureau said today.
</P>
<P>
Heavy metal elements including lead, arsenic and mercury in
cosmetics are health hazards.
</P>
<P>
However, experts pointed out that most of the raw materials and
compounds used to make China's cosmetics are imported from foreign
countries. They suggested Chinese cosmetic producers should
develop their own unique products that combine traditional Chinese
herbal medicine with modern technology.

<HEADLINE> Closure of One Iranian Reformist Daily Revoked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Head of Tehran Justice Department
Abasali Alizadeh said late Monday night that the closure of the
reformist daily Sobh-e Emrouz (This Morning) was revoked by the
judiciary.
</P>
<P>
Alizadeh said that the reason for the decision was absence of
the daily's managing director at a time of the meeting of the press
supervisory board, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Saeed Hajjarian, managing director of Sobh-e Emrouz and a
reformist ally of President Mohammad Khatami, was shot and
seriously wounded in an assassination attempt on March 12. He has
recovered his consciousness after a long coma, but is still
hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
The conservative judiciary on Monday ordered the closure of two
more reformist dailies Sobh-e Emrouz and Akhbar-e Eqtessad
(Economic News) and it closed down 12 reformist publications Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
The unusual closure of so many reformist publications came amid
the intensifying struggle between the conservative and reformist
camps since the reformists' landslide victory in the elections.
</P>
<P>
A dozen of reformist journalists and publishers have been
summoned to courts and three journalists and publishers have been
sent to prisons on charge of insulting the Islamic sanctities and
principles.
</P>
<P>
The closure of papers has triggered condemnation from many
reformist circles, including the Association of Journalists and the
Islamic Human Rights Commission, who termed the judiciary's act as
violating the press freedom spirit stipulated in the constitution.
</P>
<P>
However, the reformist camp which support the reform programs of
President Khatami called for calm and legal actions against the
conservative crackdown.
</P>
<P>
President Khatami on Monday also called for calm and solidarity
in the society, particularly before the transition of the
parliament to the reformists from the powerful conservatives, who
still control most of the sensitive state organs.

<P>
ANKARA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Turkish newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- Following a summit which lasted nine hours on Monday, Turkish
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit declared that leaders of the ruling
coalition agreed to suggest Ahmet Necdet Sezer, chairman of the
Constitutional Court, as their common presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- Efforts to bring peace and friendship to the chaos-torn
southeastern Turkey began to bear fruits as members of the pro-
Kurdish People's Democracy Party (HADEP), and Turkish soldiers came
together on Monday at the wedding feast of a HADEP mayor in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Last week, another mayor from HADEP attended the funeral of a
policeman, killed in a local clash, for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Ankara ever accused the HADEP of abetting and supporting behind
the scene the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), which has
launched a 15-year-long armed struggle for an independent Kurdish
state in the southeast. The clash has claimed the lives of
thousands of Turkish soldiers and civilians.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- Palestinian Airways announced that starting on June 1, it
will begin twice-weekly flights to Turkey's largest city Istanbul,
departing on every Monday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The air carrier was established two years ago through
arrangement with Israel.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Army Chief Calls for Dialogue With Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's Chief of General Staff of
the Armed Forces Huseyin Kivrikoglu has urged Greece to come up for
a military dialogue with Ankara, reported Turkish Daily News on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is to reduce tension with Greece," explained the
Turkish military leader.
</P>
<P>
Kivrikoglu issued the call at a reception held on Sunday evening
marking the National Sovereignty and Children's Day, which falls on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the necessity to set up a dialogue mechanism between
the militaries of the two countries so as to relax tensions in the
Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, two NATO allies which are locked in disputes
over Cyprus and the Aegean Sea for decades, cashed in on the mutual
sympathy produced by devastating earthquakes in the two countries
last summer in a process dubbed earthquake diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
The new rapprochement was furthered by an exchange of historic
visits of the foreign ministers of the two countries earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
However, none of the nine agreements signed during the visits
addressed the core disputes that have kept tensions high for years.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that with the conclusion of Greek elections
bringing the ruling PASOK back to power, there are concerns in
Ankara over whether the new Greek government will give the green
light to bilateral military dialogue between the two Aegean
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis reiterated over the weekend
that the only problem Greece has with Turkey is the determination
of the continental shelf in the Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the Parliament about his new government's
program, bilateral relations with Turkey in particular, Simitis
declared that the address for the resolution of the dispute is no
other than the International Court of Justice at the Hague.
</P>
<P>
Kivrikoglu disputed Simitis' statement by saying that "from the
very beginning they have seen the continental shelf as the sole
problem between Turkey and Greece awaiting resolution. We say there
are four or five issues."
</P>
<P>
"If one side pulls in one direction and the other in the
opposite then we will go nowhere," he added.
</P>
<P>
An unidentified senior general also attending the reception told
the paper that Simitis' announcement is a step backward in meeting
Turkish demands.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has always held that there are five major points of
contention between Turkey and Greece, including the continental
shelf, the armament of the Aegean islands, the status of certain
Aegean islands, the Turkish population of Greece's western Thrace
and air space over the Aegean. The Turkish side does not consider
the Cyprus dispute to fall within the framework of Turkish-Greek
relations.
</P>
<P>
All eyes are now on the scheduled meeting between Turkish
Foreign Minister Ismail Cem and his Greek counterpart George
Papandreou, due to be held in New York on May 2, during which both
ministers will receive the "Statesman of the Year" award from the
U.S.-based East-West Institute for their contribution to the
Turkish-Greek political dialogue.
</P>
<P>
It is speculated here that Cem and Papandreou, architects of the
rapprochement between Turkey and Greece, will reach an
understanding to pave the way for further improvement of relations.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Beefs up Patrol on Malaysian Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 25, (Xinhua) -- The Armed Forces of the
Philippines(AFP) said Tuesday that it has beefed up joint border
patrol to track down the kidnappers of some 20 foreigners taken
last Sunday night at Sipadan island, Sabah, Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Ernesto De Guzman, AFP Southern Command chief of staff said in
a statement that they have sent additional troops on board
Philippine Navy gunboats to help the Malaysian Royal Navy in their
search and rescue operation to retrieve the 20 kidnapped victims.
</P>
<P>
The 20 foreigners were believed kidnapped by at least eight
armed Filipinos believed also to be symphatizers of the extremist
Abu Sayyaf group operating in the southern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
De Guzman said a team from the Philippine Air Force have also
been dispatched to the area to conduct surveillance patrol in the
islets and islands of the provinces of Tawi-Tawi and Sulu.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the Malaysian government to the Southcom
headquarters in Zamboanga city said the 20 foreigners were
composed of five Malaysian government officials, a Malaysian
police, four beach workers while the 10 are of different
nationalities.
</P>
<P>
Sipadan island is a known diving area for foreign visitors who
would like to enjoy the natural corals in the area.
</P>
<P>
It was not confirmed yet whether the Filipino abductors brought
their captives to the southern Philippines but officials said they
could be simple sea pirates operating between the Malaysian-
Philippine border.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine and Malaysia government have signed few years
back a joint border patrol agreement to maintain security in the
border area.
</P>
<P>
No demands from the abductors have yet been reported by the
Philippine authorities.

<HEADLINE> Malaria Kills 72 Children Daily in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Seventy-two children under the
age of five years die of malaria daily in Kenya, a malaria expert
has said.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation newspaper Tuesday quoted Dr Beth Rapuoda as
saying " with 107 per 1,000 children aged below five dying of
malaria annually, the disease places a heavy burden on the health
system."
</P>
<P>
Rapuoda said the disease accounts for 30 percent of all
out-patient cases, 19 percent of all admissions and 5.1 percent of
whom die.
</P>
<P>
Malaria ranks the second killer disease in Kenya after AIDS.
The malaria endemic areas are mainly in southwestern Kenya
including Narok, Kisii, Kericho, Nandi, Kilifi districts among
others.
</P>
<P>
The anticipated perennial outbreak of malaria is possible in
parts of Nyanza, Rift Valley and Western provinces due to the
start of the long rain season between March and June.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Nyanza Provincial Medical Officer Ambrose Misore
said of 400 patients at the Kisii Hospital, between 80 to 90 were
malaria victims.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said that in Kisii District alone, 121 people
died of the disease and over 12,000 others were affected by the
epidemic this year.
</P>
<P>
To prevent and treat the disease, Kenya's Health Ministry had
allocated 320 million shillings (around 4.2 million U.S. dollars)
for anti-malaria drugs this financial year.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 25 (Xinhua) -- A Philippine firm has won a
10-year concession to operate and manage the Dar es Salaam
container terminal, the African newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine port operator International Container Terminal
Services Inc. (ICTSI), its subsidiary ICTSI International Holdings
Corp. and Tanzanian firm Vertex Financial Services are to sign the
contract with the Tanzanian government on May 5, the Filipino firm
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The group is to take over operations in August.
</P>
<P>
The consortium, called the Tanzania International Container
Terminal Services Ltd., submitted the highest bid and is expected
to spend 6.5 million U.S. dollars over the 10-year concession to
refurbish, add new equipment and introduce a computer system for
the dilapidated port, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Dar es Salaam container terminal is one of the major marine
ports on the Indian Ocean coast operated by the Tanzania Harbors
Authority (THA). It serves both Tanzania and the neighboring
landlocked countries like Zambia, Rwanda, Burundi, the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Uganda and Malawi.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of the government's plan to privatize the
Tanzania Harbors Authority, added the report.

<HEADLINE> Nikkei Stock Index Declines in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The benchmark Nikkei index fell
sharply in Tokyo Tuesday, with issues newly added to the index
continuing to face profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 207.82 points, or 1.12
percent, from Monday's close to end at 18,272.33.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX) which covers
all First Section issues, however, added 4.47 points, or 0.27
percent, to 1,665.28, rising for the sixth straight trading day.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section decreased to 537.36 million
shares from Monday's 657.54 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Nippon Steel was the day's volume leader.
</P>
<P>
New Nikkei components faced selling after gaining in the
morning session, traders said, adding that many of the 30 new
issues on the key market gauge will be top-heavy for the rest of
the week after drawing active buying last week.
</P>
<P>
Monday's plunge in New York's technology-heavy NASDAQ composite
index was another factor weighing on Tokyo share prices, they said.
</P>
<P>
Export-oriented technology issues in Tokyo were generally lower,
reflecting the weakness in the NASDAQ.
</P>
<P>
Real estate firms were the biggest winners, rising 4.42 percent
as a group, while banks, electric power and gas firms, and
wholesalers also gained.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, losers narrowly
surpassed gainers 659 to 617, while 112 issues ended unchanged.

<HEADLINE> China Has 250,000 Online Stock Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- China now has 250,000 online
stock investors, while online trading makes up one percent of the
country's total stock trading volume, the China Securities
Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has said.
</P>
<P>
In a press release today, the CSRC said more than 200
securities brokers nationwide are providing online brokerage
services, and more brokers are expected to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
The watchdog said online stock trading has existed in China for
two years without unified technical standards and regulations,
which posed growing risks to investors and prompted the CSRC's
recent issue of temporary regulations on Internet stock brokerage.
</P>
<P>
The CSRC said its regulations are a result of two years of
market experiments and discussions among all sides concerned, and
borrowed from the experiences of other countries.
</P>
<P>
Though the regulations ban computer technology companies,
Internet and information companies from taking commissions for
transactions in their co-operation with securities companies, the
CSRC said they can provide technological support or information
services to securities companies in any other form.
</P>
<P>
The regulations demand that securities companies' technical
systems must conform to certain standards, for example, the
systems must have real-time monitoring functions and must be
separated from brokers' other operation systems.
</P>
<P>
Securities companies must also have strict in-house controls
and provide account statements to customers regularly. They can
impose restrictions on the maximum value of a single deal or that
of trading by a single investor in a single day.
</P>
<P>
The CSRC said all these provisions are designed to minimize the
risks for investors as well as for securities companies.
</P>
<P>
The CSRC reminded investors to be prudent in choosing websites
and brokers, and to notify their brokers immediately if
discrepancies appear in their account statements.

<HEADLINE> China's Grain Acreage to Drop Five Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- China's grain acreage is expected
to drop by five percent this year from a year earlier, while that
of oil-bearing crops will jump about 10 percent, according to a
recent survey by the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Of the total grain acreage, the area of land planted with
summer wheat is expected to decline by six percent, and that of
low-yield, poor quality wheat south of the Yangtze River will see
the biggest cut. Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hubei, Anhui, Sichuan and
other major grain producing provinces in this region account for
70 percent of the total drop in the grain acreage.
</P>
<P>
The acreage of quality wheat for special purposes has expanded
at the same time, according to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The acreage of summer oil-bearing crops reached a record high
this year, with central China's Hubei and Hunan provinces as well
as eastern Jiangsu Province enjoying the most growth. In Hunan,
the acreage of quality oil-bearing crops now exceeds 667,000
hectares.
</P>
<P>
The survey says that summer grain seedlings are growing well in
general, however, the drought in north China and the continuous
rain in some areas south of the Yangtze River and in southwest
China have affected wheat growth.

<HEADLINE> China to Close 103 Small Steelworks This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- China will close its 225 small
steelworks in the next few years, and has set this year's target
at 103, according to the State Administration of Metallurgical
Industry(SAMI).
</P>
<P>
Both small steelworks and large steel plants with out-dated
steel production capacity of 4.5 million tons will be eliminated
this year.
</P>
<P>
Pu Haiqing, director of SAMI, said here today that closing the
small steelworks and cutting out-dated production capacity will
help improve steel quality, prevent shoddy construction, protect
the environment, save energy, and promote the sustainable growth
of China's national economy.
</P>
<P>
Out of the current 290 steelworks in China, the 225 small mills
account for only 7.5 percent of total production. These mills are
generally heavy polluters and high energy consumers, and their
products are of low standard.
</P>
<P>
Shi Wanpeng, deputy director of the State Economic and Trade
Commission(SETC), noted that closing small steelworks is not
equivalent to cutting production, but is instrumental to the
restructuring of the industry and improvement of the steel
products.
</P>
<P>
"It is also prompted by strong competition in the global steel
market as China is seeking entry to the World Trade Organization(
WTO)," Shi said.
</P>
<P>
China's energy and finance sectors will also join this move by
limiting supplies of fuel, power, and loans to those soon-to-be-
closed small mills, and licenses of some steelworks will be
revoked by the authorities.
</P>
<P>
China's first quarter steel production reached 29.8 million
tons, up 3.2 percent on an annual basis, showing a slowing down to
a great extent.
</P>
<P>
As the world's largest steel producer, China turned out 124.3
million tons of steel in 1999. Production is expected to be about
110 million tons this year.

<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua)-- China Telecom and other 25
telecommunication companies in the Asia Pacific Region has signed
an agreement to build the first self-healing high bandwidth
optical fiber submarine cable system in the region.
</P>
<P>
The cable, known as the Asian Pacific Cable Network 2, will
cost about one billion US dollars and is expected to carry
commercial traffic by the end of September 2001, according to
China Telecom here today.
</P>
<P>
Upon its completion, the 19,000 km-long cable system will
connect eight countries and regions in the Asia Pacific Region.
Besides serving the region, the cable system will also provide
seamless interconnection with other major trans-oceanic cable
networks providing connection to the USA, European countries,
Australia and other parts of Asia.
</P>
<P>
The cable system is designed to use state-of-the-art Dense
Wavelength Division Multiplexing technology to provide upgradable,
future-proof transmission facilities that support the Internet and
e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the cable system will have a "self-healing ring
configuration" with four fiber-optic pairs, with greater network
resilience and route diversity.

The delay comes despite a recent statement from President Wahid

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 25 (Xinhua) -- A tough traffic bill will be
submitted to Kenya's parliament within two weeks to amend the
current law, Kenya's Attorney-General Amos Wako has said.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Times Tuesday quoted Wako as saying that the traffic
amendment act would impose harsh penalties on offenders since the
cases of road accidents had reached an alarming rate.
</P>
<P>
In the last one month, more than 150 people were killed by road
 accidents in the east African country due to overload, overspeed
or reckless overtaking.
</P>
<P>
The bill had already been approved by the cabinet, Wako said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Information, Transport and Communications Minister
Musalia Mudavadi said that current traffic laws were too lenient.
</P>
<P>
Musalia revealed that the amendments would also seek to install
speed devices in buses to curb speeding and punish people who
board vehicles already full to capacity.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the amendments were expected to serve as
a deterrent to check indisciplined drivers and restore passengers'
confidence.

<HEADLINE> Macao Airport to Handle Small Commercial Aircraft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The principal part of the aerial transport center was completed
at the end of year, and the installing and testing of related
facilities are well underway, according to sources with the
airport.
</P>
<P>
In the coming days, the local civil aviation authority and fire-
fighting department will check on the transport center. If all
things go smoothly, the center may be put into use by the end of
the month.
</P>
<P>
Covering more than 2,100 sq m, the transport center includes a
hangar which accommodate two small airplanes, and a parking apron
which is able to handle six planes.
</P>
<P>
Similar aerial business was put into operation at the airport
of neighboring Hong Kong last year, but the landing fee in Macao
is said to be cheaper and the Macao center can offer round-the-
clock service.

<HEADLINE> Northern China Hit Again by Sandstorm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Most of north China and part of
the northeast, including Beijing, have been hit by a sandstorm for
the eighth time this year, Chinese meteorologists said today.
</P>
<P>
Li Yanxiang, a senior engineer with China's Central
Meteorological Observatory, said the sandy skies over Beijing will
gradually clear throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
She explained that a strong wind moving south that began to
sweep across Beijing will help disperse the blowing sand in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Sand from Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region turned the sky over Beijing and part of Hebei
and Shanxi provinces grey today, she said.
</P>
<P>
Both central Inner Mongolia and northern Ningxia and part of
neighboring Gansu and Shaanxi provinces were pelted by sandstorms
Monday.
</P>
<P>
She said Shandong and Henan Provinces and part of northwest
China will be affected by the drifting sand later today and
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
A lack of vegetation in northern China, dry and sandy land, and
strong winds were blamed for the bad weather condition.

<HEADLINE> More Radiation Found During Call Connection of Mobile Phone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although no scientific evidence shows that exposure to such
radiation has caused health problems, mobile phone users are
advised to keep phones away from the body between dialing and
talking.
</P>
<P>
Tso Wong Man-yin, chief of the University of Hong Kong's radio-
isotope unit, conducted the test on five different types of mobile
phones at various stages of the cycle of making a call, including
connecting, ringing, answering and listening.
</P>
<P>
The study has found that radiation emitted from the phones
while connecting ranges from 5.5 to more than 10 microwatts per
square meter. That is between five and 20 times the emissions
recorded while the phone rang or when users are talking.
</P>
<P>
In these tests, using a hands-free device had no significant
effect on radiation levels. Indeed, tests conducted by the
Consumers' Association in Britain found that hands-free
attachments can in fact send three times as much radiation to the
brain as standard handsets.

<HEADLINE> Malone 4th Man In NBA History With 4,000 Points In Playoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Karl Malone Monday became the
fourth player in NBA history with 4,000 points in the playoffs,
joining Michael Jordan (5,987 points), Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (5,762)
and Jerry West (4,457).
</P>
<P>
He passed the 4,000-point mark on a layup with 4:32 left in the
third quarter against the Seattle Supersonics. The Utah Jazz won
the second game over the Seattle Supersonics in a 101-87 victory
and Malone finished the game with 4,004 playoff points.
</P>
<P>
Ahead 57-40 at halftime, the Jazz opened the second half with
four straight baskets - two by Malone - to build their margin to
25 points. A no-look backward layup by Jeff Hornacek made it 73-47
with 6:35 left in the third period.
</P>
<P>
The Jazz led 86-59 entering the fourth quarter, and scored
seven straight points, including a long 3-pointer by Eisley as the
24-second clock expired, to take a 93-59 lead.
</P>
<P>
Malone Monday night had 23 points, fewer than half the 50
points he scored in Game 1, but the Jazz didn't need nearly that
many Monday night over the Seattle SuperSonics. Utah took a 2-0
lead in the best-of-five series. Game 3 is Saturday at Seattle.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investors Go Away for Lack of Good Stocks: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The major reason for foreign
investors to refrain from investing in Thai stocks is the absence
of good quality securities, particularly technology stocks, a
survey report disclosed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Other reasons include insufficient market liquidity and a lack
of confidence in the listed companies, said a survey report
released by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Thailand (
SEC).
</P>
<P>
According to the survey respondents, mainly local and foreign
securities companies, there are many reasons for the lack of high
quality securities in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
One reason is that viable companies have chosen not to be
listed on the stock exchange and another is that the listed
companies want to be delisted because they no longer see the
benefits of remaining on the exchange.
</P>
<P>
In addition, disclosure requirements for listed companies are
seen as a curb on their competitiveness and so they have opted to
remain unlisted.
</P>
<P>
To increase the amount of good quality stocks, the survey
respondents recommended that the Thai stock market should provide
incentives for companies to become listed.
</P>
<P>
Another way to attract foreign investors is for the Thai stock
market to improve the processes and procedures for buying and
selling stocks,the survey respondents said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Become Tesco's Asian Hub </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Buoyed by its successful hyper-
market business in Thailand, the British retailing giant Tesco Plc.
said the country will be its top site in Asia for investment, the
Bangkok Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Thailand would be the business development center for discount
stores in the region, Tesco Chairman John Gardiner was quoted as
saying Monday in Bangkok at the opening of the 20th Tesco-Lotus
store in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
"Everything we learn from Thailand will benefit Tesco's
operations in other countries worldwide," Gardiner said.
</P>
<P>
The company is already applying some experience from Tesco-
Lotus Thailand in terms of marketing, space management and product
management to Tesco stores in South Korea and Britain, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Thailand has the highest potential among Tesco operations
worldwide in terms of non-food operation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tesco has assigned executives of its food business to work with
Thai farmers to introduce new technology to increase crop yields.
They will also work on developing worldwide standards and
increasing the competitiveness of food products.
</P>
<P>
Work is also being done on the distribution-supply chain for
fresh and processed foods.
</P>
<P>
Tesco has also set up a purchasing center in Thailand to source
products such as apparel and distribute them to other purchasing
centers abroad including Central Europe and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Thailand, the company is developing businesses
in South Korea and Taiwan and is considering China's mainland and
other places as possible investment destinations.
</P>
<P>
So far, the company has invested 360 million British pounds (
540 million U.S. dollars) in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 2003, Tesco's investment in Thailand will total
600 million pounds (900 million dollars) and it will have 40
stores in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- One child was killed and five
children were wounded as two feuding groups of youths exchanged
gunfire at the National Zoo in Washington Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Police said a boy, either 11 or 12 years old, was shot in the
head and declared brain dead at a hospital. A 12-year-old girl was
in serious condition with a wound to the pelvis, a 14-year-old boy
was in serious condition with a leg wound, and three other youths
were hospitalized with less serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
The victims ranged in age on 11-16 and were attending a century-
old post-Easter gathering at the zoo celebrating the "African-
American Family Day."
</P>
<P>
At least two of the victims were shot at the zoo's visitors
center and one was shot at the zoo entrance on Connecticut Avenue,
a main thoroughfare in the northwest section of the U.S. capital.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the shooting occurred shortly after 6 p.m. local
time when a bottle was thrown from one group of youths at another.
A piece of glass struck a young woman in the face, and then shots
rang out, they added.
</P>
<P>
Police were investigating whether the shooting was gang related
and sought at least one teen-age gunman who fired a handgun into
groups of youths.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Faces Difficulties in Hosting NAM Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The proposed summit of the Non-
Aligned Movement (NAM) due to be held in Dhaka next year looks
uncertain as the huge expenditure required for massive
preparations appears to be absent, The New Nation newspaper
reported here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a diplomatic source as saying the present
hotels and apartments are not enough for the visiting heads of
government and guests.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh now burdened with a sliding economy is facing
difficulties in hosting such an event, which would cost more than
10 billion taka (200 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The transport system at the government level for the movement
of the delegations of the 115 NAM member countries would also be a
serious issue, the source said.
</P>
<P>
The movement of the visiting heads of state or government along
with the ministers would require special cars to be imported for
their use during the three-day summit.
</P>
<P>
Another vitally important factor would be the issue of security
for all the VIPs. It would be viewed in the context of the recent
mismanagement during the visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton to
Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
On security ground, the U.S. president had to drop his
scheduled program to a nearby village to see the rural development.
</P>
<P>
The source pointed out that cancellation of the scheduled
program caused serious concern both at home and abroad and it
would have a lingering impact on all future programs of foreign
dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
Hosting the NAM summit next year would also be difficult as
Bangladesh would face a hectic campaign for the coming general
election due next year. Both the ruling party and the opposition
parties would engage themselves for the electioneering, paying
little attention to the coming NAM summit.

CANBERRA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Australians are now treating
financial planners like doctors, with more than a third of the
adult population seeking their advice, a new survey showed on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The country's Roy Morgan polls indicated that a record number
of Australians are seeking advice from qualified financial
planners.
</P>
<P>
More than one-third, or 36.1 percent, of people aged 14 and
older have sought financial advice, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
"Just as we pay a doctor to look after our physical health,
consumers are aware of the need to employ a professional financial
planner to oversee their financial health," Financial Planning
Association of Australia Chief Executive Michael McKenna said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"More and more Australians are recognizing that financial
planning is a specialist, professional skill," he said.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that financial planners extended their
lead over other financial professionals as the preferred advisers.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Aims to Halt Population Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government is
aiming to reduce the country's population growth to zero as the
current 1-percent annual increase costs too much, a U.N.-sponsored
program said in its latest newsletter.
</P>
<P>
"The government spends around 5 percent of gross national
product on health," said the Reproductive Health Initiative (RHI),
a joint program launched in 1997 by the U.N. Population Fund in
association with the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka, with a population of 19 million, was included as the
seventh country to receive funding under the RHI program.
</P>
<P>
The other countries included in the program are Bangladesh with
a growth rate of 1.7 percent, Cambodia 2.3 percent, Laos 2.6
percent,Nepal 2.4 percent, Pakistan 2.8 percent and Vietnam 1.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
The basis for including Sri Lanka to receive funding under the
RHI program was the non-availability of services to young people,
especially the lack of counseling and information, said the
newsletter.
</P>
<P>
It said significant progress had been made by Sri Lanka with a
dramatic decrease in child and infant mortality from 130 per 1,000
live births in 1960 to 18 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka also compares favorably with other countries in
maintaining a low fertility rate with the use of contraceptives,
said the newsletter.
</P>
<P>
Over 60 percent of the population use contraceptives compared
with 19 percent in Pakistan and under 50 percent in Bangladesh.

<HEADLINE> Thai Economy Recovers in All-Around Way: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is entering a post-
crisis growth path, as nearly all sectors in the economy have
recovered and will be able to cope with even changing external
factors, a top official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Commerce Minister Supachai
Panitchpakdi was quoted by the official Thai News Agency as saying
that after assessing the overall economic prospects and conditions
in local financial and foreign exchange markets, the government
found that nearly all sectors had recovered.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after a governmental economic meeting on
Tuesday, at the Bank of Thailand, the country's central bank.
</P>
<P>
The production capacity of the automobile and electronic
industries had particularly increased by 70 percent and 120
percent respectively while the baht, the country's currency, has
been satisfactorily stable, Supachai noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the conditions reflected that the Thai economy is now
in a fresh firm position that enables it to cope with even
changing external factors, namely an anticipated increase of U.S.
interest rates soon.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Finance Minister Pisit Lee-Artham also expressed
similar views on Tuesday, saying the overall Thai economy is now
in a better prospect, with improving exports and industrial
manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
The only concern now is the deteriorating prices of
agricultural products, affected by conditions in the world market,
which the government is working hard to address, he said.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Lasting Peace: A Dream of N. Irish People  (By Huang Xingwei) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELFAST, Northern Ireland, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Belfast, the
capital of Northern Ireland, a name synonymous with bombs and
sectarianism. But once you are in the city, you will see another
side.
</P>
<P>
For first-time visitors to Belfast, they might be pleasantly
surprised. It is quite difficult to see a policeman or an armored
patrol car in the street, or to find shopping malls packed with
customers rushing to buy Easter gifts. The seaside city is quite
different from what they have seen or heard about from newspapers,
television or radio.
</P>
<P>
In the evening, the city's bars, clubs and restaurants,
especially in the city center, are crammed to overflowing. It
seems that a generation deprived of a night life by a three-decade-
long armed conflict has decided to have a permanent party while it
has the chance.
</P>
<P>
Inside the 200-year-old Crown Liquor Saloon, located at Great
Victoria Street, a Catholic named Hugh told Xinhua that in Belfast
people rarely ask you whether you are a Catholic or a Protestant.
</P>
<P>
"I have many Protestant friends. We get along with each other
quite well despite our different political views. Only time will
tell you that the people's desire to live a normal life here
outweighs the minority's needs to cling to the hatreds and past,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The armed conflicts, which started in 1969, between the
Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland have claimed 3,600
lives in the past 30 years, and brought constant turmoil to
Belfast, a city with a population of 300,000.
</P>
<P>
On April 10, 1998, the conflicting parties signed the historic
Good Friday peace agreement in Belfast, providing the Northern
Irish people with a new possibility to see the "dawn of peace."
</P>
<P>
In Northern Ireland, the number of tourists is the barometer of
public security. Some 1.64 million people visited Northern Ireland
in 1999, contributing 255 million pounds (408 million U.S. dollars
to its revenue, an 11-percent increase over the previous year,
Northern Ireland Tourist Board statistics showed.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the 1990s, Northern Ireland enjoyed the fastest
economic growth of any region in the United Kingdom, John Murrary
from the Northern Ireland Industrial Development told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Between 1990 and 1995, Northern Ireland's GDP grew by 11.6
percent in real terms compared with 5.3 percent for Great Britain
as a whole. And in recent years, foreign investment in software,
telecommunications and e-commerce has been increasing dramatically,
he said.
</P>
<P>
On Easter Sunday, thousands of Catholics held the annual mass
rally in West Belfast to commemorate the 1916 Easter Rising in
which thousands of Catholics died in the independence-seeking
uprising against Britain. But Sinn Fein, the political wing of the
Irish Republican Army (IRA), announced no new initiatives at the
commemorations.
</P>
<P>
The parade indicated that hundreds of years of hatred between
the Catholics and Protestants could not possibly melt like ice in
a short time, and the national reconciliation would be a long and
tortuous process.
</P>
<P>
In February, the British government suspended the Northern
Irish assembly as the IRA showed no signs of decommissioning,
raising fears of the return of violence in the province.
</P>
<P>
But John Murrary was quite optimistic about the future. "The
Northern Irish people are anxious for a lasting peace. Once the
Northern Irish assembly is restored and the paramilitary
organizations hand over their arms, by then you could discover a
new Northern Ireland with changes every day," he said.

<HEADLINE> Six Children Wounded in Washington Shooting (Update with more details) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Six children were wounded as
two feuding groups of youths exchanged gunfire at the National Zoo
in Washington Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Brian Lee, spokesman for the District of Columbia Fire and
Emergency Medical Services, said one boy suffered serious wounds
to the head. The other victims ranged in age on 11-16 and most
were listed in critical or serious condition.
</P>
<P>
Police helicopters hovered over the zoo after the shooting as
authorities sought a gunman.
</P>
<P>
At the time of the shooting, shortly after 6 p.m. local time,
the zoo, a unit of the Smithsonian Institution, was playing host
to an "African-American Family Day," featuring live music
performances, storytellers, dancers and African drummers.
</P>
<P>
At least two of the victims were shot at the zoo's visitors
center and one was shot at the zoo entrance on Connecticut Avenue,
a main thoroughfare in the northwest section of the U.S. capital.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the shooting occurred when a bottle was thrown
from one group of youths at another. A piece of glass struck a
young woman in the face, and then shots rang out, they added.
</P>
<P>
The National Zoo is one of the most visited sites in Washington,
drawing 3 million local residents and visiting tourists each year.
</P>
<P>
Police said no arrests had been made.

<HEADLINE> Atlantis Grounding Not to Delay Olympic Torch Relay: SOCOG  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The grounding of a space shuttle
with the Sydney Olympic torch on board would not affect the timing
of the 2000 Games torch relay, organisers said Tuesday in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Strong cross-winds at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, the
United States, prevented the launch of the flight carrying the
Olympic torch into space Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The boomerang-shaped torch and an Olympic flag are among cargo
stowed inside the space shuttle Atlantis, which was scheduled to
leave with a crew of seven on a mission to repair the
international space station before strong winds grounded the
flight minutes before take-off.
</P>
<P>
But a spokesman of the Sydney Organising Committee for the
Olympic Games (SOCOG) said the shuttle delay would not interfere
with the schedule for the Olympic torch relay.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a setback and it's not going to delay the start of
the relay," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"SOCOG remains confident that the torch will be in space in
time to promote the start of the Sydney 2000 torch relay," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic flame will leave Olympia in Greece in May 2000 and
travel for almost five months before it lights the cauldron at
Homebush stadium on September 15, 2000.
</P>
<P>
SOCOG said the torch was a specially designed for space travel.
</P>
<P>
"Because of limited space on board the shuttle, the torch was
designed so that it can be dismantled and taken into space," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
When the flight begins, the torch will orbit the earth about 15
times a day and will travel about 6.5 million kilometers through
space.
</P>
<P>
As well as going into space, the torch is also set to go under
water, with part of the torch relay to take in the Great Barrier
Reef, off the Queensland coast in northeast Australia.
</P>
<P>
"It will be the most travelled and transported torch in Olympic
history," the SOCOG spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Host Meeting of Gulf, Asian States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia plans to host a high-
level meeting of Gulf and Asian states here next month in an
attempt to establish a special economic fund for the country,
according to Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab.
</P>
<P>
The minister said 12 Asian and Gulf countries had agreed to
send ministers to the meeting on May 3 to discuss establishing new
agreements that could enhance investment in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"The target of the meeting is to set up a 'Gulf fund', sort of
like the fund from the International Monetary Fund, concentrating
on business investment in Indonesia," Alwi was quoted by The
Jakarta Post Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the meeting would also be an opportunity for
the private sector from the Gulf countries to meet with the
Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency to discuss investment
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The countries to be invited to the meeting are the six nations
of the Gulf Cooperation Council -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates -- and Iran, Yemen,
Brunei, Malaysia and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Singapore will hold a special seat at the meeting and assist
Indonesia in deciding which business opportunities and types of
investment are favorable for the Gulf countries.
</P>
<P>
"In the meeting, we are looking for something more than just
loans from these countries, but an assurance of long-term
investments. Hopefully we can even accomplish preliminary
transactions during the meeting," the minister added.
</P>
<P>
According to Alwi, several of the invited countries had shown
interest in Indonesia's mining industry and state enterprises,
including the privatization of airports.
</P>
<P>
He said the plan to meet with Middle Eastern and Asian
countries is also meant to reduce Indonesia's dependence on
western countries.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to correct the perception that we are too
dependent on the West, (and show) that we can also have a close
relationship with Gulf states," he said.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan Vows to Consolidate Independence, Political Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA-ATA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh President Nursultan
Nazarbayev said Monday that consolidating independence,
maintaining political stability and developing economy are the
three major tasks faced by the country at present.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev made the remarks in an interview with local official
press on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the country's
presidential system, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The three tasks constitute the basis of improving the living
standards of the people, he said, adding that it's the country's "
most valuable asset" to keep political stability and win the trust
of people.
</P>
<P>
Without stability and harmony, there is no way of talking about
building the country, developing economy and improving people's
living standards, he said.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev was elected the first president of Kazakhstan for a
six-year term in April 1990, and his tenure was extended to the
year 2000 in a referendum in April 1995.
</P>
<P>
He was reelected in the presidential elections in January 1999,
after the parliament approved an amendment to the constitution in
October 1998, which decided to hold the elections ahead of
schedule and extend the presidency to seven years.

BERLIN, April 25 (Xinhua) -- World peace was the main theme of

</P>
<P>
Organizers said that during this year's Easter Parade, which

<P>
In Stuttgart, paraders blocked the exit for the general command

<HEADLINE> Half of U.S. Small Businesses Establish Home Page </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Fifty-two percent of small
businesses in the United States established a home page in 1999,
and the number is expected to rise to over 70 percent by 2003,
according to a report released Monday.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, 2.1 million U.S. small businesses with fewer than 100
employees had a home page or website, and the number will increase
30 percent to 2.7 million in 2000, said the report from market
research firm International Data Corporation (IDC).
</P>
<P>
"Once confined by geographical constraints, small businesses in
the United States are now leveraging the Internet to expand beyond
local boundaries," the report said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to using information on the Web, small businesses
are recognizing the benefit of promoting themselves via the Web.
But IDC estimated that almost 13 percent of U.S. small businesses
have yet to invest in a PC.
</P>
<P>
At this point, IDC said, e-commerce presents the most
significant growth opportunity for a wide range of U.S. small
businesses. The number of these companies selling goods and
services online will grow from 850,000 at the end of 1999 to 2.9
million in 2003.
</P>
<P>
"The Internet has tremendous reach, and small businesses are
beginning to realize the potential of this channel," said the
report. "By 2003 nearly half of online small businesses will be
selling over the Internet."

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Stage Urine Test to Shuttlers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Badminton Association of
Indonesia (PBSI) would stage a urine test to scrutinize shuttlers
accused of consuming banned substances.
</P>
<P>
"We have received information from many people saying that some
shuttlers have been taking banned substances, most of them ecstasy,
" PBSI's executive director Karsono was quoted by the Jakarta Post
Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said PBSI would undergo urine tests on 10 suspected
shuttlers.
</P>
<P>
"We really want to test all the shuttlers here but due to the
expense, PBSI can only afford 10 tests," he said.
</P>
<P>
The national Sports Council's head of sports science commission
Carmen Jahya said that should PBSI undergo urine tests, they
should be conducted without any prior notification.
</P>
<P>
"If PBSI wants to conduct tests, (it should) do it suddenly. If
the suspected athletes have taken ecstasy or shabu-shabu (crystal
methamphetamine), they can erase their tracks by consuming lots of
water. The evidence will disappear within two days. It's useless,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Carmen said ecstasy and shabu-shabu were produced from
amphetamine or derivatives of it and were by themselves
nonaddictive.
</P>
<P>
"But I don't buy the rumors. I know our shuttlers have good
manners," she added.

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Shi Guifang, a female farmer
suffering from cataract for many years, regained her eyesight
after receiving a surgical operation at a mobile medical vehicle
recently.
</P>
<P>
Shi was among the 3,000 beneficiaries of the "Sightfirst China
Act Project" in northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
"Sightfirst China Act" is a blindness prevention and treatment
project, the largest of its kind in the world, being developed
with the combined efforts of China and the Lions Club
International.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi has 140,000 cataract patients, many of whom can restore
their eyesight after operation. However, 80 percent of the
patients live in rural areas where competent doctors and up-to-
date medical equipment are not available.

The Shaanxi Provincial Government launched an eyesight
restoration program in cooperation with the Hong Kong Society for
the Blind in 1996. Key hospitals in Shaanxi have dispatched
renowned experts to work on the mobile medical vehicle.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- China intends to bring 50,000
square kilometers of land that have suffered erosion back into use
and curb additional soil erosion, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Zhai Haohui, vice-minister of water resources, urged local
governments at various levels to intensify their erosion-control
efforts this year.
</P>
<P>
Soil erosion would worsen in the western region with large-
scale construction of highways, railways, mining and exploitation
of water resources if effective measures and strict monitoring are
not taken, Zhai warned.
</P>
<P>
Soil erosion plagues more than one-third of the country, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, the state has spent three billion yuan (
361 million US dollars) on a series of key erosion-control
projects upstream of the Yangtze River and on the Loess Plateau
along the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has protected 830,000 square kilometers of land

UNITED NATIONS -- U.S. development of the national missile
defense (NMD) system was criticized at the opening of the Non-
Proliferation Treaty review conference being held at the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
Sha Zukang, head of the Chinese delegation to the conference,
said the development of the NMD system by "a certain military
power" will bring severe damage to the integrity and vitality of
the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty concluded in 1972 by
Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The move will undermine the global strategic balance and
stability and inevitably harm the basis for the U.S-Russia
bilateral nuclear disarmament, and impede the international
nuclear disarmament process, shaking the prerequisite and basis
for international nuclear non-proliferation, Ambassador Sha said.

UNITED NATIONS -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright
defended her country's policy at a U.N. Nuclear Non-Proliferation
(NPT) Treaty Review Conference, assuring the critics of U.S.
commitment to a world free of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
At the opening session of the month-long conference, Albright
said she and President Bill Clinton were convinced that America
would ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate rejected the CTBT last October, becoming the
first and only legislature of any state to reject the treaty. It
was widely seen as a heavy blow to the world's non-proliferation
process. The failure, coupled with the U.S. efforts to develop and
deploy a national missile defense system, triggered off sharp
criticism from many countries and non-governmental organizations.

<P>
China pursues a policy of not endorsing, encouraging or
engaging in nuclear weapons proliferation, neither will it assist
other countries in developing nuclear weapons nor provide any
assistance to the nuclear facilities not subject to the safeguards
of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Ambassador Sha
Zukang said.
</P>
<P>
The month-long conference opened Monday is to review the
implementation in the past five years of the Non-Proliferation
Treaty (NPT) reached in 1970 with 187 signatories now.
</P>
<P>
China has been abided by the three principles of nuclear export,
i.e., nuclear export is conducted only for peaceful purposes and
subject to IAEA safeguards, and the receiving party shall not make
a transfer to the third country without China's permission, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Further explaining China's position on non-proliferation, Sha
said more efforts should be made to establish a global security
environment of stability, cooperation and mutual trust, which will
constitute the basic guarantee for the prevention of nuclear
proliferation.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, he said, the prerequisite for the success of nuclear
non-proliferation should be the abolishment of the double or multi-
standards in the field of nuclear non-proliferation.
</P>
<P>
Sha also noted that the only correct and effective way to solve
non-proliferation is to enhance international cooperation and
common efforts within a framework of collective security.
</P>
<P>
Any trend or action of unilateralism runs counter to the main
tide of the non-proliferation efforts, the Chinese official said.

<HEADLINE> Persons Responsible for Major Coal Mine Accident Dealt With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Twelve persons who were found
responsible for a major coal mine accident last January in the
city of Xuzhou in east China's Jiangsu Province, were dealt with
recently according to law.
</P>
<P>
On January 11, the Dahuangshan Coal Mine under the Xuzhou
Mining Administration was inundated by underground water, and 63
workers became trapped 400 to 500 meters underground, 22 of whom
were later killed. Direct economic losses from the accident were
estimated at 2.78 million yuan (about 334,939 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
An group of investigators made up of provincial labor bureau,
the coal mine administrative office, and the public security
bureau reached the conclusion based on extensive investigations
that the tragedy was caused by inaccurate hydrological data and
dereliction of duty.
</P>
<P>
Among the 12 who were punished, Zhang Jun, a coal mine
technician, was found responsible for failing to report head-on
water discharging signs in time, which led to a delay in the
withdrawal of miners working underground, and eventually led to
the tragedy. Zhang has been handed over to a local judicial
department for holding criminal responsibility in the accident.
</P>
<P>
Pei Daoqi and Liu Maode, two workers with the geological
section of the Dahuangshan Coal Mine, were found responsible for
failing to provide accurate hydrological data. Pei was expelled
from the coal mine, and Liu was given a disciplinary sanction.
</P>
<P>
The coal mine, with 5,000 workers, has been shut down and
production has ceased. All the workers will be shifted elsewhere,
and arrangements for their future work are being carried out, said
local sources.

<HEADLINE> Tibet's Tourism Heating Up ahead of Labor's Day Vacation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 25 (Xinhua) -- China's Tibet Autonomous Region,
known as the Roof of the World, will become one of China's hottest
tourist destinations during the week-long Labor's Day vacation,
which starts on May 1, according to airlines companies.
</P>
<P>
The China Southwest Airlines which operates fights to the
highest plateau in the world said that all the tickets for the
flights from Shanghai to Tibet on April 30 have been booked out
and more are still demanded even though the company has added more
flights. The week-long holiday is expected to further boost the
demand, an official with the airlines said.
</P>
<P>
All major tourist agencies in China have offered various
package tours to Tibet to meet the increasing needs.
</P>
<P>
Tibet has remained a mysterious land even to many domestic
travelers. The number of tourists to Tibet amounted to 340,000
last year, an increase of 17.3 percent over the previous year,
with the number of foreign tourists for the first time exceeding
100,000.

<HEADLINE> Wilkens Resigns as Atlanta Hawks Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Lenny Wilkens, who holds the
record for most victories by an NBA coach, resigned from his post
with the Atlanta Hawks on Monday after enduring the worst season
of his 27-year coaching career.
</P>
<P>
The Hawks announced the resignation of the Hall of Fame coach
at an afternoon news conference, saying they were seeking a
younger coach to direct a rebuilding team.
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old Wilkens had two years remaining on his Hawks
contract.
</P>
<P>
The Hawks finished the 1999-2000 campaign with a miserable 28-
54 record, their worst season since the club moved to Atlanta in
1968.
</P>
<P>
Wilkens, who coached Seattle to an NBA championship in 1979,
owns a career coaching record of 1,179-981, including a 310-232
record in seven years with the Hawks.
</P>
<P>
Wilkens, who has also coached Portland and Cleveland, was
elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame as a player and a coach,
making him the only double inductee from the NBA.
</P>
<P>
He was voted to the list of the NBA's 50 Greatest Players in
1996 and later was named one of the NBA's 10 Greatest Coaches.

<HEADLINE> Nature Reserve To Protect Egrets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- A nature reserve to protect
egrets has been created in Shibanya Village in the Banan District
of southwest China's Chongqing Municipality.
</P>
<P>
The local government has invested 100,000 yuan (12,048 U.S.
dollars) for the An Lan Egret Bird Nature Reserve, which is
expected to become an ecological tourist zone within three years,
according to the district's deputy director Lu Wei.
</P>
<P>
Unlike other nature reserves, this one was built on the basis
of a bird park initiated by local farmers.
</P>
<P>
The number of wild egrets in the village has increased from
about 100 eight years ago to the present 30,000.
</P>
<P>
An official from the local forestry department attributes this
achievement to 59-year-old farmer Wen Shihua, who launched a bird
protection drive eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
Wen's determination to save the birds resulted in the expansion
of the village's bird habitat area to over 50 mu (3.3 hectares).
</P>
<P>
Beginning last year, the local government has been allocating a
certain fund each year to compensate 14 households whose bamboo
forests -- their main source of income -- have become bird havens.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing now has three nature reserves for the protection of
egrets and 260 other bird species.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Coast Hotel Destroyed by Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A new hotel, the Garoda Coral
Beach Hotel, on Kenya's North Coast was destroyed by fire over the
weekend, media here reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The blaze, fanned by strong winds, raged through 25 private
villas plus 13 hotel rooms and other cottages, burning down
property valued at more than 5.7 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Garoda Coral Beach Hotel, a sister hotel of the Blue Bay
Village, Watamu, was ready to open at any time.
</P>
<P>
The fire started when burning garbage was blown onto the roofs
of the buildings, the police said, adding that they fought the
fire for more than five hours before giving up the struggle.
</P>
<P>
The police warned local residents to be careful when burning
garbage to avoid accidental spread of fires, especially during the
dry season.
</P>
<P>
The full extent of the losses could not be established
immediately because the manager of the hotel and the villa owners
are still abroad, the police said.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus against Direct EU Funding of Turkish Cypriot Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Any bicommunal projects and any
funds for such projects will have to have the consent of Cyprus
government, government spokesman Michalis Papapetrou said here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also stressed that funding must not, directly or
indirectly, give rise to recognition of the Turkish Cypriot regime
in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou made the remarks in response to press reports that
European Union (EU) funds will find their way to the Turkish
Cypriot community via means that could be tantamount to recognition
of the northern regime of the island.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou said work is already underway to set up an office in
Brussels of non-governmental organizations and to contribute to the
sewerage system of wider Nicosia, including the northern part
controlled by Turkish Cypriots and the southern part dominated by
Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
"All projects that may materialize and all funds to be allocated
will go ahead with the consent of the Republic of Cyprus,"
Papapetrou said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island after a failed coup seeking union with
Athens.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared a republic in
northern Cyprus in 1983 which is recognized only by Turkey, against
the internationally acknowledged Republic of Cyprus dominated by
the Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou explained that EU funds are allocated to the Planning
Bureau of Cyprus government and whenever the Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash has refused to receive funds for the Turkish Cypriot
community, these were placed in the Bureau's account at the Central
Bank for safe-keeping and have remained unused.
</P>
<P>
The EU has repeatedly said it negotiates with governments and
not entities or regimes. Denktash, in his bid to gain international
recognition of his breakaway entity, declines any funds coming
through the government of Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> Australia Supports Peaceful Solution to Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- An Australian minister expressed
the hope here Tuesday that a lasting and workable peaceful solution
will be found to the Cyprus issue, the Cyprus News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Australian Federal Minister of Justice and Customs, Senator
Amanda Vanstone, arrived here Monday night for a brief visit to
meet with men and women serving in the Australian Federal Police
Contingent with the U.N. peace-keeping force in Cyprus (UNFICYP).
</P>
<P>
The Australian police contingent numbers 20 persons and has been
on the island for the past 36 years since the island was divided
following the invasion of Turkish troops in the wake of a pro-
Greece coup.
</P>
<P>
Vanstone attended an Australian police function Tuesday morning
at UNFICYP headquarters and later met with Cyprus Minister of
Justice and Public Order Nicos Koshis.
</P>
<P>
The Australian minister praised Cyprus for its effort to curb
money laundering and combat drug trafficking, which she said are
international crimes that do not recognize borders and therefore
need an extraordinary degree of international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Vanstone is due to leave Wednesday morning.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Ministry Frowns at Closure of Reformist Papers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Ministry of Culture and
Islamic Guidance on Tuesday said the closure of reformist papers by
the conservative-controlled judiciary would damage the atmosphere
of press freedom in the country.
</P>
<P>
The ministry, led by press freedom advocator Ataollah
Mohajerani, issued an official communique urging government
branches to avoid taking any measures that might restrict the
constitutional freedom of the press.
</P>
<P>
As constitutional supervisor over publications in the country,
the ministry also called on different political camps to create a
healthy press environment in stead of stigmatizing each other, the
official IRNA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Refuting allegations that reformist papers are engaged in "mass
manipulation" and catering to the readers, the ministry hinted that
this is also the practice of the conservative press.
</P>
<P>
When necessary, the ministry would publish the result of its
investigations, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
The judiciary has ordered the closure of 13 reformist dailies
and periodicals in the past two days, accusing them of violating
Islamic sanctities and principles.
</P>
<P>
The move was meant to curb the growing reformist movement
fostered by President Mohammed Khatami, whose allies won an
overwhelming victory over their conservative opponents in
February's parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
The closure of papers was condemned by many, including the
Association of Journalists and the Islamic Commission of Human
Rights.
University students from major cities took to the streets on
Tuesday to protest the closure and "defend the freedom of speech,"
IRNA reported.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Protests Flag-Burning Incidents in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Turkey on Tuesday protested against
the burning of Turkish national flags by Armenians in front of its
diplomatic premises in Greece one day ago, the Anatolia News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Foreign Ministry early Tuesday summoned Danae
Koumanakou, charge d'affaires of the Greek Embassy in Ankara, over
the incidents and demanded that the Greek government take necessary
measures to prevent the repetition of similar incidents.
</P>
<P>
Some 100-150 Armenians staged a demonstration in front of the
Turkish Embassy in Athens on Monday and burned the Turkish national
flags in protest against the alleged genocide of Armenians by the
Ottoman Empire about 80 years ago.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, nearly 200 Armenians also burnt Turkish flags
in front of the Turkish Consulate General in the northern Greek
province of Thessaloniki.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Foreign Ministry issued a statement Tuesday condemning
the incidents.
</P>
<P>
"We consider all attacks targeting the flag, which is a national
symbol of every country, as unacceptable. We condemn yesterday's
demonstrations," said the statement signed by Foreign Ministry
spokesman Panos Beglitis.
</P>
<P>
Armenians claim that 1.5 million Armenians were killed between
1915 and 1923 by the then Turkish Ottoman Empire as part of a
genocidal campaign aimed to drive the Armenian population out of
what now is eastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey maintains that there was no such systematic slaughter and
that many Armenians fled the country of their own choice due to war
and civil unrest.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sezer Enjoys Support of Turkish Parties for Presidency by Xing Guoxin and Huai Chengbo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Turkish
Constitutional Court Ahmet Necdet Sezer, who was chosen as the
presidential candidate by leaders of the three ruling parties, has
garnered favor of various parties on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tansu Ciller, the main opposition True Path Party (DYP) leader,
hailed Sezer as "a worthy candidate for presidency with his honest
and reliable character" at her party's parliamentary group meeting
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
DYP deputies who attended the meeting also expressed their
support for Sezer, but they expressed doubts about the sincerity of
the coalition partners, adding that presidential election was a
highly sensitive process that requires a strong political will and
honesty.
</P>
<P>
They recalled that DYP gave support to the constitutional
amendment submitted by the ruling coalition for President Suleyman
Demirel' second term in office, but it failed in votes because of
defections of many deputies from the ruling partner Motherland
Party.
</P>
<P>
Ciller met with Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit on the day to
express her party's doubts on how determined the coalition parties
are in their support for their common candidate.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Recai Kutan, leader of the opposition Virtue
Party (FP), said that his party was ready to support Sezer in the
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting with Ecevit, Kutan said that the FP was in
favor of finalizing the presidential elections before it turns into
a crisis. "We want parties to reach an agreement on the issue to
elect the new president as soon as possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Islamic party leader seemed generous toward Sezer, who
voted for closing the Islamic Welfare Party by the Constitutional
Court in 1998, saying that "we left the past behind and concentrate
on the future."
</P>
<P>
He foresaw that Sezer may be elected as the next president even
in the first round of votes if the coalition partners are sincere
in their agreement, stressing that the FP will give full supports
for him.
</P>
<P>
The Parliamentary Advisory Committee decided to hold the first
round of presidential elections on Thursday. According to the
Constitution, a candidate who gets two-thirds of the votes of all
deputies, or 367 out of the 550-seat parliament, can be elected as
president.
</P>
<P>
The ruling partner Motherland Party (ANAP) Chairman Mesut Yilmaz
called on his deputies to extend "full support" to Sezer after the
presiding judge of the Constitutional Court emerged as the joint
candidate of coalition parties.
</P>
<P>
Addressing his Democratic Left Party (DSP) deputies meeting,
Ecevit said that no one should have any suspicions about Sezer's
loyalty to secular and democratic state of law.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the leaders of five big political parties in
Parliament reached a consensus on their joint presidential
candidate, who analysts predicted could be elected to office during
the first round of balloting.

<HEADLINE> Study: U.S. Aid to Poor Nations Heads for Record Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Development aid from the
United States to other nations, as a share of the domestic economy,
is on course to tie a post-World War II low in 2001, according to
a new study released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The study, Trends in U.S. Development Aid and the Current
Budget Debate, which was published by the Center on Budget and
Policy Priorities, also said that the U.S. foreign aid will soon
reach a half-century low as a share of government spending as well.
</P>
<P>
The study finds that under the latest Clinton administration
budget, not only would aid in fiscal year 2001 ties a post-World
War II low by one key measure, but it would decline further in
subsequent years. This would occur even though the United States
already spends a much smaller portion of its resources on aid than
any other comparable country.
</P>
<P>
The administration's budget request for spending on development
aid for fiscal year 2001 is only 0.11 percent of the U.S. economy,
tied for the lowest percentage on record. The amount of aid
requested would be 0.6 percent of federal expenditures next year,
a lower figure than throughout the 1962-97 period.
</P>
<P>
Under the administration's budget, development aid measured as
either a share of the economy or as a share of the budget would
reach recorded new lows by fiscal year 2003.
</P>
<P>
Although the administration has proposed an exceptionally low
level of development aid spending for 2001, Congress is likely to
adopt an even-lower figure, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Congressional budget resolution approved April 13 sets a
target figure for overall international affairs spending that is
significantly smaller than the Clinton administration's proposal,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has established a target that donor nations
should provide in aid to poor countries of 0.7 percent of the
donor nation's gross domestic product. So far, only four European
nations exceeded this goal in 1997-98. The United States, however,
contributed less than one seventh of the target.

<HEADLINE> Russia Defends ABM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The compliance with the ABM Treaty in its present form without
any modifications is a prerequisite for further negotiations on
nuclear disarmament," Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told a
U.N. conference to review the implementation of the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).
</P>
<P>
The NPT, seen as a cornerstone in arms reduction treaties, went
into force in 1970. It bars nuclear weapon states from
transferring nuclear weapons to non-nuclear-weapon states and
prohibits non-nuclear-weapon states from manufacturing and
receiving such arms.
</P>
<P>
Signatories to the NPT, now numbering 187, meet every five
years to review progress and set new objectives. The 2000 review,
which opened Monday, is the first of its kind since the treaty
became indefinite in the 1995 review.
</P>
<P>
There is "a dangerous tendency" to undermine the existing
system of strategic stability and there are attempts to build
national stability at the expense of other states, said Ivanov,
referring to the development of the National Missile Defense (NMD)
system by the U.S., the largest nuclear power with the most
advanced nuclear weapons in the world.
</P>
<P>
"The collapse of the ABM Treaty would, therefore, undermine
the entirety of disarmament agreements concluded over the last 30
years," he warned.
</P>
<P>
According to the indefinite ABM Treaty, the U.S. and Russia are
committed to not manufacturing, testing or deploying anti-
ballistic missiles in any environment.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. NMD system, which aims at protecting the U.S.
territory from any ballistic missile attacks, has been criticized
by Russia as a move running against the ABM and challenging
international strategic stability.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said Russia is prepared "to engage in the broadest
consultations" on the ABM issue with the U.S. and multilaterally.
</P>
<P>
Russia, the second biggest nuclear power, has threatened to
withdraw from strategic arms reduction talks (START II) with the U.
S. if Washington would go ahead with NMD deployment.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Moscow is resolved "to pursue a stage-by-
stage and integral progress" of all nuclear powers towards nuclear
disarmament "without any artificial delays or undue hurry."

<HEADLINE> White House Briefed on Microsoft Antitrust Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Antitrust lawyers from the U.S.
Justice Department were summoned to the White House Tuesday to
brief President Bill Clinton's legal and economic advisers about a
range of options for dealing with Microsoft Corp., including
splitting up the software giant.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports said that attorneys for the Justice
Department and the 19 states that successfully sued Microsoft for
antitrust violations are considering ways to break up the company
as a method to curb anticompetitive practices.
</P>
<P>
One reported option would be to split the company into two or
three parts, each selling separate products, such as the Windows
operating system and Internet content. Another alternative would
be for Microsoft to divest its popular Office software.
</P>
<P>
The government and the states have the option of filing
separate recommendations, but both sides hope to turn in a single
proposal. Each has until Friday to submit proposed remedies to U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who ruled on April 3 that
Microsoft illegally used its dominance in the operating systems
market to hurt competition. The ruling came after a 78-day trial
that began in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft officials have said they will appeal Judge Jackson's
ruling and expect to prevail. They have rejected a breakup, saying
that such a remedy reaches far beyond the evidence presented in
the trail.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing in the trial record or in this case that
would justify such an extreme and radical remedy," Microsoft
spokesman Jim Cullinan said Monday. "This would be bad for
Microsoft, consumers and the entire industry."
</P>
<P>
A court hearing to consider remedies has been scheduled for May
24.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft has until May 10 to respond to the government's
proposal, but it may ask for an extension depending on the
remedies requested.
</P>
<P>
If the Justice Department calls for breaking up Microsoft, it
would be the agency's first such action since the 1974 antitrust
suit against AT&AMP;T Corp. that led to the breakup of the telephone
giant.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft has already made clear that it will appeal the ruling
against it. The case is considered likely to end up before the
Supreme Court.

During March 11, 340 decisions were taken by immigration
officers - four times the number being dealt with at the end of
last year.
</P>
<P>
The figures, which come after Home Secretary Jack Straw said
the government's reform of the asylum system was working, also
showed that the number of claims processed is also up on the 7,865
applications dealt with in February.
</P>
<P>
They also reveal an increase in the number of people seeking
asylum in the UK, with 6,680 applications for asylum in March -up
from 6,110 in February.
</P>
<P>
Applications averaged 6,300 over the last three months, 36
percent higher than the monthly average for the same period in
1999.
</P>
<P>
Most came from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia - Kosovo,
Montenegro and Serbia - followed by Sri Lanka, China, Afghanistan
and Somalia.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 percent of applications were refused, with 19
percent either accepted as refugees or given "exceptional leave"to
stay in the country.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the number of cases processed means the backlog
has fallen to below 100,000 for the first time this year and now
stands at 93,365.

<HEADLINE> Brazil to Increase Exports of Telecommunication Equipment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's exports of
telecommunication equipment for Latin America are growing in
relation to exchange devaluation and the increasing demand for new
products in the region.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister of development, industry and foreign
trade, in this year's first two months, exports of transmitters,
receptors and components registered an increase of 196.7 percent
compared to the same period of last year, reaching 224.3 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Total value of external sales in 1999 was 759.8 million,
increasing by 24.8 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
External sales in the sector are believed to be registering an
even bigger growth, as big manufacturers established in the
country, like Motorola, Ericsson, Siemens, Lucent Technologies and
Samsung, are investing in their production lines or picking up the
fruits of investments made last year.
</P>
<P>
The greater part of these external sales is made up by cellular
telephones. Last year, 1.23 million cellulars were exported.
Infrastructure equipment is also exported, such as radiobase
stations and commuting centrals.
</P>
<P>
Argentina is the main market for telecommunication equipment
made in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, in the first two months of this year,
transmitting and reception equipment was the main article of
exports to Argentina, with sales of 61.9 million dollars and a
growth of 507.8 percent above 1999's same period.

<P>
The wide ranging safety problems are "too big to be solved by
one organization so we formed partnerships with businesses as well
as private and governmental organizations", President of the
National Safety Council Jerry Scannel said.
</P>
<P>
The council estimated that 52,000 people died and 14.5 million
were injured in accidents at home and in public places in the
United States in 1999, up 21 percent since 1992. Falls were the
primary cause of death and injury, especially for older adults.
</P>
<P>
The organization said it is working with the American
Association of Retired Persons to work on preventing falls and
encourage the development of safer home design.
</P>
<P>
An average of 14 people are killed in the workplace every day,
it noted.
</P>
<P>
The council said it is working with the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration and National Institute for Occupational
Safety and Health to expand the use of better safety practices at
work.
</P>
<P>
On the road, where nearly 41,000 deaths occurred in 1999, the

<HEADLINE> South Africa, China United by Common Resolve: Mbeki </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRETORIA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- South African President Thabo
Mbeki said here on Tuesday that his country and China are united
by a common resolve to build a better life for themselves.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said at a banquet he hosted in honor of visiting Chinese
President Jiang Zemin: "We are at one in the commitment to ensure
that we build that better life in conditions of freedom and
peace."
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa is determined to work with China to
achieve this objective while simultaneously contributing to the
strengthening of South- South cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said he was confident that the Pretoria declaration
signed by the two countries earlier on Tuesday "will form the
necessary foundation to guide our work in this regard and further
to strengthen and enhance our already close, constructive
partnership."
</P>
<P>
The president recalled the past two years since South Africa
and China established diplomatic relations, saying the two
countries "have established a wide range of substantive relations
and the bilateral agreements we signed today will give further
concrete meaning to the relationship we are building between our
two countries and peoples."
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to the China-Africa Cooperation Forum
Ministerial Conference which you will be hosting in October of
this year," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that this initiative represents a major building
block of the mutually beneficial partnership between Africa and
China, a partnership that will help all of us in Africa as we
continue the difficult struggle for the success of the African
renaissance," mbeki added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Tuesday, Mbeki met with Jiang to discuss a wide
range of regional and international issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Jiang arrived in South Africa on Monday for a state visit.
South Africa is the last leg of his five-nation tour of Asia,

<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Experts attending the first ever
African Summit on Roll Back Malaria here on Tuesday urged African
leaders to pay greater attention to the roles played by
traditional medicines in preventing and curing the deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
Edugie Abebe, Nigerian medical expert and the summit's manager,
said at a news conference that the registration of traditional
medicine practitioners must be facilitated in order to integrate
them into the "mainstream way" fight against the disease.
</P>
<P>
"So I call on practitioners with remedies that can help in the
eradication of malaria to come and let us carry out research to
verify their claims,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Abebe, the World Health Organization (WHO) has
established a department to coordinate the practice of traditional
medicine.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the conference, David Nabarowo, a WHO
representative, said that the organization is taking pains in
looking into other ways of curing the disease as some kinds of
malaria were becoming resistant to drugs.

<HEADLINE> War Veterans, White Farmers in Zimbabwe Urged to Live in Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Acting Lands and
Agriculture Minister Joyce Mujuru Tuesday said there should be a
peaceful co-existence of the war veterans and the white farmers
while a peaceful solution is being worked out.
</P>
<P>
She told a press conference to mark the opening of this year's
tobacco marketing season that such a co-existence would allow
cropping programs to continue.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the war veterans and the white
farmers agreed during a recent meeting with President Robert
Mugabe to make consultations in finding a solution to the land
crisis which had caused the former freedom fighter invading
white-owned farms willy-nilly.
</P>
<P>
Mujuru commended tobacco farmers for producing good quality
crop and hoped that this would encourage merchants to pay fair
prices that would encourage farmers to continue growing the crop.
</P>
<P>
"Farmers should continue to do their pre-planting for tobacco
and wheat winter crops while consultations between farmers and war
veterans continue," she said.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco auction will start on Wednesday and about 220 million
kilograms of flue cured are expected to be sold this season
against last season's 196 million kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco is Zimbabwe's biggest foreign currency earner. It
earned about 500 million U.S. dollars for the country during the
last season.

<HEADLINE> Former Rwandan General Moved to U.N. Genocide Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Augustine Ndindiliyimana,
former Chief of Staff of Rwanda's para-military police forces
(Gendarmerie Nationale), has been transferred from Belgium to a
United Nations court in northern Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
A statement of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda
(ICTR) available on Tuesday said that Ndindiliyimana was brought
to the Tribunal's Detention Facility in Arusha last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ndindiliyimana, arrested in the Belgian town of Termonde on
January 29 on the basis of a warrant of arrest issued by the ICTR,
is to answer to 10 counts charging him with genocide, crimes
against humanity and violations of the Geneva Conventions.
</P>
<P>
He is alleged to have participated in planning and preparing
the massacre of about 500,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus in Rwanda
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The 57-year-old former general was also charged with sexual
violence and rape of Tutsi women.
</P>
<P>
"It is further alleged that General Ndindiliyimana and other
senior government and army officials failed to prevent or punish
the perpetrators when elements of the Gendarmerie, the Rwandan
Army and the Interahamwe (militia men) carried out the massacre of
Tutsis," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Born in 1943 in Nyaruhengeri commune, Butare Prefecture,
Ndindiliyimana was appointed to the position of Chief of Staff of
the Gendarmerie Nationale on September 2, 1992.
</P>
<P>
The ICTR, created on November 8, 1994 by the United Nations
Security Council Resolution 955, has the mandate to try persons
suspected to be responsible for genocide and other serious
violations of the international humanitarian law committed in the
territory of Rwanda between January 1 and December 31, 1994.
</P>
<P>
It also has the mandate to try Rwandan citizens responsible for
such violations committed in the territory of neighboring states
during the 100- day massacre which claimed more than 500,000
civilians, mostly the ethnic Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
The ICTR has so far issued 29 indictments against 50
individuals and a total of 44 indicted individuals are in custody,
including several former senior cabinet ministers in the Interim
Government of Rwanda of 1994, former military commanders,
political leaders, journalists and senior businessmen.
</P>
<P>
The five detainees who have already been convicted by the Trial
Chambers of the Tribunal are still held in Arusha, pending outcome
of their appeals, but are kept apart from the other detainees to
whom the presumption of innocence applies.
</P>
<P>
Three of the convicts including former Prime Minister of Rwanda
Jean Kambanda and former Prefect of Kibuye Clement Kayishema have
been sentenced to imprisonment for life.
</P>
<P>
Businessmen Obed Ruzindana and Omar Serushago were sentenced to
25 years and 15 years of imprisonment, respectively.

WASHINGTON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senate Republicans
criticized Attorney General Janet Reno Tuesday for the forceful
seizure of Cuban boy Elian Gonzalez from his Miami relatives and
said they would hold hearings on the raid Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A Senate delegation led by Majority leader Trent Lott held a
two-hour closed-door meeting with Reno on Capital Hill.
</P>
<P>
"I felt like a number of questions were not adequately
answered, particularly why did they use this force on that
particular day," Lott told reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps we may get a clearer answer to some of these questions
in a public hearing," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lott said the Senate Judiciary Committee would hold hearings
soon and may call government officials, lawyers and members of the
Gonzalez family to testify.
</P>
<P>
Florida Republican Senator Connie Mack also said that he was "
horrified that our government would use armed force in a family
home to remove a 6-year-old child at gunpoint."
</P>
<P>
Elian has stayed together with his father Juan Miguel at
Andrews Air Force base outside Washington since Saturday and they
will shift to an estate at Wye River east of Washington.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Whisky Exports Up 11.6 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Whisky exports rose to
622 million Canadian dollars (about 421 million U.S. dollars) in
1999, up 11.6 percent from 557 million Canadian dollars (about 377
million U.S. dollars) in 1998, the Association of Canadian
Distillers announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
That was the 4th consecutive year of growth for the country's
Whisky exports, which are being targeted at a goal of 1 billion
Canadian dollars (about 677 million U.S. dollars) by the year 2005,
said the association.
</P>
<P>
Whisky exports approached the 20 million case mark in 1999,
accounting for nearly 85 percent of the country's production.
</P>
<P>
The United States has been one of the dominant markets for
Canadian Whisky exports. U.S. consumers are buying more Canadian
Whisky than American Bourbon Whisky or Scotch and Irish Whiskies
combined, the association said.
</P>
<P>
Under a multi-year "Enhanced Export Development Program", "the
goal for 2000 is to continue to broaden our export base beyond the
strong American market," said Jan Westcott, president of the
association.

<P>
ROME, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Edo Ronchi, the Italian minister for
the environment in the outgoing government, turned down Italian
Premier-designate Giuliano Amato's offer to take over European
Union policy Minister in the new cabinet in a letter to the
premier-designate made public late Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Ronchi said he thought it was a "serious mistake
" to remove the environment portfolio from the Greens but went on
to"confirm, however, my parliamentary support and best wishes for
the success of your government."
</P>
<P>
Amato nominated 24 ministers in presidential palace Tuesday
evening, and he moved Ronchi to ministry of European Union policy,
and nominated Willer Bordon to hold the job of environment in the
cabinet
</P>
<P>
Amato point out that he succeeded in trimming portfolios from
25 to 24 by combining the industry with foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
The premier-designate also noted that this government has two
technicians, and they can be easily recognized by their names. One
is Professor Tullio De Mauro, tapped for education, and the other
is Doctor Umberto Veronesi, a leading oncologist given the public
health portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Amato's confidence test is expected to come Thursday in the
Lower House and calculations indicate that he will be able to
count on fewer than 320 votes against 297 for the opposition
Freedom Front, with another nine deputies wavering and talking
abstention.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Cuban Boy Elian Gonzalez and
his family moved Tuesday from Andrews Air Force base outside
Washington to an estate at Wye River, site of 1998 Israeli-
Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said they were relocated
to the new site, about an hour's drive east of Washington, to
await court action over whether Elian should be allowed to return
to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Rubin also announced that four playmates of Elian will be
allowed to come from Cuba to visit him for about two weeks.
</P>
<P>
A teacher and cousin of Elian are expected to fly to the United
States on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Elian stayed together with his father Juan Miguel, his
stepmother and baby brother at Andrews Air Force Base since the
federal government snatched him forcefully from the Miami home of
his relatives Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls on U.S. Media to Allow Elian Family to Heal Wounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking at an event at the White House, Clinton also praised
Attorney General Janet Reno for the raid that took Elian from his
relatives in Miami Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Now that they have been safely reunited, I believe it is time
for all of us, including the media and those of us in public life,
to give this family the space it needs to heal its wounds and
strengthen its bonds, to work to lesson the pressure on them as
the matter goes forward in the courts," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"The thing that really matters now is that little boy and his
life and his family, and I think at least for the next several
days the less we all say about it and the more time he has to
breathe the air of a normal life, the better," he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the raid ordered by Reno Saturday, Clinton praised
the attorney general. "They had a very, very difficult job to do
with no easy choices, and I am grateful that they were able to
safely reunite the young boy with his father," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, the U.S. State Department announced that it
will allow four playmates of the Cuban boy, Elian Gonzalez, to
come from Cuba to visit him here for about two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a regular briefing, State Department spokesman
James Rubin said visa requests from the four will be dealt with on
an expedited basis once they are received. One adult will be
permitted to accompany each child.
</P>
<P>
The department issued visas almost three weeks ago to Elian's
former kindergarten teacher, a pediatrician and a male cousin,
Rubin noted.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. federal government seized the six-year-old Cuban boy
from the home of his Miami relatives in a predawn raid Sunday and
reunited Elian and his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, ending a five-
month standoff between the government and Elian's Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
Despite the happy reunion of the father and son, some U.S.
politicians were critical of the administration's handling of the
case.
</P>
<P>
Defending the government's handling of the case soon after the
raid, Clinton and Reno both indicated that the authorities used
force to remove Elian from his relatives in Miami after they
refused to surrender the boy voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
Elian, his step mother, his father and his half brother have
been staying at a residence at nearby Andrews Air Force Base. They
plan to move shortly to the Wye Plantation, located in a secluded
area on Maryland's Eastern Shore, while awaiting court action over
whether Elian should stay in the U.S. or return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Elian was rescued on November 25 near a shipwreck in the
Atlantic sea off Florida after his mother and 10 others drowned
when their boat capsized.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Treaty on the Non-
Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) cannot have any credibility
with the states in the Middle East as long as Israel is exempt
from its provisions, Egypt said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the general debate of the 2000 NPT Review
Conference which is held here from April 24 to May 19, Ahmed Aboul
Gheit, permanent representative of Egypt to the United Nations,
said that over the last five year, Egypt had put forward many
proposals on steps to be taken by Israel and the states of the
region with a view to achieving practical progress toward ridding
the Middle East of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Among the steps were the initiation of regional negotiations
on the tenets of the establishment of a nuclear-weapons-free zone
in the Middle East, the declaration by the states of the region of
their commitment to adhere to the international instruments on the
non-proliferation or prohibition of nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons within a specified timeframe and the adoption
by Israel and the states of the region of confidence building
measures in the nuclear field, the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
 "We put forward these and other ideas in the hope of
initiating a positive dialogue that would contribute to breaking
the current impasse and reaffirming the obligation of the Israeli
side to take practical steps for the negotiation on rendering the
region free from nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass
destruction," said the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, Israel did not respond to any of these
endeavors," the ambassador noted.
</P>
<P>
The NPT's credibility with the states of the region can only
be achieved by Israel accepting the commitments which its
neighbors in the region had already accepted in the field of non-
proliferation of nuclear weapons, the ambassador stressed.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador urged the 2000 NPT Review Conference to
consider the following:
</P>
<P>
-- The uniqueness of the situation in the Middle East region
as acknowledged by the 1995 review conference;
</P>
<P>
-- The message of the 2000 NPT Review Conference must be
unequivocal in its demand that Israel accede to the Treaty without
further delay and that it place all its nuclear facilities under
the safeguards regime of the IAEA (International Atomic Energy
Agency);
</P>
<P>
-- The need to achieve the universality of the NPT at the
regional and international levels alike is of essence;
</P>
<P>
-- The responsibility of the Nuclear States and in particular
the States depositories of the Treaty that have cosponsored the
Resolution on the Middle East in 1995 for its implementation and
the realization of all of its objectives in full;
</P>
<P>
-- The need for a mechanism to monitor and follow up the
progress made in the implementation of the 1995 Middle East
Resolution.
</P>
<P>
Opened for signature in 1968, the NPT entered into force in
1970. By January 2000, a total of 187 parties had joined the
Treaty. Four states have chosen to remain outside the Treaty: Cuba,
India, Pakistan and Israel.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved
Tuesday a credit of 35 million U.S. dollars to help Burundi
stabilize its economy.
</P>
<P>
The Emergency Economic Recovery Project will assist the
government in preparing an environment for economic recovery and
restore essential social services to facilitate and support the
ongoing negotiations for peace and reconciliation, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The credit will also support the recovery of the private sector;
finance public expenditures for rehabilitation in health,
education, and agricultural infrastructure; and improve economic
productivity for households affected by the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Since Burundi's internal conflict, progress has been made in
political reconciliation and in establishing security, the bank
said. Social indicators have, however, deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
In light of the ongoing peace process, the worsening poverty
and the emergency, an Interim Strategy Report was prepared by the
World Bank to guide donor assistance over the next 24 months.
</P>
<P>
This strategy proposes a framework for donors to address rising
poverty, taking into consideration the underlying factors and
causes of conflict in Burundi and the triggers leading to repeated
violence. The Emergency Economic Recovery Project is par of the
Interim Strategy.
