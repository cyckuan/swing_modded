 By EDDIE SEFKO  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
The pulse of the golf industry, relentlessly pumping dollar signs
through the veins of the sport for the past five years, skipped a
beat in 1998.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Golf clubs. Everything from Callaway's oversized drivers to
heavy-metal fairway woods to irons with satellite-dish sweet spots.
Every one of them sold poorly this year compared to the retail
surge from 1992 to 1997. Retailers in Houston and everywhere else
felt the cooldown.
</P>
<P>
   So is the golf boom that has enveloped everybody from the
country club to the inner city waning? Are there lean times
forthcoming? Have golf manufacturers glutted the market with their
techno-products? Has everybody in the world bought a Big Bertha and
realized that it doesn't go obsolete in two years?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for the game is that golfers do not go on strike.
Unlike the NBA, there are no owners to lock out the players. Unlike
baseball's 1994 World Series, the Masters will not be wiped out
this year. Titleist will not have to juice up its golf ball to the
point that even topped shots travel home-run length just to get
fans interested again.
</P>
<P>
   In short, some of the foremost authorities in the game believe
golf is enduring a brief downturn _ a correction, to use a
stock-market term. And it is expected to run its course rather
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golf-club sales in the U.S. still are very, very healthy,''
says Ely Callaway, founder of Callaway Golf, which produces the Big
Bertha and Warbird lines of woods and is the world's leader in the
industry. ``The interest in the game, I think, is higher than ever.
And so the future looks good. It's not an out-of-character thing to
see dips in the cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a backlash against us, except among the
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Callaway is far and away the sales leader in the golf-club
market. The Carlsbad, Calif.-based company did $843 million in
business in 1997. That was up from $679 million in '96. Those
figures were unheardof in the golf business previously.
</P>
<P>
   Sales figures for 1998 are expected to be slightly below those
of the previous year, and Callaway's stock price has plummeted from
a high of almost $34 this year to $10.50 at Tuesday's close. But
Callaway still will have greater sales than its four nearest
competitors combined.
</P>
<P>
   When Callaway laid off 700 employees last month, it sent shock
waves through the golf and business communities. Not that cutbacks
are unusual in any business. Lynx went bankrupt and was absorbed by
another company. There have been cutbacks at TaylorMade, Zevo and
others. Everybody is feeling the pinch caused by a downturn in
sales and an increase in costs. Reductions in the work force are
the result.
</P>
<P>
   But when the industry leader must restructure, it's news.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people are saying that we're down _ and we're saying
we're down, too,'' total sales will not have fallen far from the
firm's previous peak year, Callaway says. ``No other golf-club
manufacturer has ever been within $300 million of that total.
That's not bad for a down year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to the rest of corporate America, our downturn is
nothing. Boeing is laying off 50,000 workers. Exxon is merging, and
that will eliminate about 9,000 jobs. You can't read about any
business without hearing about belts being tightened.''
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Jack Nicklaus. His Golden Bear line of golf equipment
was no different than the rest of the industry this year, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like everybody else, we got murdered this year,''
Nicklaus says. ``Our inventory is backlogged, just like all other
golf-equipment people. And we're having to do a lot of conserving
to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's like everything else. It'll go through this cycle and
make its way back up. It's the old story: You can't keep bringing
out a new model of club every six months. The average player is
saying, `Why am I buying five or six different clubs for the same
shot?' It's a tough business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Callaway. They said titanium was the only way to go,
and now they've got stainless steel back in their inventory. But
Callaway is a good company, and they'll be back, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Callaway isn't abandoning its philosophy that titanium
is better and bigger is better.
</P>
<P>
   Though the company's new Steelhead fairway woods were labeled as
a departure from its Big Bertha meal ticket, Callaway says the
Steelheads were meant to replace and improve upon the Warbirds.
And, in fact, new advertising that hits the racks in magazines this
week will remind golfers that the Steelhead actually has a larger
clubhead than the Warbirds did.
</P>
<P>
   ``People look at the Steelhead and think it's a smaller
replacement of the Warbird,'' Callaway says. ``Some of our
competitors are going on a design trend of shallower faces and
smaller clubheads.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our opinion that bigger is still better. We're not
getting any smaller. Our competitors are. That's fine. Let 'em go.
We like that. We led the way into Titanium woods with the Great Big
Bertha. But, contrary to what Cobra and some other companies
believe, steel is not dead. We've never said it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same thing being said by all our competitors now,
that smaller heads and slightly smaller heads are the way to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're saying that's not the way to go _ if you want to go
Callaway. That's just a difference of opinion. Steelhead is the
replacement for the Big Bertha Warbird, and it's a slightly bigger
clubhead. We've done a bum job getting that word out. But you'll
see by the end of January that the message we need to get out will
be entirely cleared up.''
</P>
<P>
   Callaway Golf's 1998 wasn't impacted strictly by the soft market
for golf clubs. The company had to wage another fight as well.
</P>
<P>
   With roughly 30 percent of its business overseas (and most of
that in Japan), when the bottom fell out of the Asian economy,
Callaway took a major hit. People just stopped buying luxury items,
and golf clubs are high on that list.
</P>
<P>
   And design costs have jumped radically. There is a reason
Callaway has been the market leader in golf clubs for years. It
spends a lot of money on design research trying to stay ahead of
the competition. And, of course, there are production costs.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is saturation in the market. It's difficult for
any company to market a state-of-the-art product for $350 and then,
a year or two later, come back and say that product now is
obsolete, so you need a new $350 product. What's next, a metal
tennis racket on the tee box?
</P>
<P>
   ``The reasons are pretty well known,'' Callaway says. ``There
was a slowdown at retail in golf equipment, at all price levels.
And by slowdown, we're guessing 10 percent. And we've found in our
case that our competitors have cut prices or pushed sales of
closeouts more than we can ever remember. That affects sales
somewhat.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then another big reason for the downturn has been the
financial turmoil in Southeast Asia, which was something that
nobody could predict. When you have a big business over there, you
suffer. Most of the other companies didn't have as much to lose in
Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority of Callaway's layoffs were in manufacturing. Four
vice presidents and a number of managers also had to hit the
highway. In all of their cases, it had nothing to do with their
performance and everything to do with the outside factors.
</P>
<P>
   But Callaway Golf is far from struggling. In fact, its salvation
may end up being a venture into the competitive world of golf
balls. The company is investing $150 million in creation and
development of a Callaway golf ball.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is sure whether the golf ball will rejuvenate Callaway or
not. The golf-ball market is a $2 billion-a-year business. There's
no denying people use a lot more balls than they do clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be tough,'' Nicklaus predicted. ``The difference
is that they are the established leader in the equipment business.
They won't have that distinction in the ball market. That goes to
Spalding or Titleist or whoever. But the ball business is going to
be a tough one for them to get into.''
</P>
<P>
   Callaway is taking the plunge into the ball market fully aware
that it won't be easy. But by next Christmas, you probably will be
able to put a dozen Callaway balls in somebody's stocking.
</P>
<P>
   But the main focus of Callaway Golf, according to the man
running it, won't change from clubs to balls. The two areas will
coexist. But club design and manufacturing will remain a priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think there's any doubt about it,'' Callaway says.
``We're going to have new and improved products. Steelhead sales
have been terrific, and that's going to continue to be important
for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be a whole different direction for the golf-club
industry. But there will be no mystery about which way Callaway is
going. We have something up our sleeves. We can't say when it's
going to drop out of our sleeves. But Callaway will come up with a
superior product and take advantage of the higher-priced metal-wood
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Are you ready for a metal tennis racket on the tee box?

USC'S MORTON MAKES HIS MARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Chad Morton can recount a variety of roles he has
played at USC, and rarely with much satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   When he first arrived, Morton was primarily known as former
Trojans wide receiver Johnnie Morton's little brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not bad hearing you're Johnnie's little brother, but a
lot of people thought I was only here because of my brother,''
Morton said. And usually, the emphasis was on little. Morton is
5-foot-8 and 185 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   That changed when Morton became the team's defensive specialist.
He bounced between defensive back and free safety, with some spot
tailback duties. Sometimes, Morton could be difficult to locate at
practice, because he worked with the offense and defense on the
same day.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, it was a pretty unsatisfying experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very tough. Even though I got a scholarship, I felt
like I was a walk-on, like I didn't really belong,'' Morton said.
``I didn't feel I was part of the Trojan family yet. I was on the
side and trying to get in. I felt that for my last couple years.''
</P>
<P>
   Morton finally found his niche this season as USC's full-time
tailback. He is just 33 yards shy of gaining 1,000 yards, something
no Trojan has done since Delon Washington in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime during the Sun Bowl, Morton figures to smash the
1,000-yard mark against Texas Christian University. In Morton's
mind, it will be one more accomplishment to show that he has
arrived and that he fit in.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year was my coming-out party,'' Morton said. ``Now, I'm
starting to understand what the Trojan family is like. I didn't
feel like I was part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Morton is small for his position and has overcome
several injuries this season, there are no lingering questions of
whether he truly belongs in the backfield. He's proven his worth by
gaining 967 yards rushing with an average of 5.1 per carry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pound for pound, he might be the best player I've ever
coached,'' USC running backs coach Hue Jackson said. ``He meant as
much to the offense as Chris (Claiborne) meant to our defense.''
</P>
<P>
   As he's become more comfortable with his role with the team,
Morton has become a more secure player. In the past, he might push
himself too hard in practice, worried that another player would
take his job.
</P>
<P>
   When he was bothered by a sore back or sprained ankle earlier in
the season, he would not hesitate to let coaches know he needed
rest, in order to increase his chances of being available for
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm in a position where I have a lot of confidence in
myself,'' Morton said. ``If I'm not feeling up to practicing, I
won't hesitate to tell them.''
</P>
<P>
   The best example occurred before USC's game with Stanford last
month. Although Morton's ankle bothered him, there was some
pressure to get him to practice. Morton held his ground, however,
and did not practice. He did play in the game, and gained a
game-high 87 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big deal for me,'' Morton said. ``My ankle was
sore. Either I could practice during the week and stay injured or I
could not practice but play in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Paul Hackett said Morton probably will never be able
to carry the ball 20-25 times a game, but said Morton can still
influence a game enough even with just 15 carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the contribution he makes to the team in all areas,''
Hackett said. ``There's the leadership and his being captain, then
there's that spin move.''
</P>
<P>
   That ``spin move'' was the juke Morton made against Notre Dame
at the line of scrimmage that turned an apparent no-gain into a
21-yard run which set up the Trojans' touchdown in the 10-0
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything doesn't have to be perfect for Chad to make a
play,'' Jackson said. ``When things weren't exactly the way you
wanted, he could squirt out and make a play.''
</P>
<P>
   Morton also made a big play in practice that week. He became
extremely upset at the end of one session, when the linemen decided
not to do wind sprints because they earned a reward by winning a
team contest the previous week.
</P>
<P>
   Morton was bothered that the linemen would choose practices
during Notre Dame week to rest, instead of waiting until the
less-significant bowl practices began.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just made me so mad. It just hurt,'' Morton said.
</P>
<P>
   Morton's feelings were not ignored. The next day, the line came
back and ran wind sprints.
</P>
<P>
   His competitive spirit causes him to faithfully check the
Pacific-10 stats every week, keeping tabs on how he matched up with
the league's other top running backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll read the thing for about an hour,'' Morton said. ``If I'm
not No.1, I'm just down. I'll be in a bad mood for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   He admitted being ``deeply disappointed'' when he was not
selected to the All-Pacific-10 Conference first or second teams.
Morton was named honorable mention, behind Arizona State's J.R.
Redmond, Arizona's Trung Canidate, Oregon's Reuben Droughns and
Washington State's Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely using this as motivation for next year,''
Morton said. ``I'm not really respected throughout the league. It
really hurt. All that hard work and dedication didn't really get
noticed.''

REPUBLICANS FALL IN LINE, MAKING IMPEACHMENT A NEAR CERTAINTY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs lede graf for updating and rewriting; subs 30th graf for new
quote by Tom DeLay about prospects for impeachment)  (htv) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER and ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton returned to Washington Tuesday
night facing the near certainty that the House of Representatives
would vote to impeach him later this week unless he can find some
extraordinary means to reverse the Republican tide running against
him.
</P>
<P>
   The almost insurmountable problems facing the president became
clear Tuesday as several previously undeclared Republicans
announced that they would vote in favor impeachment on one or more
of the four counts against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The blows came one by one by one throughout the day, as if
choreographed. And on Tuesday it was not the Republicans considered
longshots by the White House who proclaimed their intention to vote
against the president. Rather, the White House lost Republicans who
were considered as possible opponents of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The hemorrhaging of support left the White House pondering
several desperate and unappealing options Tuesday night. All had
their proponents in the White House and in Clinton's circle of
outside advisers. But none of these advisers expressed confidence
that any words or actions by the president could reverse the
momentum at this point.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the situation was still in flux Tuesday evening,
but the president was planning to meet with Rep. Christopher Shays
of Connecticut and other undecided Republicans individually in an
attempt to craft a tough censure option including a fine and an
admission of wrongdoing to keep the last Republicans from
defecting.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democrats said it would be difficult to persuade Clinton
to make a confession of perjury and other offenses that Republicans
are demanding. Clinton has insisted in public that he did not lie
under oath and does not believe he committed perjury.
</P>
<P>
   White House advisers also said the president is weighing an
appeal to the public in a televised address, not to sway Republican
votes but to awaken the public to the stakes and to paint the
impeachment drive as a partisan effort to undo the result of two
national elections. Such a speech would most likely be delivered
only after it was clear that Clinton did not have the votes to
defeat an impeachment resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The White House was also studying two new proposals for an
alternative punishment short of impeachment, one from former Sen.
Bob Dole, the other from Rep. Michael N. Castle, Republican of
Delaware. Both require forthright admissions of wrongdoing by the
president; Castle's proposal also would have Clinton pay a $2
million fine to help cover the cost of the Monica Lewinsky
investigation that formed the basis of the four impeachment
charges.
</P>
<P>
   The most damaging announcement for Clinton came from
Representative Jack Quinn of New York, who for weeks had said that
he would oppose impeachment. On Tuesday he said he had changed his
mind after studying the evidence against the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more I learn about the serious details of perjury and
obstruction of justice, the more I am concerned about the
President's failure to tell the truth under oath,'' Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
   With the Republican announcements Tuesday, the mathematical
possibilities of avoiding impeachment became as unlikely as drawing
an inside card to a royal flush. To prevent 218 votes' being cast
to impeach the president, he would need to win over nearly all the
18 undecided Republicans and hold the support of almost every
Democrat who is wavering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something has to happen to change the dynamic,'' said one
Democrat. ``The math gets tough from here on out. You've got to
walk this back.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Campbell, a California Republican who came out against
Clinton on Tuesday, said, ``It is my judgment that the president
will be impeached by the House of Representatives.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Shays, one of the last undecided Republican House members, is
scheduled to meet with Clinton at the White House on Wednesday.
Shays, a respected moderate, has said that he wants the president
to admit that he lied under oath and accept the legal consequences
of his acts.
</P>
<P>
   Shays is seen as the envoy of the dwindling band of undecided
moderate Republicans who are seeking some final admission from the
president before deciding on their impeachment votes. The White
House beseeched him to bring other undecided Republicans with him
for a session of presidential persuasion, but an official close to
Shays said, ``We're trying. We don't know the result. Chris is very
pessimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   With the time before the decisive House impeachment vote now
counted in hours, White House officials, in public at least,
continued to hold out hope that the tide could somehow turn in the
president's favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it over? Definitely not,'' said Paul Begala, presidential
counselor. ``No vote is certain until it is cast.''
</P>
<P>
   But private assessments were decidedly gloomy, alternating
between anger and a sense of foreboding about Thursday's
impeachment debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll lose,'' one senior adviser to the president
said. ``The real blow was Quinn. He's a very moderate Republican
who was always friendly to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Another adviser, who insisted on anonymity, said that no one at
the White House, from the president on down, had a strategy for
winning the impeachment fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is just at a loss for what it is you do,'' this adviser
said of the president. ``He took the advice to give a speech last
week and it didn't do him any good. He can't understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   The adviser continued glumly, ``My biggest fear is that there
will be a din for resignation after the vote. How do we stop
that?''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Republicans who declared themselves Tuesday were the
ones who had been expected to be Clinton's allies either because
they came from districts in the northeast that had voted for
Clinton, or because they sometimes cross party lines in their
voting. Four of them came from New York, the state that had been
expected to be a Clinton stronghold: Quinn, Michael P. Forbes, John
M. McHugh and Sue W. Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes had signaled to colleagues for weeks that he was going to
support the president. But on Tuesday he said he would vote to
impeach him on all four articles against him. ``I don't think there
is anything more that the president or the White House can do on
this issue,'' he said as he announced his position at a Capitol
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of Campbell, a Stanford University law professor, was
another disappointment for the White House. He is a Republican who
has worked closely with Democrats on campaign finance overhaul and
he had opposed Newt Gingrich as Speaker when he faced his own
ethics controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell had been talking to two Cabinet officers for weeks
seeking some answers from the president that could sway him. But on
Tuesday, in an office crammed with television cameras and with his
voice occasionally trembling, Campbell said he had decided to vote
in favor impeachment based on Clinton's testimony before a federal
grand jury last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my belief that the president did not tell the truth on
several occasions before the federal criminal grand jury,'' he
said, ``having had seven months' advance notice, with his attorney
by his side, being able to stop the questioning at any point.''
</P>
<P>
   He said those lies also carried a fundamental cost in the world
of politics, where business is done with a handshake. ``If he would
not tell the truth under those circumstances, I do not know when I
can trust that he will tell the truth when it is to his political
advantage not to,'' he said. ``And that, in my judgment, seriously
incapacitates him in his abilities to carry out the duties of
president.''
</P>
<P>
   The others who came out for impeachment on Tuesday included:
Nancy L. Johnson of Connecticut, E. Clay Shaw, Jr. of Florida, Fred
Upton of Michigan, Gil Gutknecht of Minnesota, Jim McCrery of
Louisiana, Roy Blunt of Missouri and Anne M. Northup of Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Tom DeLay, R-Texas, who is the majority whip, has been driving
the impeachment in the House. He said on Tuesday night that he did
not have the 218 voteds needed for impeachment, but added ``The
momentum is certainly going that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have 206 votes in the 105th Congress and there is
one independent who votes with them. They are counting on losing
only three to six Democrats in the impeachment vote. That means
that to prevail by just one vote, Clinton needs to draw 14 to 17
Republicans to his side. So far just four have said they are
supporting him or leaning toward supporting him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may be the last optimist at the White House,'' said one
senior presidential aide, ``but I'm not ready to say it's over in
the House. I still believe a majority of Congress opposes
impeachment and would welcome an opportunity to vote their
consciences.''
</P>
<P>
   This official said once again that Clinton had no intention of
resigning, even if the House votes to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Members of the public have consistently said they would prefer
that Clinton finish his term. According to the latest New York
Times/CBS News Poll 69 percent of respondents continue to say it
would be better for the country if Clinton remained in office,
while only 28 percent say he should resign, according to the latest
New York Times/CBS News Poll. That sentiment has held steady since
September when the question was first asked.
</P>
<P>
   But public sentiment for resignation jumps when a different,
hypothetical question is asked about possible resignation if a vote
by the House sends articles of impeachment to the Senate for a
trial. In that situation, 40 percent say it would be better for the
country for Clinton to resign, while 56 percent oppose resignation.
</P>
<P>
   The White House reacted favorably to the censure options offered
by Dole and Castle as a means for members of Congress to condemn
the president's behavior without provoking a constitutional crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Dole's proposal, made in an op-ed article in Tuesday's New York
Times, calls for the House to complete its vote on impeachment.
Regardless of the House action, the Senate and House would
immediately draft a strong joint resolution of censure
incorporating the charges against Clinton _ perjury, obstruction of
justice and abuse of power. The bill could also include a financial
penalty. Clinton would have to accept the censure resolution at a
public signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Castle said that he was seeking a solution that would respond to
the majority of the public that abhors the president's actions but
does not want to see him removed from office. His proposal would
repeat the charges against Clinton and affirm that he remains
liable to criminal prosecution after he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   Castle said that he believed the Senate was unlikely to vote to
convict Clinton and eject him from office. ``Would not the country
be better served if we took action now _ in the next 48 hours _ to
bring this matter to the same conclusion that is likely to occur
even after months of a Senate trial?'' Castle said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   A White House official, speaking not for attribution, said that
Clinton would be reluctant to sign anything that forces him to
confess to serious crimes and constitutional offenses. But if the
House votes to impeach, Clinton might consider such a step to spare
himself and the nation the agony of a protracted Senate trial, the
aide said.
</P>
<P>
   As the stream of previously undeclared Republicans announced
their intentions to vote for impeachment, at least two
rank-and-file Republicans reserved judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've announced I won't announce,'' said Rep. Jim Greenwood of
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Davis of Virginia, the newly-elected chairman of the
House Republican campaign committee, at first ignored questions
from reporters as he walked to a leadership meeting on the Capitol
Tuesday. Finally, he snapped, ``The committee report isn't even
printed yet. I'd like to read that before I make up my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to the House Judiciary Committee's summary
report of the articles of impeachment.

TEXAS SCHOOL FACED PLAYOFF DILEMMA: FORFEIT OR HAZARDOUS ROADS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   On Friday, the Stanton Buffaloes, the defending state champions,
awoke to fast-falling snow. The small community between Midland and
Big Spring on Interstate 20 had been primed to leave for
Stephenville, about 200 miles or a four-hour drive away, where the
Buffaloes were to take on Celina in the Class 2A state semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:37 Friday morning, the National Weather Service in Midland
issued a winter weather advisory. At 9 a.m., the advisory was
upgraded to a heavy snow warning from Midland stretching close to
Abilene along I-20.
</P>
<P>
   The Buffaloes were scheduled to leave Stanton around 10 a.m.
heading for Abilene on I-20 for the 7:30 p.m. game. Heavy snow
continued to fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``My office is a half-mile from the highway,'' Stanton coach
Mark Cotton said. ``You couldn't see it.''
</P>
<P>
   From here, what's really hard to see is why Stanton would be
allowed to travel to play a game in such treacherous conditions.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Stanton superintendent Jim White said he called
Celina superintendent Ken Burks to warn him of incoming inclement
weather. At 9 a.m. on Friday, White phoned Burks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them it's snowing pretty bad,'' White said. ``In the
meantime, I called the UIL to see what our options were. They told
me both teams had to agree to change once we accepted a date and
location.''
</P>
<P>
   From the outside looking in, maybe the UIL should have the
ability to step in or at least consult a third party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him (Burks) we wanted to play on Saturday in the middle
of the afternoon,'' White said ``He wanted to talk to his coach
about it. They called back and said they want to play tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Cotton found himself with little choice: forfeit or battle the
weather. Five school buses prepared to leave. White settled some
nerves when the Stanton sheriff's department gave him a forecast
that said the snow was dissipating around Coahoma, about 30 miles
away. He was unaware of the National Weather Service's expanded
snow warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him (White) if you can't put buses on the road then we
won't play the game. We would be completely agreeable to that,''
Burks said. ``We would like to play the game, but we think of the
safety of the students first and foremost.''
</P>
<P>
   Longtime Celina coach G.A. Moore said the final say was up to
Stanton. However, White and Cotton didn't get that impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to (postpone the game),'' said Cotton, whose team
lost, 9-0, on a miserably cold and windy night. ``I'm not saying we
would have won the football game on a dry field. My deal was the
safety. The only time I talked to coach Moore was when we had 4
inches of snow on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Celina officials told Cotton that Saturday's forecast called for
worse weather. Ironically, Saturday was a spectacular fall day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what he (Celina's Burks) felt pressure to do was go
along with what his coach wanted to do,'' White said. ``He said,
`Are you telling me then you cannot make it there?' I said, `No, if
we start out I would expect to make it there. I am worried about
the kids in these travel conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the (Celina) superintendent had some compassion, but I
think he had some uncertainty to how much he could trust me since
he didn't know me.''
</P>
<P>
   At about 10:50 a.m., the buses pulled out of Stanton. In
Midland, city officials had already closed Loop 250 and off-duty
officers were called in.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 130 miles, five Stanton buses rumbled through snow
storms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a situation with our band buses,'' White said. ``An
18-wheeler tried to pass them. It knocked off their side-view
mirror. If I'm ever again in that situation, I will say, `Sorry, we
will not be there.'''
</P>
<P>
   Cotton also said the football team buses had a close call,
swerving to avoid sideswiping another 18-wheel truck.
</P>
<P>
   The trip, including a stop for lunch, lasted six hours, still in
plenty of time for normal pregame rituals, Cotton said. His team
was ready to play, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying we would have beaten them on a clear day, but I
sure would have liked to have tried,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, Midland had a snowfall of 9.75 inches,
according to the National Weather Service. The Buffaloes lost the
game, the majority of their fans never left Stanton and the team
eventually made it home safely.
</P>
<P>
   The question remains, when does playing a game _ even a state
semifinal _ override the safety of students?
</P>

MILLS LOOKS BACK ON INJURY AND IS THANKFUL THINGS DIDN'T GET WORSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Veteran receiver Ernie Mills walked into the locker room earlier
this week and was besieged with questions regarding the problems
with the Cowboys, who have lost three consecutive games since Mills
suffered a perforated small intestine Nov. 22 against Seattle. The
injury sidelined him for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Mills had no answers _ partly because he's not the type to
criticize his teammates and partly because the Cowboys' problems
were the least of his concerns the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Mills was injured when he caught a short pass from Cowboys
quarterback Troy Aikman and was hit by Seattle's Fred Thomas.
Others have suffered a similar injury from being in car wreck and
having the steering wheel smash into their stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never felt pain like that in my life,'' Mills said. ``There
was so much going through my mind while I was in the hospital.
Football wasn't one of them. It was just life in itself. The first
thing was, Will I be able to be healthy again? Will I survive? Will
I live? That was it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills remembers little about the incident, though he somehow
still stretched for the first down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody told me I did that,'' Mills said. ``That's just
instinct. The pain initially was like getting the wind knocked out
of you. I was gasping for air. When I got to the sideline, I was
really gasping for air. Once I got my breath back in the locker
room at halftime, I started feeling the pain and it wouldn't go
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills spent a sometimes rough two weeks in the hospital after
surgery Nov. 23. The good news is that Mills, a six-year veteran,
will be able to return to the field next season _ although he has
lost 15 pounds and won't be able to start working out again until
his wounds heal, which should be about six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He also said there is a good chance he will be on the sideline
for Sunday's crucial matchup with the Eagles. He wants to offer any
help he can to his teammates _ particularly the receivers, who had
come to rely on his in-depth knowledge of Cowboys coach Chan
Gailey's offense from their days in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys also sorely miss his big-play ability. His absence
is one reason for the drop in offensive production the past two
games. Mills was the second-leading receiver with 28 passes for 479
yards and had a team-leading four touchdown receptions before the
injury. More important, he was a target Aikman trusted to make a
play when he needed one.
A BLOSSOMING STAR?
</P>
<P>
   Gailey is impressed by what he has seen from former Country Day
star Patrick Jeffers, who has stepped up to play since the injury
to Mills four weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, only Michael Irvin has caught more passes than
Jeffers' 13. No receiver has scored more touchdowns than Jeffers'
two. And he has led the Cowboys in receptions the past two games
with eight. There is even speculation that he could replace Billy
Davis as a starter opposite Irvin down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has become a big-play guy for us,'' Gailey said. ``I knew
was a solid receiver. He is one of those guys that has stepped
forward to pick up some of the slack. He will have to continue to
do that for us.''
LOOKING AHEAD
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys held their first draft meeting Monday to help scouts
get ready for college all-star games during the holidays. Areas of
need include a big-play wide receiver, offensive guard/center,
linebacker, pass rush end and cornerback. Considering that the
Cowboys can get an offensive lineman or defensive end in free
agency, a wide receiver, linebacker or cornerback appear to be more
likely options as possible first-round picks. Also don't rule out
the possibility that in the off-season the Cowboys will sign former
Texas A&AMP;M star Quentin Coryatt to play middle linebacker.
INSIDE THE LOCKER ROOM
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said Falcons coach Dan Reeves, who had quadruple bypass
surgery Monday, is in his prayers. But Gailey said it has not
caused him to re-evaluate his own health. Gailey said he doesn't
work out and doesn't particularly watch what he eats. He said he
gives thanks for his health, but said his biggest concern is
winning football games, not worrying about his health. ... Speaking
of health, the official name for the injury to Cowboys cornerback
Deion Sanders' left great toe is not a sprained toe or turf toe,
but a hyperdorsal flexion of the first metatarsophalangeal joint,
says Cowboys trainer Jim Maurer. Now say that three times in a row.
YARD MARKERS: How far do the Cowboys have to go?
</P>
<P>
   First and long
</P>
<P>
   Standout defensive tackle Leon Lett has recorded 44 tackles,
including four sacks and leads the team in tackles for losses with
seven and quarterback pressures with 17. Lett's numbers are good
but it's generally thought at Valley Ranch that his impact would be
even better if players around him were better.
</P>
<P>
   Second and short
</P>
<P>
   Safety Darren Woodson, who leads the team in tackles with 123,
has topped the 100-tackle plateau for the fifth consecutive season.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth Down
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for cornerback Kevin Smith, who apparently is going
to be replaced by Kevin Mathis in the starting lineup, to be going
anywhere soon. Smith is signed through 2003 and was given a signing
bonus of $4.7 million last spring to restructure his deal.

KANSAS STATE FANS CAN GET VIRTUAL REVENGE THIS WEEK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Attention Kansas State football fans: Your shot at revenge
against Texas A&AMP;M is available this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats battle the Aggies in a rematch of their Big 12
Conference championship game Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But a warning to K-State fans: Don't start packing the purple RV
yet; this rematch is one step on the way to the ``virtual''
national football championship, which is being waged online through
Jan. 4. CBS SportsLine and The FANSOnly Network are featuring the
Virtual Championship Series (www.fansonly.com/virtual), a simulated
16-team playoff to determine the online college football national
champion.
</P>
<P>
   Why a virtual champion? ``Because,'' as the FANSOnly Network
states, ``we've all had enough of this BCS nonsense and want a real
playoff at long last.''
</P>
<P>
   FANSOnly seeded the top 15 teams in the latest Bowl Championship
Series standings and the highest-ranked team in The Associated
Press that didn't make the BCS cut. The teams were in a
single-elimination tournament, utilizing 3-in-1 Football, a
text-based computer simulation game created by Lance Haffner of
Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   The champion will be crowned Jan. 4 in the Virtual Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In this week's Virtual Cotton Bowl, A&AMP;M and Kansas State battle
for a spot in the semifinals. In the first round, A&AMP;M defeated
Nebraska, 13-10, on Russell Bynum's late 55-yard field goal. In
last weekend's first round, Kansas State defeated Georgia Tech,
38-17, in the Virtual Sun Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The games are played based on statistical comparisons. The
FANSOnly site provides options to view the comparisons. The
computer simulation comes up with a game recap and an extended box
score. Mike Kahn, CBS SportsLine executive editor, provides expert
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   All they need are virtual nachos and hot dogs.
</P>
<P>
   RECRUITING HELP: The recruiting season is here, which means
decisions for recruits, parents and coaches. The Athletic Network
(athletenetwork.com), produced by Marc Isenberg and Rich Rhoads,
has produced a companion survival guide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Real Athletes Guide: How to Succeed in Sports, School &AMP;
Life'', is a 208-page book available on Athlete Network. It can
also be ordered on Amazon's online bookstore (www.amazon.com) by a
toll-free number, (800) 356-9315.
</P>
<P>
   The book answers questions about eligibility for NCAA, National
Association of Intercollegiate Athletics and junior-college
athletes, the availability of scholarships and what to watch out
for during recruiting periods.
</P>
<P>
   The Athlete Network site also features diaries from several
athletes on different levels of competition.
</P>
<P>
   EASY LISTENING: Broadcast.com of Dallas features hundreds of
sports cybercasts, and one of its more interesting has to be its
69th annual Pop Warner football championships
(www.broadcast.com/sports/football/popwarner).
</P>
<P>
   Poll of the week: In a recent CNN/SI.com poll, 36 percent of
12,362 respondents are ``making whoopee'' in response to the
question: How are you spending time usually devoted to the NBA?
Thirty-three percent are watching more college basketball.

STARS' HULL RETURNS TO FORM, ZINGS BLUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Brett Hull returned to form in more ways than one last
night.
</P>
<P>
   The gregarious Stars winger, who signed as a free agent in the
summer, came back from a six-game layoff after recovering from a
strained groin muscle to score two goals and help lead the Stars to
a 7-3 victory against the team he left, the St. Louis Blues.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time Hull had faced the Blues, where he had
been a captain and averaged 51 goals a season for 10 years. It was
also the organization that engaged him in rocky contract talks that
led Hull to seek a new home.
</P>
<P>
   The 34-year-old winger said his anxiety showed last night. ``I
was very nervous; I wanted to get it out of the way,'' he said. ``I
couldn't sleep in the afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was through, however, Hull was his old self, cutting up
with the news media and flashing the ``Brett Hull'' smile that
showed he is having fun again.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether he had thought he would immediately return to
the top line, playing beside Mike Modano and Jere Lehtinen, as he
did, Hull replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a double-edged sword. If I say no, you'll say I'm
lying. If I say yes, you'll say I'm a cocky \Rplayer\S. So I think
I'll just leave that one alone.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether the Lehtinen-Modano-Hull line will work, he
replied: ``How can it not work? You've got one of the most talented
players in the league in the middle \RModano\S, you've got the top
defensive forward \RLehtinen\S and you've got me picking up the
scraps. I think it'll work. Those two will carry me all year.''
</P>
<P>
   And when asked about his second-period breakaway on old friend
Grant Fuhr, the Blues goalie who had just entered the game to
replace starter Jamie McLennan, Hull replied: ``We had a good
chuckle afterward. I told him it didn't count because he was
cold.''
</P>
<P>
   Read between the lines, and the message that Hull delivered was
that he continues to become more a part of the Stars, who are
17-5-5 with the victory, good for an NHL-leading 39 points. The
Stars also ran their unbeaten streak to a season-high six games
(4-0-2), while the Blues (9-10-7) saw their winless streak stretch
to a season-worst six games (0-4-2).
</P>
<P>
   Two injuries have sidelined Hull in eight of the Stars' 27
games, and he has only now started to play as a regular on the
right wing after an early-season experiment on the left side. In
the past three games Hull has played in which he has been healthy
and playing the right side, he has four goals and three assists for
seven points.
</P>
<P>
   Having him back ``really gives us a deeper top six,'' Stars
coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``He takes everybody's focus away from
our other players. He's a distraction to the other team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars didn't need that distraction early as they jumped to a
2-0 lead 10 minutes into the game on goals by Derian Hatcher and
Pat Verbeek. The Blues, who played Monday night in Denver and are
missing Pierre Turgeon (broken hand), Geoff Courtnall
(post-concussion syndrome) and Tony Twist (finger laceration), were
swimming upstream most of the game.
</P>
<P>
   But the Blues scored twice in a 34-second span thanks to a slash
by goalie Ed Belfour, and that provided St. Louis with momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Hull made it 3-2 after one period with a power-play deflection
42 seconds before intermission. And the Blues again tied things
when Pascal Rheaume undressed Stars defenseman Richard Matvichuk 5
minutes, 7 seconds into the second period.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the Stars opened up. Brian Skrudland scored his
third goal in the past six games _ a goal that proved to be the
game-winner _ after a great setup pass by linemate Guy Carbonneau.
Hull sandwiched his breakaway goal between two Joe Nieuwendyk
goals, and the Stars had their biggest offensive output of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Hull had two goals, Nieuwendyk two goals (breaking a nine-game
goal drought), Jamie Langenbrunner had two assists and Tony Hrkac
added two assists. All four lines scored _ an important fact
considering that Hitchcock switched two of his lines to accommodate
the return of Hull. Langenbrunner moved to the left wing on a line
with Nieuwendyk and Grant Marshall, and Mike Keane moved onto a
line with Verbeek and Hrkac.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I liked was that all four lines looked like they had some
real strong identity,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that identity was sticking up for the new kid on the
block when he wanted to show up his old pals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little bit special for him, and I think our players
recognized that,'' Hitchcock said of Hull facing the Blues for the
first time. ``That was a good thing.''

TEXAS FALLS SHORT AGAINST WISCONSIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Texas had a shot at defeating its second consecutive
Top 25 opponent last night _ just not enough of them.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns made just one field goal in the last four minutes
against defense-minded Wisconsin, which survived William Clay's
desperation 3-point shot at overtime to spoil Texas' upset bid,
65-62.
</P>
<P>
   The surprising No. 23 Badgers (10-1) have won eight consecutive
games, seven on either neutral or hostile courts. Included is a
63-56 victory at then-No.16 Temple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're a Top 10, Top 15 team,'' said Texas coach Rick
Barnes, whose 2-6 team defeated No. 25 Utah on Saturday. ``But if
I'm saying that about them, I think I'm kind of telling you we're
pretty close. They're a little more experienced than we are right
now. They made some plays you have to make to win games like this,
and that was the difference in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns led by eight early in the second half. They were
up 40-35 when the game apparently turned.
</P>
<P>
   As the teams came back downcourt after Hennssy Auriantal's
3-pointer cut the lead to 40-35, volatile junior Gabe Muoneke
punched Auriantal in the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Though the officials did not see it and Wisconsin's leading
scorer Sean Mason (21 points) said it had no real effect, Badgers
coach Dick Bennett said he used the incident to fire up his team _
which took the lead for good at 58-56 on Mason's two free throws at
2:36.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaches are hams,'' Bennett said. ``They'll use anything to
charge the troops. I was surprised there weren't more faceoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes pulled Muoneke, but the player returned in a couple of
minutes. Barnes said, however, the play hurt the Longhorns, and he
threatened to suspend Muoneke if such an incident ever happened
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``No player of mine is going to play like that,'' Barnes said.
``It's not right. I apologized to the \RWisconsin\S players because
I wouldn't want that to happen to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gabe has got to be more mature than that. If it gets to where
I'm going to have to set him down and suspend him for a game \RI
will\S if that's what it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Muoneke later apologized and echoed Barnes' pledge that there
would be no repeat.
</P>
<P>
   But what really hurt Texas was that after Chico Vazquez followed
a miss by Chris Mihm at 4:07 to put UT ahead 54-52, the Longhorns
didn't make another basket until Ivan Wagner drove the lane to
bring Texas to 64-59 with 27.8 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Bothered by fouls most of the night, Kris Clack scored just
seven points. Clay led with 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't let anything come easy to us,'' Vazquez said.
</P>
<P>
   But they almost did. After Wagner's drive, Wisconsin's Ty
Calderwood made only one of two free throws, then fouled Clay on an
attempted 3-pointer. Clay made all three free throws, and Badgers
freshman Charlie Wills missed a pair with 16.3 seconds left to open
the door for Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Clay got a partial look after an inbounds play with five seconds
left, following an errant 3-pointer by Mihm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shot off-balance and it went too far to the right,'' Clay
said. ``But those are the kinds of shots I shoot every day after
practice. I feel like I ought to hit those.''

BROWN'S IN TOWN FOR DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The $105 million contract begins with the
30-something starts right-hander Kevin Brown is projected to make
this season, the 100-or-so wins he's expected to secure over the
next seven years and the multiple world championships his arrival
to the Los Angeles Dodgers could signify.
</P>
<P>
   And the $105 million is for another portion of Brown's game that
is equally, if not more, essential to the deal. It's for his
between-games demeanor and his professionalism that the Dodgers
hope rubs off on the rest of the pitching staff, particularly the
younger players.
</P>
<P>
   After being introduced at a news conference Tuesday at Dodger
Stadium, Brown was reminded of a performance last spring training
when he came off the mound in a rather nasty mood after not
pitching well.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a game,'' Brown, 33, said. ``Sure, spring training is
spring training, but you have to set the tone. Whenever I walk on
the field I expect to do my best, but I also expect to win. You
have to have that drive and desire.''
</P>
<P>
   Spring training, mid-July or the postseason holds little
relevance for the nomadic Brown, who will pitch for his fifth team
in six years. People speak of his personality being about winning
and teaching others along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who pitched in the past two World Series for the Florida
Marlins and the San Diego Padres, isn't only charged with
maintaining his domination on the mound _ he's 51-26 with a
league-low 2.33 ERA in the past three seasons _ but also with
molding a young staff.
</P>
<P>
   In leading the Padres to the National League championship in
October, Brown got major credit for the maturation and success of
San Diego starters Joey Hamilton, Andy Ashby and Sterling
Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   Come spring training in Dodgertown in February, Brown's pupils
are expected to be Chan Ho Park, Ismael Valdes, Carlos Perez and
Darren Dreifort.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will have a major, positive impact on the (staff),''
Dodgers GM Kevin Malone said. ``He knows how to win. He knows how
to prepare mentally, physically. This is the ultimate warrior. This
guy does not accept losing. I think when you have that sort of
pitcher on your staff it's contagious in a positive way. It
motivates, it encourages and it helps teach. His personality will
transcend his affect of taking the ball every fifth day.''
</P>
<P>
   It's why the Dodgers were willing to add a seventh year for
Brown _ who will be 40 when his contract expires _ just six months
after balking at a seventh year to keep catcher Mike Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers president Bob Graziano said Brown's addition upgrades
the Dodgers in a way the retention of Piazza would not. Brown is an
acquisition, whereas Piazza would have kept the Dodgers status quo
and not given them flexibility in the free-agent market, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Malone also relayed the results of an examination conducted by
Dodgers team physician Dr. Frank Jobe on Brown's right arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The elbow looked pristine and clear and Dr. Jobe said his arm
was in such condition he could pitch for another 10 years,'' Malone
said. ``One of the objectives when I came here was to try and find
a leader. I thought we were fortunate to acquire Todd Hundley, who
is a leader, and the acquisition of Kevin Brown, it changes the
personality of the clubhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson wasn't in attendance because he
was on a fishing trip. But Brown was accompanied by his wife,
Candace, who was making her first trip to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   She offered insight into Brown's personality in regards to his
pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a lot more frustrated when he makes a mistake,'' Candace
Brown said. ``He can throw a bad pitch and win, and be frustrated
by that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, Brown, who lives in Macon, Ga., said he would be
pitching for the Atlanta Braves because of the proximity to the
home he's building. It would allow him to spend more time with
Candace and their two sons, Ridge, 7, and Grayson, 3.
</P>
<P>
   But the Braves never expressed interest, so Brown and his wife
made a list of negatives for each ballclub, and its city, involved
in the sweepstakes. When it came to Los Angeles, the time change
and travel distance were glaring problems.
</P>
<P>
   So the Dodgers countered the concerns with a plane, which the
organization will charter 12 times a year for Brown's family to fly
to L.A., or any other city the Dodgers are playing in.
</P>
<P>
   ``This solution makes them, basically, a Midwest team by cutting
three or four hours of travel time off for my family,'' said Brown,
who added he planned on buying a house in Los Angeles. ``I was
impressed with their commitment to family.''

THREE-WIDE COULD BE THE CHARM FOR COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The absence of Ernie Mills has compromised the
Cowboys' ability in their four-wide-receiver formations. The
alternative is to use more three-wide-receiver formations. On
statistics alone, that is not a bad alternative for coach Chan
Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   In this formation, quarterback Troy Aikman is 38-of-59 passing
for 596 yards, with seven completions of 25 yards or longer. His
passer rating of with three receivers on the field is 109.1, second
to the Seattle Seahawks' John Friesz (112.8). Cowboys backup Jason
Garrett has been similarly efficient passing out of the three-wide
formation, with a passer rating of 103.8.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, the Cowboys' team passer rating of 107.3 is tops in
the NFL. Rounding out the top five are the Minnesota Vikings
(102.4), San Francisco 49ers (99.9), Denver Broncos (96.9) and
Pittsburgh Steelers (95.8). It is no small coincidence that all but
Pittsburgh rank among the top 10 teams in passing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why it's important that all of our guys play well,''
said wide receivers coach Dwain Painter, who was unaware of the
Cowboys' three-wide efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Eagles, the Cowboys' opponent Sunday, have been
successful stopping the pass. They rank fourth in that category,
allowing 178.2 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have the seventh-ranked passing offense in the
league, although they have traditionally struggled to pass against
the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman and company will try to attack the Eagles with a
receiving unit that is banged up. Mills is out for the season.
Michael Irvin has a sore lower back, although he is expected to
play. Billy Davis (35 receptions, 631 yards, three touchdowns) and
Patrick Jeffers (14 for 257, two TDs) have most often been the
players joining Irvin in the three-wide set, although Jeff Ogden (8
for 63), and Eric Bjornson (12 for 163, 1 TD) will rotate in at
times in the formation.
</P>
<P>
   Painter said the Eagles usually try to defense the
three-wide-receiver set mostly with three formations. By using a
four-man front, Eagles defensive coordinator Emmitt Thomas can put
four players in underneath zone coverage and three in deep
coverage, or he can keep five players in underneath zone coverage
and two for deep help. If the Eagles blitz when the Cowboys use a
three-wide-receiver set, Thomas can send five at Aikman, keep five
in underneath zone coverage and keep a safety back.
</P>
<P>
   The key to combating this strategy, Painter said, is to keep
Aikman out of harm's way and to give the wide receivers an option
when running routes so that they can adjust to the defensive
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to protect the quarterback, and our receivers have
to run coordinated routes,'' Painter said.

SPACE SHUTTLE RETURNS HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BETH DICKEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ The space shuttle Endeavour swooped out
of a clear, starry sky late on Tuesday, bringing home six
astronauts who laid the cornerstone for the international space
station.
</P>
<P>
   ``One flawless mission completed and a new era in space
exploration just begun,'' a NASA commentator, James Hartsfield,
said in Houston as the shuttle's landing gear touched the pavement
at 10:53 p.m. at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The return of five Americans and one Russian capped a 12-day
flight in which they assembled and outfitted the first two sections
of a $60 billion research outpost for 16 nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a beautiful landing,'' a flight controller in
Houston, Scott Horowitz, radioed the crew after Endeavour had
rolled to a stop. ``Thanks a lot for an awesome job starting our
space station adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's great to be home after such an exciting mission,'' Col.
Robert Cabana of the Marine Corps, the mission commander, radioed
back.
</P>
<P>
   After years of controversy and delays, a Russian-built
propulsion cylinder and an American connecting hub now orbit the
planet in a permanent embrace.
</P>
<P>
   The propulsion module named Zarya, for the Russian word for
dawn, and the connecting hub called Unity towered seven stories out
of the open shuttle cargo bay while a pair of astronauts worked on
the stack in space walks on three days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just kept pinching ourselves and saying, `It can't be
real,''' Cabana said earlier in the week. Endeavour's mission was
first envisioned in 1984 when President Ronald Reagan announced
that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration would build
a space station.
</P>
<P>
   More than 21 hours in the void of space made Col. Jerry Ross of
the Air Force the most experienced American space walker and put
his partner, Dr. James Newman, in third place.
</P>
<P>
   But the time they spent outside was just a tiny fraction of the
entire construction effort that will be needed. NASA estimates that
159 more space walks will be needed as the space station takes
shape over the next five years. Eventually, it will cover an area
almost as big as two football fields.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Mavericks forward Chris Anstey has a serious beef with
those responsible for the NBA lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, Anstey said the players should be back on the court
playing the game they say they love and quit trying to earn enough
money to purchase a Third World country.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the difference if you make $10 million a year or if you
make $9 million a year?'' Anstey said. ``How much difference does
it make to your lifestyle? It's going to be more than most people
see in a lifetime anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``These \RNBA\S guys spend more money in a week than a lot of
people do in two or three years. Everyone should just be thankful
for what they've got and play the game they love.''
</P>
<P>
   As a rookie last season, Anstey earned $713,900, and this season
he was scheduled to make $985,200. But he and his peers missed
their third paycheck yesterday because of the owners' lockout,
which has reached 169 days after players and owners were able to
agree on a new collective bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   NBA players are assured of missing at least two more paychecks.
And with the union and owners toeing the hard line in negotiations,
the entire 1998-99 season might be canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Last season the average NBA player salary was $2.6 million.
Anstey said he can't explain to basketball fans why _ with the
players earning that kind of money _ they're not at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish someone would explain it to me,'' Anstey said. ``I
played my first three years of professional basketball in Australia
and my total salary was $150,000, and I was happy with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I'm making less than half the average salary, and I
couldn't be happier with what I'm making. I never thought I'd make
this much in my lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Anstey purchased a $600,000 home in Australia this year. He said
he was hoping to pay it off soon, but the lockout is costing him
$82,100 per pay period.
</P>
<P>
   As for his NBA co-workers, Anstey had stern advice. Stop being
greedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who makes a million bucks has got to be pretty happy,''
Anstey said. ``If you walk up to somebody who's working an office
job and say, `I'm making a million dollars to play sports,' I can
guarantee they'll say, `I wish I could do that, too.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the highest-paid basketball league in the world, and
we're arguing about how much we're earning. I've got no problem
with my salary, so, as far as I'm concerned, the lockout shouldn't
even be happening.''
OPEN THOSE BOOKS
Forward Kurt Thomas said NBA fans shouldn't focus only on the money
the players are making. He said the owners are making money, too.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas pointed to the six-year, $126 million contract
Minnesota's Kevin Garnett signed last season, and the $33.1 million
the Chicago Bulls paid Michael Jordan last season as evidence that
the owners are making money.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can pay a man $126 million over six years and another
man $33 million in one year ... I don't want to hear that,'' Thomas
said. ``If they can pay us $2.6 million a year, what are they
making off us?
</P>
<P>
   ``Basketball is a business. Look at the luxury boxes. The owners
are making billions of dollars.''

RANGERS ACQUIRE RICKY WILLIAMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Rangers took a $100,000 gamble yesterday
that the nation's premier college football player will develop his
crude baseball skills in their minor-league system.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers purchased the contract of Heisman Trophy
winner/minor-league outfielder Ricky Williams from the Montreal
Expos for $100,000 and risked surrendering infielder Scott Sheldon
by designating him for assignment.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers placed Sheldon on outright waivers for the purpose
of assigning him to Triple-A Oklahoma of the Pacific Coast League.
Sheldon, who hit .256 with 29 home runs and 96 runs batted in this
season for the RedHawks, must clear waivers to remain with the
organization. Sheldon will go to spring training with the Rangers
and compete for a berth on the Opening Day roster as a reserve
should he clear waivers.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who has never played above Class A, must spend an
entire season on the Rangers' 25-man roster or be offered to the
Philadelphia Phillies for $25,000. The Expos chose Williams from
the Phillies' Scranton/Wilkes-Barre roster for $50,000 with the
fifth selection in the Rule V Draft on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The object is to try and get him in our minor-league system,''
Rangers general manager Doug Melvin said of Williams, who will be
invited to major-league camp as a memeber of the Rangers' 40-man
roster. ``That's sort of the purpose of this. This is Step 1 at
this time. We'll worry about the rest down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers could place Williams on the suspended list should he
decide to play football professionally, but it would not subtract
from the time he must spend on the 25-man roster.
</P>
<P>
   The other option would be to designate Williams for assignment
after spring training and hope he clears waivers.
</P>
<P>
   Williams spent the four summers playing in the Phillies'
minor-league system and hit .211 with four home runs and 46 stolen
bases in 565 at-bats.

<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Cornerback Kevin Smith's return to health does
not guarantee his return to the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, still nursing a sore back, will play in the Cowboys'
nickel defense Sunday against the Philadelphia Eagles, coach Chan
Gailey said. But Smith's role as a reserve might not change when he
is totally healthy, Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will evaluate that when the time comes,'' Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to reverse a three-game losing streak, Gailey also
indicated yesterday that more personnel changes might be coming,
``primarily on offense.'' But he was less forthcoming about those
moves than he was about the possible switch at one cornerback spot.
</P>
<P>
   If Deion Sanders is healthy, he and Kevin Mathis will be the
starting cornerbacks. If Sanders cannot play, Charlie Williams will
make his fourth consecutive start.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has one interception this year. Before hurting his back in
the first half Nov. 26 against the Minnesota Vikings, Smith had
been beaten for eight touchdown passes, including six of 35 yards
or longer.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he would not cause a fuss if he doesn't get his
starting job back. But he expressed disappointment about Gailey's
assessment of the position that Mathis has manned the last two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was playing all right before I got hurt,'' Smith
said. ``I know we haven't won a game since I've been out. Hey, they
want me to play this week. That's got to say something about
whether I'm needed or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he would not worry about starting until he was
totally healthy. He added that, ``we're trying to win. We're
scrapping and scrapping for a win in whatever way we can.''
</P>
<P>
   In Smith's absence, Mathis allowed an 89-yard touchdown pass in
New Orleans, but rebounded on Sunday. He helped limit Kansas City
Chiefs wide receiver Andre Rison to one catch for 11 yards. Mathis
also broke up three passes.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said Mathis will start against Philadelphia, and he
expects Sanders will take his customary spot at the other
cornerback position. Sanders has been inactive the past three games
with a sprained left big toe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is pointing toward Deion getting in the ballgame
this week,'' Gailey said.
INJURY UPDATE
</P>
<P>
   As he walked to the team meeting room to conduct his weekly
press briefing, Gailey ran into Michael Irvin in the hallway.
</P>
<P>
   ``How you feelin'?'' asked Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing a little better than I was \RMonday\S,'' Irvin
replied.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin, his backside sore after taking a hard hit Sunday against
the Chiefs, was still moving slowly yesterday. But Gailey said he
expects Irvin to play against the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey also expected Chris Warren (groin injury) to play. But he
was not sure about tight end David LaFleur (sprained knee).
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a real question,'' Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Hayward Clay could be asked to make his second start to replace
LaFleur.

EDITORIAL: VOTE NO ON IMPEACHMENT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for changes throughout)   (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Dec. 16:
</P>
<P>
   Just about any citizen who follows the news could write the
one-paragraph synopsis of what history will make of William
Jefferson Clinton, a man blessed with great talent and afflicted
with a mysterious passion for lying. But as the members of the
House of Representatives gather in the Capitol, our thoughts must
turn to the question of what history will make of this Congress'
handling of its impeachment powers. That judgment will hang on
whether the designated speaker, Robert Livingston, produces a
result that depends on something other than the fact that he can
muster the votes to do what he chooses. Livingston and his
political id, Tom DeLay, should know that only in the recording of
battles does history applaud the unmitigated application of power.
When it comes to governance, the laurels are reserved for those who
demonstrate wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   To predict historical judgments, of course, one must first
examine past judgments. Why, for example, has Congress' handling of
Watergate and the resulting forced resignation come to be regarded
as a model of constitutional process? The fundamental reasons are
that the congressional consensus to punish Richard Nixon was
bipartisan and that a majority of the American people, including
many of his former supporters, wanted him out of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The Partisan Bias
</P>
<P>
   The opposite realities prevail in the case of Bill Clinton's
crimes. Two-thirds of the American people want him to finish his
term. The vote against him will be almost strictly partisan,
meaning that the Republican victory will meet the arithmetic
requirements of the Constitution but will not carry its magisterial
authority. History, in our view, will condemn the Republicans for
using their constitutional powers as an instrument of partisan
vengeance. That instrument was intended as a scalpel for the
cutting out of cancers, not for the excising of unsightly pimples.
</P>
<P>
   We say that from the platform of our record of consistently
criticizing Clinton's ugly little lies, his abject failure to lead
by example and to speak truthfully to the American people, his
equally dismal failure to honor the historic residence entrusted to
him, and his abandonment of his constitutional duty to defend and
uphold the law. He is, in sum, a man you cannot trust whether you
have his handshake, his signature or his word on a Bible.
</P>
<P>
   If impeachment by the House and removal by the Senate would
simply harm him and not the Constitution, we would be all for it.
But under the present circumstances of a polarized party-line vote,
it would assault the Constitution as well as public confidence in
that most precious American asset, the orderly, quadrennial
surrender of power from one chief executive to another and often
from one party to another.
</P>
<P>
   That transfer of power without gunfire or legislative chicanery
is the jewel in the crown of American democracy. It should not be
sacrificed over Bill Clinton's inability to resist looking at thong
underwear. If the Republicans remove him by simple force of
numbers, the debate over whether this was a political coup will
continue for decades and could become a bigger threat to civic
stability than Clinton's mendacity.
</P>
<P>
   Constitutional Precedents
</P>
<P>
   Tomorrow the House will be setting precedents by which the
nation will be governed when this presidency is a memory as distant
and distasteful as that of Warren Harding. A basic principle for
impeachment ought to be that presidents stay in office unless the
case against them is so strong that it persuades at least a
substantial part of the public _ and their representatives in
Congress _on the grounds specified by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Another basic threat to future interpretation of the
Constitution is the Judiciary Committee's insistence that
impeachment could be undertaken as a kind of ``ultimate censure,''
rather than a somber, considered recommendation that the president
be removed. This aberrant interpretation of constitutional
procedure invites promiscuous application of the impeachment
process whenever future presidents and Congresses find themselves
in unresolvable partisan conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Although the words allow for a wide range of interpretation, the
Republicans in the House cannot pretend, in the manner of a Bill
Clinton disquisition on the meaning of ``is,'' that they do not
understand the core import of ``high crimes and misdemeanors.'' The
phrase refers to offenses against the state that threaten the
nation's security or the stability of its civic order and to major
personal crimes such as murder.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's offenses threaten us with embarrassment. They threaten
us with the possibility that young Americans will see him as a role
model. They cry out for condemnation so that no citizen will be
tempted to follow his example or regret his departure _ in due
time. But they do not threaten the future of a Republic that
defines itself through politics and whose politics defines itself
through conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The Moderates' Duty &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We come to that position as a page that has warned often and,
according to some of our critics, too forcefully about Clinton's
poisoning effect on political trust and on Washington's respect for
campaign finance laws. We believe the evidence presents an ironclad
case that he lied, by plan and repetitiously, while under oath in a
civil suit and before a grand jury. But the lies were those of a
sneak, not those of a person plotting to topple or betray the
government. In constitutional terms, the continuity of elections is
more important than punishing these contemptible but not
nation-threatening failings.
</P>
<P>
   In advocating censure, we have consistently urged the House not
to offer it in the absence of an admission of lying by the
president. But now that the decisive moment is at hand, we urge the
moderate Republicans who hold the balance of power to vote against
impeachment even if Clinton does not confess. The constitutional
logic for that bottom line is explained above. The political logic
is based on our view that the days ahead will bring out alternative
political means of punishing Clinton. Also, there remains a bare
chance that good sense could break out in the White House and
Clinton could make a deal based on confessing to his lies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's Day
</P>
<P>
   As today unfolds, we shall see whether Clinton, like Achilles,
sulks in his tent, or whether he sheds his defendant's weeds and
becomes a shaper of his fate. Surely he sees that he returned to
Washington to find few elements of his presidency intact beyond his
stubbornness and the public's desire to see him finish out the most
disappointing White House tenure since that of Richard Nixon.
Wrapped in dishonor, his face a mask of depression, Clinton
presents his staff and congressional mediators with the highly
unusual task of rousing a president to coping with the realities of
his job and situation.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Clinton is not the only stockholder in this
coalescing disaster. The right-wing captivity of the Republican
Party has never been more destructive. We have to believe that the
much-maligned Newt Gingrich, had he continued to function as
speaker, would have exerted statesmanlike leadership. As a scholar
of history, Gingrich heading the House would have recognized that
the case developed by Rep. Henry Hyde and the Judiciary Committee
was not impeachable. As a practicing bully, he would not have
cowered, as Livingston did, before the GOP strongarmers.
</P>
<P>
   A condemnation of the Judiciary Committee's railroading of the
case does not mean it should not have been investigated. The whiff
of scandal and the tactic of stonewalling have been part of this
administration since 1993. Once organized and provable lying
emerged as a White House tactic, as it did early on, the Judiciary
inquiry was mandatory. But the constitutional process cannot reach
its proper destination without a change of course by Livingston,
Clinton or wiser people who step forward either before or after the
impeachment that now looks certain barring dramatic developments
today.
</P>
<P>
   The Wisdom of Censure
</P>
<P>
   To be realistic, the censure option still has a pulse, but it is
as faint as it can get without stopping altogether. While Clinton
was in Israel, the band of 30 or so undecided Republican moderates
dwindled to a handful because the president refused to meet their
price of an admission that he lied under oath. What happens next in
that regard depends in part on whether Clinton and his lawyers
enter the last-minute bargaining being urged by two junior
Republicans, Reps. Christopher Shays of Connecticut and Michael
Castle of Delaware. Shays is reportedly willing to bring a
half-dozen or so Republicans and some cooperating Democrats to the
White House. Perhaps they could thread the needle by selling
Clinton language like ``I lied under oath, but that intent was not
in my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Moderate Republicans can confidently vote against impeachment in
the knowledge that, if impeachment fails, even the Republican
leaders will want the kind of censure they have disingenuously
dismissed as unconstitutional. Moreover, the proposal by former
Sen. Bob Dole for a joint House-Senate resolution of condemnation
has provoked serious discussion. Even if impeachment passes,
according to Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, such a resolution could
be offered as a binding substitute that would have the force of law
once the president signed it. As such, Moynihan said, it could be
worded so as to make future prosecution a practical impossibility,
freeing Clinton to admit what everyone knows about his repeated and
purposeful lies. We elected him to lead a great nation. He became a
prince of disorder. Now it is up to Congress and the public to
limit the damage caused by his irresponsibility. &QL;

IT'S TIME FOR BROWN TO EARN HIS MONEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Adding up the time and effort involved in posing
with a Los Angeles Dodgers cap and jersey, saying nice things about
Fox management and coming off bright, witty and grateful at his
introductory news conference, I'd say Kevin Brown earned $49.46 of
his $105 million Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Now, what's he got to do to earn the rest of it?
</P>
<P>
   It's not an easy question to answer, since there's no formula
for converting on-field success into front-office revenue and since
the baseball economy is likely to go through even more changes
during the seven years of Brown's contract.
</P>
<P>
   Brown himself didn't have an answer, saying no more than ``I've
got to do what I've done in the past'' and that any player ``has to
expect a championship (or) you don't belong on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Agent Scott Boras didn't have an answer, cautioning that no
single player can guarantee a team a World Series championship
while noting that Brown helped underdog Florida and San Diego to
the Series in 1996 and '97.
</P>
<P>
   And Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone didn't have an answer,
although he did cite Brown's durability and predict he'll improve
with age.
</P>
<P>
   But Malone might have cut closest to the truth of the matter
whether his prediction comes true or not.
</P>
<P>
   Because when you think about it, Brown will have to do even more
in the next seven years than he's done in the past seven years to
make the Dodgers look back in 2005 and say it was money well spent.
</P>
<P>
   His contract is the first nine-figure deal in baseball and his
$15 million salary makes him the highest-paid player in baseball by
a sensational margin of $1.7 million a season. For that money, he
ought to be inarguably the most valuable player in the sport at
this moment and maybe a Hall of Famer.
</P>
<P>
   Is he? Will he be? Let's do the math.
</P>
<P>
   Assume Brown repeats his past seven seasons, which began with a
21-win year with Texas in 1992 and included a National League-low
1.89 ERA for Florida in '96 and a '97 no-hitter as well as the '97
and '98 pennants.
</P>
<P>
   That's no sure thing, considering that pitchers normally decline
in their mid-30s, but we're giving him the benefit of the doubt at
least until Opening Day.
</P>
<P>
   If he repeats the past seven years, he'll win 114 games for the
Dodgers, he'll help them to go to two World Series and win one,
he'll go to four All-Star Games and he'll pitch a no-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming he then retires _ he'll be 40 years old _ his career
accomplishments will stack up like this.
</P>
<P>
   He'll have 253 wins (ranking in the top 40 of all time, in the
neighborhood of Carl Hubbell, Bob Gibson and Jack Morris).
</P>
<P>
   He'll have a .604 winning percentage (ranking in the top 75,
about equal to Preacher Roe, Dave McNally and Tom Seaver).
</P>
<P>
   He'll have eight All-Star appearances (up there with the
leaders, in the company of Don Drysdale, Jim Bunning and Juan
Marichal).
</P>
<P>
   He'll have four World Series appearances and two championship
rings.
</P>
<P>
   And _ here's the bad news _ he'll have earned zero (0) Cy Young
Awards and recorded zero (0) winning decisions in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   That's a mixed bag. With a couple of gaping holes in the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   The question isn't whether any baseball player deserves $15
million a year (though that's a valid one too).
</P>
<P>
   The question isn't whether a starting pitcher, who appears only
once every five days, deserves as much money as a hitter, who
appears every day. (Mike Piazza batted about 620 times in 1998.
Brown faced about 1,040 batters. Unless you place an unusual
emphasis on defense, how can you argue that the everyday player has
more influence than the pitcher?)
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether this is the player or pitcher who
deserves the biggest bucks. To say ``yes'' is a stretch as long as
Greg Maddux, Randy Johnson and Roger Clemens _ to say nothing of
Mark McGwire _ are out there.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see what the Dodgers like about Brown and why they
decided to bet $105 million on his future. His no-nonsense demeanor
makes him the kind of player they've notably lacked during most of
their solid decade without a postseason victory. His performance at
age 31, 32 and 33, if you believe his agent's research, suggests
he'll age as gracefully as Seaver, Don Sutton, Nolan Ryan, Gaylord
Perry and Steve Carlton.
</P>
<P>
   But in their desire for Kirk Gibson-like inspiration, the
Dodgers are counting on a pitcher who happens to have never won a
World Series game; Brown was outdueled twice by Cleveland's Chad
Ogea while battling the flu in '97, and done in once by San Diego's
bullpen and once by New York's choppy ground balls in '98.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I didn't have the horseshoes turned the right way in
the World Series,'' Brown said with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   For the biggest money in baseball history, he'd better find a
way to change that.
</P>
<P>
   This is the question that will hang over Brown well into the
next century: What's he got to do to earn $105 million?
</P>
<P>
   And this is the daunting answer: He's got to do even more than
he's done so far.

KEARIN HAS SOME REGRETS IN LEAVING CSUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jeff Kearin said his decision to leave Cal State
Northridge gave him a sick feeling, but in order to advance in the
profession he couldn't pass up the opportunity with UNLV.
</P>
<P>
   Nor could he pass up the chance to work with former USC head
coach John Robinson again.
</P>
<P>
   ``My four years at Northridge were the most formative of my
coaching career,'' said Kearin, who will coach tight ends and
special teams at UNLV. ``I'm sick to leave. It's done for
professional development. We did some really great things at
Northridge, but I had to do this for professional development.''
</P>
<P>
   Kearin, who made $39,700 annually at CSUN, said his contract
with the Runnin' Rebels was much higher. He said added perks _ no
state taxes in Nevada and a staff car _ make the deal even more
appealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd sell shoes for John Robinson,'' said Kearin, who served
under Robinson for four years at USC. ``It was hard because I had
autonomy at Northridge. (CSUN coach) Ron (Ponciano) gave me my
areas and I ran with them. There was a comfort zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Kearin was the assistant head coach and coached special teams
and quarterbacks at CSUN. He said he would return to Northridge
today to tell the players of his decision and to clean out his
office.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the timing with the recruiting season, Kearin said he
will head onto the road immediately. He expects to move to Las
Vegas after the New Year.

BEARING GIFTS FOR OLYMPICS SHAMES ALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   First, allow me to introduce our contestants. Trust me _ they
will ALL leave with lovely parting gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Faisal Fahd Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia is a member of the
International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Princess Anne is another, as is Princess Nora von
Liechtenstein, the only lady on the IOC named after a country. Or
is it vice versa?
</P>
<P>
   There are generals and doctors. There are octogenarians and
politicians. They have Prince Albert any way you want him.
</P>
<P>
   They are not all rich. But judging from the news emanating out
of Salt Lake City, they are working on it.
</P>
<P>
   There are 115 members of the IOC, and suffice to say that Motel
6 need not bother leaving the light on for them. They just awarded
the 2002 Winter Olympics to Salt Lake City, the 2004 Summer Games
to Athens, and they're all going to Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   No, wait. That was the Atlanta bid.
</P>
<P>
   As a historical footnote, please be advised that offering
college scholarships was one of the claims also leveled at the
committee that snatched and shmoozed away the 1996 games for
Atlanta. Organizer Billy Payne emphatically denies that his people
ever swapped tuition payments at a Georgia college for votes.
</P>
<P>
   But who are we going to believe? Marc Hodler of Switzerland, a
respected senior executive on the IOC who has served on the
committee for 35 years? Or a man who convinced visiting IOC
dignitaries that the average summer temperature in Atlanta was 72
degrees?
</P>
<P>
   Just when the organizers in Salt Lake City thought last week
that the reports about tuition bribes would go away, Hodler spoke
out in Lausanne, Switzerland, surfing from TV crew to TV crew,
telling them all that swapping favors for votes is an IOC way of
life.
</P>
<P>
   Hodler seemed to confirm the existence of ``agents'' _ middlemen
among the electorate _ who regularly solicit fees of $3 million to
$5 million to deliver site-selection votes.
</P>
<P>
   The latest round of Olympic scandal began in Utah as a simple
leak _ a stolen letter, passed to a Salt Lake TV station. The
letter referred to a $10,000 tuition payment in 1996 that was being
made by Salt Lake Olympic bidders to Sonia Essomba, daughter of a
now-deceased IOC member from Cameroon. In all, 13 people, including
six relatives of IOC members, allegedly received tuition payments.
</P>
<P>
   The initial response of the Salt Lake Olympic Committee (SLOC)
was that it had done nothing wrong. Hodler himself tried to defuse
the guilt by saying Salt Lake ``is not the villain. It's the
victim.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodler's point is that the vote agents ``put cities in awkward
positions.'' By the time the Olympic votes are ready to be taken,
bid cities are so far down the financial bobsled run that they'll
agree to anything.
</P>
<P>
   And let me get this straight. In good, clean Utah, this makes it
right?
</P>
<P>
   Awkward corners or not, somebody in former bid organizer Tom
Welch's inner circle had to see the obvious unethical nature of the
tuition payments and free medical care that were being doled out.
But no one said anything.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever does when the Olympics are involved, it seems. The
Games are still too prestigious, too coveted an honor, for any city
to tear down the curtain.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to get the Olympic Games, be advised. The IOC
doesn't want cubic zirconium. It wants your best hotel, your
longest limo and, apparently, your best root-canal man.
</P>
<P>
   If you see a limousine, flanked by siren escorts, traveling the
streets during an Olympic Games, chances are it's not Carl Lewis or
Alberto Tomba. It's an IOC member, or maybe an IOC member's wife,
returning from a shopping expedition.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, tsk-tsk, it's terrible. It's scandalous. The Olympic
Movement can't let things like the bribery reports in Salt Lake
City happen.

<P>
   Juan Antonio Samaranch, the head of the IOC, said all that
himself last week, as he was slapping a gag order on Hodler.
</P>
<P>
   They have rules, Samaranch said. But the IOC rules governing
gifts, legal or otherwise, are all directed at the bidding cities _
not the IOC members. According to Andrew Jennings, noted author and
Samaranch Achilles' heel, no IOC blueblood has ever publicly been
admonished for accepting a gift, no matter what size or karat.
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake City a victim? Sure. And I'll bet it's 72 degrees in
the middle of February, too.

   &UR; For WEDNESDAY PMs &LR;
</P>
<P>

   &UR; IMPEACH (Moved in ``w'' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-SENATE (Washington) _ Republican and Democratic senators
said Tuesday that it appeared increasingly unlikely that President
Clinton could avoid a trial in the Senate if the House votes this
week to impeach him. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-CLASSROOM (New York) _ Not since communism fell and
rendered Cold War-era textbooks passe have social studies and
civics teachers faced a target that has shifted as rapidly as the
Lewinsky matter _ a subject whose enormity could not possibly have
been anticipated by the course materials that they selected at the
beginning of the school year. By Jacques Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-RULES (Washington) _ A primer on the rules, and how
Democrats might try to foil them to get censure. By David E.
Rosenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-LOBBY (Washington) _ Why the business lobby isn't
lobbying. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-VOICES (St. Louis) _ Talking to people about the
impeachment issue. By Rick Lyman.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL _ (Moved in ``i'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-CLINTON-MOOD (Jerusalem) _ Clinton was a puzzle during
this trip, even to some of his aides. He was clearly concerned
about the impeachment vote, occasionally checking on his position
in calls to chief-of-staff, John Podesta, or one of his
congressional experts, Steve Ricchetti. But when forced by
reporters to address the matter, he seemed almost indifferent, and
gave sullen answers that risked tipping away the fence-sitters
whose support he needs. By James Bennet.
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-CHILDREN (Jerusalem) _ The Israelis are furious as
Clinton seems to equate children of Palestinian prisoners with
children of Israelis killed by Palestinians. By James Bennet.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS-AFRICA-MOURNING (Bulawayo, Zimbabwe) _ Across Africa, as
the AIDS epidemic has gnawed through people like a conqueror worm,
the number of the dying is so great that it is changing the culture
of death itself. There are 5,500 AIDS-related funerals every day in
Africa, according to the United Nations. On a continent where death
has always been a communal rather than a private matter, poverty
and emotional exhaustion are taking their toll. The poorest go
unshrouded into a common pit. Thousands of graves are left with no
markers grander than the favorite cup and spoon of the deceased,
smashed in loving memory of them. And people in all walks of life
shamefacedly confess that they no longer have the money or energy
to mourn as they feel African tradition demands. By Donald G.
McNeil Jr.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BUSINESS DAY _ (Moved in ``f'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BIOTECH-MARKETPLACE (Los Angeles) _ The biotechnology industry
is facing a financial reckoning. Investors, disappointed by the
financial returns the industry has provided so far, are growing
more reluctant to provide the huge amounts of money young companies
need to develop, test and sell new drugs. The result is that many
small biotechnology companies are cutting back on research. Some
are falling by the wayside or being acquired by bigger companies.
By Andrew Pollack.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   WIEDEN-AD-COLUMN (New York) _ One of America's most creative
agencies, Wieden &AMP; Kennedy, is seeking to raise the profiles of the
larger offices beyond its headquarters in Portland, Ore. As part of
those ambitious efforts, the agency's New York office has been
assigned a big, important task: leading the pitch for the creative
portion of the Miller Lite beer account. By Stuart Elliott.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CULTURE (Moved in ``e'' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE-PEONY (Paris) _ Peter Sellars's ``Peony Pavilion'' comes
to Paris. By Alan Riding.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COMMENTARY (Moved in ``k'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   DOWD-COLUMN (Washington) _ Maureen Dowd on the impeachment
showdown.
</P>
<P>
   RICH-COLUMN (Undated) _ Frank Rich writes about impeachement.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SPORTS (Moved in ``s'' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BKN-NBA-RACE (New York) _ The negotiations have often been
heated, with both sides pointing fingers and hurling profanity.
Egos have been bruised, and enormous amounts of money and pride
have been sacrificed. But while it sounds like any other labor war
in America, one dynamic separates the National Basketball
Association from other disputes _ the issue of race. The players
union is 85 percent black and has begun to question whether it is
being treated with respect by an ownership that is 100 percent
white. Any number of players have already concluded they are not
being taken seriously and seem angry enough to sacrifice a season
to prove a point. By Selena Roberts and Mike Wise.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-VECSEY-COLUMN (Undated) _ Sports of The Times column the NFL
vagabonds _ the owners who keep moving their teams. By George
Vecsey.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DINING (Moved in ``d'' copy) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MASTER-CHEF (New York) _ During most of December, and most
definitively during the Cena della Vigilia, the ritual dinner of
the vigil on Christmas Eve, my childhood home in Buffalo, N.Y.,
could have been beamed to Sicily without a single Sicilian noticing
anything peculiar about it. Alfred Portale of Gotham Bar &AMP; Grill
recreates his Sicilian Christmas Eve feast.
</P>
<P>
   CHOCOLATE (Undated) _ First, the aroma beckons. The intense
scent drawing you in is unmistakably that of rich chocolate, but
you detect exotic hints of clove, coffee, orange peel, even cedar.
The bar is dark and shiny, scored into sections. It breaks cleanly,
with a definite snap. At this point you don't even need to taste it
to know you're dealing with extremely fine chocolate. A look at how
to truly appreciate chocolate; what makes the really good stuff
worlds away from Hershey's. By Florence Fabricant.

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ The Astros left baseball's winter meetings
Tuesday in the same position they arrived in _ without Roger
Clemens.
<TEXT>
<P>
   So did every other club interested in dealing for the five-time
Cy Young Award winner, who has demanded a trade from the Toronto
Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   After a gathering of baseball management failed to produce a
resolution, Toronto general manager Gord Ash and his 20-member
contingent checked out of the Opryland Hotel still holding Clemens
with no immediate deal in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr. spoke with one of Clemens'
agents, Randy Hendricks, on Tuesday. McLane said that based on the
travel schedules of the parties involved, further talks aren't
expected until the beginning of next week.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens is in California playing in a golf tournament, and his
agents, Randy and Alan Hendricks, are in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something that once seemed imminent, hour-to-hour, has been
pushed back a week,'' McLane said. ``We're parking this and letting
them get back to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ash had set a self-imposed deadline of seven to 10 days when
Clemens demanded on Dec. 2 to be dealt to a bona fide contender or
closer to his Houston home. Interest in the 36-year-old pitcher has
steadily dropped since it became known he desired an extravagant
new contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``My experience has been the longer things go, the least likely
you are to be successful,'' McLane said.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens' complicated contract has been mostly to blame in
holding up negotiations with potential suitors. Many clubs are
reluctant to pursue Clemens because of their having to trade
top-line players, then spend free-agent money for him. When the
Hendrickses spoke with McLane last weekend, they proposed a $27.4
million, one-year extension that would give Clemens $43.5 million
over the next three seasons _ a $14.5 million average that would
nearly equal the record $15 million Kevin Brown received over the
weekend from the Los Angeles Dodgers (seven years, $105 million).
</P>
<P>
   The Hendrickses' proposal also included a fourth-year vesting
option worth an additional $15 million and a $12 million signing
bonus to be spread over the life of the contract, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Saying the Astros were ``shocked ... just stunned'' at the
financial demands of Clemens' agents, Astros general manager Gerry
Hunsicker called a news conference Sunday to announce the club was
pulling out of the Rocket sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   McLane revived the Astros' interest in obtaining Clemens by
submitting an undisclosed counteroffer the next day. McLane added
he has received no indication from the Hendricks brothers if the
club's latest offer is acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty well set, unless they come back with something
that economically makes sense,'' McLane said in regard to the
club's current pitching rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Clemens' agents agree on a deal, the Astros would then
have to come up with an acceptable pool of players for Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if we make a deal with Randy Hendricks and then Toronto
wants talent that we can't give up? We still wouldn't do it,''
McLane said.
</P>
<P>
   McLane also took the opportunity Tuesday to clear matters
regarding any dissension in the Astros' front office. Sunday's
announcement by Hunsicker caused a series of heated exchanges
between the general manager and Randy Hendricks, who said McLane
hadn't written off the possibility of a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, Gerry took it very personal. That's what we all
would do,'' McLane said. ``We've learned from that experience and
are prepared to work closely.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland, Baltimore and the New York Yankees remain involved in
the Clemens derby, while the Colorado Rockies acknowledged Clemens
has little interest in pitching regularly at Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're absolutely out of it,'' Rockies manager Jim
Leyland said.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Rangers, also considered a front-runner for Clemens,
had an offer rejected Monday that included 20-game winner Rick
Helling.
</P>
<P>
   ``You work and work and work, and you hope your work pays off,''
Rangers general manager Doug Melvin said. ``I really felt we had
the upper hand. Now, I feel like things have changed again.''

 By ALAN TRUEX  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
MIAMI _ Dick Anderson, who played on the only NFL team with a
perfect record, looked forward to this being a special week of
reunion and reminiscence and of reasserting the disputed claim of
the 1972 Miami Dolphins as the greatest club in football history.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The current Dolphins are preparing to make a stand Monday night
against the Denver Broncos, who could have matched the 14-0
regular-season run of Anderson's team.
</P>
<P>
   But Denver's quest was thwarted by the New York Giants, who won
20-16 on Sunday. So nobody is hyperventilating any more about the
Broncos coming to town.
</P>
<P>
   ``The electricity would have been flowing all week,'' Anderson
said, a tinge of regret in his voice. ``The excitement would have
been greater than some playoff games.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Fame fullback Larry Csonka had called Dolphins coach
Jimmy Johnson to ask if he and some 1972 teammates could join him
on the sidelines Monday night. Johnson granted permission,
welcoming the '72 karma.
</P>
<P>
   Don Shula, who coached the '72 Dolphins to their 17-0 overall
record, had summoned the alumni to a banquet today at ``The Perfect
Season'' room of his Miami steakhouse.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to the Giants, that confab was canceled. So was a
Nike television commercial featuring Shula and three of the stars
of that '72 team: Csonka, Bob Griese and Mercury Morris.
</P>
<P>
   Shula was as shocked as Nike by New York's giant upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think the Giants had a chance to beat Denver,'' he
said. ``I was just hoping the Dolphins could do the job and stop
them next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Griese had said: ``If the Dolphins don't stop Denver, I
don't know who will.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris was cheering for the Broncos to beat the Giants, not just
to get his commercial aired but to see ``poetic justice'' _ an
opportunity for the present-day Dolphins to preserve the glory of
their predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   He longed for a repeat of 1985, when the Chicago Bears came here
12-0 and were knocked off 38-24 by a team still being coached by
Shula.
</P>
<P>
   But Anderson, Shula and most of the other '72 Dolphins are happy
the Broncos were stopped before the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   And the '98 Dolphins are equally happy. Relieved, you might say.
</P>
<P>
   Some had grumbled that they could do without Griese and cohorts
making comments that added to their burden. Forget '72. These
Dolphins are trying to make this year's playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Kiick, halfback for the '72 team (back when ``halfback'' was
a position), empathized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad the Giants won and there won't be a distraction for
this team,'' Kiick said. ``I know it would have been a distraction,
with all the hype during the week and a lot of us old guys hanging
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Morris was right about the Giants' victory having its
downside. Now, the '72 Dolphins are denied the limelight that would
have shined on them. National media had planned to descend on South
Florida and write volumes about these gridiron perfectionists of
the past.
</P>
<P>
   There's cruel irony here, because far from diminishing the
Dolphins' accomplishment, the Broncos' loss enhances it.
</P>
<P>
   NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue, who attended Sunday's Miami-New
York Jets game, observed: ``This is something that happens every
quarter century or half century. You have to root for people who
are doing the extraordinary, but the Broncos' losing shows you also
have to recognize this league is really tough.''
</P>
<P>
   The '72 Dolphins are more deserving than ever of tribute. But as
Shula, 66, has sourly noted from time to time, it's a team forever
denied its due.
</P>
<P>
   Shula's famous iron jaw practically quivers when football
historians postulate that the Pittsburgh Steelers of the later
1970s superseded his team as the best ever.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, NFL Films president Steve Sabol set out to
discern the greatest team of all time. After interviewing numerous
players and coaches, reviewing game film and cramming data into a
computer, he selected the 1978 Steelers and '72 Dolphins as his
fantasy finalists.
</P>
<P>
   In his computerized championship game, Pittsburgh won 21-20.
Shula, the winningest coach in NFL history, was incensed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing anybody could possibly have done to come out
on top of us,'' he insisted. ``We didn't make mistakes. We
dominated in time of possession, in touchdowns. We went 32-2 over
two seasons and won two Super Bowls.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1973 Dolphins, with Csonka having his finest year, may have
been even stronger than the youthful '72s.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people say the '73 team was better,'' Kiick said. ``I
don't know. They were both pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Better than was realized at the time. Being a 1966 expansion
team from the defunct American Football League, the Dolphins of the
'70s had no tradition and little credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Buoniconti, their Pro Bowl middle linebacker who is now a
Miami lawyer, said, ``A lot of people think we were a fluke. They
don't speak of our team with the same reverence they show for the
Steelers or Packers or Cowboys. We have never been paid the homage
we deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics point out that Miami's 1972 schedule included only two
winning teams, both of which were an unimposing 8-6.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins even entered the Super Bowl as underdogs. But they
won 14-7, with the Washington Redskins scoring only because of an
ill-conceived pass by Miami kicker Garo Yepremian on a botched
field goal.
</P>
<P>
   What's too often overlooked are the myriad reasons why the
Dolphins always won. They were wonderfully balanced, with
exceptional depth (pioneering the 3-4 and nickel defenses),
pulverizing power (Csonka) and game-breaking speed (Hall of Fame
receiver Paul Warfield and a running back fast enough to be
nicknamed Mercury).
</P>
<P>
   Their versatility allowed them to prevail on any surface, in any
weather. They landed 10 players in the Pro Bowl following the '72
season.
</P>
<P>
   They passed sparingly (259 times for the season), because Csonka
and Morris each rushed for more than 1,000 yards, with Kiick
contributing 521.
</P>
<P>
   Griese, a Hall of Fame quarterback, submerged his ego to let the
methodical running game flourish. He missed two-thirds of the
season with a broken ankle, but 38-year-old Earl Morrall, plucked
by Shula from the waiver wire, filled in magnificently, averaging
9.1 yards per pass.
</P>
<P>
   While their No-Name Defense by its very definition lacked the
flamboyant assassins of Pittsburgh's Steel Curtain, it was no less
effective. It was the stingiest in the NFL, allowing 235.5 yards
per game, and it intercepted 26 passes. It limited Joe Namath to
151 yards passing and O.J. Simpson to 45 yards rushing.
</P>
<P>
   The defense was short on speed, but coordinator Bill
Arnsparger's zone alignments proved impervious to the pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arnsparger was brilliant,'' said Anderson, who played free
safety. ``He put us in the right situation all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins might not have been the most talented team ever,
but as Hall of Fame guard Larry Little observed, ``We knew what it
took to win games. The players today are a lot bigger and more
athletic, but we could have played with 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   It's doubtful any team now could have as much will to win as the
1970s Dolphins. Guard Bob Kuechenberg played the '73 season with a
broken arm. Defensive tackle Manny Fernandez played in '74 with his
left shoulder so badly torn, it had to be strapped together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning was more important to us than anything else,''
Fernandez said. ``I wasn't worried about injuries cutting short a
$6 million career. With the salary I was making, I could make as
much outside of football.''
</P>
<P>
   In that era before free agency, football teams were family
units, and the Dolphins were closely knit, though sometimes at odds
with the driven and hard-driving Shula, who scheduled as many as
four practices in a day.
</P>
<P>
   The players grudgingly accepted his regimen in order to be the
best-prepared team in the league. And they appreciated Shula's
lighter side. Csonka referred to Shula as ``a madman,'' but he
dared to put an alligator in the coach's shower stall, knowing
there would be no recriminations.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins' biggest scare in their undefeated season came in
the third game, when the Minnesota Vikings led 14-6 in the fourth
quarter. Miami rallied with a 51-yard field goal by the native
Cypriot Yepremian (``I keecked a touchdown,'' he would say) and a
scoring pass from Griese to tight end Jim Mandich.
</P>
<P>
   But as committed as the Dolphins were to winning every game, it
took years for them to fathom the significance of their 17-0
perfecto.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, we thought the only thing that mattered was
winning the Super Bowl,'' Kiick said. ``In 1985, coach Shula called
me up to tell me about beating the Bears and keeping them from
being undefeated, and I said, `So what?'''
</P>
<P>
   Kiick said Csonka ``lost interest in football for several years
after he retired. He didn't want to have anything to do with it.
But when the Bears were trying to beat our record, he got
interested again.''
</P>
<P>
   Interested enough to deliver an impassioned pre-game speech to
the Dolphins, challenging them to protect a legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, vice president of a cellular-phone company located
here, said he ``didn't think too much about our record for a couple
of years after it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it wasn't until the Dallas Cowboys in 1991 snapped
Washington's string at 11-0 that the significance of '72 struck
him. That's when he first uncorked a bottle of champagne and shared
it with his neighbor, Buoniconti.
</P>
<P>
   Every year since, the bubbly has come out when the last
undefeated NFL team gets blemished.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem unsportsmanlike to celebrate someone's downfall. But
the Dolphins' shameless display is a male rebonding and a
reaffirmation of their collective worth, a validation of a
sweat-wringing, blood-draining, unified effort that never waned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams today get beat by a bad team, and they say they weren't
up for the game,'' Kiick said. ``We got up for 17 games. At the
time, it wasn't considered that big an achievement. But every year
that passes, it's more unbelievable. I don't think it will ever be
done again.''

SEATTLE REFUSES TO SELL ITSELF ON WORLD OLYMPIC STAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Seattle is one arrogant little city. What else can
local champions of an effort to bring the 2012 Summer Olympics to
this splendid region be thinking this week?
</P>
<P>
   The Emerald City is out of contention. Forget about it now _
unless a wildly unlikely 11th-hour rescue operation unfolds before
Dec. 31. That is the deadline set by the United States Olympic
Committee for American cities to get in or out of the 2012 bid
process.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Seattle City Council killed the 2012 initiative
when it voted 8-1 to not enter the bid process.
</P>
<P>
   What Atlanta could do to haul in the 1996 Summer Games, Seattle
will not.
</P>
<P>
   What Salt Lake City did to win the 2002 Winter Games, Seattle
won't.
</P>
<P>
   If that is arrogance, maybe that's not such a terrible thing,
although the 2012 Olympic bid champions will no doubt see the City
Council as an isolationist, quasi-xenophobic collection of
Northwesterners who should be doomed to a lifelong diet of salmon
and microbrews.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that would be perfectly terrific to most Seattle
natives, and even to some of its many newcomers, which would mean
anyone who moved here after the maiden voyage of the Kalakala.
</P>
<P>
   Unofficially, Seattle was at least a front-runner among USOC and
International Olympic Committee officials, although no polls or
votes would make that public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seattle is an envied city. It is one of the five cities in the
U.S. where if you asked people where they would live, if they could
live anywhere, Seattle would be one of them,'' USOC spokesman Mike
Moran told the P-I Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seattle is also an international city. It has attracted many
events and is an enviable place to hold sporting events, no
question about it,'' Moran said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have been getting consistent signals that there was a
hostility toward the prospect of the Olympics coming there, and the
USOC is rooted in the strict requirement that we will only go where
we are welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for the USOC, there are eight other American
cities/regions still alive for the 2012 bid. With China now a
strong candidate to bring the 2008 Summer Olympics to Asia, it
increases the likelihood that the IOC would return the Games to
North America in 2012.
</P>
<P>
   So, if Seattle bid proponents like Kathy Scanlan or Bob Walsh
are a little extra bitter or funereal over the death-penalty doled
out Monday, it is probably because they viewed Seattle as the
likely beneficiary of a long, hard, expensive bid campaign and
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, when the 2012 Olympics are awarded in three years, and
if it goes to San Francisco or Baltimore/Washington or Houston or
New York or one three other U.S. cities, then Seattle will have to
live with the quirky and admirable trait of civic arrogance, which
surely it can do.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Denver, which threw back its Olympic bid to the USOC in
the early 1970s and now yearns for another shot, Seattle will
probably never look back.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it soon will have no alternative. Thursday, the Seattle
bid committee's executive board is scheduled to meet. It will more
than likely vote to disband, ending four years of fund raising,
four years of politicking by Walsh, the promoter who brought the
Goodwill Games to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh's vision for an even greater Seattle through an Olympic
extravaganza was rebuked by a City Council that heard nothing more
loud or more resounding than the protests of irate citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's crying around here,'' City Council member Peter
Steinbreuck said Tuesday, adding that the council looked forward to
getting back to the business of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympic torch never caught on the attention it would have
needed. The bid committee did not have an inspired local leader.
They didn't work well with the council,'' Steinbreuck said, making
it clear that head-butting and suspicion between the bid committee
and council was an issue from the start of the non-process.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbreuck admitted that beyond the awesome financial
obligations now required of a local government by the USOC in order
to become a bid city, there were other, more parochial issues on
the minds of the council.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Olympics came here, Seattle would never be the same. It
would have the spotlight on it again. It would just add to our
growth problems,'' Steinbreuck said. ``It would draw more people
here, and we are already dealing with housing and transportation
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is a little far-fetched to think that every
Olympic visitor would fall so immediately, so deeply in love with
Seattle that he or she would evacuate homes from Biloxi or Beijing
to set up residence under the Space Needle.
</P>
<P>
   The point is, in addition to the natural and warranted suspicion
about the costs, liabilities and human resources associated with an
undertaking as mammoth as the Olympic Games, there seems to be
messed up in this council's decision an overwhelming _ and not
entirely healthy _ dose of hostility toward the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some people over there laughing about killing the
Olympics,'' one bid insider said in disgust, failing to understand
why Seattle would choose not to flaunt itself in front of a global
audience for an Olympic fortnight in exchange for what he says
could be 10 years of residual benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Ongoing tourism, conventions, government subsidies for education
and transportation, and if you can believe this, potential profit
are being sacrificed in this knee-jerk and premature end of the
Olympic discussion.
</P>
<P>
   If it can be faulted for anything, the bid committee _ with
officials like Mayor Paul Schell and County Executive Ron Simms on
board _ could not get the word out loud enough on these positive
Olympic factors to combat the bevy of full-throated nay-sayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor feels it is very unfortunate that we have shut this
discussion off in the city when there is strong support in the
region,'' Cliff Traisman, the city's director of intergovernmental
relations, said Tuesday. ``The mayor is very frustrated that there
can't be regional debate. This was all contingent on a public
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the central issue about why this Olympic bid
was never going to see the light of day in King County or
Washington state: Not with the such intense backlash in the wake of
two stadium votes that were at best flawed or flops.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that the Mariners' new stadium is being built despite
the fact the public mandate was for it not to be built. And
remember that Seahawks owner Paul Allen underwrote the costs of a
statewide referendum on the Kingdome _ something some advocates of
democracy say smacks of buying an election.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of such tumultuous manipulations on the part of
local and state officials in their efforts to give public funding
to Seattle's sports teams, it is easier to understand why some
citizens _ elected or otherwise _ are steadfastly, unerringly
denying this Olympic bid to take a single, trespassing step onto
Seattle's hallowed environs.
</P>
<P>
   Hostility, arrogance, call it what you want. The Olympics
themselves are truly one of the most awesome and inspiring events,
the way the world comes together, the way the athletes soar.
</P>
<P>
   It's just not going to be happening in our backyard.

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
It has taken the NBA quite awhile to reach the lofty heights it has
enjoyed in recent years.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few remember, but there was a time when the NBA wasn't the
big-time sport it is today. There was a time when the NBA Finals
were shown on tape delay, after the late news. There were no
All-Star Weekends, no Dream Teams, no NBA Inside Stuff, no daily
highlight packages on ESPN's SportsCenter and no barrage of NBA
stars hawking just about every product on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the league's dark days, in the mid-1970s when drug
usage made headlines. But along came three people who would change
the NBA image.
</P>
<P>
   The first two were Magic Johnson and Larry Bird, who went to the
Los Angeles Lakers and the Boston Celtics, respectively, in 1979.
That they had the kind of skills suited to highlights _ the no-look
passes, the impossibly difficult shots _ was just part of the
package. The perfect part was Bird and Johnson were unselfish. They
were willing, even eager, to make their teammates better, which the
fans embraced.
</P>
<P>
   How to sell that to the fans? That's where David Stern came in.
Stern took over as NBA commissioner in 1984 and went to work
packaging the league for an upscale audience. Because of Stern's
vision, players such as Bird, Johnson, Julius Erving, Charles
Barkley, Isiah Thomas and, of course, Michael Jordan became
recognizable around the world. And that's why the NBA has an annual
revenue of $2 billion and a four-year, $2.64 billion television
contract. Hello, success.
</P>
<P>
   But history shows that for most every rise, there is bound to be
a fall, and that's true of the NBA. Perhaps the league was too
successful. The money flowed, allowing franchise values to
skyrocket and many players to become millionaires several times
over.
</P>
<P>
   But money eventually causes problems, and that is also true of
the NBA. A league that never had lost a game to labor strife is in
danger of losing a season because the owners and the National
Basketball Players Association can't hammer out a new
collective-bargaining agreement. We're 169 days into the lockout,
the All-Star Game has been canceled, the players have lost almost
$500 million in salary, and there's no end in sight. The players
had a conference call Tuesday and agreed to stand firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Stern doesn't have to meet us halfway,'' said one source
close to the union, ``but he has to meet us part of the way. We're
not giving up another nickel, and we're through giving concessions.
Everybody's frustrated, but the league is dictating everything.''
</P>
<P>
   So here we are.
</P>
<P>
   The following is a look at some of the issues:
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are there any talks on the horizon?
</P>
<P>
   A: No.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the big problem?
</P>
<P>
   A: Money, what else? The league's owners, shocked by salaries
shooting into the stratosphere, are attempting to slow that trend
by imposing limits on how much a player can make and setting an
absolute limit on the amount of revenue devoted to salaries. The
union, wanting to keep the open-market, free-economy system it has
enjoyed, does not want to give up such things as the Larry Bird
exception, which allows teams to exceed the salary cap to re-sign
their own free agents. But the owners are serious about taking
control of their industry, aiming to install a hard salary cap and
using cost certainty to ensure profits.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will there be a season?
</P>
<P>
   A: Probably. Odds are about 70-30 in favor of having a season.
Why? Because neither side can afford to lose a season. The players'
only stock in trade is their bodies and their ability, and losing a
year _ especially at the wages they make _ would be disastrous to
most. And the NBA can ill afford to lose the trust of the corporate
sponsors it has so carefully cultivated. Courtside seats at NBA
games have gone from the Levi's crowd to Brooks Brothers, so once
that magic is captured, you can't afford to let it escape.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How much time is left to save the season?
</P>
<P>
   A: If there's no deal before Christmas, you probably can forget
about the NBA this season _ if you haven't already, that is. It's
going to take about two weeks to finalize the new
collective-bargaining agreement and put it on paper, and then
another three weeks to allow teams to make trades, sign free agents
and have an abbreviated camp. That would make the start of the
season around Feb. 1, just enough time to squeeze in the 50 or so
games needed for an acceptable season.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Were the two sides close to reaching an agreement last week?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. They were so close, Stern reportedly personally called
selected East Coast writers and told them to drop everything and
prepare to write about the new deal that was about to come out of
last Saturday's bargaining session.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What happened?
</P>
<P>
   A: It depends on which side you ask. After making tremendous
progress in previous negotiating sessions, the owners say the
players entered a meeting last Saturday and renewed their demand
for 57 percent of the basketball-related income instead of what the
owners thought was an agreed-upon average of 54 percent over the
course of a six- or seven-year deal. The players say the owners
have tinkered too much with a complicated escrow fund, which is
designed to slow salary growth that has owners so concerned about
the future of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the problem with the escrow fund?
</P>
<P>
   A: The escrow deal is a fund whereby the players contribute a
percentage of their salaries before the season as a hedge against
spending beyond a predetermined limit. The union would like players
and ownership to share the responsibility for overspending, and it
is offering 10 percent of players' salaries to cover that
agreed-upon limit. If salaries exceed what the players contribute,
then the union would like owners to cover the rest with a tax on
huge salaries. Owners, who want the players to kick in 15 percent
of their salaries, agreed to the tax but want an exceedingly high
tax rate _ around 600 percent, according to union sources, meaning
owners would have to pay $6 million for every $1 million of
overspending. The players don't want that high of a tax rate.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why does the union care how much the tax rate is? The owners
are spending the money, aren't they?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, but the union would like to see salaries increase at an
acceptable rate, and thinks such a prohibitive tax rate would
paralyze salary growth. Plus, the union thinks such a rate would
cause a competitive imbalance because only a few of the wealthiest
teams _ the Portland Trail Blazers (owned by billionaire Paul
Allen), the New York Knicks (owned by MSG Inc.) and the Los Angeles
Lakers (owned by billionaire Jerry Buss), for example _ would be
able to afford such a huge tax.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are there other points of disagreement?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, but most can be worked out. The owners were demanding a
timing-rules change, which would have forced a team that signed
another team's free agent to forfeit its right to go over the cap
to re-sign its own Bird-exception free agents. The union called
this demand a ``deal killer'' and won't budge off that stance. But
the owners have shown a willingness to relax their demand, offering
a phase-in of the timing-rule change over a period of years and may
include some exceptions. This one is debated _ when the sides are
talking, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If they have identified the problems, why are they not
negotiating?
</P>
<P>
   A: Again, it depends on which side you ask. The owners say the
players have to make more concessions in an honest effort to get a
deal done. The players say the owners are trying to sweat them out,
to see if the union breaks ranks after the players missed a third
paycheck Tuesday. The truth is probably that egos have gotten in
the way and neither side wants to budge. It has become a power
struggle as well as a battle over the financial future of the
league.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why don't they bring in a mediator?
</P>
<P>
   A: The union has asked for that three times, but the league has
declined. Stern insists that if the sides can't work out a deal
``like partners,'' then having a third party deciding things won't
do much good.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
INTERNATIONAL Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch is
in his bliss when the horns are trumpeting, the flags are waving
and the world is watching.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch, a man who once described himself as more important
than the Pope, is Lord of the rings _ with a capital ``L,'' at
least in his opinion.
</P>
<P>
   He loves the grandeur of an international moment and being at
the center of it. He revels in Olympic splendor and being the one
who represents it.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, Samaranch loves when the winners are
marching in, the Olympic theme is playing and costumed youths are
standing before him holding pillows on which are lying the revered
gold, silver and bronze medals.
</P>
<P>
   But today, the glory is tainted. Samaranch is not presenting
medals but wearing one. It's the one he most often slips on when
times become sticky: Teflon.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest scandal Samaranch's Games have seen since Ben
Johnson is upon him. This time, he should not slink away behind the
hallowed walls of the IOC headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, to
hide behind the pristine image he has so carefully _ and we must
say, artfully _ crafted.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Samaranch should stand before the world and do what
is not only right but deserved. He should take responsibility for
the shadiness that has secretly plagued Olympic bids for years and
last week was firmly connected to the Salt Lake City 2002
organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
   The world is watching. Potential bid cities such as ours are
watching.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing for the Houston 2012 committee to understand the
hurdles and lobbying efforts it will face if it eventually earns
the right to solicit IOC votes. It is quite another for the 2012
committee to see the Salt Lake developments, watch Samaranch try to
let it slide away, and then tell government leaders that Houston
still wants to make an Olympic bid.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch should expand the investigation into the
bribes-for-votes scandal that is chipping away at the Games' image
bit by bit. He should do it for the sake of the Games. He should do
it for those cities like ours, which would be crazy to stay in a
race that is looking tainted and dirty.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Samaranch is sweeping it away like an aberration. In
all likelihood, the Salt Lake scandal was not an aberration.
</P>
<P>
   Other successful Olympic bids under Samaranch's watch reportedly
hinged on similar scams and illicit gifts, including scholarships
for IOC voters' family members, which is at the heart of the Salt
Lake scandal. Other bribes reportedly included luxurious vacations
and prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch always called those charges outrageous, which they
might well have been. But the IOC should find out. Houston 2012
should know if this is true before it goes any further. And if the
years of rumor and innuendo prove to be true, Samaranch should
resign.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Samaranch pulled on the Teflon in the wake of the
scandal and vowed to take care of the problem but not look further
than Salt Lake unless hard evidence comes forward.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it already has. Marc Hodler, a longtime IOC member and
by most accounts a reputable man, said he has information that
points to similar gifts-for-votes scams since before 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Among the allegations are agents securing IOC votes in exchange
for up to $3 million once the bid is won. When this information
came out Sunday, Samaranch didn't change his stance regarding
further investigations. He did, however, muzzle Hodler and announce
that only he or IOC director general Francois Carrad would publicly
comment on the Salt Lake issue.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Samaranch sidestepped something that should be
attacked head-on. Only last summer, Samaranch enraged anti-doping
advocates when he all but gave performance-enhancing drugs his
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doping damages the health of the sportsman and, second,
artificially increases his performance,'' Samaranch told a Madrid
publication. ``If it produces only this second condition, for me
that's not doping.''
</P>
<P>
   For Samaranch, no harm, no foul.
</P>
<P>
   This is a man who helped build the Games into something
magnificent and profitable but then wrapped himself so much in his
own glory that he became numb to all things real.
</P>
<P>
   An example: In Nagano during the 1998 Winter Olympics, Samaranch
demanded many luxuries from organizers, including having a Catholic
priest come to his room every Sunday to offer a private service.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch was informed that his hotel was less than a mile from
one of the few Catholic churches in the Buddhist nation. He was
told the priest often must travel to surrounding cities for other
services after an early-morning Mass in Nagano.
</P>
<P>
   No matter, Samaranch said. Eventually, priests were flown 500
miles from Tokyo to offer Samaranch a private service.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch shouldn't hide behind the Teflon medal this time. The
investigation needs to go further, not just for the sake of the
Games but for those cities hoping to carry the pristine image into
the next century. And the first place Samaranch should look is in
the mirror.

PANEL CLEARS OLYMPIC SPRINTER OF DOPING OFFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By PAUL GAINS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dennis Mitchell, the Olympic sprinter suspended last summer
because of a positive drug test, has been cleared by a panel of the
United States Track and Field Association.
</P>
<P>
   After two days of testimony in a Chicago airport hotel, a
three-member panel of the association's doping hearing board ruled
that Mitchell did not commit a doping offense in connection with an
out-of-competition test last April.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, reached on Monday, should clear the way for
Mitchell, a three-time Olympian, to compete sometime early in the
new year, if the International Amateur Athletic Federation upholds
the findings. If it rejects the findings, the federation can ban
him for up to two years.
</P>
<P>
   The IAAF suspended the 32-year-old sprinter in July after the
analysis of a urine sample taken in April. That analysis revealed
an elevated level of testosterone to epitestosterone level, growth
hormones that are widely believed to enhance performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am happy with the results and I am looking forward to
putting the events of the last six months behind me,'' Mitchell
said in a prepared statement issued by his lawyer, Suja Thomas. ``I
look forward to competing again as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said Mitchell was obviously elated at the news but
cautious in his reaction because the IAAF must sanction his
reinstatement before he sets foot on the track.
</P>
<P>
   A similar process took place with the American distance runner
Mary Slaney, who was suspended for a positive test during the 1996
Olympic trials. Two years later her case is still unresolved, but
she is allowed to compete.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing on Mitchell had been postponed from Nov. 14 when
Thomas asked for more time to prepare for cross-examination of a
new witness.
</P>
<P>
   Prepared and confident, Mitchell was reported to have been
delighted to be able to finally tell his side of the story, though
neither he nor his attorney will reveal the nature of their
successful argument.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell earned a gold medal as a member of the 400-meter relay
team that set a world record in the Barcelona Summer Olympics in
1992. He also won a bronze medal in the 100 meters there. In the
Goodwill Games in New York last summer, he again won gold on the
U.S. 400-meter relay team.
</P>
<P>
   The volunteer panel members _ a judge, a lawyer and a former
track world record-holder _ were unanimous in their decision. Now
they must present a written explanation of their decision to the
USATF and to the IAAF within 15 days.
</P>
<P>
   Reached in Seville, Spain, Istvan Gyulai, the IAAF general
secretary, was reluctant to comment on the case until the IAAF had
received the written judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Once the report is received at IAAF headquarters in Monte Carlo,
the council will judge whether it should go to arbitration or
whether it accepts the American decision outright.
</P>
<P>
   The Mitchell case had been particularly embarrassing to the
USATF because the sprinter is the chairman of the association's
athlete's advisory committee and has always spoken out against drug
use.

NORMAN FELL, 74, ACTOR KNOWN FOR TV ROLE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
   Norman Fell, a television and film actor best known for his role
as the crotchety landlord Stanley Roper on the sitcom ``Three's
Company,'' died on Monday at the Motion Picture and Television
Fund's retirement home in Woodland Hills, Calif. He was 74.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said Carol Pfannkuche, a spokeswoman for
the fund.
</P>
<P>
   In ABC's ``Three's Company,'' which made its debut in 1977, Fell
and Audra Lindley played Stanley and Helen Roper, landlords to two
attractive female roommates. The young women, played by Joyce
DeWitt and Suzanne Somers, decide for financial reasons to share
their apartment with an attractive male, played by John Ritter.
Nosy and uptight, Roper spends a good deal of time meddling in his
neighbors' affairs, while enduring the constant putdowns of his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Fell and Ms. Lindley left the sitcom to star in ``The
Ropers,'' a spinoff that lasted one season. Fell's peevish
expression and hangdog eyes were distinctive, and the role earned
him considerable recognition into his later years, often to his
exasperation.
</P>
<P>
   Fell also appeared in 35 movies, including ``Catch-22'' and,
somewhat presciently, ``The Graduate,'' in which he played the
landlord who throws Dustin Hoffman out of a rooming house.
</P>
<P>
   He also appeared in the television series ``Dan August,'' a
detective drama starring Burt Reynolds that ran from 1970 to 1975,
eventually winning roles with Reynolds in the films ``Paternity''
and ``The End.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Philadelphia, Fell graduated from Temple University with
a bachelor's degree in drama.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, during which he served as an Air Force tail
gunner in the Pacific, he studied acting, struggling to win small
parts in stage and television productions like ``Twelve Angry Men''
in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   He made his first regular television appearances in the
short-lived comedy ``Joe and Mabel,'' which was broadcast in 1956,
and in the role of Detective Meyer in the 1961-62 drama ``87th
Precinct,'' based on the Ed McBain mystery novels.
</P>
<P>
   Fell is survived by two daughters.

SUNY BOARD TO REQUIRE CORE COURSES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Over complaints that they were ramming through a
policy that had never been publicly discussed, trustees of the
State University of New York on Tuesday approved a new core
curriculum for about 150,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   While many other universities allow their students wide latitude
in choosing what classes they take, SUNY's board saw a firmly
defined core curriculum as a cornerstone to its efforts to raise
standards and enhance SUNY's prestige.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will elevate the value of the State University degree,
and that our graduates will possess the skills and know-how they
need,'' said SUNY's chairman, Thomas F. Egan.
</P>
<P>
   The curriculum approved by the trustees, in a 10-3 vote,
requires that all freshmen starting in the fall of 2000 at the 29
undergraduate SUNY campuses take 10 individual courses, including
mathematics, natural science, social sciences, American history,
Western civilization and foreign languages.
</P>
<P>
   Some trustees had reservations about specific requirements, like
foreign languages. Others asked why the curriculum included some
broad fields, like the sciences, but was specific in calling for
American history and Western civilization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have concerns for academic freedom,'' said Louis T.
Howard, a trustee. ``Why in these two areas are we so specific? Why
not Franco-American history?''
</P>
<P>
   Randy A. Daniels, one of the trustees who was co-chairman of the
board's subcommittee that shaped the policy, argued that American
history was a must. ``We are all Americans and we should all be
knowledgeable about our own history,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest complaint was the board's hurry to pass the
proposal without campus discussion, which some critics viewed as an
effort to put the policy in place before people could attack it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are dealing with something that is going to affect
everyone in the university community, there should be some time
spent discussing it,'' said Celine Traylor, the sole student
trustee, who called for the vote to be delayed and was one of the
three trustees who voted no.
</P>
<P>
   Paul R. Perez, a trustee and co-chairman of the curriculum
subcommittee, said that the topic had been publicly discussed since
1995. But presidents of several SUNY colleges said that they had
not seen the specific proposal until Tuesday, when they arrived at
the board meeting. And some trustees said they had not seen copies
until late last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only got mine faxed Friday afternoon,'' said Edward S.
Nelson, another trustee who voted against the proposal. ``It looks
to me like this is a rush to judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Egan, the board chairman, tried to reassure Nelson and others,
saying that there would be plenty of time for discussion and
changes before the policy takes effect in 2000. He said that the
policy would be discussed with the college presidents in January,
and that amendments were possible.
</P>
<P>
   SUNY's provost, Peter D. Salins, also tried to reassure critics,
saying there was room for faculties and presidents to set their own
requirements within the framework. ``I don't see it as a
straitjacket,'' he said. ``I see it as having a great deal of
flexibility.''
</P>
<P>
   But Arnold B. Gardner, the third trustee to oppose the measure,
called it ``a milestone in increasing the intrusion by the central
office'' into campus affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason to act so quickly except to claim the
ground and then act to defend it,'' he added.

COLUMN: U.S. STALLS FLIGHTS TO AID HONDURAN VICTIMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A big yellow truck rumbled down the drab streets of
Long Island City, Queens, before heaving to a halt outside a
warehouse. Luis Riera gave it a weary glance from inside the drafty
space that has been his home lately. All around him, boxes of food,
medicine and clothing were piled high like building blocks, all
donations intended to rebuild Honduras, his native land, which was
battered seven weeks ago by Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   The sight of this largess did not make him happy. Nor did the
arrival of the truck, which was ready to be loaded with more boxes,
if only they had a way to reach Central America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be different if we had a way to transport this to
Honduras,'' said Riera, a volunteer who oversees the warehouse.
``Right now we have a list of places where we could collect more
donations, but we can't. There's no more room to move in and out.
Without transportation, we are delayed.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar snags have been reported in Los Angeles, Miami and
elsewhere as tons of donations await shipment to Central America.
In New Jersey alone, some 20,000 pounds of relief supplies sit in
warehouse limbo. Much of the aid has to be sent by boat, a slower
process made more difficult by what Honduran consular officials
said was a seasonal scarcity of cargo containers.
</P>
<P>
   The officials had hoped that National Guard planes would be made
available to airlift the boxes. But it appears that those plans
were sidetracked when American forces were put on alert because of
the potential need for forces in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Officials in New York state offered us transport planes from
the National Guard,'' said Octavio Pineda, the Honduran consul in
New York. ``The problem is they need federal authorization to leave
American air space. They never were authorized. Then the situation
with Iraq happened and all the planes were put on hold. Since then,
we have not had any communication.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1980s, the United States had no problem flying nearly
anything it wanted to Honduras, which was then considered a friend
and ally in Central America. At the time, Honduras was an
intelligence and command post for the contra war being waged
against Nicaragua's Sandinista government. The presence of
thousands of American-supported contra troops and their base camps
embarrassed Honduran officials, who were reduced to taking a
face-saving cue from that old ``Hogan's Heroes'' stalwart, Sgt.
Schultz. ``Contras? CIA? I know nothing! Nothing!''
</P>
<P>
   Now the contras are history, and democracy has come to
Nicaragua. And the promise of cargo planes that could have ferried
relief supplies vanished once the president of Iraq, Saddam Hussein
_ himself once a friend of sorts to the United States _ started
playing his usual shell game with weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Two spokesmen for the Defense Department could not explain why
the cargo flights to Honduras had not been authorized. Instead,
they punted the question on Monday to New York state National Guard
officials, a puzzling move, since state officials cannot
unilaterally authorize the flights.
</P>
<P>
   This has frustrated New York state officials, who said they were
still willing to supply several cargo planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been asking from the beginning, but it has not been
approved,'' said one state official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity. ``We're ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government has pledged hundreds of millions of dollars
in aid to Honduras. It has also suspended the country's obligations
to make foreign debt payments for two years and provided
helicopters and engineers to help rebuild roads and bridges. But
Hondurans and their supporters here wonder why the tons of goods
they collected _ with the generous help of state and city officials
_ can't get to their homeland in a timely manner.
</P>
<P>
   Edward James Olmos, the actor, visited Honduras for UNICEF soon
after the hurricane, and he said the devastation he witnessed
underscored the need for as much help as possible. He said that in
Los Angeles alone there were 20 50-foot containers packed with
supplies sitting in a factory, and he worried that they might have
been collected in vain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might just be easier to buy things locally in Honduras or
Mexico than it would be to wait for help to be flown in,'' he said.
``They need everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Honduran consular officials said that some commercial airlines
had helped move supplies, but that much more of them had had to be
sent by boat. They said their office had been forced to scramble to
find enough cash and cargo containers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at the point of losing hope,'' said Julio Cesar
Enamorado, the vice consul. ``We cannot keep food and clothing in
warehouses while our people are dying of hunger. We decided we are
going to cover the cost of containers until we get free planes.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the setbacks, volunteers still show up to pack and stack
boxes of donations. On Saturday, Sandra Monge stood before a tower
of boxes, each one filled with toys and decorated with jolly Santas
and messages of Feliz Navidad. She was collecting money from
friends and family to send the toys by boat, which means they
probably won't arrive by Christmas Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it gets there by Three Kings Day, that's good enough,'' Ms.
Monge said of the Jan. 6 holiday. ``I like kids, so this is the
most important shipment to me. They don't understand what is
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Children understand friendship. So what if in their fickleness
they jump from one best buddy to another _ who doesn't? Just ask
some of the volunteers toiling at the warehouse on Saturday.
Outside, the skies were a cloudy gray. It was a fitting backdrop
for the volunteers, who were swamped with boxes. Among themselves,
they were learning how it felt to have fair-weather friends.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BRONXVILLE, N.Y. _ Before a wildly hooting audience of 300, New
York University trounced Bard and Sarah Lawrence colleges when
their teams clashed in a ``slam'' _ what was billed as the World's
First Intercollegiate Competitive Poetry Performance.
</P>
<P>
   In a slam, poets recite their work before a panel of judges. The
more boisterous the better. The lyrics are frequently raunchy and
the atmosphere rowdy, with performers being cheered, booed, hissed,
challenged from the floor and _ on occasion _ actually tackled, or
slammed, into silence.
</P>
<P>
   The slam, so named in the mid-1980s by Marc Smith, a Chicago
barroom poet, was until recently confined to coffeehouses or
taverns, like the Green Mill in Chicago where Smith still holds
forth. But today, the slam has become so popular that some English
professors call it a new art form while others denounce it as
fiercely, as if staving off an assault by barbarians. It is sure to
be a hot topic at the annual convention of the Modern Language
Association in San Francisco later this month.
</P>
<P>
   At the event held at Sarah Lawrence Dec. 10, Patrick Anderson, a
wiry drama major at NYU, brought the audience to its feet when he
racked up 27.93 points out of 30. His work was explosive and
decidedly X-rated. Among the more tame verses of the poem ``I Know
a Secret Way of Making Love'' were:
</P>
<P>
   I want to hear someone say
</P>
<P>
   You're a movie star
</P>
<P>
   While I take my hand, soft, magical
</P>
<P>
   To the skin of her butt
</P>
<P>
   And warm away the goose-bumps.
</P>
<P>
   Do you hear that, America?
</P>
<P>
   Do you understand, dream woman?
</P>
<P>
   and I think we should have sex
</P>
<P>
   A billion more times tonight.
</P>
<P>
   College students find it an antidote for youthful angst. ``It
gave me an outlet I didn't have before,'' said Susan
Somers-Willett, a slam champ who is a doctoral student in English
at the University of Texas at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether slam can rise to the level of art
inspires great debate. The Modern Language Association, which seeks
to foster the study and teaching of language and literature, has
commissioned Sally Placksin, an independent radio producer, to
create a program for National Public Radio on the oral tradition of
poetry from Homer to slam.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Franklin, executive director of the association,
explained: ``We think slam is worth studying to show the
connections between the ancient oral tradition and that of modern
poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter Herbert, a professor of 19th-century American literature
at Southwestern University in Georgetown, Texas, said: ``Slam is
intentionally contra-genteel, but must not be dismissed for that
reason. Mark Twain had a significant career as a platform comedian
and throughout his life was seen _ like slam _ as somewhat
disreputable. Slam is bringing a new vitality to poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   Marjorie Perloff, a professor of English at Stanford University,
also approves. ``It's probably a corrective for the pompous poetry
readings of the 80s,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees. The eminent Yale professor Harold Bloom
said this week that although he has never attended a slam, he has
read some of the contest winners and found them ``of a badness not
to be believed.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's Helen Vendler, another well-known professor of modern
poetry, said she had attended slams and considered the work ``not a
new art form, but a new social form, a new type of social
gathering.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Holman, a poet, slammer and teacher at Bard, said Ms.
Vendler was blind to performance values. ``She does some wonderful
things with text analysis,'' he said, ``but doesn't seem to realize
that slam performance takes us back to the origins of poetry, which
is an oral art that engages the audience viscerally.''
</P>
<P>
   The poet Richard Tillinghast, a professor at the University of
Michigan at Ann Arbor, said he did not mind the performance part.
``What I don't like about slam is when the audience votes,'' he
said. ``It's crazy to have the crowd pass judgment on any art.''
</P>
<P>
   That is precisely what attracts David Lehman, a poetry professor
at Bennington College who edited ``The Best of the Best American
Poetry'' (Scribner Poetry, 1998). ``Making a poetry reading into a
competitive event adds a new flavor, a new possibility,'' he said.
``It makes poetry exciting to young people.''
</P>
<P>
   The intercollegiate slam began when Robert Elstein, a
high-spirited, bushy-haired Sarah Lawrence junior who performs
under the name Keystone, raced around the stage several times. He
welcomed ``my 17 current girlfriends in the audience'' and
explained that each of the 16 competing poets would have five
minutes. Spectators were encouraged to be vocal about likes and
dislikes. Five judges scattered in the audience would score the
performers and decide which school won.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had Keystone got this far than a man zipped across the
stage and floored him, setting off an earsplitting round of
laughter, cheering and applause.
</P>
<P>
   The tackler turned out to be Holman, the Bard professor and
co-host for the evening.
</P>
<P>
   The sexual explicitness Anderson favored was also seen in other
poets. Amanda Nazario of NYU fantasized about having ``acrobatic
sex on the dining room table,'' and Marisa Vurale of Bard scolded a
former lover with such intensity that the manuscript she was
holding literally smoked (from burning incense, it developed).
</P>
<P>
   Edwin Butler represented Sarah Lawrence with his jovial poem
``An Ode to Meatball Stromboli.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, yes soon,
</P>
<P>
   You'll be restin'
</P>
<P>
   In my large intestine.
</P>
<P>
   NYU was cheered and booed thunderously when Keystone declared it
the victor. Anderson, the poet with the highest individual score,
was awarded a box of Clementines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was super! Just super!'' said Holman, who seemed as
high-spirited as any of the students.

 &HT;    Kelso: Do your worst to win our card contest
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ How's this for a couple of nuts?
</P>
<P>
   The nut on the left is Robert Burns, 54, the art director of the
'70s cult horror classic ``The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.'' Burns is
the guy who created the gooey special effects for the movie.
</P>
<P>
   The nut on the right in this Christmas card is the World's
Largest Pecan, not an actual pecan but a 1,000-pound concrete pecan
that sits in the square in Seguin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Burns moved from South Austin to Seguin, a town of
21,373 people and lots of pecans about 50 miles south of Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Burns' first artistic act after moving to Seguin was to visit
the town square last week and have this picture taken for his
Christmas card.
</P>
<P>
   You've got to wonder what the locals were thinking when they saw
this happening. I imagine the conversation went something like
this: ``Hey, Midge. Looks like another nutbag from Austin has moved
into town. There's some idiot over by the pecan getting his picture
made.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns went to some trouble to get this picture taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took it on the first day that big cold front blew through,
and it was just colder than (provide your own noun),'' Burns said.
``I was just standing out there making a fool of myself next to
that pecan in front of the whole city.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's the good news. This picture has provided the inspiration
for John Kelso's Extremely Stupid Christmas Card Contest. If you
have a Christmas card that is anywhere near as silly as this one,
please send a copy of it to me to P.O. Box 670, Austin, TX 78767,
and you could become famous.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you have a Christmas card that shows you giving your cat a
bubble bath. Maybe you've got a Christmas card of Aunt Nelda
accidentally electrocuting herself while putting on that
glitter-covered, battery-powered sweat shirt that plays ``Silent
Night.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe you have a Christmas card of you and mom on
vacation in Florida, holding up a large, dead fish.
</P>
<P>
   Do you have anything that creative? If so, get jolly and send it
to me. The silliest Christmas cards will be printed in The Austin
American-Statesman newspaper along with your name and explanation
(alibi?).
</P>
<P>
   Burns is going to be hard to beat, though, because he is a
veteran of putting out stupid Christmas cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I've sent out a lot of goofy cards,'' he said smugly.
``The first one I ever did was the one I did with those rubber
stamps. I've done all kinds of them through the years. Now it's
expected of me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Christmas card done with a rubber stamp was a postcard Burns
sent to his friends that showed the globe with some little round,
smiling green peas sitting on top.
</P>
<P>
   The caption? ``Peas on Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the things that makes Burns' most recent stupid Christmas
card so perfect is the outfit he has on for the occasion. That
plaid jacket Burns is wearing in the picture is louder than Texas
Monthly publisher Mike Levy. Where did Burns get those clothes?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is around the house. ``I have outfits for all
occasions,'' Burns said.
</P>
<P>
   Burns picked the World's Largest Pecan for his Christmas card
because it is a centerpiece in Seguin, a major pecan-growing town.
``It's featured on all their brochures,'' Burns said. ``Seguin is
mighty proud of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowning touch of this card is the message on the right
side: ``Come share the excitement.'' Makes you want to pack the
kids in the car and take off for Seguin, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   The inscription on the plaque of the World's Largest Pecan tells
visitors that 16th century Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca traveled
on the Guadalupe River, which runs through Seguin, and that the
river used to be known way back when as ``The River of Nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that Burns has moved to Seguin, there is more truth to the
name than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a Christmas card that can top this, and I'm sure
some of y'all have, get it to me and we'll share it with the world.

 &HT;    Slicker Than Nixon
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ President Richard Milhous Nixon was standing a few
feet in front of me, sweating and twitching, on Sunday evening,
Nov. 11, 1973.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have got to know whether or not their president is a
crook,'' he said. ``Well, I'm not a crook.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon, unlike President William Jefferson Clinton, was a lousy
liar.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon looked shifty and sounded shifty during that press
conference and throughout his political career. His body language
was out of sync with his words.
</P>
<P>
   Where Nixon was clumsy, Clinton is slick. Clinton is an actor, a
con man and a master manipulator. He has been accurately described
as someone who could teach Machiavelli lessons in the art of
deceit.
</P>
<P>
   Like all good grifters, Clinton tells people what they want to
hear, plays on their emotions, draws them into his web and uses
them for his gain.
</P>
<P>
   If Nixon had half of Clinton's guile, he likely would be warmly
ensconced in history books as a great president. Surely, Clinton
could make those incriminating Oval Office tapes disappear just as
easily as the Rose law firm billing records.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon had a genius for masterminding foreign policy resolutions
that brought long-term benefits to this nation. Clinton has a
genius for adopting and changing positions based on effervescent
public opinion polls. His career is littered with friends, allies
and policy positions dropped in a heartbeat when they threatened
his public approval ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Co-workers gave me a Richard Nixon watch that included the
instantly famous ``I'm not a crook'' remark. It still runs. Nixon's
eyes shift back and forth with each tick.
</P>
<P>
   Today there's a Bill Clinton watch. It shows his nose growing
longer and longer with each tick. Also now on sale is a takeoff on
the ``Tickle me, Elmo'' dolls called ``Fondle me, Bubba.'' They
play back remarks such as ``I'll bomb Baghdad, I'll bomb France, if
you'll remove my underpants,'' or ``Hey, baby, I've got some
Astroturf in the back of my El Camino.''
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers also can buy a knockoff of Russian nesting dolls that
include the figures of Paula, Gennifer, Monica and Kathleen.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors flock daily to White House to catch a glimpse of the
``Bill and Monica'' room.
</P>
<P>
   First Clinton turned America's revered People's House into a
hot-sheet flop house to raise campaign funds and then he turned it
into a bawdy-house joke. True to his nature, he lied about it.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon, in my estimation, was a crook. He committed high crimes
and misdemeanors. He ``violated the trust of the American people,
lessened their esteem for the office of president and dishonored
the office which they have entrusted to him,'' which is the censure
resolution congressional Democrats want to apply to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon deserved to be impeached in the House, tried in Senate and
removed from office. Fortunately, Nixon took the advice of powerful
Republicans who told him it was time to go.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's partisan apologists keep reminding us that there is no
equivalency in the crimes committed by Nixon and Clinton. They are
right. But so what?
</P>
<P>
   All crimes are not equivalent. If all criminals except the very
worst were released, there would be only one person in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Preachers, pundits and more than 150 U.S. newspapers have called
on Clinton to resign. But Clinton will never resign unless the
leaders of his party tell him to go. Even then, he might not do it.
</P>
<P>
   It's unlikely that Congress will force Clinton's removal even if
it comes to a trial in the Senate. That's fine with me.
</P>
<P>
   But American voters must come to grips with the fact that they
have twice been slickered by an immoral con man. They must make
sure it never happens again.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: In two takes.)
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;(AT)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard about the discovery of stone bullets in the
Mediterranean Sea that were used in a battle 2,000 years ago. What
kind of weapon was used to fire such things? How big were the
bullets?
</P>
<P>
   A: Researchers say the projectiles were fired by catapults,
which worked on the same principle as slingshots, but on a larger
scale. Just before the battle for control of the Mediterranean
world began on Sept. 2, 31 B.C., the fleets of Octavian, fighting
against those of Marc Antony and Cleopatra, faced one another in
long parallel lines and launched thousands of stone balls. While
larger stone-throwing catapults were used on land, smaller ones
were used on the naval vessels because of their weight. The balls,
found and photographed on the sea floor in the battle zone, are
estimated to be between 4 and 6 inches in diameter and to weigh
between 3.3 and 10 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that there is an immediate need for an influx of cash
before construction can begin on the proposed World War II monument
in Washington. It would be helpful to know where to send donations.
Can you tell us?
</P>
<P>
   A: Call 1-800-639-4992 for information.
</P>
<P>
   Q: During the House Judiciary Committee hearings, members often
used the phrase ``strike the last word.'' What does that mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's a parliamentary tactic to extend debate time during the
amending process. The ``last word'' refers to the last word of the
pending amendment or bill. Motions to strike the last word actually
are nonsense amendments, or more technically, pro forma amendments
(amendments in form only).
</P>
<P>
   House members recognize that these motions to strike the last
word are used strictly to extend debate. They're not meant
literally to strike out the last word.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works. The House most often amends bills under the
``five-minute rule,'' which allots five minutes for the mover of an
amendment to explain it, and five minutes for an opponent. This
time can be extended only by unanimous consent, which is not always
forthcoming. With a total of only 10 minutes per amendment under
the regular order, the two principal members debating an amendment
often use up all the time and have none left to yield to other
members who wish to participate in the debate. However, members can
get five minutes of their own if they offer an amendment _ so
that's what they do. They move to strike the last word of the
pending amendment. They then are recognized for five minutes, which
they use not to discuss the merits of striking the last word of the
pending amendment, but instead to discuss its substantive content.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I keep seeing mention that there's one independent in the
House of Representatives. But the person is never identified. Who
is it? What is his or her voting record like?
</P>
<P>
   A: Rep. Bernard Sanders, just re-elected to his fifth term from
Vermont, is the only independent in Congress. He usually votes with
the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Donna Shalala, secretary of health and human services, was
named by the Sara Lee Corp. among women who are exceptional. I
recall that Shalala, commenting about Vietnam veterans, once was
criticized for saying ``They are not our best and brightest.'' What
was the context?
</P>
<P>
   A: The remark, made in April 1995, created a brief stir, fueled
by syndicated conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh and others.
Shalala, appearing on CNN's ``Capital Gang,'' was commenting about
a new book, ``In Retrospect: The Tragedy and Lessons of Vietnam,''
by Robert S. McNamara, secretary of defense in the Kennedy and
Johnson administrations.
</P>
<P>
   When it first was reported that Shalala had said ``the best and
the brightest sons'' did not go to Vietnam, Limbaugh and others
pounced, saying she was disparaging the men who fought there, with
Limbaugh adding that she ``should be forced to apologize for and
maybe even resign over'' the comment. Avis LaVelle, her
spokeswoman, said Shalala was misunderstood, and what she meant was
that ``the best and the brightest's sons'' were able to avoid
serving in the war.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Shalala, then-Veterans Affairs Secretary Jesse
Brown, a Vietnam veteran, wrote: ``I understand what you were
saying _ it is mainly the poorer kids of this country who have
traditionally fought our wars.'' Shalala also wrote to six
veterans' organizations, saying: ``I did not, and would never,
disparage or denigrate those who served our nation so valiantly.
The point I was making is that the burden of fighting the war fell
disproportionately on poor and middle-income families, and that the
sons of the so-called best and the brightest were rarely called.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Didn't Joe DiMaggio have a brother who also played
professional baseball? Is he still living? Can you tell us
something about him and his baseball career?
</P>
<P>
   A: Three DiMaggio brothers _ Vince, born Sept. 6, 1912; Joe,
Nov. 25, 1914; and Dom, Feb. 12, 1917 _ played professional
baseball. While Joe, the Yankee Clipper, was the most celebrated,
Dom and Vince each played in more than 1,000 Major League games.
Two other DiMaggio brothers didn't go into pro sports.
</P>
<P>
   Vince (Vincent Paul) died in 1986 after a bout with stomach
cancer. He played 10 seasons in the National League as an
outfielder with the Boston Braves. He also played with the
Cincinnati Reds, Pittsburgh Pirates, Philadelphia Phillies and New
York Giants. He had a career batting average of .249 with 125 home
runs and 584 runs batted in. He also had at one time the dubious
distinction of holding the Major League record for strikeouts with
134 in 1938 for the Braves. He retired from baseball in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   At last report, Dom (Dominic Paul) was splitting his time
between New England and his waterfront home in Florida. He broke in
with the Boston Red Sox in 1940, four years after brother Joe made
his debut with the New York Yankees. In 1949, Dom set a Red Sox
record for the longest hitting streak by a rookie: 34 games. He
retired from baseball in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What were the popular vote totals in the 1996 presidential
race between Bob Dole and Bill Clinton? What were the Electoral
College vote totals? How many states did each of them win?
</P>
<P>
   A: Clinton got 47,401,185 votes (49.25 percent of the total);
Dole got 39,197,469 (40.73 percent). Electoral College: Clinton
379; Dole 159. States: Clinton 31 and the District of Columbia;
Dole 19.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you give us an update on the Thompson sextuplets, the
first born to an African-American couple in the United States?
</P>
<P>
   A: Jacqueline and LindenThompson of Washington became the
parents of the nation's first black sextuplets May 8, 1997. One,
Allison Nicole, was stillborn, but the other five _ Octavio
Daniela, Stella Kimberly, Emily Elizabeth, Richard Linden and
Ann-Marie Amanda _ are doing well. Even though the one daughter
died, the family still refers to their babies as ``sextuplets.''
</P>
<P>
   The babies were virtually ignored by outsiders for six months,
until a published report contrasted their circumstances to the
attention poured on white septuplets born in November 1997 to Bobbi
and Kenny McCaughey in Iowa. After that, the Thompsons began
receiving donations too, including free day care, a Chevrolet van,
a lifetime supply of diapers, free toys until they are 15, and free
dental care. In December 1997, Howard University and the National
Political Congress of Black Women announced full four-year
scholarships for the babies.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the Thompsons moved from their apartment to a
six-bedroom home purchased by the Freddie Mac Foundation for
$210,000. Renovations costing $100,000 were covered by the
corporation and the donated services of several Washington
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Donations are still being accepted: The Thompson Family Fund,
c/o The Village Helpers Group, Attention: Deborah E. Reid, 1620 E.
12th St., 3-C, Brooklyn, NY 11229.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some months ago, I read about a cruise ship with cabins that
could be purchased like a condominium. What's that all about?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 958-foot vessel, called The World of ResidenSea, is the
brainchild of Knut Kloster Jr., whose father founded Norwegian
Caribbean Line, which later became Norwegian Cruise Line. It's
scheduled to be completed in early 2001, according to Christie's
Great Estates, marketing agent for the vessel in the Americas.
Condo-style suites and apartments range from $792,000 to more than
$3.6 million; annual maintenance fees range up to $302,600.
</P>
<P>
   While the concept resembles a floating condo, residents won't
really own their homes like condo owners do, according to a report
in Business Week. While documents are structured to resemble condo
agreements, residents actually would be buying a 50-year lease, the
magazine added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has any TV show other than ``The White Shadow'' won an Emmy
for its pilot?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. It's not ``exceptionally unusual,'' says Louise Danton,
archivist for the Television Academy of Arts and Sciences. But ``it
doesn't happen often,'' either. Last year, for example, an Emmy for
directing for a drama series was awarded to Mark Tinker for the
pilot of ``Brooklyn South,'' and two choreographers, Marguerite
Dericks and Peggy Holmes, won for choreography for the pilot of
``Fame.'' And there were pilot winners in previous years, too,
Danton said. You can find more information on the Television
Academy's Web site: www.emmys.org

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: PART TWO OF TWO TAKES.)
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: What is a nonreactive pan? I tried to make a lemon tart in a
regular pan and it didn't turn out right.
</P>
<P>
   A: What you need is a glass baking dish or a metal pan coated
with enamel, says nutritionist Connie Crawley of the University of
Georgia Cooperative Extension Service. Most other baking pans are
aluminum, and those tend to react with acidic foods, she adds. The
glass or enamel-coated wares are widely available, and the brand
doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've always enjoyed reading ``The Night Before Christmas'' at
this time of year. How old is this beloved poem? Can you tell me
anything about its author, Clement C. Moore?
</P>
<P>
   A: The popular ballad goes by several names, ``An Account of a
Visit From St. Nicholas,'' ``A Visit From St. Nicholas,'' and
simply by its first line, ``'Twas the Night Before Christmas.''
According to tradition, Clement Clarke Moore wrote the poem in 1822
as a Christmas present for his children. It was first published
anonymously on Dec. 23, 1823, in the Troy (N.Y.) Sentinel.
</P>
<P>
   Moore was born in New York in 1799; he died in 1863. He was a
biblical scholar who taught Greek and Oriental literature in the
Episcopal seminaries of New York from 1821 to 1850. There's some
dispute about the authorship of the holiday favorite; some people
have attributed it to Henry Livingston Jr., a New York land
surveyor who also composed poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Stolen art during World War II has been in the news lately.
I've been told that the French hid a large part of the Louvre's
collection so successfully that it was never found by invading
armies. Do you have any details?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was the declared intent of the German Nazis to take home a
long list of French masterpieces for a special new imperial museum.
The French reacted to that threat, and to the possibility of German
bombings of the Louvre and other museums, by taking their cherished
contents and secreting them around the countryside. Hector
Feliciano's book ``The Lost Museum: The Nazi Conspiracy to Steal
the World's Greatest Works of Art'' examines the subject of
artworks missing or lost in the war.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did Sen. Max Cleland get hurt in Vietnam? I've heard
several theories.
</P>
<P>
   A: Cleland (D-Ga.), who served in the Army from 1965 to 1968,
explained the incident in his own words in the November issue of
George magazine, which paid tribute to 20 Vietnam veterans serving
in Congress. This is what he said, in part:
</P>
<P>
   ``I was awake long before dawn on April 8, 1968. My tour of
Vietnam was almost over. . . . I volunteered for one more mission,
my last. My unit was sent to relieve the Marines in Khe Sanh. After
we landed at the base, the team unloaded our equipment from the
chopper. I called to the pilot that I was getting out. . . . I
jumped to the ground, ran in a crouch until I got clear of the
spinning helicopter blades, turned around, and watched the chopper
lift. Then I saw the grenade. . . . It must be mine, I thought.
Grenades had fallen off my web gear before. Shifting the M-16 to my
left hand and holding it behind me, I bent down to pick up the
grenade. A blinding explosion threw me backward.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleland, a captain, lost both legs and an arm. He was awarded a
Silver Star and a Bronze Star. Before being elected to the Senate,
he served as Georgia's secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What will be the time and azimuth of sunrise and sunset on
the winter solstice? What will be the elevation of the sun at noon
Dec. 21?
</P>
<P>
   A: The winter solstice occurs at 8:56 p.m. EST on Dec. 22, says
astronomer David Dundee at Fernbank Science Center in Atlanta. The
maximum elevation of the sun that day will be 33 degrees above the
horizon in the South. Sunrise will be at 7:39 that morning, sunset
at 5:33 that evening. For non-astronomers, the azimuth is an
angular measurement used to locate an object such as the moon or a
star. It's measured clockwise around the horizon from the north, or
south, to the object or the object's vertical circle with the
horizon. Dundee says the sun will rise at 118 degrees and set at
242 degrees; 90 degrees is east, zero degrees is north.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A&AMP;E's ``Biography'' recently featured the Rockefeller family.
What was the relationship between the Rockefeller who died on the
Titanic and John D. Rockefeller Sr.? Also, can you list John Sr.'s
descendants?
</P>
<P>
   A: Titanic's passenger list shows no Rockefeller aboard. You may
be thinking about millionaire John Jacob Astor or department store
owner Isidor Straus, both of whom were lost in the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   John Davison Rockefeller was the American businessman who made a
fortune in the petroleum industry and later became famous for his
philanthropy. Born in 1839, he died in 1937 in Ormond Beach, Fla.
His only son, John D. Rockefeller Jr. (1874-1960), continued his
father's philanthropic work. John D. Jr. had five sons: John D.
III, chairman of the Rockefeller Foundation 1952-71; Nelson,
governor of New York from late 1958 to 1973 and vice president from
1974 to '77; Laurance, a noted conservationist; Winthrop, governor
of Arkansas from 1967 to '71; and David, CEO of Chase Manhattan
Bank from 1969 to '80. John D. IV, by the way, was governor of West
Virginia from 1977 to '85 and has been a U.S. senator from West
Virginia since 1985.

   Q: I saw a picture of an old American flag with 15 stripes. I
thought the stripes represented the 13 original colonies. Can you
explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: On June 14, 1777, the Continental Congress resolved that the
U.S. flag would have 13 alternating red and white stripes
representing, as you say, the 13 original colonies. By 1794, two
new states had joined the Union, so Congress decided to add two
stripes (and two stars), with the 15-stripe version to be used
after May 1, 1795. By 1817 five more states had come into the
Union, but Congress didn't want the flag to have 20 stripes (and 20
stars) because it would be too cluttered. Peter Wendover, a House
member from New York, proposed a flag with 13 stripes, with a star
for each state. Congress accepted the idea, and April 4, 1818, it
set the number of stripes at 13 again.

   Q: A friend saw a report on CBS News recently concerning a new
drug to treat osteoporosis.Testing of the drug was a part of Sen.
John Glenn's regimen on his recent space voyage. Do you have any
information? My father is severely afflicted with this debilitating
disease.
</P>
<P>
   A: CBS News correspondent John Roberts was reporting on A1x1-11,
a drug that works by mimicking hormones produced by the parathyroid
glands. Those hormones help regulate the ongoing process of
renewing bone. The drug stimulates new bone growth and restores
lost bone mass, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   While drugs such as estrogen slow the breakdown process, A1x1-11
puts the rebuilding process into overdrive, rapidly increasing
density and strength, Roberts said. It appears that A1x1-11 is a
promising new way to attack osteoporosis without the cancer risks
associated with estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   When Glenn returned to space in October, he tested how the new
drug might prevent the bone loss astronauts suffer in zero gravity.
``Potentially, if we can work it out correctly, parathyroid hormone
would be the first of the agents that actually cures the disease of
osteoporosis in the spine,'' Dr. Robert Lindsay of the National
Osteoporosis Foundation told CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw where in September,Sen. Sen. Strom Thurmond became only
the second senator ever to cast 15,000 votes. Who was the first?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was 81-year-old Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.). He remains
about 140 votes ahead of Thurmond (R-S.C.), who is 96. When
Thurmond hit the 15,000-vote mark, his comment was this: ``I'm
speechless. The quality of the people in this body (the Senate) is
just outstanding, and I wish all of them stay here till they cast
15,000 votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it safe to drink Diet Coke after the expiration date? My
husband says the Nutrasweet in it changes chemically after a
certain time, and it shouldn't be consumed. I say it just loses
some of its fizz. Who is right?
</P>
<P>
   A: If this is a bet, your husband wins, because he's at least
partially correct. The loss of carbonation doesn't figure into it.
The expiration date on diet drinks is mainly to prevent you from
drinking something sweetened with aspartame _ the active ingredient
in Nutrasweet and Equal _ that is no longer sweet, said nutrition
expert Connie Crawley of the University of Georgia Cooperative
Extension Service. When it's stored over time in liquid, aspartame
tends to become unstable and less sweet. This is especially true
when temperatures are high and drinks are stored in a hot warehouse
or kept for long periods in a metal delivery truck. Technically
there's indeed a chemical change, Crawley said, but she added that
she knows of no danger or problem other than ``a poor-tasting
product.''
</P>
<P>
   As always with food concerns, you might want to follow the old
saying: If in doubt, throw it out.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: In two takes.)
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;(AT)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard about the discovery of stone bullets in the
Mediterranean Sea that were used in a battle 2,000 years ago. What
kind of weapon was used to fire such things? How big were the
bullets?
</P>
<P>
   A: Researchers say the projectiles were fired by catapults,
which worked on the same principle as slingshots, but on a larger
scale. Just before the battle for control of the Mediterranean
world began on Sept. 2, 31 B.C., the fleets of Octavian, fighting
against those of Marc Antony and Cleopatra, faced one another in
long parallel lines and launched thousands of stone balls. While
larger stone-throwing catapults were used on land, smaller ones
were used on the naval vessels because of their weight. The balls,
found and photographed on the sea floor in the battle zone, are
estimated to be between 4 and 6 inches in diameter and to weigh
between 3.3 and 10 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that there is an immediate need for an influx of cash
before construction can begin on the proposed World War II monument
in Washington. It would be helpful to know where to send donations.
Can you tell us?
</P>
<P>
   A: Call 1-800-639-4992 for information.
</P>
<P>
   Q: During the House Judiciary Committee hearings, members often
used the phrase ``strike the last word.'' What does that mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's a parliamentary tactic to extend debate time during the
amending process. The ``last word'' refers to the last word of the
pending amendment or bill. Motions to strike the last word actually
are nonsense amendments, or more technically, pro forma amendments
(amendments in form only).
</P>
<P>
   House members recognize that these motions to strike the last
word are used strictly to extend debate. They're not meant
literally to strike out the last word.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works. The House most often amends bills under the
``five-minute rule,'' which allots five minutes for the mover of an
amendment to explain it, and five minutes for an opponent. This
time can be extended only by unanimous consent, which is not always
forthcoming. With a total of only 10 minutes per amendment under
the regular order, the two principal members debating an amendment
often use up all the time and have none left to yield to other
members who wish to participate in the debate. However, members can
get five minutes of their own if they offer an amendment _ so
that's what they do. They move to strike the last word of the
pending amendment. They then are recognized for five minutes, which
they use not to discuss the merits of striking the last word of the
pending amendment, but instead to discuss its substantive content.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I keep seeing mention that there's one independent in the
House of Representatives. But the person is never identified. Who
is it? What is his or her voting record like?
</P>
<P>
   A: Rep. Bernard Sanders, just re-elected to his fifth term from
Vermont, is the only independent in Congress. He usually votes with
the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Donna Shalala, secretary of health and human services, was
named by the Sara Lee Corp. among women who are exceptional. I
recall that Shalala, commenting about Vietnam veterans, once was
criticized for saying ``They are not our best and brightest.'' What
was the context?
</P>
<P>
   A: The remark, made in April 1995, created a brief stir, fueled
by syndicated conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh and others.
Shalala, appearing on CNN's ``Capital Gang,'' was commenting about
a new book, ``In Retrospect: The Tragedy and Lessons of Vietnam,''
by Robert S. McNamara, secretary of defense in the Kennedy and
Johnson administrations.
</P>
<P>
   When it first was reported that Shalala had said ``the best and
the brightest sons'' did not go to Vietnam, Limbaugh and others
pounced, saying she was disparaging the men who fought there, with
Limbaugh adding that she ``should be forced to apologize for and
maybe even resign over'' the comment. Avis LaVelle, her
spokeswoman, said Shalala was misunderstood, and what she meant was
that ``the best and the brightest's sons'' were able to avoid
serving in the war.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Shalala, then-Veterans Affairs Secretary Jesse
Brown, a Vietnam veteran, wrote: ``I understand what you were
saying _ it is mainly the poorer kids of this country who have
traditionally fought our wars.'' Shalala also wrote to six
veterans' organizations, saying: ``I did not, and would never,
disparage or denigrate those who served our nation so valiantly.
The point I was making is that the burden of fighting the war fell
disproportionately on poor and middle-income families, and that the
sons of the so-called best and the brightest were rarely called.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Didn't Joe DiMaggio have a brother who also played
professional baseball? Is he still living? Can you tell us
something about him and his baseball career?
</P>
<P>
   A: Three DiMaggio brothers _ Vince, born Sept. 6, 1912; Joe,
Nov. 25, 1914; and Dom, Feb. 12, 1917 _ played professional
baseball. While Joe, the Yankee Clipper, was the most celebrated,
Dom and Vince each played in more than 1,000 Major League games.
Two other DiMaggio brothers didn't go into pro sports.
</P>
<P>
   Vince (Vincent Paul) died in 1986 after a bout with stomach
cancer. He played 10 seasons in the National League as an
outfielder with the Boston Braves. He also played with the
Cincinnati Reds, Pittsburgh Pirates, Philadelphia Phillies and New
York Giants. He had a career batting average of .249 with 125 home
runs and 584 runs batted in. He also had at one time the dubious
distinction of holding the Major League record for strikeouts with
134 in 1938 for the Braves. He retired from baseball in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   At last report, Dom (Dominic Paul) was splitting his time
between New England and his waterfront home in Florida. He broke in
with the Boston Red Sox in 1940, four years after brother Joe made
his debut with the New York Yankees. In 1949, Dom set a Red Sox
record for the longest hitting streak by a rookie: 34 games. He
retired from baseball in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What were the popular vote totals in the 1996 presidential
race between Bob Dole and Bill Clinton? What were the Electoral
College vote totals? How many states did each of them win?
</P>
<P>
   A: Clinton got 47,401,185 votes (49.25 percent of the total);
Dole got 39,197,469 (40.73 percent). Electoral College: Clinton
379; Dole 159. States: Clinton 31 and the District of Columbia;
Dole 19.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you give us an update on the Thompson sextuplets, the
first born to an African-American couple in the United States?
</P>
<P>
   A: Jacqueline and LindenThompson of Washington became the
parents of the nation's first black sextuplets May 8, 1997. One,
Allison Nicole, was stillborn, but the other five _ Octavio
Daniela, Stella Kimberly, Emily Elizabeth, Richard Linden and
Ann-Marie Amanda _ are doing well. Even though the one daughter
died, the family still refers to their babies as ``sextuplets.''
</P>
<P>
   The babies were virtually ignored by outsiders for six months,
until a published report contrasted their circumstances to the
attention poured on white septuplets born in November 1997 to Bobbi
and Kenny McCaughey in Iowa. After that, the Thompsons began
receiving donations too, including free day care, a Chevrolet van,
a lifetime supply of diapers, free toys until they are 15, and free
dental care. In December 1997, Howard University and the National
Political Congress of Black Women announced full four-year
scholarships for the babies.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the Thompsons moved from their apartment to a
six-bedroom home purchased by the Freddie Mac Foundation for
$210,000. Renovations costing $100,000 were covered by the
corporation and the donated services of several Washington
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Donations are still being accepted: The Thompson Family Fund,
c/o The Village Helpers Group, Attention: Deborah E. Reid, 1620 E.
12th St., 3-C, Brooklyn, NY 11229.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some months ago, I read about a cruise ship with cabins that
could be purchased like a condominium. What's that all about?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 958-foot vessel, called The World of ResidenSea, is the
brainchild of Knut Kloster Jr., whose father founded Norwegian
Caribbean Line, which later became Norwegian Cruise Line. It's
scheduled to be completed in early 2001, according to Christie's
Great Estates, marketing agent for the vessel in the Americas.
Condo-style suites and apartments range from $792,000 to more than
$3.6 million; annual maintenance fees range up to $302,600.
</P>
<P>
   While the concept resembles a floating condo, residents won't
really own their homes like condo owners do, according to a report
in Business Week. While documents are structured to resemble condo
agreements, residents actually would be buying a 50-year lease, the
magazine added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has any TV show other than ``The White Shadow'' won an Emmy
for its pilot?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. It's not ``exceptionally unusual,'' says Louise Danton,
archivist for the Television Academy of Arts and Sciences. But ``it
doesn't happen often,'' either. Last year, for example, an Emmy for
directing for a drama series was awarded to Mark Tinker for the
pilot of ``Brooklyn South,'' and two choreographers, Marguerite
Dericks and Peggy Holmes, won for choreography for the pilot of
``Fame.'' And there were pilot winners in previous years, too,
Danton said. You can find more information on the Television
Academy's Web site: www.emmys.org

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: PART TWO OF TWO TAKES.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: What is a nonreactive pan? I tried to make a lemon tart in a
regular pan and it didn't turn out right.
</P>
<P>
   A: What you need is a glass baking dish or a metal pan coated
with enamel, says nutritionist Connie Crawley of the University of
Georgia Cooperative Extension Service. Most other baking pans are
aluminum, and those tend to react with acidic foods, she adds. The
glass or enamel-coated wares are widely available, and the brand
doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've always enjoyed reading ``The Night Before Christmas'' at
this time of year. How old is this beloved poem? Can you tell me
anything about its author, Clement C. Moore?
</P>
<P>
   A: The popular ballad goes by several names, ``An Account of a
Visit From St. Nicholas,'' ``A Visit From St. Nicholas,'' and
simply by its first line, ``'Twas the Night Before Christmas.''
According to tradition, Clement Clarke Moore wrote the poem in 1822
as a Christmas present for his children. It was first published
anonymously on Dec. 23, 1823, in the Troy (N.Y.) Sentinel.
</P>
<P>
   Moore was born in New York in 1799; he died in 1863. He was a
biblical scholar who taught Greek and Oriental literature in the
Episcopal seminaries of New York from 1821 to 1850. There's some
dispute about the authorship of the holiday favorite; some people
have attributed it to Henry Livingston Jr., a New York land
surveyor who also composed poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Stolen art during World War II has been in the news lately.
I've been told that the French hid a large part of the Louvre's
collection so successfully that it was never found by invading
armies. Do you have any details?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was the declared intent of the German Nazis to take home a
long list of French masterpieces for a special new imperial museum.
The French reacted to that threat, and to the possibility of German
bombings of the Louvre and other museums, by taking their cherished
contents and secreting them around the countryside. Hector
Feliciano's book ``The Lost Museum: The Nazi Conspiracy to Steal
the World's Greatest Works of Art'' examines the subject of
artworks missing or lost in the war.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did Sen. Max Cleland get hurt in Vietnam? I've heard
several theories.
</P>
<P>
   A: Cleland (D-Ga.), who served in the Army from 1965 to 1968,
explained the incident in his own words in the November issue of
George magazine, which paid tribute to 20 Vietnam veterans serving
in Congress. This is what he said, in part:
</P>
<P>
   ``I was awake long before dawn on April 8, 1968. My tour of
Vietnam was almost over. . . . I volunteered for one more mission,
my last. My unit was sent to relieve the Marines in Khe Sanh. After
we landed at the base, the team unloaded our equipment from the
chopper. I called to the pilot that I was getting out. . . . I
jumped to the ground, ran in a crouch until I got clear of the
spinning helicopter blades, turned around, and watched the chopper
lift. Then I saw the grenade. . . . It must be mine, I thought.
Grenades had fallen off my web gear before. Shifting the M-16 to my
left hand and holding it behind me, I bent down to pick up the
grenade. A blinding explosion threw me backward.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleland, a captain, lost both legs and an arm. He was awarded a
Silver Star and a Bronze Star. Before being elected to the Senate,
he served as Georgia's secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What will be the time and azimuth of sunrise and sunset on
the winter solstice? What will be the elevation of the sun at noon
Dec. 21?
</P>
<P>
   A: The winter solstice occurs at 8:56 p.m. EST on Dec. 22, says
astronomer David Dundee at Fernbank Science Center in Atlanta. The
maximum elevation of the sun that day will be 33 degrees above the
horizon in the South. Sunrise will be at 7:39 that morning, sunset
at 5:33 that evening. For non-astronomers, the azimuth is an
angular measurement used to locate an object such as the moon or a
star. It's measured clockwise around the horizon from the north, or
south, to the object or the object's vertical circle with the
horizon. Dundee says the sun will rise at 118 degrees and set at
242 degrees; 90 degrees is east, zero degrees is north.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A&AMP;E's ``Biography'' recently featured the Rockefeller family.
What was the relationship between the Rockefeller who died on the
Titanic and John D. Rockefeller Sr.? Also, can you list John Sr.'s
descendants?
</P>
<P>
   A: Titanic's passenger list shows no Rockefeller aboard. You may
be thinking about millionaire John Jacob Astor or department store
owner Isidor Straus, both of whom were lost in the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   John Davison Rockefeller was the American businessman who made a
fortune in the petroleum industry and later became famous for his
philanthropy. Born in 1839, he died in 1937 in Ormond Beach, Fla.
His only son, John D. Rockefeller Jr. (1874-1960), continued his
father's philanthropic work. John D. Jr. had five sons: John D.
III, chairman of the Rockefeller Foundation 1952-71; Nelson,
governor of New York from late 1958 to 1973 and vice president from
1974 to '77; Laurance, a noted conservationist; Winthrop, governor
of Arkansas from 1967 to '71; and David, CEO of Chase Manhattan
Bank from 1969 to '80. John D. IV, by the way, was governor of West
Virginia from 1977 to '85 and has been a U.S. senator from West
Virginia since 1985.

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: Leave the jury alone
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best case the House Judiciary Committee has against Bill
Clinton is perjury. To paraphrase the president, it all depends on
what you mean by perjury. The committee didn't bother to specify.
It's apparently no fun getting into the boring details.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, while House members pondered impeachment, they
were being subjected to heavy pressure by their congressional
leadership and the White House. Moderate Republicans _ precise
number unknown, since GOP moderation is more a state of art than
science _ were targeted.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure from the House leadership seems the more intense, since
Republican Majority Whip Tom DeLay, the former exterminator from
the Houston suburbs, has reportedly threatened to ruin any
Republican who breaks ranks. In civilian life, this would be known
as jury tampering, and subject to strict handling by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   But the customs of the House, like F. Scott Fitzgerald's rich
folk, are different. That's what confused Mike Espy, the former
Agriculture secretary, who thought it was OK to receive carelessly
as a Cabinet member what he once took graciously as a House member.
Judiciary Republicans were at pains to denounce perjury as an
insult to the rule of law. How much better or worse is trifling
with the jury?

   1. MUCH ADO ABOUT GWYNETH PALTROW Why has Gwyneth Paltrow
reigned as America's It Girl for the last three years? Some might
attribute it to her undeniable style. Others might say it's her
ability to shine in small, unpredictable films, including ``Emma''
and ``Sliding Doors.'' Find out what writer Merle Ginsberg
discovered about Paltrow, who now stars in ``Shakespeare in Love''
in this Q&AMP;A interview. From WWD. 1,500 words + photos.
________________________________________________________ 2. ROCK
'N' GREED The Rolling Stones are charging up to $300 a ticket for
their upcoming arena tour - a gesture that has made them the new
poster boys for the runaway greed that is infecting the music
industry and changing its very fabric. By Steve Morse. From The
Boston Globe. 2,000 words. 3. A YOUNG TAKE ON OLD MEN Kirk Jones,
first-time feature-film writer and director, did not set out to
make a movie about old men. But when you come up with two lead
actors whose combined age is over 150 years, you have not made the
ordinary narcissistic about-my-life First Film. His comedy,
``Waking Ned Devine,'' was a quiet hit at Cannes earlier this year.
It is about an Irish wake -- but really about the human condition,
with the emphasis on geriatric imperatives. By M.R. Montgomery.
From The Boston Globe. 1,400 words. 4. BRENDA BLETHYNB FINDS HER
'VOICE' Brenda Blethyn seemed to come out of nowhere in 1996 to win
an Oscar nomination for her riveting performance in ``Secrets and
Lies.'' In fact, she had been working steadily in England as a
popular star of stage, screen and TV. Blethyn shows a very
different but no less remarkable side in ``Litle Voice,'' playing
the boozy, fast-talking mother of a strangely gifted daughter.
Blethyn had worked for 10 years in an office before turning to
acting. ``I didn't think acting was a reasonable profession,'' she
says. By Joshua Mooney. BPI. 1,100 words. 5. JOHN TRAVOLTA'S
'CIVIL' WAR FOR RESPECT If ``A Civil Action'' wins John Travolta
the Oscar that many are predicting, it will cap his remarkable
comeback. Now he is rich, famous, happily married and the father of
an adored son. In this interview he talks about the new film, the
challenge of playing a cynical, detached, arrogant and insensitive
lawyer in his most serious film in years, why he candidly admits he
would love to win an Oscar for the role and how he views his
controversial Scientology religion. By Cindy Pearlman. 1,400 words
+ photo. 6. MAYA ANGELOU : A NEW ROAD LEADS 'DOWN IN THE DELTA'
Maya Angelou earned fame as a poet, but she's also a playwright,
teacher, mother, actress and civil-rights advocate - and now a film
director. Making her improbable debut at age 70, Angelou has
directed ``Down in the Delta,'' a subtle family drama which is
earning glowing reviews. In this interview she talks about the new
film, why she chose to direct a story written by someone else, why
she wanted to direct a film now and why, aging aside, she's still
enthralled by every opportunity for new experiences. By Ian
Spelling. 1,400 words + photo. 7. HAS GUS VAN SANT GONE PSYCHO?
When the director of ``Drugstore Cowboy'' and ``My Own Private
Idaho'' announced his shot-by-shot remake of the Hitchcock classic
thriller ``Psycho,'' cinephiles screamed sellout. But it may be Gus
Van Sant's most experimental film yet. By R.J. Smith. From The New
York Times Magazine. Full-length (3,000 words) + edited article
available.
_______________________________________________________________ 8.
DODGING THE DETECTORS Engineers in Britain who have spent the past
two years developing a hand-held device to detect illicit TV sets
will soon be overtaken by changing technology. While their detector
is great at spotting the radio frequencies emitted by the
cathode-ray tubes used in conventional sets, it is blind to the new
flat-panel displays. By Barry Fox. From New Scientist magazine.
(N/A Brazil, Australia, New Zealand.) 400 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 9.
BURT BEHIND BARS It seems a long time ago that Burt Reynolds was
associated mainly with stories about a messy divorce, financial
entanglements and allegations of failing health. In this interview
Reynolds talks about his renewed career, past hits, why he doesn't
consider himself to be engaged in a comeback and why he owes his
entire career to two people : Actress Joanne Woodward and a
literature teacher named Watson Duncan. By Jean Oppenheimer. 1,400
words + photo. Please fax to Paris 33.1.47.42.80.44 or
33.1.47.42.18.81

   Insects can help solve murders, but their testimony is being
attacked in the courts. Forensic entomologists say their science
offers the most reliable way of determining the time of death at a
crime scene, short of an eyewitness. Insects populate the human
corpse _ or any carcass _ in predictable waves over the course of
weeks. An entomologist must then knit together the arrival and
departure of several kinds of insects that visit the body in a more
or less orderly succession. Jessica Snyder Sachs, a former editor
of Science Digest who is based in the Atlanta area, reports.

   A recent study at the University of California at San Francisco
cultured 113 examples of cash. Most grew harmless organisms, but 18
percent of coins and 7 percent of notes had some less friendly
bacteria on them, including the odd colony of Escherichia coli and
the potential pathogen S. aureus. So Mom was right when she would
yell, ``Don't put that in your mouth. You don't know where it's

   If you want to see a time machine, go to room 2677 on the second
floor of the geology building at UCLA. Once you pass into the inner
sanctum, you are faced with a 5-foot-tall, 20-foot-wide piece of
equipment housed in stainless steel. This is the time machine. This
device, however, will not accept human passengers. What goes inside
is a flake of rock. By analyzing the atoms in the rock, this
machine can take you back to the time when the Himalayas arose, or
when life appeared on Earth. Kathy A. Svitil, an associate editor

   People can talk. Other animals can't. The birds and beasts can
use signals to attract, threaten or alert each other, but they
can't ask questions or strike bargains. Those skills make Homo
sapiens a uniquely successful, powerful and dangerous mammal.
Grooves and holes in fossil skulls may reveal when our ancestors
began to speak. The big question, though, is what drove them to it?

anthropology and studies animal locomotion, reports. Cartmill is

   Insects can help solve murders, but their testimony is being
attacked in the courts. Forensic entomologists say their science
offers the most reliable way of determining the time of death at a
crime scene, short of an eyewitness. Insects populate the human
corpse _ or any carcass _ in predictable waves over the course of
weeks. An entomologist must then knit together the arrival and
departure of several kinds of insects that visit the body in a more
or less orderly succession. Jessica Snyder Sachs, a former editor
of Science Digest who is based in the Atlanta area, reports.

 By JESSICA SNYDER SACHS  
 c.1998 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   In the cow town of Stroud, Okla., no one thinks twice about a
junk pile alongside a neighbor's driveway. But people paid
attention to the pile by Aureliano Cisneros's house, thanks to the
thick swarm of shiny, fat flies and a ripening stench.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 8, 1994, police discovered within that junk pile the
decaying, maggot-packed body of Cisneros himself. Apparently, after
being stabbed in the chest and neck, he had collapsed in front of
his house.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicion quickly fell on Cisneros's wife, Linda Howell. They'd
argued publicly the previous Thursday night, she acknowledged, but
they'd made up before morning. She hadn't seen her husband for two
days, since the evening of Saturday, Aug. 6, when he left home to
join some buddies.
</P>
<P>
   The police didn't buy her story and arrested her for the murder
of her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when Jackie Johnson, a deputy inspector at the Oklahoma
State Bureau of Investigation, looked over the forensic evidence,
she wasn't very confident about the case. Ironically, it was
Howell's defense attorney, Frank Muret, who led Johnson to the
evidence she needed.
</P>
<P>
   When she was handing over the forensic reports to Muret, he
asked if they had looked at the maggots on the corpse. If they had,
he was entitled to know what they'd found.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Muret walked out the door, Johnson picked up her
phone. Two calls later, she had located Neal Haskell, a forensic
entomologist _ a scientist trained in gleaning criminal information
from insects. He is, in fact, the world's only full-time forensic
entomologist.
</P>
<P>
   Haskell identified the larvae as belonging to two common flies:
the black blowfly and the secondary screwworm. He then determined
that these maggots were in their third developmental stage, or
instar.
</P>
<P>
   Since temperature influences the pace at which flies develop, he
consulted the temperature records from the nearest weather
stations, then calculated that the maggots had come from eggs laid
on the body 72 to 96 hours before discovery. Cisneros could have
died no later than the morning of Aug. 5 _ a day earlier than
Howell claimed she had last seen her husband alive.
</P>
<P>
   When faced with the scientific evidence, Howell's lawyer called
the calculations guesswork, and urged the judge to rule Haskell's
testimony inadmissible. The judge admitted the testimony. Soon
afterward Howell accepted a plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Disputes over the courtroom legitimacy of entomological evidence
are becoming more frequent and more pointed. Forensic entomologists
say it's worth the struggle, because their science offers the most
reliable way of determining the time of death at a crime scene,
short of an eyewitness.
</P>
<P>
   Insects populate the human corpse _ or any carcass _ in
predictable waves over the course of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The first to arrive are the husky bombardiers known as
blowflies. Once these flies depart, an entomologist must then knit
together the arrival and departure of several other kinds of
insects that visit the body in a more or less orderly succession.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Hawaii entomologist Lee Goff handled a particularly
grisly case in which the decomposed corpse of a Marine _ with an
execution-style bullet wound _ was found in a rain forest on Oahu.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Goff arrived, most of the blowflies had already come
and gone, but a host of other insects were still busy with the
corpse. Among them, Goff found soldier flies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They let the body age for about 20 days before coming in,'' he
says. ``And the ones I collected were fifth instars, between 9 and
11 days old.''
</P>
<P>
   Goff thus placed time of death at 29 to 31 days before the
body's discovery. Military police confronted two Marines seen with
the victim 30 days earlier, and they confessed.
</P>
<P>
   Part of what makes the method work so well for Goff is Hawaii's
isolation and its relatively limited number of insect species.
Experts on the mainland find it harder to make such definitive
analyses. They often encounter dozens of different cadaver-loving
insects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unusual to find ourselves estimating the
developmental time of a lesser-known insect based on that of a
close relative that's been better studied,'' admits forensic
entomologist Robert Hall of the University of Missouri. ``On
cross-examination, a good lawyer will say, 'So, Dr. Hall, what
you're telling us is you're guessing.'''
</P>
<P>
   For forensic entomologists to answer such challenges requires
thousands of hours of research and legions of graduate students,
but these are hard to come by in their underfunded field.
</P>
<P>
   A noticeable exception has been a program set up by Gail
Anderson of Simon Fraser University, largely funded by the Canadian
Police Research Center. Anderson's students camp out across the
rugged landscape of British Columbia year-round, each baby-sitting
the carcasses of several dozen pigs.
</P>
<P>
   To simulate real-life homicides, some of the victims lie buried
in soil or partially submerged in streams or lakes. In 1995,
Anderson's students began clothing some of their pigs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Canada, at least, most of our murder victims are dressed,''
she explains. ``We needed to document whether this altered insect
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   The research raised eyebrows across North America when a school
newspaper intercepted a grad student's e-mail request for used
panties and bras. Wire services quickly spread the story: Wanted:
Pig Underwear.
</P>
<P>
   By studying pigs in underwear, the entomologists learned some
important things _ that clothing, for instance, helps conserve
moisture in a corpse, so that it will remain attractive to
blowflies longer than if it is naked, and that maggots tend to eat
the skin when a body is clothed but not if it is unclothed.
</P>
<P>
   As forensic entomologists struggle to make determining time of
death court-proof, recent work has begun to push the science's
powers in new directions.
</P>
<P>
   At the FBI's National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime
in Quantico, Va., entomologist Wayne Lord is perfecting a method
for tracing DNA found in bloodsucking insects to the humans on
which they have fed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only a matter of time before we put this research to work
in an actual case,'' Lord says. ``Most likely it will involve a
rape and murder, in which the suspect's blood is retrieved from
crab lice left on the victim.''
</P>
<P>
   Lord is still determining the feasibility of this approach, but
he is confident it will work. If he's right, then someday one more
previously mute witness will speak for the dead.

<P>
   In the cow town of Stroud, Okla., no one thinks twice about a
junk pile alongside a neighbor's driveway. But people paid
attention to the pile by Aureliano Cisneros's house, thanks to the
thick swarm of shiny, fat flies and a ripening stench.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 8, 1994, police discovered within that junk pile the
decaying, maggot-packed body of Cisneros himself. Apparently, after
being stabbed in the chest and neck, he had collapsed in front of
his house.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicion quickly fell on Cisneros's wife, Linda Howell. They'd
argued publicly the previous Thursday night, she acknowledged, but
they'd made up before morning. She hadn't seen her husband for two
days, since the evening of Saturday, Aug. 6, when he left home to
join some buddies.
</P>
<P>
   The police didn't buy her story and arrested her for the murder
of her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when Jackie Johnson, a deputy inspector at the Oklahoma
State Bureau of Investigation, looked over the forensic evidence,
she wasn't very confident about the case. Ironically, it was
Howell's defense attorney, Frank Muret, who led Johnson to the
evidence she needed.
</P>
<P>
   When she was handing over the forensic reports to Muret, he
asked if they had looked at the maggots on the corpse. If they had,
he was entitled to know what they'd found.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Muret walked out the door, Johnson picked up her
phone. Two calls later, she had located Neal Haskell, a forensic
entomologist _ a scientist trained in gleaning criminal information
from insects. He is, in fact, the world's only full-time forensic
entomologist.
</P>
<P>
   Haskell identified the larvae as belonging to two common flies:
the black blowfly and the secondary screwworm. He then determined
that these maggots were in their third developmental stage, or
instar.
</P>
<P>
   Since temperature influences the pace at which flies develop, he
consulted the temperature records from the nearest weather
stations, then calculated that the maggots had come from eggs laid
on the body 72 to 96 hours before discovery. Cisneros could have
died no later than the morning of Aug. 5 _ a day earlier than
Howell claimed she had last seen her husband alive.

<P>
   Saint Paul and your mother have always agreed about one thing:
Money is dirty. The peevish apostle worried about what lucre does
to the soul, while your mom worried about what money might do to
your body. Don't put it in your mouth, she'd say, you don't know
where it's been.
</P>
<P>
   You don't, but you can just imagine. Money is used for every
type of commerce, from buying milk at the corner store to
trafficking in sex and drugs. All this trade is rough on money.
</P>
<P>
   Even though paper bills (actually a rugged mix of 75 percent
cotton, 25 percent linen) are made to take abuse (4,000 folds in
each direction), the average U.S. dollar lasts a mere 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Moms the world over have done a fine job of convincing us money
is full of disgusting germs. Oddly, though, studies of bacteria on
money are few and far between.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972 a study in the Journal of the American Medical
Association cultured bacteria from 200 coins and bills and found
objectionable ones like fecal bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus on
13 percent of coins and 42 percent of notes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 a study published in Infections in Medicine found 3
percent of coins and 11 percent of bills growing bacteria, but only
benign ones, and decided ``our country seems to have cleaned up its
act.''
</P>
<P>
   Both studies used money collected in hospitals. Rigorous
scrubbing by doctors and nurses could leave their hands _ and money
_ exceptionally clean. Maybe differing hygienic practices account
for the studies' disparity.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, a study at the University of California at
San Francisco cultured 113 examples of ``real life'' cash. Most
grew harmless organisms, but 18 percent of coins and 7 percent of
notes had some less friendly bacteria on them, including the odd
colony of Escherichia coli and the potential pathogen S. aureus.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, these organisms usually spell trouble only if they
somehow breach the skin in large numbers. You're not likely to get
sick from the few bugs your hands encounter on a coin.
</P>
<P>
   What will be obvious by now is that anything that gets on hands
can get on money. And hands are hardly germ-free.
</P>
<P>
   In general, though, skin resists being colonized or invaded by
foreign bacteria. Its horny outer layer forms an efficient barrier,
its surface is too dry or too acidic for many nonresident species,
and its surface oils contain antimicrobials.
</P>
<P>
   In the mouth, saliva _ our natural mouthwash _ contains
germ-killing enzymes and the antibody immunoglobulin A. Any microbe
that makes it past the skin or the mouth's pink lining must contend
with the body's immune system. And any microbe that's swallowed
faces the acid test of the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   If money has a dirty little secret, it's not bugs but drugs. For
the past decade, there have been sporadic reports that U.S.
currency is hopelessly contaminated with cocaine. Is our money
snowed under?
</P>
<P>
   A study conducted at the Houston Advanced Research Center in
Texas and the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois examined
currency in Miami, Chicago and Houston and found an overall 70 to
80 percent contamination rate, with single dollar bills more
commonly contaminated than higher denominations.
</P>
<P>
   A recent look at money circulating in northern Illinois,
published this May in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, found even
higher rates: close to 93 percent of the sample, and 100 percent of
$20 bills, tested positive for cocaine. ``In fact, most Americans
handle small amounts of cocaine every day, not as packets sold by
drug dealers but on the dollar bills that line their pockets,''
concluded this study.
</P>
<P>
   How has moola become so amazingly infested with cocaine?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, the reason you traffic in drugs is to get money,'' comes
the deadpan reply from a spokesman for the Drug Enforcement
Administration who has worked undercover in narcotics and asked not
to be identified by name. ``When drugs come into the country,
traffickers are going to cut the dope with any number of chemicals.
Open the bags, mix in the cut, repackage in smaller bags, sell to
people who sell on the streets. All the time money's changing
hands. It's hard to keep money and drugs apart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But that can't be the whole story,'' adds Tom Jourdan, chief
of the materials and devices unit at the Federal Bureau of
Investigation Laboratory in Washington. The going theory, held by
Jourdan and others, is that one bill brushed through a counting
machine in a bank could contaminate a whole stack.
</P>
<P>
   Something in paper money seems to be binding to cocaine almost
like a biological receptor, and Jourdan thinks that something is
ink: ``I've wiped an old bill on white paper, and ink comes off.
The green pigment never really dries, and drugs of abuse get stuck
to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cocaine dissolves in almost anything _ water, alcohol, fat. And
it sticks quite nicely to skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does that mean your grandmother in the Midwest is going to be
contaminated by a bill handled by a drug dealer in Chicago?'' asks
David Kidwell, a chemist at the Naval Research Laboratory in
Washington. ``Not very likely. If money's freshly dusted with
cocaine, it will get on you, of course. But once money's been
handled and passed through machines, it's too deeply embedded.''
</P>
<P>
   Simulation studies at Argonne and a ``real life'' test at
Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska, apparently bear him out.
For the Creighton study, bank tellers were swabbed after a
four-hour shift handling cash. Although cocaine was found on the
cash (even in rural Nebraska), none was transferred to the tellers'
hands.
</P>
<P>
   So money isn't exactly squeaky clean. But it isn't exactly going
to do us in, either. If there's a lesson here, it's that money
reflects whatever activity, and mischief, human hands get up to _
and the activity and occasional mischief of all the microscopic
organisms along for the ride on our skin.

hands. It's hard to keep money and drugs apart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But that can't be the whole story,'' adds Tom Jourdan, chief
of the materials and devices unit at the Federal Bureau of
Investigation Laboratory in Washington. The going theory, held by
Jourdan and others, is that one bill brushed through a counting
machine in a bank could contaminate a whole stack.
</P>
<P>
   Something in paper money seems to be binding to cocaine almost
like a biological receptor, and Jourdan thinks that something is
ink: ``I've wiped an old bill on white paper, and ink comes off.
The green pigment never really dries, and drugs of abuse get stuck
to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cocaine dissolves in almost anything _ water, alcohol, fat. And
it sticks quite nicely to skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does that mean your grandmother in the Midwest is going to be
contaminated by a bill handled by a drug dealer in Chicago?'' asks
David Kidwell, a chemist at the Naval Research Laboratory in
Washington. ``Not very likely. If money's freshly dusted with
cocaine, it will get on you, of course. But once money's been
handled and passed through machines, it's too deeply embedded.''
</P>
<P>
   Simulation studies at Argonne and a ``real life'' test at
Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska, apparently bear him out.
For the Creighton study, bank tellers were swabbed after a
four-hour shift handling cash. Although cocaine was found on the
cash (even in rural Nebraska), none was transferred to the tellers'
hands.
</P>
<P>
   So money isn't exactly squeaky clean. But it isn't exactly going
to do us in, either. If there's a lesson here, it's that money
reflects whatever activity, and mischief, human hands get up to _
and the activity and occasional mischief of all the microscopic
organisms along for the ride on our skin.

   If you want to see a time machine, go to room 2677 on the second
floor of the geology building at UCLA. Once you pass into the inner
sanctum, you are faced with a 5-foot-tall, 20-foot-wide piece of
equipment housed in stainless steel. This is the time machine.
</P>
<P>
   This device, however, will not accept human passengers. What
goes inside is a flake of rock. By analyzing the atoms in the rock,
this machine can take you back to the time when the Himalayas
arose, or when life appeared on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The official name of this place is the National Science
Foundation/Keck Foundation National Ion Microprobe Facility. The
name of the machine is the Cameca 1270.
</P>
<P>
   There are other ion microprobes, but the one at UCLA is by far
the best. They all work by sorting and counting isotopes.
</P>
<P>
   If you remember basic chemistry, you'll recall that isotopes are
the various forms an element can take. Once created, many isotopes
are stable.
</P>
<P>
   Carbon 12 and carbon 13, for example, can be found in our solar
system in the same ratio that they were in when the solar system
formed some 4.5 billion years ago. Living things prefer carbon 12
to carbon 13, so the minerals and fossils that have contained life
always have more, relative to nonliving things, of the lighter
isotope.
</P>
<P>
   Not all isotopes are stable, though. Some will release particles
and metamorphose into entirely different elements, and they do so
at a predictable rate. Some break down after just fractions of a
second; others in quadrillions of years. Isotopes can thus act as
clocks, each working on its own timescale.
</P>
<P>
   But decoding the history written in isotopes is not simple,
because it is sometimes inscribed on mineral crystals only a few
thousandths of an inch across, buried inside younger rock. To
detect them, you need an ion microprobe _ ideally, UCLA's ion
microprobe.
</P>
<P>
   The UCLA machine is the brainchild of isotopic chemist Mark
Harrison. It analyzes isotopes by liberating them from the rock
that holds them captive.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers embed the target flake in a one-inch block of resin
and fire a beam of charged atoms, or ions, at the block. When the
beam strikes the sample, some of its momentum is transferred to the
atoms on the surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them will have enough energy imparted to them that
they'll ionize,'' Harrison says.
</P>
<P>
   These new ions form a cloud, which the microprobe can corral in
a 10,000-volt electric field. The ions can then be sorted by their
charge and by their mass as they pass through a giant magnet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heavier ions take a wider path through the magnet because the
magnet is unable to deflect them as much,'' Harrison says.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the ions crash into a detector at the end of the
machine in an orderly ranking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we can just count them,'' Harrison says.
</P>
<P>
   With its four-ton magnet, the Cameca 1270 can distinguish
between molecules that differ in mass by just one part in 8,000,
and analyze specks of mineral less than four-millionths of an inch
across. That sort of precision has led to some exciting
discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   For example, geologist Stephen Mojzsis and his Scripps
Institution of Oceanography colleague Gustaf Arrhenius used the
microprobe to look at the ratio of carbon 13 to carbon 12 in
3.85-billion-year-old sedimentary rocks from an island on the
southwest coast of Greenland.
</P>
<P>
   (The oldest previously known sign of life was
3.45-billion-year-old fossils of microbes.)
</P>
<P>
   If Earth had been lifeless 3.85 billion years ago, the crystals
in the rock should have had the same ratio found throughout the
lifeless solar system. But the proportion was actually off by a few
percent _ ``Far and away above anything that is inorganic,''
Mojzsis says.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, scientists have begun to wonder if life also left its
mark on Mars. In 1996, NASA scientists announced that they had
found microscopic fossils and other signs of biological activity in
a Martian meteorite that had landed in Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Leshin, a cosmochemist at UCLA, decided to use the
microprobe to analyze the tiny globules of carbonate inside the
meteorite where these supposed signs of life were. The type of
oxygen isotope that a carbonate incorporates into its structure
depends greatly on temperature.
</P>
<P>
   A carbonate that forms at a relatively cool temperature will be
enriched in oxygen 18 compared with carbonates that form at warmer
temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   In NASA's meteorite, Leshin found that the ratio of oxygen 18 to
oxygen 16 varied wildly between different carbonate globules.
Several scenarios could explain the ratios _ none of them very
friendly to life.
</P>
<P>
   Leshin's results now stand as a major question mark to the claim
for life on Mars.
</P>
<P>
   The Cameca 1270's sharp focus recently allowed Harrison to put a
new date on the birth of the Himalayas. Scientists had long
believed that the mountain range was built some 19 to 25 million
years ago. Harrison got hold of garnets that had formed in the
intense pressures of the primary fault in the Himalayas. Inside the
garnets were tiny crystals rich in the element thorium, which
decays into lead 208 with clocklike regularity.
</P>
<P>
   Using the ion microprobe, Harrison was able to measure the
thorium and lead in the crystals and was surprised to discover that
they were only 4 to 8 million years old. The Himalayas actually
arose over 10 million years more recently than anyone had thought.
</P>
<P>
   As researchers continue to explore the Cameca 1270's powers,
Harrison believes that the only limit they will encounter won't be
the machine's technical capabilities but the inherent limits in the
isotopes themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get to smaller and smaller domains _ to see
behavior, to see gradients, to see signals that we haven't had
access to before. But because we are looking at such small domains,
with relatively few atoms, we are beginning to run into the
statistical limits of our chronometers,'' Harrison says. ``It's not
a problem now, but in a few years we'll have to deal with it.''

 By MATT CARTMILL

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   People can talk. Other animals can't. The birds and beasts can
use signals to attract, threaten or alert each other, but they
can't ask questions, strike bargains, tell stories or lay out a
plan of action. Those skills make Homo sapiens a uniquely
successful, powerful and dangerous mammal.
</P>
<P>
   Other creatures' signals carry only a few limited kinds of
information about what's happening at the moment, but language lets
us tell each other in limitless detail about what used to be or
will be or might be.
</P>
<P>
   Without language, we would be only a sort of upright chimpanzee
with funny feet and clever hands. With it, we are the
self-possessed masters of the planet.
</P>
<P>
   We can reasonably assume that by at least 30,000 years ago
people were talking _ at any rate, they were producing tokens of
art and religion, high-level forms of symbolic behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Language surely goes back further than that, but archaeologists
don't agree on just how far. Paleontologists have pored over the
fossil bones of our ancient relatives in search of evidence for
speech abilities.
</P>
<P>
   All mammals produce their vocal noises by contracting muscles
that compress the rib cage. The air in the lungs is driven out
through the windpipe to the larynx, where it flows between the
vocal cords. These structures vibrate in the breeze, producing a
buzzing sound that becomes the voice.
</P>
<P>
   In people, the larynx lies well below the back of the tongue,
and most of the air goes out through the mouth when we talk. But in
most mammals, including apes, the larynx sticks farther up behind
the tongue, into the back of the nose, and most of the exhaled air
passes out through the nostrils. Nonhuman mammals make mostly nasal
sounds as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Lieberman of Brown University thinks that an apelike
throat persisted for some time in our hominid ancestors. His
studies of fossil jaws and skulls persuade him that a more modern
throat didn't evolve until some 500,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This year my colleague Richard Kay, his student Michelle Balow
and I were able to offer support for Lieberman's ideas from another
part of the hominid body.
</P>
<P>
   The tongue's movements are controlled almost solely by a nerve
called the hypoglossal. In its course from the brain to the tongue,
this nerve passes through a hole in the skull. Kay, Balow and I
found that this bony canal is relatively big in modern humans _
about twice as big in cross section as that of a like-size
chimpanzee.
</P>
<P>
   Our larger canal presumably reflects a bigger hypoglossal nerve,
giving us the precise control over tongue movements that we need
for speech.
</P>
<P>
   We also measured this hole in the skulls of a number of fossil
hominids. Australopithecines have small canals like those of apes,
suggesting that they couldn't talk. But later skulls from the genus
Homo, beginning with a 400,000-year-old skull from Zambia, all have
big, humanlike hypoglossal canals. These are also the skulls that
were the first to house brains as big as our own.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years ago most linguists thought that people learn to talk
through the same sort of behavior reinforcement used in training an
animal to do tricks: When children use a word correctly or produce
a grammatical sentence, they are rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   This picture was swept away in the late 1950s by the
revolutionary ideas of Noam Chomsky. Chomsky argued that we are all
born with the same fundamental grammar hard-wired into our brains,
and we are preprogrammed to pick up the additional rules of the
local language, just as baby ducks are hard-wired to follow the
first big animal they see when they hatch.
</P>
<P>
   If language learning were just a matter of proper training,
Chomsky reasoned, we ought to be able to teach English to lab rats,
or at least to apes.
</P>
<P>
   As we have seen, apes aren't built to talk. But they can be
trained to use sign language or to point to word-symbols on a
keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   Duane Rumbaugh and Sue Savage-Rumbaugh work at the Yerkes
Regional Primate Research Center in Atlanta, where Sue made a
surprising breakthrough with a young bonobo named Kanzi.
</P>
<P>
   Kanzi had watched his mother try to learn signs with little
success. When Sue started with Kanzi, she was astonished to
discover that he already knew the meaning of 12 of the keyboard
symbols. Apparently, he had learned them without any training or
rewards.
</P>
<P>
   In the years that followed, he learned new symbols quickly and
used them both to answer questions and to ``talk'' about things
that he intended to do or had already done. Still more amazingly,
he had a considerable understanding of spoken English _ including
its syntax.
</P>
<P>
   In their forthcoming book, ``Lingua ex Machina,'' neuroscientist
William Calvin of the University of Washington and linguist Derek
Bickerton of the University of Hawaii argue that the ability to
create symbols _ signs that refer to things _ is potentially
present in any animal that can learn to interpret natural signs,
such as a trail of footprints. Syntax, meanwhile, emerges from the
abstract thought required for a social life.
</P>
<P>
   In apes and some other mammals with complex and subtle social
relationships, individuals make alliances and act altruistically
toward others, with the implicit understanding that their favors
will be returned. These foreshadowings of symbols and syntax, they
propose, laid the groundwork for language in a lot of social
animals but didn't create language itself. That had to wait until
our ancestors evolved brains big enough to handle the large-scale
operations needed to generate and process complex strings of signs.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin and Bickerton suggest that brain enlargement in our
ancestry was the result of evolutionary pressures that favored
intelligence and motor coordination for making tools and throwing
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   As a side effect of these selection pressures, human evolution
crossed a threshold at which language became possible.
</P>
<P>
   This account may be wrong in some of its details, but the story
in its broad outlines solves so many puzzles and ties up so many
loose ends that something like it must surely be correct. It also
promises to resolve our conflicting views of the boundary between
people and animals.
</P>
<P>
   The story of language origins sketched above suggests that the
human difference is real and profound, but it is rooted in aspects
of psychology and biology that we share with our close animal
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   If the growing consensus on the origins of language can join
these disparate truths together, it will be a big step forward in
the study of human evolution.

   People can talk. Other animals can't. The birds and beasts can
use signals to attract, threaten or alert each other, but they
can't ask questions, strike bargains, tell stories or lay out a
plan of action. Those skills make Homo sapiens a uniquely
successful, powerful and dangerous mammal.
</P>
<P>
   Other creatures' signals carry only a few limited kinds of
information about what's happening at the moment, but language lets
us tell each other in limitless detail about what used to be or
will be or might be.
</P>
<P>
   Without language, we would be only a sort of upright chimpanzee
with funny feet and clever hands. With it, we are the
self-possessed masters of the planet.
</P>
<P>
   We can reasonably assume that by at least 30,000 years ago
people were talking _ at any rate, they were producing tokens of
art and religion, high-level forms of symbolic behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Language surely goes back further than that, but archaeologists
don't agree on just how far. Paleontologists have pored over the
fossil bones of our ancient relatives in search of evidence for
speech abilities.
</P>
<P>
   All mammals produce their vocal noises by contracting muscles
that compress the rib cage. The air in the lungs is driven out
through the windpipe to the larynx, where it flows between the
vocal cords. These structures vibrate in the breeze, producing a
buzzing sound that becomes the voice.
</P>
<P>
   In people, the larynx lies well below the back of the tongue,
and most of the air goes out through the mouth when we talk. But in
most mammals, including apes, the larynx sticks farther up behind
the tongue, into the back of the nose, and most of the exhaled air
passes out through the nostrils. Nonhuman mammals make mostly nasal
sounds as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Lieberman of Brown University thinks that an apelike
throat persisted for some time in our hominid ancestors. His
studies of fossil jaws and skulls persuade him that a more modern
throat didn't evolve until some 500,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This year my colleague Richard Kay, his student Michelle Balow
and I were able to offer support for Lieberman's ideas from another
part of the hominid body.
</P>
<P>
   The tongue's movements are controlled almost solely by a nerve
called the hypoglossal. In its course from the brain to the tongue,
this nerve passes through a hole in the skull. Kay, Balow and I
found that this bony canal is relatively big in modern humans _
about twice as big in cross section as that of a like-size
chimpanzee.
</P>
<P>
   Our larger canal presumably reflects a bigger hypoglossal nerve,
giving us the precise control over tongue movements that we need
for speech.
</P>
<P>
   We also measured this hole in the skulls of a number of fossil
hominids. Australopithecines have small canals like those of apes,
suggesting that they couldn't talk. But later skulls from the genus
Homo, beginning with a 400,000-year-old skull from Zambia, all have
big, humanlike hypoglossal canals. These are also the skulls that
were the first to house brains as big as our own.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years ago most linguists thought that people learn to talk
through the same sort of behavior reinforcement used in training an
animal to do tricks: When children use a word correctly or produce
a grammatical sentence, they are rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   This picture was swept away in the late 1950s by the
revolutionary ideas of Noam Chomsky. Chomsky argued that we are all
born with the same fundamental grammar hard-wired into our brains,
and we are preprogrammed to pick up the additional rules of the
local language, just as baby ducks are hard-wired to follow the
first big animal they see when they hatch.
</P>
<P>
   If language learning were just a matter of proper training,
Chomsky reasoned, we ought to be able to teach English to lab rats,
or at least to apes.
</P>
<P>
   As we have seen, apes aren't built to talk. But they can be
trained to use sign language or to point to word-symbols on a
keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   Duane Rumbaugh and Sue Savage-Rumbaugh work at the Yerkes
Regional Primate Research Center in Atlanta, where Sue made a
surprising breakthrough with a young bonobo named Kanzi.
</P>
<P>
   Kanzi had watched his mother try to learn signs with little
success. When Sue started with Kanzi, she was astonished to
discover that he already knew the meaning of 12 of the keyboard
symbols. Apparently, he had learned them without any training or
rewards.
</P>
<P>
   In the years that followed, he learned new symbols quickly and
used them both to answer questions and to ``talk'' about things
that he intended to do or had already done. Still more amazingly,
he had a considerable understanding of spoken English _ including
its syntax.
</P>
<P>
   In their forthcoming book, ``Lingua ex Machina,'' neuroscientist
William Calvin of the University of Washington and linguist Derek
Bickerton of the University of Hawaii argue that the ability to
create symbols _ signs that refer to things _ is potentially
present in any animal that can learn to interpret natural signs,
such as a trail of footprints. Syntax, meanwhile, emerges from the
abstract thought required for a social life.
</P>
<P>
   In apes and some other mammals with complex and subtle social
relationships, individuals make alliances and act altruistically
toward others, with the implicit understanding that their favors
will be returned. These foreshadowings of symbols and syntax, they
propose, laid the groundwork for language in a lot of social
animals but didn't create language itself. That had to wait until
our ancestors evolved brains big enough to handle the large-scale
operations needed to generate and process complex strings of signs.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin and Bickerton suggest that brain enlargement in our
ancestry was the result of evolutionary pressures that favored
intelligence and motor coordination for making tools and throwing
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   As a side effect of these selection pressures, human evolution
crossed a threshold at which language became possible.
</P>
<P>
   This account may be wrong in some of its details, but the story
in its broad outlines solves so many puzzles and ties up so many
loose ends that something like it must surely be correct. It also
promises to resolve our conflicting views of the boundary between
people and animals.
</P>
<P>
   The story of language origins sketched above suggests that the
human difference is real and profound, but it is rooted in aspects
of psychology and biology that we share with our close animal
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   If the growing consensus on the origins of language can join
these disparate truths together, it will be a big step forward in
the study of human evolution.

<P>
   In the cow town of Stroud, Okla., no one thinks twice about a
junk pile alongside a neighbor's driveway. But people paid
attention to the pile by Aureliano Cisneros's house, thanks to the
thick swarm of shiny, fat flies and a ripening stench.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 8, 1994, police discovered within that junk pile the
decaying, maggot-packed body of Cisneros himself. Apparently, after
being stabbed in the chest and neck, he had collapsed in front of
his house.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicion quickly fell on Cisneros's wife, Linda Howell. They'd
argued publicly the previous Thursday night, she acknowledged, but
they'd made up before morning. She hadn't seen her husband for two
days, since the evening of Saturday, Aug. 6, when he left home to
join some buddies.
</P>
<P>
   The police didn't buy her story and arrested her for the murder
of her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when Jackie Johnson, a deputy inspector at the Oklahoma
State Bureau of Investigation, looked over the forensic evidence,
she wasn't very confident about the case. Ironically, it was
Howell's defense attorney, Frank Muret, who led Johnson to the
evidence she needed.
</P>
<P>
   When she was handing over the forensic reports to Muret, he
asked if they had looked at the maggots on the corpse. If they had,
he was entitled to know what they'd found.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Muret walked out the door, Johnson picked up her
phone. Two calls later, she had located Neal Haskell, a forensic
entomologist _ a scientist trained in gleaning criminal information
from insects. He is, in fact, the world's only full-time forensic
entomologist.
</P>
<P>
   Haskell identified the larvae as belonging to two common flies:
the black blowfly and the secondary screwworm. He then determined
that these maggots were in their third developmental stage, or
instar.
</P>
<P>
   Since temperature influences the pace at which flies develop, he
consulted the temperature records from the nearest weather
stations, then calculated that the maggots had come from eggs laid
on the body 72 to 96 hours before discovery. Cisneros could have
died no later than the morning of Aug. 5 _ a day earlier than
Howell claimed she had last seen her husband alive.
</P>
<P>
   When faced with the scientific evidence, Howell's lawyer called
the calculations guesswork, and urged the judge to rule Haskell's
testimony inadmissible. The judge admitted the testimony. Soon
afterward Howell accepted a plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Disputes over the courtroom legitimacy of entomological evidence
are becoming more frequent and more pointed. Forensic entomologists
say it's worth the struggle, because their science offers the most
reliable way of determining the time of death at a crime scene,
short of an eyewitness.
</P>
<P>
   Insects populate the human corpse _ or any carcass _ in
predictable waves over the course of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The first to arrive are the husky bombardiers known as
blowflies. Once these flies depart, an entomologist must then knit
together the arrival and departure of several other kinds of
insects that visit the body in a more or less orderly succession.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Hawaii entomologist Lee Goff handled a particularly
grisly case in which the decomposed corpse of a Marine _ with an
execution-style bullet wound _ was found in a rain forest on Oahu.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Goff arrived, most of the blowflies had already come
and gone, but a host of other insects were still busy with the
corpse. Among them, Goff found soldier flies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They let the body age for about 20 days before coming in,'' he
says. ``And the ones I collected were fifth instars, between 9 and
11 days old.''
</P>
<P>
   Goff thus placed time of death at 29 to 31 days before the
body's discovery. Military police confronted two Marines seen with
the victim 30 days earlier, and they confessed.
</P>
<P>
   Part of what makes the method work so well for Goff is Hawaii's
isolation and its relatively limited number of insect species.
Experts on the mainland find it harder to make such definitive
analyses. They often encounter dozens of different cadaver-loving
insects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unusual to find ourselves estimating the
developmental time of a lesser-known insect based on that of a
close relative that's been better studied,'' admits forensic
entomologist Robert Hall of the University of Missouri. ``On
cross-examination, a good lawyer will say, 'So, Dr. Hall, what
you're telling us is you're guessing.'''
</P>
<P>
   For forensic entomologists to answer such challenges requires
thousands of hours of research and legions of graduate students,
but these are hard to come by in their underfunded field.
</P>
<P>
   A noticeable exception has been a program set up by Gail
Anderson of Simon Fraser University, largely funded by the Canadian
Police Research Center. Anderson's students camp out across the
rugged landscape of British Columbia year-round, each baby-sitting
the carcasses of several dozen pigs.
</P>
<P>
   To simulate real-life homicides, some of the victims lie buried
in soil or partially submerged in streams or lakes. In 1995,
Anderson's students began clothing some of their pigs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Canada, at least, most of our murder victims are dressed,''
she explains. ``We needed to document whether this altered insect
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   The research raised eyebrows across North America when a school
newspaper intercepted a grad student's e-mail request for used
panties and bras. Wire services quickly spread the story: Wanted:
Pig Underwear.
</P>
<P>
   By studying pigs in underwear, the entomologists learned some
important things _ that clothing, for instance, helps conserve
moisture in a corpse, so that it will remain attractive to
blowflies longer than if it is naked, and that maggots tend to eat
the skin when a body is clothed but not if it is unclothed.
</P>
<P>
   As forensic entomologists struggle to make determining time of
death court-proof, recent work has begun to push the science's
powers in new directions.
</P>
<P>
   At the FBI's National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime
in Quantico, Va., entomologist Wayne Lord is perfecting a method
for tracing DNA found in bloodsucking insects to the humans on
which they have fed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only a matter of time before we put this research to work
in an actual case,'' Lord says. ``Most likely it will involve a
rape and murder, in which the suspect's blood is retrieved from
crab lice left on the victim.''
</P>
<P>
   Lord is still determining the feasibility of this approach, but
he is confident it will work. If he's right, then someday one more
previously mute witness will speak for the dead.

   Saint Paul and your mother have always agreed about one thing:
Money is dirty. The peevish apostle worried about what lucre does
to the soul, while your mom worried about what money might do to
your body. Don't put it in your mouth, she'd say, you don't know
where it's been.
</P>
<P>
   You don't, but you can just imagine. Money is used for every
type of commerce, from buying milk at the corner store to
trafficking in sex and drugs. All this trade is rough on money.
</P>
<P>
   Even though paper bills (actually a rugged mix of 75 percent
cotton, 25 percent linen) are made to take abuse (4,000 folds in
each direction), the average U.S. dollar lasts a mere 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Moms the world over have done a fine job of convincing us money
is full of disgusting germs. Oddly, though, studies of bacteria on
money are few and far between.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972 a study in the Journal of the American Medical
Association cultured bacteria from 200 coins and bills and found
objectionable ones like fecal bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus on
13 percent of coins and 42 percent of notes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 a study published in Infections in Medicine found 3
percent of coins and 11 percent of bills growing bacteria, but only
benign ones, and decided ``our country seems to have cleaned up its
act.''
</P>
<P>
   Both studies used money collected in hospitals. Rigorous
scrubbing by doctors and nurses could leave their hands _ and money
_ exceptionally clean. Maybe differing hygienic practices account
for the studies' disparity.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, a study at the University of California at
San Francisco cultured 113 examples of ``real life'' cash. Most
grew harmless organisms, but 18 percent of coins and 7 percent of
notes had some less friendly bacteria on them, including the odd
colony of Escherichia coli and the potential pathogen S. aureus.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, these organisms usually spell trouble only if they
somehow breach the skin in large numbers. You're not likely to get
sick from the few bugs your hands encounter on a coin.
</P>
<P>
   What will be obvious by now is that anything that gets on hands
can get on money. And hands are hardly germ-free.
</P>
<P>
   In general, though, skin resists being colonized or invaded by
foreign bacteria. Its horny outer layer forms an efficient barrier,
its surface is too dry or too acidic for many nonresident species,
and its surface oils contain antimicrobials.
</P>
<P>
   In the mouth, saliva _ our natural mouthwash _ contains
germ-killing enzymes and the antibody immunoglobulin A. Any microbe
that makes it past the skin or the mouth's pink lining must contend
with the body's immune system. And any microbe that's swallowed
faces the acid test of the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   If money has a dirty little secret, it's not bugs but drugs. For
the past decade, there have been sporadic reports that U.S.
currency is hopelessly contaminated with cocaine. Is our money
snowed under?
</P>
<P>
   A study conducted at the Houston Advanced Research Center in
Texas and the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois examined
currency in Miami, Chicago and Houston and found an overall 70 to
80 percent contamination rate, with single dollar bills more
commonly contaminated than higher denominations.
</P>
<P>
   A recent look at money circulating in northern Illinois,
published this May in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, found even
higher rates: close to 93 percent of the sample, and 100 percent of
$20 bills, tested positive for cocaine. ``In fact, most Americans
handle small amounts of cocaine every day, not as packets sold by
drug dealers but on the dollar bills that line their pockets,''
concluded this study.
</P>
<P>
   How has moola become so amazingly infested with cocaine?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, the reason you traffic in drugs is to get money,'' comes
the deadpan reply from a spokesman for the Drug Enforcement
Administration who has worked undercover in narcotics and asked not
to be identified by name. ``When drugs come into the country,
traffickers are going to cut the dope with any number of chemicals.
Open the bags, mix in the cut, repackage in smaller bags, sell to
people who sell on the streets. All the time money's changing
hands. It's hard to keep money and drugs apart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But that can't be the whole story,'' adds Tom Jourdan, chief
of the materials and devices unit at the Federal Bureau of
Investigation Laboratory in Washington. The going theory, held by
Jourdan and others, is that one bill brushed through a counting
machine in a bank could contaminate a whole stack.
</P>
<P>
   Something in paper money seems to be binding to cocaine almost
like a biological receptor, and Jourdan thinks that something is
ink: ``I've wiped an old bill on white paper, and ink comes off.
The green pigment never really dries, and drugs of abuse get stuck
to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cocaine dissolves in almost anything _ water, alcohol, fat. And
it sticks quite nicely to skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does that mean your grandmother in the Midwest is going to be
contaminated by a bill handled by a drug dealer in Chicago?'' asks
David Kidwell, a chemist at the Naval Research Laboratory in
Washington. ``Not very likely. If money's freshly dusted with
cocaine, it will get on you, of course. But once money's been
handled and passed through machines, it's too deeply embedded.''
</P>
<P>
   Simulation studies at Argonne and a ``real life'' test at
Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska, apparently bear him out.
For the Creighton study, bank tellers were swabbed after a
four-hour shift handling cash. Although cocaine was found on the
cash (even in rural Nebraska), none was transferred to the tellers'
hands.
</P>
<P>
   So money isn't exactly squeaky clean. But it isn't exactly going
to do us in, either. If there's a lesson here, it's that money
reflects whatever activity, and mischief, human hands get up to _
and the activity and occasional mischief of all the microscopic
organisms along for the ride on our skin.

<P>
   If you want to see a time machine, go to room 2677 on the second
floor of the geology building at UCLA. Once you pass into the inner
sanctum, you are faced with a 5-foot-tall, 20-foot-wide piece of
equipment housed in stainless steel. This is the time machine.
</P>
<P>
   This device, however, will not accept human passengers. What
goes inside is a flake of rock. By analyzing the atoms in the rock,
this machine can take you back to the time when the Himalayas
arose, or when life appeared on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The official name of this place is the National Science
Foundation/Keck Foundation National Ion Microprobe Facility. The
name of the machine is the Cameca 1270.
</P>
<P>
   There are other ion microprobes, but the one at UCLA is by far
the best. They all work by sorting and counting isotopes.
</P>
<P>
   If you remember basic chemistry, you'll recall that isotopes are
the various forms an element can take. Once created, many isotopes
are stable.
</P>
<P>
   Carbon 12 and carbon 13, for example, can be found in our solar
system in the same ratio that they were in when the solar system
formed some 4.5 billion years ago. Living things prefer carbon 12
to carbon 13, so the minerals and fossils that have contained life
always have more, relative to nonliving things, of the lighter
isotope.
</P>
<P>
   Not all isotopes are stable, though. Some will release particles
and metamorphose into entirely different elements, and they do so
at a predictable rate. Some break down after just fractions of a
second; others in quadrillions of years. Isotopes can thus act as
clocks, each working on its own timescale.
</P>
<P>
   But decoding the history written in isotopes is not simple,
because it is sometimes inscribed on mineral crystals only a few
thousandths of an inch across, buried inside younger rock. To
detect them, you need an ion microprobe _ ideally, UCLA's ion
microprobe.
</P>
<P>
   The UCLA machine is the brainchild of isotopic chemist Mark
Harrison. It analyzes isotopes by liberating them from the rock
that holds them captive.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers embed the target flake in a one-inch block of resin
and fire a beam of charged atoms, or ions, at the block. When the
beam strikes the sample, some of its momentum is transferred to the
atoms on the surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them will have enough energy imparted to them that
they'll ionize,'' Harrison says.
</P>
<P>
   These new ions form a cloud, which the microprobe can corral in
a 10,000-volt electric field. The ions can then be sorted by their
charge and by their mass as they pass through a giant magnet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heavier ions take a wider path through the magnet because the
magnet is unable to deflect them as much,'' Harrison says.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the ions crash into a detector at the end of the
machine in an orderly ranking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we can just count them,'' Harrison says.
</P>
<P>
   With its four-ton magnet, the Cameca 1270 can distinguish
between molecules that differ in mass by just one part in 8,000,
and analyze specks of mineral less than four-millionths of an inch
across. That sort of precision has led to some exciting
discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   For example, geologist Stephen Mojzsis and his Scripps
Institution of Oceanography colleague Gustaf Arrhenius used the
microprobe to look at the ratio of carbon 13 to carbon 12 in
3.85-billion-year-old sedimentary rocks from an island on the
southwest coast of Greenland.
</P>
<P>
   (The oldest previously known sign of life was
3.45-billion-year-old fossils of microbes.)
</P>
<P>
   If Earth had been lifeless 3.85 billion years ago, the crystals
in the rock should have had the same ratio found throughout the
lifeless solar system. But the proportion was actually off by a few
percent _ ``Far and away above anything that is inorganic,''
Mojzsis says.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, scientists have begun to wonder if life also left its
mark on Mars. In 1996, NASA scientists announced that they had
found microscopic fossils and other signs of biological activity in
a Martian meteorite that had landed in Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Leshin, a cosmochemist at UCLA, decided to use the
microprobe to analyze the tiny globules of carbonate inside the
meteorite where these supposed signs of life were. The type of
oxygen isotope that a carbonate incorporates into its structure
depends greatly on temperature.
</P>
<P>
   A carbonate that forms at a relatively cool temperature will be
enriched in oxygen 18 compared with carbonates that form at warmer
temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   In NASA's meteorite, Leshin found that the ratio of oxygen 18 to
oxygen 16 varied wildly between different carbonate globules.
Several scenarios could explain the ratios _ none of them very
friendly to life.
</P>
<P>
   Leshin's results now stand as a major question mark to the claim
for life on Mars.
</P>
<P>
   The Cameca 1270's sharp focus recently allowed Harrison to put a
new date on the birth of the Himalayas. Scientists had long
believed that the mountain range was built some 19 to 25 million
years ago. Harrison got hold of garnets that had formed in the
intense pressures of the primary fault in the Himalayas. Inside the
garnets were tiny crystals rich in the element thorium, which
decays into lead 208 with clocklike regularity.
</P>
<P>
   Using the ion microprobe, Harrison was able to measure the
thorium and lead in the crystals and was surprised to discover that
they were only 4 to 8 million years old. The Himalayas actually
arose over 10 million years more recently than anyone had thought.
</P>
<P>
   As researchers continue to explore the Cameca 1270's powers,
Harrison believes that the only limit they will encounter won't be
the machine's technical capabilities but the inherent limits in the
isotopes themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get to smaller and smaller domains _ to see
behavior, to see gradients, to see signals that we haven't had
access to before. But because we are looking at such small domains,
with relatively few atoms, we are beginning to run into the
statistical limits of our chronometers,'' Harrison says. ``It's not
a problem now, but in a few years we'll have to deal with it.''

microprobe to look at the ratio of carbon 13 to carbon 12 in
3.85-billion-year-old sedimentary rocks from an island on the
southwest coast of Greenland.
</P>
<P>
   (The oldest previously known sign of life was
3.45-billion-year-old fossils of microbes.)
</P>
<P>
   If Earth had been lifeless 3.85 billion years ago, the crystals
in the rock should have had the same ratio found throughout the
lifeless solar system. But the proportion was actually off by a few
percent _ ``Far and away above anything that is inorganic,''
Mojzsis says.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, scientists have begun to wonder if life also left its
mark on Mars. In 1996, NASA scientists announced that they had
found microscopic fossils and other signs of biological activity in
a Martian meteorite that had landed in Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Leshin, a cosmochemist at UCLA, decided to use the
microprobe to analyze the tiny globules of carbonate inside the
meteorite where these supposed signs of life were. The type of
oxygen isotope that a carbonate incorporates into its structure
depends greatly on temperature.
</P>
<P>
   A carbonate that forms at a relatively cool temperature will be
enriched in oxygen 18 compared with carbonates that form at warmer
temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   In NASA's meteorite, Leshin found that the ratio of oxygen 18 to
oxygen 16 varied wildly between different carbonate globules.
Several scenarios could explain the ratios _ none of them very
friendly to life.
</P>
<P>
   Leshin's results now stand as a major question mark to the claim
for life on Mars.
</P>
<P>
   The Cameca 1270's sharp focus recently allowed Harrison to put a
new date on the birth of the Himalayas. Scientists had long
believed that the mountain range was built some 19 to 25 million
years ago. Harrison got hold of garnets that had formed in the
intense pressures of the primary fault in the Himalayas. Inside the
garnets were tiny crystals rich in the element thorium, which
decays into lead 208 with clocklike regularity.
</P>
<P>
   Using the ion microprobe, Harrison was able to measure the
thorium and lead in the crystals and was surprised to discover that
they were only 4 to 8 million years old. The Himalayas actually
arose over 10 million years more recently than anyone had thought.
</P>
<P>
   As researchers continue to explore the Cameca 1270's powers,
Harrison believes that the only limit they will encounter won't be
the machine's technical capabilities but the inherent limits in the
isotopes themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get to smaller and smaller domains _ to see
behavior, to see gradients, to see signals that we haven't had
access to before. But because we are looking at such small domains,
with relatively few atoms, we are beginning to run into the
statistical limits of our chronometers,'' Harrison says. ``It's not
a problem now, but in a few years we'll have to deal with it.''

   People can talk. Other animals can't. The birds and beasts can
use signals to attract, threaten or alert each other, but they
can't ask questions, strike bargains, tell stories or lay out a
plan of action. Those skills make Homo sapiens a uniquely
successful, powerful and dangerous mammal.
</P>
<P>
   Other creatures' signals carry only a few limited kinds of
information about what's happening at the moment, but language lets
us tell each other in limitless detail about what used to be or
will be or might be.
</P>
<P>
   Without language, we would be only a sort of upright chimpanzee
with funny feet and clever hands. With it, we are the
self-possessed masters of the planet.
</P>
<P>
   We can reasonably assume that by at least 30,000 years ago
people were talking _ at any rate, they were producing tokens of
art and religion, high-level forms of symbolic behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Language surely goes back further than that, but archaeologists
don't agree on just how far. Paleontologists have pored over the
fossil bones of our ancient relatives in search of evidence for
speech abilities.
</P>
<P>
   All mammals produce their vocal noises by contracting muscles
that compress the rib cage. The air in the lungs is driven out
through the windpipe to the larynx, where it flows between the
vocal cords. These structures vibrate in the breeze, producing a
buzzing sound that becomes the voice.
</P>
<P>
   In people, the larynx lies well below the back of the tongue,
and most of the air goes out through the mouth when we talk. But in
most mammals, including apes, the larynx sticks farther up behind
the tongue, into the back of the nose, and most of the exhaled air
passes out through the nostrils. Nonhuman mammals make mostly nasal
sounds as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Lieberman of Brown University thinks that an apelike
throat persisted for some time in our hominid ancestors. His
studies of fossil jaws and skulls persuade him that a more modern
throat didn't evolve until some 500,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This year my colleague Richard Kay, his student Michelle Balow
and I were able to offer support for Lieberman's ideas from another
part of the hominid body.
</P>
<P>
   The tongue's movements are controlled almost solely by a nerve
called the hypoglossal. In its course from the brain to the tongue,
this nerve passes through a hole in the skull. Kay, Balow and I
found that this bony canal is relatively big in modern humans _
about twice as big in cross section as that of a like-size
chimpanzee.
</P>
<P>
   Our larger canal presumably reflects a bigger hypoglossal nerve,
giving us the precise control over tongue movements that we need
for speech.
</P>
<P>
   We also measured this hole in the skulls of a number of fossil
hominids. Australopithecines have small canals like those of apes,
suggesting that they couldn't talk. But later skulls from the genus
Homo, beginning with a 400,000-year-old skull from Zambia, all have
big, humanlike hypoglossal canals. These are also the skulls that
were the first to house brains as big as our own.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years ago most linguists thought that people learn to talk
through the same sort of behavior reinforcement used in training an
animal to do tricks: When children use a word correctly or produce
a grammatical sentence, they are rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   This picture was swept away in the late 1950s by the
revolutionary ideas of Noam Chomsky. Chomsky argued that we are all
born with the same fundamental grammar hard-wired into our brains,
and we are preprogrammed to pick up the additional rules of the
local language, just as baby ducks are hard-wired to follow the
first big animal they see when they hatch.
</P>
<P>
   If language learning were just a matter of proper training,
Chomsky reasoned, we ought to be able to teach English to lab rats,
or at least to apes.
</P>
<P>
   As we have seen, apes aren't built to talk. But they can be
trained to use sign language or to point to word-symbols on a
keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   Duane Rumbaugh and Sue Savage-Rumbaugh work at the Yerkes
Regional Primate Research Center in Atlanta, where Sue made a
surprising breakthrough with a young bonobo named Kanzi.
</P>
<P>
   Kanzi had watched his mother try to learn signs with little
success. When Sue started with Kanzi, she was astonished to
discover that he already knew the meaning of 12 of the keyboard
symbols. Apparently, he had learned them without any training or
rewards.
</P>
<P>
   In the years that followed, he learned new symbols quickly and
used them both to answer questions and to ``talk'' about things
that he intended to do or had already done. Still more amazingly,
he had a considerable understanding of spoken English _ including
its syntax.
</P>
<P>
   In their forthcoming book, ``Lingua ex Machina,'' neuroscientist
William Calvin of the University of Washington and linguist Derek
Bickerton of the University of Hawaii argue that the ability to
create symbols _ signs that refer to things _ is potentially
present in any animal that can learn to interpret natural signs,
such as a trail of footprints. Syntax, meanwhile, emerges from the
abstract thought required for a social life.
</P>
<P>
   In apes and some other mammals with complex and subtle social
relationships, individuals make alliances and act altruistically
toward others, with the implicit understanding that their favors
will be returned. These foreshadowings of symbols and syntax, they
propose, laid the groundwork for language in a lot of social
animals but didn't create language itself. That had to wait until
our ancestors evolved brains big enough to handle the large-scale
operations needed to generate and process complex strings of signs.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin and Bickerton suggest that brain enlargement in our
ancestry was the result of evolutionary pressures that favored
intelligence and motor coordination for making tools and throwing
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   As a side effect of these selection pressures, human evolution
crossed a threshold at which language became possible.
</P>
<P>
   This account may be wrong in some of its details, but the story
in its broad outlines solves so many puzzles and ties up so many
loose ends that something like it must surely be correct. It also
promises to resolve our conflicting views of the boundary between
people and animals.
</P>
<P>
   The story of language origins sketched above suggests that the
human difference is real and profound, but it is rooted in aspects
of psychology and biology that we share with our close animal
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   If the growing consensus on the origins of language can join
these disparate truths together, it will be a big step forward in
the study of human evolution.

UNION PROTESTS FAA COMPUTER TEST ON LIVE TRAFFIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration is gambling with safety by
testing a new computer system for controllers on live traffic
before it has been certified, the union representing technicians
who install, repair, and maintain much of the nation's air-traffic
control equipment alleged Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, a new mainframe computer was tested at the New
York en route center, which controls all high-altitude traffic in
southeastern New York, New Jersey, eastern Pennsylvania, and out
into the Atlantic Ocean, without undergoing the battery of safety
and human performance evaluations the FAA usually requires for new
systems, executives of the Professional Airways Systems Specialists
charged.
</P>
<P>
   FAA officials acknowledged making the tests, but portrayed the
union's objections as more related to labor issues than safety.
</P>
<P>
   The union insisted its only concern was for safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the agency feels pressured. . .to field a new system
very quickly,'' Tom Brantley, vice president of PASS, said Tuesday,
noting the many ongoing problems with the FAA's antiquated computer
system. ``They turned it on this weekend and used it on live
traffic but they haven't declared it operational and we haven't
certified it.''
</P>
<P>
   The new computer will replace the aging host, or primary,
computer used in the New York Center. The FAA expects the new
system to be operational there Dec. 28. The new computer will also
replace the aging host computer at the Boston Center, in Nashua,
N.H., which has had numerous computer problems this year. The new
system is scheduled to begin operating there on Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   There are 21 so-called en route centers around the country.
Centers in Los Angeles, Minneapolis, and Oakland are also expected
to get the new computer early next year. PASS officials said if
there are major glitches in the new computer, they may not be
discovered until it is operating in many of the en route centers
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   An FAA spokesman in Washington said officials are meeting
regularly with PASS to negotiate a settlement to the issues the
union has raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the current contract, we are required to negotiate any
changes in working conditions, and the new computer system is a
change in working conditions,'' said FAA spokesman William A.
Shumann. ``At the same time, we are simultaneously and separately
negotiating a new contract with PASS.''
</P>
<P>
   Brantley, however, said the issue is one of safety, not labor
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have tried very hard to keep anything to do with contract
negotiations from spilling over into the (air-traffic control)
modernization area,'' he said. ``That is one of the reasons why we
have liaisons on these work groups to informally address issues as
they come up. To be honest, there are labor issues here that we
have not brought up. They put in a new system without negotiating,
which is an unfair labor practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally, before a new system is introduced, it undergoes human
performance and safety evaluations, which can result in design and
operating changes. For example, the replacement system for
controllers who work airplanes in the congested airspaces around
major airports underwent such a review, and 98 changes _ more than
50 of them requested by PASS _ are currently being instituted. It
is unclear if the changes will affect the installation of that
system, scheduled for March 1999 at Washington's Ronald Reagan
National Airport.
</P>
<P>
   One of the issues the union identified regarding the new
comptuer is there is no audible alarm if a failure occurs. As a
result, the FAA has hooked up a modem to ring a telephone if the
system fails. That jury-rigged solution, PASS contends, could
result in false alarms if a wrong number is dialed, or someone not
familiar with the importance of the telephone, picking it up.
</P>
<P>
   Brantley said he would be reluctant to fly through New York
airspace if the new system is continued to be used without its
first being tested off-line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The existing host computer, as obsolete as it is, I know it
works,'' he said. ``Odds are, if this new system fails, they will
go to the back up and nothing (bad) would happen. The odds are with
them, the odds are pretty good that you will come out okay. But
most of us don't like to gamble when we fly.''
</P>
<P>
   The replacement computers, which will cost about $85 million
systemwide, will not be maintained by PASS technicians. Instead,
the FAA has contracted with IBM to maintain them.
</P>
<P>
   PASS must still certify the new computers.
</P>
<P>
   Mike DePalma, the New York Center local president of the
National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said testing the new
host computer went fine this weekend with no glitches. He said
controllers desperately need the new computer in order to begin
training on a replacement of the radar display system they use.
</P>
<P>
   He was distressed, however, that PASS representatives will not
be maintaining the new computer system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work traffic and I worked a sector recently and the radar
failed. A technician was there in 30 seconds,'' DePalma said. ``If
the agency is planning on contracting out this work, I don't want
to be sitting here waiting an hour for a technician to arrive.
Contracting out the work is dangerous and reckless.''

LIVINGSTON CHIDES FEMINISTS FOR CLINTON SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Asserting that their ``inconsistency is amazing,''
House Speaker-elect Robert L. Livingston told a group of feminist
leaders Tuesday they are undermining the women's rights movement by
opposing impeachment and being ``strident'' in support of President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is it that feminism is championing this particular
cause?'' Livingston asked a group that included feminist icons
Betty Friedan and Eleanor Smeal. ``If (former GOP Senator) Bob
Packwood had been caught in similar circumstances with a young
intern under his control, you would have had his head.''
</P>
<P>
   When the women angrily denied they have a double standard for
Democrats and said impeachment is too strong a punishment for
Clinton, Livingston declared that President Nixon faced
impeachment, and resigned, for a lesser offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard Nixon's crime was covering up a crime he did not
commit,'' Livingston said. ``Clinton is covering up a crime he did
commit, and that is a large difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary exchange occurred in an impromptu session in
Livingston's Capitol Hill office. The women's rights leaders
requested, and unexpectedly got, the meeting after they held a news
conference decrying this week's expected impeachment votes as a
Republican attempt to undo the will of women, who
disproportionately voted for Clinton in 1996 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I happen to think you do not represent all women in your very
strident views on behalf of the president,'' Livingston told the 20
women seated in his office, as he stood behind his desk.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker-elect related how his mother, divorced and left with
two young children, worked as a secretary in New Orleans in the
long days before Friedan's ``Feminine Mystique'' was published.
``She never ran the office, but she raised us and nurtured us and
got the job done,'' Livingston said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother has better feminist credentials than half of the
people in this room,'' he added, ``and she believes Clinton ought
to be impeached.''
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, many of the women said they were shocked and
upset at what they viewed as Livingston's confrontational style and
condescending remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a founder of the women's movement, I would say that he was
very insulting,'' Friedan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``His tone was disrespectful,'' said Smeal, president of the
Feminist Majority Foundation, ``and we're troubled and saddened by
his response.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston flatly rejected the women's appeal that the House
consider a censure resolution as a substitute for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our belief is censure is not envisioned by the Constitution in
the US House,'' said Livingston, adding that he intends to vote for
``two, and possibly more'' articles of impeachment. ``Censure will
be an option in the Senate. Censure is a penalty. Expulsion is a
penalty. Those are issues the Senate will have to determine after
we vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The speaker-elect stopped short of calling for Clinton's
resignation, as some of his GOP colleagues have done, but he called
Vice President Al Gore ``fully capable'' of stepping in if Clinton
steps down.
</P>
<P>
   During their news conference, which included activists in labor
unions and civil rights groups as well as leaders of the National
Organization for Women and the National Women's Political Caucus,
the women said a Senate trial would create turmoil in Congress and
block progress on issues important to women, such as education,
child care, and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ironic that after a majority of women said in exit polls
in November that they don't want this to happen, a Congress that is
12 percent female reverses the election of a president who stands
with women and stands for their issues,'' Smeal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans are suddenly born-again on sexual harassment after
they have voted again and again against women's rights, from
abortion to pay equity,'' Smeal added. ``We are not fooled by their
hypocritical actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Women's rights groups have been called hypocritical for having
little to say about Paula Jones's sexual harassment lawsuit against
Clinton when they were very vocal in calling on Packwood to step
down in 1995 when allegations of sexual misconduct were made
against him. During the fall campaigns, several Democratic women
candidates who rode a feminist tide in 1992 in the wake of sexual
harassment allegations against Supreme Court nominee Clarence
Thomas had to answer for defending the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your inconsistency is amazing,'' Livingston told the women.
``You stand by the condemnation of Bob Packwood but not the
president? By championing his cause, the cause of feminism and the
integrity of your movement is severely jeopardized.''
</P>
<P>
   Feminist leaders say they abhor the president's behavior with
former intern Monica S. Lewinsky, but they don't believe that
either his sexual misconduct or his misleading the public about it
are impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if he did what he's alleged to have done, what is the big
deal?'' Friedan asked. ``It's not a matter of public concern. To
have our will overthrown by a bunch of dirty old white men, trying
to use sexual issues wrongly ... this is a disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedan said she was ``seriously considering'' calling a women's
protest march on Washington if the House votes to impeach Clinton.
Tuesday, the feminist activists staged their own mini-march on
Capitol Hill, traveling from House office to House office, first
seeing Livingston, then Representative Maxine Waters, a California
Democrat, and finally Democratic Minority Leader Richard Gephardt
of Missouri. Most of the time, they were followed by press cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said he would provide a ``short list'' of undecided
Republicans and urged the women to personally press the case for
censure with them. ``You are doing the very right thing,'' Gephardt
told them.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the personal visits, the women said, was because
it was so hard to reach members over the jammed Capitol Hill phone
lines. They said the majority of Americans were telling lawmakers
what the polls have long showed: They don't want Clinton impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston responded that he was not elected by the polls, but
by people who expect him to use his judgment. ``I like the guy, I
think he's nice,'' Livingston said of Clinton, ``but I believe what
he said in his deposition and before the grand jury is perjury, and
perjury is a felony, punishable by five years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ladies, when the history books are written, you will have to
tell your grandchildren why you were defending a president who
lied,'' Livingston said.

 Apple Preps Laptop Version of iMac  
 By Jon Swartz   
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Apple Computer is readying a low-cost laptop version of its
popular iMac in an all-out bid for consumer sales, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The new portable _reportedly called WebMate _ is translucent
plastic, like its desktop forebear, and comes with a lightning-fast
microprocessor.
</P>
<P>
   One insider described several prototypes of the lightweight
portable, including a ``spiffy'' curved model with 300 MHz
processor, built-in modem, Ethernet connections and universal
serial bus for connecting to printers, scanners and other devices.
Although a price has not been set, it is expected to be competitive
with the inexpensive $1,500 laptopson the market, one source said.
</P>
<P>
   The WebMate is due in the first half of 1999 but could be sneak
previewed at next month's Macworld Expo computer trade show at
Moscone Center, sources said. (During a speech to educators
yesterday in Seattle, interim Apple CEO Steve Jobs said a new
consumer portable will be shown later in the year, not at
Macworld.)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an aggressive attempt by Apple to drive a stake in the
ground for the consumer market,'' said Matthew Rothenberg, content
director at MacWEEK.com in San Francisco, which has been tracking
Apple's new products. ``The iMac has kicked ass in the desktop
consumer market, and Apple intends to do the same with its new
laptop.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple sold 278,000 of its curvy aquamarine iMac machines in the
six weeks following its August debut, and industry observers
estimate that as many as 800,000 units will ship this year.
</P>
<P>
   Some are calling WebMate, code-named P1, the technologic
successor to the defunct eMate, a four-pound, $600 clamshell-shaped
computer that was well received by students and educators but
discontinued as part of Apple's cost-cutting measures. Unlike the
eMate, which used Apple's Newton operating system, WebMate is
expected to run the Macintosh operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The new notebook would round out Apple's personal computer line.
The PowerMac and PowerBook anchor the company's business offerings,
while the iMac is a desktop PC for consumers. All three models have
sold well, triggering a financial turnaround that has vaulted Apple
from fiscal despair to profitability.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Apple is tinkering with a ``palmtop'' computer
project that would resurrect elements of the ill-fated Newton
MessagePad, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
   That project, called MacMate, would come with either the Mac OS
or much-rumored Mac OS Lite _ a graphical-user interface designed
for palmtop devices _ and provide wireless connections to the
WebMate, iMac, PowerBook and other Macs. It reportedly would
include software for connecting to both Mac and Windows machines.
</P>
<P>
   MacMate, which probably will not debut until late 1999,
allegedly was spotted at a meeting of the Hong Kong Newton Users
Group earlier this year. Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, an Apple board
member, has publicly hinted about an upcoming $500 handheld Mac.
MacMate is the likeliest candidate to fulfill that description,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Apple has maintained the semblance of a handheld project despite
shutting down its Newton division in February. At the time, the
company said it was ``committed'' to a Mac-based portable,
beginning in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Apple also could conceivably strike a deal to develop a hybrid
of 3Com Corp.'s popular PalmPilot device, or sign a co-marketing
agreement with 3Com, sources said. In a recent interview in
Fortune, Jobs said Apple attempted to acquire 3Com's Palm Computing
division.
</P>
<P>
   The new consumer Macintosh models are expected to help stoke a
remarkable comeback at Apple by further boosting its lot in the
home market. Until recently, it had squandered market share with
consumers because, as Jobs has repeatedly said, the company didn't
build sufficiently compelling products.
</P>
<P>
   The number of consumers who bought Macs plunged to 4.3 percent
last year from 11.2 percent in 1995, according to ZD Market
Intelligence. That total, however, is on the upswing with iMac
sales, said analyst Matt Sargent.
</P>
<P>
   The Cupertino company _ which hemorrhaged $1.8 billion in 1995,
1996 and part of last year _ has now registered four-straight
money-making quarters and is expected to finish in the black for
its first quarter, ending December 25.
</P>
<P>
   Apple has relied on a streamlined product strategy and
aggressive cost cutting to reverse its flagging fortunes. The iMac
has been a runaway hit, topping the best-seller list at computer
superstores, according to ZD Market Intelligence in La Jolla (San
Diego County).
</P>
<P>
   An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the rumored
machines.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While no longer a member of Congress, as the
Republican presidential candidate in 1996 I do have more than a
passing interest in the pending impeachment proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Without rehashing that election, suffice it to say that any
chance of success I may have had was wiped out by an avalanche of
negative television advertising paid for with money raised through
questionable fund-raising tactics by the president and vice
president. Attorney General Janet Reno has buried her head in the
sand on this serious matter, but let's hope that someone in
Congress will hold the attorney general accountable and pursue the
alleged illegal fund-raising activities.
</P>
<P>
   Having said that, let me lay out what might be an imperfect but
tough and reasonable solution to the pending impeachment matter.
</P>
<P>
   I have reminded myself that to impeach or accuse is the
constitutional responsibility of the House; to convict or acquit is
the constitutional responsibility of the Senate. I seriously doubt
that half the American people understand the complex impeachment
process.
</P>
<P>
   Let me also note, at the outset, that many large and small
details would have to be worked out by congressional leaders
working with the House and Senate parliamentarians and legal
counsels. I've been there and know how much work putting all this
together will entail, including all the procedural hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   So, here goes:
</P>
<P>
   Step No. 1: Vote in the House of Representatives on any or all
of the four articles of impeachment reported by the House Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Step No. 2: Regardless of the outcome of the House vote on any
of the four articles, the Senate majority leader would, at the
earliest possible time, introduce in the Senate a joint resolution
(numbered 1600 if possible). The resolution would contain the
essence or ``guts'' of all articles of impeachment considered by
the House, plus any other necessary language, as determined by the
Senate majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Step No. 3: After suspending or amending the rules governing
impeachment proceedings, the Senate would take up and consider the
joint resolution under a time agreement. The vice president
(president of the Senate) would preside at all times. No amendments
except technical amendments offered by the majority leader would be
in order. All points of order would be waived.
</P>
<P>
   Step No. 4: Upon final action by the Senate, the House of
Representatives would take up the joint resolution: no amendments
in order, except technical amendments offered by the Speaker or his
designee. Points of order would be waived. The resolution would be
considered under a time agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Step No. 5: If a House-Senate conference is necessary, the
conference report would be considered under a time agreement in
both the House and the Senate. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Conditions, Etc. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. The president announces his intention to support and sign the
joint resolution before any action on the resolution by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   a. The president agrees to sign the joint resolution at a public
signing ceremony attended by the vice president, congressional
leadership and other appropriate members of the House and Senate
recommended by Democratic and Republican leaders; the president's
Cabinet; the chief justice of the Supreme Court, and others as
recommended by House and Senate leaders.
</P>
<P>
   b. White House, Senate and House media _ television, radio,
print and photographers _ shall be present.
</P>
<P>
   c. The site, date and hour of the ceremony is to be determined
by the House Speaker, or his designee, and the Senate majority
leader.
</P>
<P>
   d. Copies of the signed joint resolution, with an appropriate
presidential letter, are to be forwarded to members of the Cabinet,
members of Congress and heads of other government agencies. This is
to be completed within seven days of signing the joint resolution.
</P>
<P>
   2. The overall agreement is to be determined by the Speaker, or
his designee, and the Senate majority leader. Possible items:
</P>
<P>
   a. All congressional action completed and the president's
signature affixed on or by Jan. 2, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   b. Bipartisan. Any agreement in the House or Senate with
reference to the proceedings shall be inoperative if the president,
vice president and Democratic congressional leaders fail to
publicly and actively support the joint resolution. Support is to
be demonstrated by the president, vice president and Democratic
leadership in House and Senate, prior to and throughout
consideration of the joint resolution. Republican leaders also
agree to publicly and actively support it.
</P>
<P>
   c. The Speaker, or his designee, and the majority leader shall
outline procedure, rules, time and any and all other matters
pertaining to debate and disposition of the joint resolution, and
could, if appropriate, include provisions relating to the
president's legal obligations upon leaving office.
</P>
<P>
   3. Penalties. Any penalty imposed must be in accordance with the
Constitution and could require the voluntary agreement by the
President to overcome the prohibition against bills of attainder. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Summary &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These are my ideas. They are offered in good faith. I have
consulted with no one.
</P>
<P>
   They may not be worthy of a second thought, but I believe the
suggestions could lead to a fairly broad bipartisan result. There
is scarcely anyone who believes that the required 67 senators would
vote to convict the president on any of the four articles of
impeachment approved by the House Judiciary Committee,
notwithstanding what the full House might do.
</P>
<P>
   I hope these suggestions will be seen as a blending of
responsibility and justice, which will permit an expeditious
disposition of the entire matter before the new 106th Congress
begins work in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   It is also my hope that pursuing the above suggested outline, or
a modified version thereof, would demonstrate to the vast majority
of Americans that Republican congressional leaders will fulfill
their constitutional responsibilities, clear the decks and move
forward when the 106th Congress convenes on Jan. 6, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot imagine a better way for Republicans to start the new
year than by taking charge, and producing just results, at this
historic moment. It is time for a tough but responsible conclusion.
Maybe these ideas will be a starting point for a bipartisan ending.

COMPUTING VISIONARY'S IDEA CHANGED THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID L. CHANDLER   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was an unimposing little handcarved wooden box on wheels,
looking more like a simple toy than like an epochal invention that
would change the world. But it was, and it did.
</P>
<P>
   When Douglas Engelbart unveiled the first computer mouse to the
world at a computing conference 30 years ago this week, he thought
it would catch fire and change the face of computing in short
order. But to his surprise it took more than 16 years before a
commercial version reached the marketplace, with the introduction
of the Macintosh computer in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, it's hard to find a computer that doesn't come with a
mouse, or one of its offspring (such as trackballs or touch pads),
as standard equipment. The transformation that was revealed that
day laid the groundwork for the whole computer revolution and made
possible an industry that today generates hundreds of billions of
dollars a year in revenues. For his trouble, Engelbart _ who holds
the patent for the mouse _ eventually was paid $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1968 demonstration of Engelbart's work completely blew
people away,'' said Paul Saffo, director of the Institute for the
Future at Stanford University _ the campus where Engelbart made his
pioneering developments in the 1960s. ``It was like a UFO landing
on the White House lawn,'' Saffo said. ``Nothing has been the same
since in computing.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just the mouse itself, of course. What Engelbart was
demonstrating at the Joint Computer Conference in San Francisco on
Dec. 9, 1968, was a whole new approach to what computers were and
how they could be used. On that December day, Engelbart unveiled a
vision that was the first public marriage of ``personal'' with
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, computers were huge, expensive and impersonal
number-crunching machines. For the most part, they had no screens
or keyboards and were not too comfortable working with words, and
even less so with pictures.
</P>
<P>
   But the technology was there, and Engelbart saw the potential.
As he described it in a recent interview, by then he had already
been working with computers for 17 years, and had figured out _ as
few others had _ that ``personally interacting with a computer is
going to be a big thing.''
</P>
<P>
   That was prescient thinking in an era when computer pricetags
were in the millions, the hardware would fill large,
climate-controlled rooms, and even professional programmers mostly
interacted with a computer by handing a pile of punchcards to a
computer operator, who would feed the cards in, wait for the
computer to carry out its work, collect its output from a printer
and hand it back to the programmer hours, or even days, later. To
most people at that time, the notion of ``personally interacting''
with computers made as much sense as thinking that average people
could ``interact'' with a nuclear reactor or a battleship.
</P>
<P>
   First steps
</P>
<P>
   But Engelbart saw far beyond that, and set the stage for the
revolution to come. He saw that computers had the power to become
more than just the overgrown calculators they were at the time.
They could become, he realized, a way of expanding and enhancing
the human mind.
</P>
<P>
   The first step toward that was to represent information in a
visual way, on a television screen. Words, pictures and commands
(menus) could all be displayed on the same screen, and could be
manipulated by controlling a moving pointer, or cursor, on that
screen. But then came the big question: How could you best control
the movements of that cursor?
</P>
<P>
   Engelbart and his Stanford Research Institute team tried a
variety of devices, but the breakthrough came when Engelbart was
``drawing doodles during a boring meeting. That ended up being the
principle for the first mouse.''
</P>
<P>
   The system he developed also included the concept of the
hyperlink _ now widely familiar as the clickable links found on
Internet pages, which connect you to another page or another site
that contains additional information about the word or phrase that
was clicked on. And it included ``windows'' on the screen that
provided views of different kinds of information.
</P>
<P>
   Those concepts were further developed during the 1970s by
another group in the same town: the Palo Alto Research Center of
Xerox Corp., which developed the first truly ``personal'' computer
_ but never brought it to market. It was there that Steven Jobs saw
the system demonstrated, and incorporated the basic concepts into
the Apple Macintosh operating system.
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate these ideas to a packed audience of 2,300 at the
1968 conference, Engelbart and his team had set up a large work
station at the auditorium, connected by special phone lines to a
computer at Stanford. ``It was a real gamble,'' Engelbart says.
``We had a lot of expensive hardware and software to work the
presentation. If at any time in that hour-and-a-half it had
crashed, we would have been left waving our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   And it was a further gamble, he said, because the people paying
for the work _ the Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects
Agency and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration _
didn't even know about the unauthorized demo. If it had crashed,
``people would have been upset.''
</P>
<P>
   But much of the future of computing was right there that day.
Engelbart himself _ a modest and unassuming man, now 73 _ admits
that ``the whole thing had lots of revolutionary aspects.''
</P>
<P>
   Others put it more strongly. ``Engelbart's demonstration that
year was a watershed that fundamentally changed the course of the
computing revolution, contributing not only ideas, but also many of
the people who would later build the systems we use today,'' said
Stanford librarian Michael Keller.
</P>
<P>
   In honor of the thirtieth anniversary of that watershed event,
Stanford will hold a daylong symposium called ``Engelbart's
Unfinished Revolution'' this week, featuring many of the leaders of
today's computer industry. Some of the ideas demonstrated that day,
as the symposium's title implies, are still awaiting
commercialization.
</P>
<P>
   A long way to go
</P>
<P>
   Engelbart sees the computer revolution as a towering mountain,
and he says we may be about 20 percent of the way up it so far. He
is concentrating on the way ahead, not what's happened so far. He
sees computers as a way for humans to gain ``collective IQ,
knowledge management. It portends a very significant potential for
society,'' where instead of just helping people do the things they
did already, computers will make it possible to do things that
could never even have been imagined before.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, he says, ``I think we can start collectively tackling
large issues in a way that we can't today. I'm still trying to get
people to hear that.''
</P>
<P>
   Engelbart himself never got rich from his vision, as so many
lesser innovators did. But he has found himself a comfortable home
for his own research. Back in the early 1980s, a company called
Logitech, which has since become the world's leading maker of mice
(they are about to ship their 200 millionth mouse) decided to
provide Engelbart with office space and resources to continue his
work. He has been working at Logitech's headquarters in Fremont,
Calif., ever since, though he is not on the company's payroll,
preferring the independence of his own nonprofit foundation, the
Bootstrap Alliance. He is deeply grateful for Logitech's help:
``It's been a huge thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1967, Englebart and the Stanford Research Institute were
granted a patent on the mouse _ but not on other elements of the
system, such as windows and hypertext. Those were software, and at
the time only hardware could be patented.
</P>
<P>
   But patents only last for 17 years _ exactly how long it took
for his device to become a commercial product. In any case,
Stanford owned the rights to the invention, under an arrangement
that was standard practice at the time. Engelbart was not legally
entitled to any royalties, even if there had been any.
</P>
<P>
   But he did get something for it. Several years ago, Stanford
``did give me a $10,000 check,'' Engelbart said _ and then, without
a trace of irony, he added, ``which was nice of them. They didn't
have to.''
</P>

THINK SMALL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're working up a gearhead's gift list, think small. There
are a lot of cute little tech devices on the market in time for
Christmas. These lightweight gadgets will fit nicely in a stocking
or a shirt pocket, while being powerful enough to tempt many
business travelers to leave the laptop at home.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Electronics has freshened up an old favorite, the Rex
shirt-pocket databank. I wrote about the original version about a
year ago, when it accompanied me to the Comdex computer show in Las
Vegas. With a Rex, I had all my phone numbers, e-mail addresses,
and appointments stored in a device about as thick as three credit
cards.
</P>
<P>
   The Rex was touted as an alternative to the larger and more
expensive 3Com Palm Pilot. But the Palm Pilot lets you punch in new
information by touching the screen with a pen. To add new names or
memos to the Rex, you had to plug it into a full-fledged computer.
</P>
<P>
   But the new Rex Pro features a clever system for scheduling new
appointments or typing in contact data. You just use the six tiny
buttons along the right edge of the device.
</P>
<P>
   Pressing the data input button on the Rex Pro opens a menu of
tasks. Say you want a reminder to call somebody. Click the ``To
Do'' command, which opens yet another menu. Click ``Call.'' Still
another menu appears, and so on. If the person you want to call is
already in the Rex address book, it takes just a few clicks to
create your appointment. The Rex even beeps to remind you.
</P>
<P>
   What if the name isn't in the address book? With the old Rex,
you'd be out of luck. But the new version can display a menu of
letters and numbers, and will let you type in new data.
</P>
<P>
   The Rex Pro lists for $239, but CompUSA sells it on the Net for
$199.
</P>
<P>
   I knew the Rex was a reliable gadget, but I had my doubts about
another trinket that recently slid over my transom. I think it was
the suction cup that worried me. It's tucked away on the underside
of the JVC HC-E100 Portable E-Mail Device, and it brought back
memories of computing in the Jurassic era.
</P>
<P>
   Before RJ-11 phone jacks became commonplace, people connected
computers to phone lines with acoustic couplers _ big rubber
suction cups that you wrapped around the mouthpiece and earpiece of
a standard telephone. The portable kind, long used by journalists,
were heavy, bulky, and unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   So why is somebody making a device that uses an acoustic coupler
to check e-mail? Because it'll work with practically any phone on
earth. And because JVC uses one that's simple and lightweight. Just
dial an 800 number to reach the PocketMail e-mail service, then
press the JVC device against the phone receiver. Your e-mail is
quickly loaded into a box slightly larger than a Walkman. If you
can stand the cramped keyboard, you can pound out a reply.
</P>
<P>
   Holding the JVC e-mail device against the phone is clumsy, but
unless you've got hundreds of messages, you'll be done in a couple
of minutes. For maximum speed, you can download only the title of
each message. Then you can look them over and dial up again to get
just the messages that matter. The devices even send faxes, for 25
cents per page inside the United States and $1 everywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't try the JVC device with a cell phone. PocketScience
says it'll work with analog phones, but not the new digital ones,
including PCS phones. They're working on upgraded software to solve
that problem.
</P>
<P>
   PocketMail provides you with an e-mail account, but the service
can also check three outside mailboxes, including your company
e-mail box or even your America Online account. But for some odd
reason, PocketMail only checks these other mailboxes once an hour,
rather than doing it whenever the customer dials in. So if someone
sends you mail one minute after PocketMail's hourly update, you'll
wait 59 minutes to see it. Anybody willing to wait that long
doesn't need PocketMail.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is an impressive gadget _ and cheap. At the
PocketMail site (http://www.pocketmail.com) you can order the JVC
e-mail device for $100. Then you pay $99.95 a year or $9.95 a month
for a PocketMail e-mail account. Then you can place it under the
Christmas tree and win the eternal gratitude of some poor
laptop-lugger who hasn't walked upright through an airport since
1989.

TECHIE TREKKIES IN CYBERSPACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PATTI HARTIGAN   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It's a bit of an urban-galactic mission just to wind
your way to the offices of The Screen House, an on-line design and
development firm located somewhere between a crater and a roadblock
down on the waterfront. Once there, you're greeted by a barefoot
programmer with a ponytail who pads across the blue Astroturf and
invites you to relax among the 10 arcade games in the lobby, enjoy
a little chat with the life-size cutout of Captain Jean-Luc Picard
and, heck, have a cup of java.
</P>
<P>
   This quirky little office, down by Big Dig Central, is the place
where a group of young entrepreneurs developed Star Trek:
Continuum, a rare Web site where the gee-whiz technology is
actually appropriate for the content. If you live in the flesh
world (as opposed to the Trek world), Star Trek: Continuum _ part
of Paramount's official Star Trek site _ might seem a little out
there, but to Screen House co-founder Drake Roberts, it's serious
business. His face takes on the look of a child just given the run
of the world's largest toy store when he leads a tour of the site,
which features more than 1,700 pages including an exhaustive
library and a special section called ``Klingon Compendium.''
</P>
<P>
   When he logs on, the site greets him personally, ``Welcome
Skyhopper!'' Roberts, needless to say, is a die-hard Trekkie.
Paramount noticed the start-up company after it produced some
on-line games for E! Online (most notably the fun little
time-waster that enabled users to sink the Titanic last year). ``It
didn't hurt that we were fanatic Trekkies,'' Roberts says,
launching the PADD (personal access display device) that enables
easy navigation of the mammoth site.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you build a site for Star Trek, you can use all your
technical bells and whistles,'' Roberts explains, practically
whistling himself. He clicks into the Klingon Linguistic Studies
area, where newbies like you-know-who can learn the language and
hear the synthesized voice of Majel Roddenberry, widow of Trek
founder Gene Roddenberry; she pronounces and defines vocabulary in
Klingon. For instance, butlh, pronounced ``boock,'' means dirt
under the tips of humanoid fingers. Noted.
</P>
<P>
   The site, of course, includes a section on ``Star Trek:
Insurrection,'' the latest adventure film, which opens next Friday.
And, of course, the Star Trek store is now open on line, part of
the $2 billion entertainment phenomenon that started modestly with
the first television series in 1966 and spawned three additional TV
series, nine feature films, scores of books and action figures,
dozens of unofficial Web sites, as well as thousands and thousands
of fans. And, yes, Star Trek: Continuum, is found at
www.startrek.com.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts and his partner Adam Prince, who also produce
non-galactic sites for earthly entities like Fidelity Investments,
seem to have found their dream job with the Trek assignment. But
there's a guy out in Hollywood who has a job that would bring tears
to the eyes of all those Trekkies rushing to see ``Insurrection''
next weekend. His name is Guy Vardaman, and he maintains the
official Star Trek database, which contains more than 30 years of
trivia and lore. The very idea makes your nltlhpachs itch (that's
fingernails, humanoid!).
</P>
<P>
   Vardaman, 33, worked closely with the Screen House folks on the
site, and he's the guy at Paramount responsible for answering
e-mail from the discerning audience. ``I've got a backlog of about
10,000 here,'' he says. He proceeds to read one about a ``warp core
breach.'' ``As you can see, we get a whole bunch of real technical
questions,'' he says, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Vardaman counts himself as a sort of soft-core Trekkie. ``I
watched the original series when I was a kid, but when I reached
adolescence, Captain Kirk came off the wall and Farah Fawcett went
up,'' he recalls. While he was a college student studying
electro-optical engineering, he landed a gig as an extra on one of
the Trek television series, and it turned into a full-time job. ``I
guess star dates and trivia pushed out my knowledge of the indices
of light refraction,'' he says, sighing. ``What can you do? I think
I know more about `Star Trek' than many things in my life I should
know more about.'' Like what? ``Like plumbing. If they could just
make the plumbing in my house look like the Enterprise floor plan,
I could figure it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Vardaman is quick to point out that the only Trek uniform he's
ever worn came out of the costume department. Sure, he loves his
job, but would he ever consider doing anything else? ``Why do you
ask? Do you have an offer? I don't think there are a lot of places
where you can go with a real advanced knowledge of Star Trek and
use it to make a living,'' he says. Well, there's this place down
on the Boston waterfront. Take a left at the crater and a right at
the roadblock. Ask for Skyhopper.
</P>
<P>
   Search of the week. Trekkies, by their very nature, have been on
line since the very beginning, back in the day when some of us were
still trying to work our VCRs and other more enterprising types
were trying to figure out how to make money on this thing called
the Internet. The best way to solve the VCR problem is to marry an
engineer. As for the money solution, it's called e-commerce. And
that's the reason some Trekkies are at war in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   A quick search leads Trekkies to Star Trek: WWW (www.stwww.com)
one of the best unofficial sites in intergalactica. Billed as
``Mother of all Star Trek sites,'' it's run by an Italian Trekkie
named Luca Sambucci. Last year, he and other Trekkie Web masters
received letters from Paramount's parent company Viacom, which
charged that they were infringing on copyrights by using Star Trek
images on their sites. Sambucci launched the Online Freedom
Federation, which fired off a petition to Viacom striving to reach
a compromise that enabled the fans to have their fun and enabled
the corporate monolith to generate revenue from its property. By
the latest count, Sambucci has collected 23,881 signatures.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the affected sites have been shut down, and others
continue, with or without the unauthorized images. One of the
funniest of these sites (www.bradley.edu/campusorg/psiphi/mov/)
includes an annotated copy of the letter from Viacom, in which the
Trekkie renegade parses the legalese and corrects the punctuation.
Too bad it isn't written in Klingon. Do`Ha' _ in Klingon, ``That is
unfortunate.''

YOUNG UNLIKELY CANDIDATES FOR REPETITIVE STRAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JUDY FOREMAN   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Children who play on new kiddie computers are unlikely to suffer
repetitive strain injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome because,
unlike adults, they don't usually sit still at a computer hour
after hour, day in and day out.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's the prediction of Robert Follansbee, director of
the computer learning program in the communication enhancement
center at Children's Hospital in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some evidence that kids using video games get some
RSI,'' he says, referring to repetitive strain injury, but ``that's
with a huge amount of use. It seems unlikely that most kids would
use a computer intensively enough to develop'' the problems that
adults or college students do. ``Many difficulties that adults get
come from massive amounts of touch typing day after day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most kids don't use the keyboard that way. They type slower
and not for long periods of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Children also tend not to stay seated in the same position for
hours on end the way adults do. Instead, they get up and down and
move around, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Whether small children would be better off doing something other
than using computers is another question, and one for which there
are no clear answers yet because computers designed for children
are so new.
</P>
<P>
   The American Academy of Pediatrics has no guidelines for
computer use among small children. It does say, however, that ``the
amount of time that a child spends watching TV is a major concern.
If your child spends three to four hours a day watching TV, then
time for other activities is limited.'' The academy advises
limiting children's screen time _ including video games _ to less
than two hours a day.

FOR IBM, YOU'RE NEVER TOO YOUNG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Would you pay $2,300 for a home computer, when you can easily
buy two for that price?
</P>
<P>
   The computer is made by IBM Corp, not some maker of cut-rate
clones. It's got an Intel microprocessor, a big hard drive and lots
of memory. And not only does the system include a color monitor,
IBM throws in a computer desk and chair, ergonomically designed for
comfort and easy operation.
</P>
<P>
   Sound like a deal? Okay, but there is a catch. The IBM Young
Explorer computer isn't for Mom or Dad or even Big Sister. This
pricey new computer was designed in cooperation with Little Tykes
Co., the popular maker of toy furniture for toddlers, and is
intended for children aged 4 through 7.
</P>
<P>
   The Young Explorer isn't a family computer _ it's a kid's
computer, with every feature tailored to a preschooler's idea of
comfort. IBM says it's the first machine of its kind, created for
use in day care centers. But when hundreds of parents began asking
where they could buy one to use at home, IBM executive Michele
Riggs decided it was time to take a gamble, and begin selling Young
Explorer at retail.
</P>
<P>
   Riggs thinks Young Explorer is the product many American
children and their parents have been waiting for. ``We are
responsible for insuring that our kids have the right tools so they
can learn for the future,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Riggs herself is a mother of two. Her official title _ ``market
segment manager for moms and dads with kids at home'' _ shows how
far IBM has moved from its blue-suited Fortune 500 past in an
effort to tap the massive consumer technology market.
</P>
<P>
   The Young Explorer isn't your typical desktop computer. Indeed,
it's an entire desk. A 14-inch color monitor peeks out of a tough
plastic housing, and the keyboard is a part of the desk itself.
Unlike standard keyboards that can easily be ruined by spilled milk
and cookie crumbs, the Young Explorer uses a membrane-type keyboard
permanently sealed under thick plastic.
</P>
<P>
   The tough but friendly design was tailored to the needs of Young
Explorer's original target market _ schools and day care centers,
where the machines would regularly receive harsh treatment from
dozens of very low-tech children. Field testing even led IBM and
Little Tykes to modify the plastic seat, when they found that
toddlers view computing as a social activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made it a bench so it can accomodate two kids,'' Riggs
said. And instead of a modem for dialing onto the Internet, each
unit comes with a built-in Ethernet adapter, for connection to a
school's internal computer network.
</P>
<P>
   The Young Explorer has been available since April to schools and
day care centers, but IBM executives soon got word that teachers
and kids weren't the only ones who liked it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we rolled this product out, we were getting unbelievable
calls from parents saying, `We want this product. I'll write you a
check right now.' '' The same thing happened this fall, when a
Young Explorer unit was exhibited for two weeks at the Oklahoma
State Fair.
</P>
<P>
   IBM decided to begin selling the Young Explorer at retail this
week. ``We are responding to our customers,'' said Riggs.
</P>
<P>
   But it is far too early to know whether all the tirekickers will
really break out their checkbooks for computer, which is available
by mail order directly from IBM and from Little Tykes.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco-based children's software expert Cathy Miranker
thinks the Young Explorer is fine for schools and day care centers.
But she's skeptical about its value in the home.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you happen to have septuplets or something, you probably
want some special computer equipment,'' said Miranker, author of
Great Software for Kids and Parents, part of the popular ``For
Dummies'' book series. ``But I don't see any pressing need for this
kind of equipment, other than its physical charm.''
</P>
<P>
   Miranker said that most households could make do with a cheaper
standard computer equipped with a special kiddie keyboard and
mouse. ``Kids are very adaptable,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Miranker fears that parents who have just parted
with $2,300 may try to get their money's worth by encouraging small
children to spend too much time on the machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm opposed to their parking their kids in front of the
computer the same way parents park their kids in front of the TV,''
Miranker said.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's Riggs said she doesn't want that to happen either.
``Nothing, absolutely nothing, should be used as a babysitting
tool,'' she warned. The Young Explorer isn't supposed to be a
substitute for ``Rugrats'' reruns, but a high-tech head start for
curious kids and ambitious parents.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 Changing Default Font In Word 97  
 By David Einstein   
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Question: &LR;  Is there some way to change the default setting for
Word 97 from Times New Roman 10 to Times New Roman 12? I am getting
tired of reformatting my letters after they are done.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  I don't know why Microsoft uses 10-point type as the
default in Word. It's too small on the screen, and it's too small
when you print it out. Anyway, there's an easy remedy to the
situation. Go into the Format menu in Word and choose Font. Select
the font you want (in this case, Times New Roman 12), and click on
the Default button at the bottom of the window. From that point on,
all new documents will default to your chosen font.
</P>
<P>
   Copying to Another Drive
</P>
<P>
   Q: I would like to copy all the files from my old hard drive on
a Windows 95 computer to my new computer, which has Windows 98. I
am trying to avoid having to reinstall all my applications on the
new computer. Is there a smart way to do this?
</P>
<P>
   A: It can be done, but not easily. You'll need a program such as
DriveCopy from PowerQuest ($30), which can copy the contents of one
hard drive to another. And you'll have to remove the hard drive
from the new computer and connect it to the old one, which entails
opening up both cases and messing with cables and power lines.
</P>
<P>
   Also, I don't think it's possible to copy applications without
also copying the operating system, which means you'd be
transferring Windows 95 to your new hard drive. You could then use
the Windows 98 disc that came with your new computer to upgrade the
hard drive to Windows 98. But that seems like an awful lot of work
just to transfer your applications and documents.
</P>
<P>
   The more practical approach is simply to reinstall your
applications on the new computer and copy your document files from
the old computer to the new one using a floppy disk or a Zip drive.
</P>
<P>
   Refurbished Computers
</P>
<P>
   Q: I occasionally see ads for refurbished/reconditioned
computers from major vendors. These often are near top-of-the-line
models, selling for a significant discount. Often, warranties are
provided. Are these PCs likely to be good deals, or are there
pitfalls a consumer should know about?
</P>
<P>
   A: Assuming that you can get the specifications you want _ chip
speed, memory, hard drive capacity, etc. _ a used or refurbished
computer can be a great deal. The components most susceptible to
failure are the hard drive and the CD-ROM drive, and the monitor
also could be a problem, especially if it's a few years old. But if
you get a warranty on those parts, there's little risk.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing to consider is expandability. If you think you
might want to add a new video or sound card, make sure the computer
has enough PCI expansion slots.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the issue of software. A good vendor will include
Windows 98 and a bundle of programs such as Microsoft Works, so you
won't have to fork over big bucks for a new set of applications.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the Question
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there some way that I can print out the address book in
the Netscape e-mail program? A copy would be handy to have while
traveling.
</P>
<P>
   A: You're in luck. The latest upgrade of Netscape Communicator,
version 4.5, lets you do just that. With your address book open,
choose Select All from the Edit menu. Then choose Export from the
file menu. You can save the list in the Netscape format or in
formats that can be printed from a word processor or spreadsheet.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AOL UPDATE: &LR;  A couple of weeks ago, I outlined a way to control
cookies using AOL 4.0. There's a catch, however _ you also must
have Internet Explorer 5.0 on your PC. AOL has a built-in version
of IE, which doesn't let you block cookies. But if you also have IE
5.0 installed, the AOL program will utilize some of the options of
the latest Microsoft browser _ including cookie control. You can
download the Beta of IE 5 for free from www.microsoft.com/ie.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to get around AOL's cookie conundrum is to use any
version of IE or Netscape Navigator instead of AOL's browser. After
connecting to AOL, simply start your other browser (after adjusting
its settings for cookie control).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; TIP OF THE WEEK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Here's a cool way to get on the Web fast from the Windows 98
desktop. Right-click on any blank area of your taskbar (that's the
bar that runs along the bottom of the screen). Point to Toolbars
and choose Address. An address space will be displayed on the
taskbar every time Windows is running. Type an Internet address
into the space, hit Enter, and the Internet Explorer browser will
open automatically.

PRINTERS MAKE THEIR MARK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SIMSON GARFINKLE   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As someone who has used laser printers for more than 15 years,
I've always looked at their less sophisticated cousins, ink jet
printers, with a good deal of suspicion and disdain. Year after
year, makers of inkjet printers have promised that their models
were just as good and just as fast as laser printers. But each time
I tried them out, I was disappointed _ until now.
</P>
<P>
   Today's generation of ink jet printers is nearly as good and
nearly as fast as all but the most expensive laser printers. At the
same time, you can do much more with a typical inkjet. As a result,
I'm doing so many things with an inkjet printer that you just can't
do with a laser printer that I am hard-pressed to recommend a laser
to anyone except, perhaps, an author who needs to repeatedly print
out drafts of a 400-page manuscript.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past month I've been experimenting with two
high-quality desktop printers: the Epson Stylus Color 640 and the
Lexmark 5770 Photo Jetprinter.
</P>
<P>
   Epson claims its printer has a resolution of 1440x720 dots per
inch, and prints five pages per minute. It comes with two
cartridges, one with black ink, the other with a mix of yellow,
cyan, and magenta inks, allowing you to print color photographs
with a four-color process. It is priced at $189.
</P>
<P>
   Lexmark, meanwhile, claims a resolution of 1200x1200 and eight
pages per minute print speed. It comes with a black cartridge and a
color cartridge. You can also buy a photo cartridge, which replaces
the black cartridge with black plus two colors, allowing you to
print color photographs with a six-color process. The Lexmark also
has slots on the side for flash cards for most digital cameras.
This lets you print a picture without first bringing the images
into your computer. This printer costs $315.
</P>
<P>
   As the name implies, ink jet printers work by spraying a jet of
ink at the paper. The ink comes out of a nozzle that moves back and
forth across each line. Laser printers, on the other hand, are
based on xerography. A laser beam is used to control the placement
of an electric charge on a metallic drum inside the printer. The
charge then picks up tiny bits of toner, which are deposited onto
the paper and then melted into place by a high-temperature heating
element.
</P>
<P>
   One reason I've always been incredulous about inkjet printers is
that their specifications never match what I observe when I try
them out. Consider speed. Unlike a laser printer, which prints at a
fairly constant rate regardless of what is being printed, the
performance of inkjets slow down when the page is text heavy. I
tried printing out pages from a new book that I'm writing and found
that the Epson would only print two pages per minute, while the
Lexmark printed between three and four. Those speeds go down
considerably, of course, when you print a full-color page in
photographic quality: expect to spend three to six minutes per page
when you start stamping out copies of 8x10 photographs. And while
these printers may have truly phenomenal clarity, the resolution
quoted is the resolution for a single dot of color. In order to
create a full-color photograph you need to blend many dots together
to form each full-color pixel, making the perceived resolution
somewhat less than is promised.
</P>
<P>
   But when I set my moral outrage aside and look at the printouts
from these devices, I am stunned. Although there are occasional
horizontal streaks and smudges in the black-and-white text from
dirt and dust on the print head, especially when you are printing
on plain paper, it's pretty hard to distinguish the print of the
Lexmark from the print of my Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 5P, which
costs $800.
</P>
<P>
   The Epson fares a little poorer in a side-by-side comparison
test, but it's still completely usable for both business and
personal correspondence. Put specially coated inkjet paper into
these printers and they can actually turn the tables on the laser
with print that is just as sharp, but with many tricks that a laser
printer simply can't play.
</P>
<P>
   Print a color photograph on glossy paper and you'll see an image
that is nothing short of spectacular. Indeed, the only problem with
printing photos with these printers is getting the digitized image
in the first place: anything that you download from the Web or snap
with a low-resolution digital camera will look like so many pixels
when you print it on 8x11 paper. If you are printing a JPEG file, a
common stardard for compressing images, be sure that you get one
that is at least 200 kilobytes in size or you won't be happy with
the results.
</P>
<P>
   Now that I've got these printers connected to my computers, I'm
discovering lots of other uses for printing with color. When I'm
traveling someplace new, I'll get a map from the Internet and print
it for myself in full-color. I've also started printing my
letterhead and envelopes with a color logo and return address. I've
even made a letter head file with a Microsoft Word template file,
so that I can print the letterhead along with my correspondence.
</P>
<P>
   For more ideas, just go to a large stationery supply store or a
computer store and you'll find an astonishingly wide variety of
inkjet-ready office supplies. You can get labels for envelopes,
floppy disks, CDROMs, and even Zip cartridges. There are overhead
transparencies. There are more than a dozen different grades of
photo-quality glossy paper, including thick stock that looks just
as good as the stuff that comes back from the photo lab. And there
are postcards and greeting cards that are inkjet-ready for your
personal message.
</P>
<P>
   I've tried paper from Epson, H-P, Lexmark, Avery, and others.
Overall, I haven't seen any problems in putting HP paper into the
Epson printer or Epson paper into the Lexmark. I've even tried
doing some two-sided printing for some brochures that I printed for
a friend's company. They came out pretty well with every paper I
tried except the Great White Recycled Content Paper that I picked
up at Staples. Great White worked great on the front page, but
printing on the back with my inkjet smeared.
</P>
<P>
   The most important thing that I've learned on my printing
endeavors is that you won't get good results unless you set the
paper type before you go to print something. Setting the paper type
is quite easy: in Windows 95, just hit the roperties button before
you hit the OK button on the Print panel. On a Mac you can hit a
similar button that is labeled Options.
</P>
<P>
   Setting the paper type tells the printer how much ink to send
through the nozzles and gives it instructions for manipulating the
paper feed rollers. Set it wrong and you won't be happy with the
results.

FINDING GIFTS _ AND SOME SECURITY _ ON THE NET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This Christmas, you could probably do all your shopping from
home. The Internet gold rush has driven thousands of merchants onto
the Web, selling everything from jewelry to automobiles. Now the
big problem is finding what you want, and a trustworthy merchant to
buy it from.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most secure place for electronic shopping is the
America Online computer network. AOL runs its own shopping mall,
open only to subscribers to the service. Many of the merchants
doing business on AOL are well-known outfits like Walt Disney Co.,
L.L. Bean and Macy's. Many also run major shopping sites on the
public Internet, so you needn't be an AOL subscriber to deal with
them. But as the saying goes, membership has its privileges.
</P>
<P>
   AOL pledges total safety and satisfaction to customers who
purchase merchandise at its on-line mall. All merchants must use
the latest digital security systems to make sure customer data
can't be swiped by hackers. The threat of having one's credit card
number intercepted by data thieves has been wildly exaggerated. But
to reassure customers, AOL promises to reimburse shoppers if their
credit card data falls into the wrong hands.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, all stores at the AOL site must respect their
customers' privacy and guarantee their satisfaction. AOL itself
promises to reimburse customers if the guarantee isn't met by the
merchant .
</P>
<P>
   About 14 million people are AOL members. What about the rest of
us? We can find similar on-line shopping centers at the popular
portal sites. These sites began life as search engines, listing
millions of interesting Internet pages. Now, in order to attract a
constant stream of traffic, they offer many other services,
including listings of retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these are companies that have paid for a spot on, say,
the Yahoo shopping site. Unlike AOL, Yahoo offers virtually no
assurance that one of its stores is a good place to shop. ``There's
not a universal set of protections that apply to every single
store,'' said Yahoo director of brand management Karen Edwards. The
company will offer refunds to disgruntled shoppers on a
case-by-case basis, and spokesman Tim Brady said that Yahoo will
rid itself of bad apples. So far, he added, it hasn't been
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The Excite Web site offers somewhat more consumer protection
through its Certified Merchants program. These are on-line stores
that have to meet fairly rigorous customer service standards. But
not every store listed at the Excite shopping mall is certified,
and it took a little hunting to find a list of the certified
merchants.
</P>
<P>
   Most uncertified stores are run by honest merchants, so don't
write them off. Preston Gralla , author of ``The Complete Idiot's
Guide to Online Shopping,'' says you can take steps to protect
yourself. ``Check for warranty and return policies,'' he urges.
Responsible merchants will generally display them prominently at
the site. ``If there's no warranty and return policy posted, I
wouldn't shop at the site.''
</P>
<P>
   Also beware of sites that don't display the address and phone
number of the company. ``If a site isn't willing to post that kind
of information, I wouldn't want to do business with them,'' said
Gralla.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Internet credit card theft is highly unlikely,
reputable firms will use a secure transaction system for extra
protection. Your browser will display a message when you connect to
a secured shopping area on the `Net, and the ``http'' at the
beginning of the Web address will turn into ``https.`` If this
doesn't happen, shop elsewhere. These days, the Internet has plenty
of alternatives to choose from.

NET CAN'T DECK THE MALLS -- YET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By CHRIS REIDY   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ On-line shopping is supposed to be going mainstream
this holiday season, so why is Jeff Levine still hunting for gifts
the old-fashioned way at CambridgeSide Galleria?
</P>
<P>
   A 28-year-old city planner for nearby Somerville, Levine is
young, educated, and computer-savvy, going on line almost every
day.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, he seems an ideal candidate for hunkering down in
front of his personal computer and buying gifts from some trendy
electronic-commerce retailer like Amazon.com, which bills its World
Wide Web site as the world's biggest book store.
</P>
<P>
   Yet early December finds Levine in a mall, undaunted by the
prospect of big crowds, long lines, and scarce parking spaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to beat a mall when you just want to browse,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   If the hype of e-commerce advocates is to be believed, 17
million Americans will buy something on line this holiday season _
many of them dressed only in their pajamas. After a few years of
experimenting and buying items such as software and hot sauce, many
consumers are at last comfortable with electronic shopping.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, on-line holiday sales are expected to double,
growing from last year's $1.1 billion to $2.3 billion _ or so
claims Jupiter Communications, a New York research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's no need to start writing obituaries for the mall
and the department store just yet. While nearly half of US
households now own a personal computer, on-line sales will account
for only about 2 percent of the more than $170 billion US consumers
are expected to spend this holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet shopping is still so small it hardly shows up,'' says
Britt Beemer of America's Research Group, a firm that surveys
consumer shopping patterns.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not to say the Internet won't change the way people
shop and the way retailers do business.
</P>
<P>
   At the Boston Consulting Group, vice president David Pecaut is
eager to dispel some myths about on-line shopping.
</P>
<P>
   What's likely to emerge is not a battle between hip e-commerce
retailers on one side and old-fashioned brick-and-mortar retailers
on the other. As Pecaut sees it, shrewd retailers are likely to
operate both in stores and on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, some brick-and-mortar retailers continue to shy
away from the Net, afraid a Web site may cannibalize store sales.
Such fears, Pecaut says, are unfounded _ and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones who get on the Web late will struggle,'' falling
further and further behind those who got there first, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Macy's, the hallowed department-store chain, may offer one
blueprint for future success. In June, Macy's mailed out its first
catalog, and last month it ``relaunched'' its Web site. An early
Web site sold only 400 items. At the new version of Macys.Com ,
shoppers can choose from among 150,000 items.
</P>
<P>
   By offering three choices _ stores, catalogs, and Web site _
Macy's expects to see syngergies, savings, and more sales.
</P>
<P>
   Catalogs and Web sites, of course, mean Macy's can sell
merchandise in places where it has no stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you live in Kansas, you can now buy gifts from Macy's,''
says Carol Sanger, spokeswoman for Federated Department Stores
Inc., Macy's parent company.
</P>
<P>
   Not only can the Web help Macy's reach new geographic areas ,
but it will also help Macy's to reach out to new demographic
groups. Most department-store customers range in age from 30 to 50,
but on-line shoppers tend to be younger. Macy's hopes its Web site
will attract this much coveted younger crowd.
</P>
<P>
   According to Sanger, a traditional merchant such as Macy's has
an advantage over pure e-commerce retailers that sell their
merchandise only on the Web. Unlike new companies with strange
names, Macy's has a long history that may allay the fears of
consumers wary of using their credit cards for on-line purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Despite repeated industry claims that encryption makes such
transactions safe, mall shopper Levine is one who remains wary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still concerned about security,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Dempsey is worried about something else; he thinks his
shopping strategy won't work on line. The Web may be great if you
know ahead of time what you want to buy, but if you're looking for
gift ideas, malls are better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to buy theme gifts,'' says Dempsey, a 25-year-old
teacher who prefers to buy several small items for individuals on
his shopping list rather than one big present.
</P>
<P>
   When coming up with themes, window-shopping in malls is a source
of inspiration, he says. And though he often goes on the Internet
for other reasons, he says: ``Right now it's easier to go to the
malls. Besides, I actually like to shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Macys.Com president Kent Anderson doesn't think the Internet
will end browsing as we know it; it will simply modify old habits.
Some folks will browse Web sites and buy in stores, and others will
browse stores and then buy on line, he believes. Macy's job is to
be all things to all shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   The shopper of the future may look like Northeastern University
student Leo Wiriadjaja, who buys books on line and clothes at the
mall. Just as Macy's offers customers three ways to buy
merchandise, many consumers will reach a point when they buy some
items on line, some by catalog, and others in stores.
</P>
<P>
   Why won't Wiriadjaja buy clothes on line? ``I'm not a normal
size,'' he says. ``I like to try things on first.''
</P>
<P>
   At its Web site, Lands' End Inc. looks to address such concerns
with a new ``virtual mannequin,'' one of many personalization
features e-commerce retailers are relying on more heavily this
year, as they seek to find ways to make on-line shopping a more
customer-friendly experience.
</P>
<P>
   At Landsend.com, some visitors can type in their measurements
and color preferences for a sweater, and the mannequin will not
only exhibit an image of how it will look on their body type, but
also suggest ideas for color-coordinated skirts and trousers.
</P>
<P>
   Another feature helps men select shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many shirts are available that it can be a daunting
challenge to wade through all of them,'' says Willie Doyle, a
Lands' End Internet executive.
</P>
<P>
   The Oxford Express aims to make that task easier. Type in a
fabric preference. (Oxford pinpoint or 60-40 cotton blend?) Type in
a collar preference. (Button-down or tab?) After answering these
and similar questions, customers can quickly zero in on what they
want, Doyle says.
</P>
<P>
   Other Web sites tout similar search features.
</P>
<P>
   At Holtoutlet.com, the Web site of a Waltham company that sells
toys on line, shoppers can use a ``toy detective.'' No, this
playroom shamus won't be able to track down Furby _ but, then,
Furby is also hard to find at stores _ but type in the age of a
child on your gift list, a price range, and the kid's favorite TV
show, and the toy detective is supposed to round up some likely
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Holt debuted something else to help shoppers: a
rating system that lets customers grade the toys they've bought and
publish brief reviews that appear on Holt's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   MotherNature.com employs a similar strategy as it pursues its
goal to become the Amazon.com of on-line vitamins.
</P>
<P>
   Type in a malady at MotherNature.com's Web site, and a range of
possible remedies pop up. Built into the site is a ``health
encyclopedia,'' explains marketing vice president Sharon Rice.
</P>
<P>
   What distinguishes the best retail Web sites are ``selection and
information,'' she says. People may be reluctant to discuss medical
problems with a store clerk, but they may be more at ease going on
line in the privacy of their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Certain commodity-type items such as books and music CDs have
sold well on the Internet. After all, a book is a book, whether
bought at Amazon.com or an old-fashioned book store.
</P>
<P>
   Rice believes vitamins, herbs, and supplements fall into a
similar category; by offering more choices and information, an
e-commerce retailer can gain an edge over brick-and-mortar rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Time _ or a lack of it _ may be the mall's worst enemy and the
Web's best friend. Faced with so many chores and errands,
two-income families want fast, hassle-free ways to shop.
</P>
<P>
   Such realities may explain why some malls are feeling the pinch
from the so-called power center, a much smaller strip mall anchored
by a superstore such as Home Depot, says Simmons College retail
professor Susan Sampson. The appeal? Consumers can zip in and out
of power centers far easier than big malls.
</P>
<P>
   But if consumers are looking to save time, they also want
service. And on that score, many Web sites don't measure up.
According to a recent study by Jupiter Communications, many Web
sites are ``failing miserably'' at service. Seeing an opening,
retail chains such as Filene's are redesigning parts of their store
floor plans to make shopping more convenient and less
time-consuming.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many Web sites will get things right sooner or later _
even a confirmed mall shopper like Levine acknowledges that.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether he can see himself shopping on line some day,
he replies, ``It's probably just a matter of time.''

ORACLE JOINS SUN IN PLAN TO CHALLENGE WINDOWS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Microsoft's archrivals, Sun Microsystems and
Oracle, plan to announce a joint effort on Monday to make corporate
computer users less reliant on Microsoft's Windows software.
</P>
<P>
   Sun and Oracle intend to create network server computers that
users of desktop machines can draw upon for many of their basic
computing activities, reducing the need for a full-blown desktop
operating system like Windows. The move is also meant to slow the
rapid rise of Microsoft's office-network version of Windows, called
Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   It is a strategy that Sun and Oracle have pursued in the past,
so far without success.
</P>
<P>
   The new plan is based on a cross-licensing agreement the two
companies signed earlier this month. The agreement gave Oracle the
ability to use a portion of Sun's Solaris operating system software
to create simple server computers that would be designed to run
Internet and office data base applications. The agreement also
permits Sun to add Oracle's data base software to the Solaris
operating system, which competes with Windows NT from Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The plan conforms to a strategy that has been outlined by
Oracle's chairman, Lawrence Ellison, in his effort to fight Windows
and Windows NT by doing away with the need for an operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Ellison announced that Oracle planned to introduce a
new version of its Oracle 8 data base program code-named Raw Iron,
which he said would be sold by makers of PC server computers,
including Compaq, Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard and Dell
Computer as an adaptation that would, in effect, render the
operating system invisible to the user.
</P>
<P>
   The new strategy is a refinement of Ellison's attempt in years
past to persuade corporate computer managers to simplify their
networks by replacing the personal computer on a worker's desktop
with a simpler terminal called a network computer.
</P>
<P>
   That effort had the support of Novell, Sun, Netscape and a
number of other Microsoft rivals. The companies began plotting an
alternative to the personal computer in 1995, based on the idea of
inexpensive desktop computers that would download software via
corporate networks. But the approach has been slow to develop, in
part because of the sharply falling cost of personal computers and
in part because computer makers have been slow to offer
commercially viable systems.
</P>
<P>
   But Ellison and his allies have not given up. In its most recent
iteration, the network computing idea now calls for almost all
computing tasks to be centralized on servers, so that users' own
computers will do little more than act as monitors for the server
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems, for example, has begun developing an
experimental version called Newt, which the company describes as an
``ultra-thin client.''
</P>
<P>
   The device would have the advantage of reducing the costs of
operating corporate computers while centralizing and simplifying
their management. But it requires a relatively bureaucratic style
of computing that takes away a great deal of the freedom to which
users have become accustomed as they use PC's.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives deride the Sun-Oracle approach as a style
of computing that went out of fashion with the mainframes and
minicomputers that held sway in the 1960s and 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   But the criticism has not deterred Ellison, who is promising a
vast drop in the complexity and cost of computing for small
businesses.

IBM TO RELEASE ORIGINAL INSTRUCTIONS OF E-MAIL PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adding momentum to the open-source movement for the free sharing
of software, IBM plans Monday to make available the original
programmer's instructions for a new mail program that can be used
to store and forward e-mail messages with a high level of security.
</P>
<P>
   The program, Secure Mailer, serves as an electronic post office
for server computers connected to the Internet. It was developed by
Wietse Venema, an IBM researcher and computer security specialist.
Executives said they were using the free, open-source model of
software distribution to insure that the program would be widely
available on the dozens of kinds of computers that are used to
route Internet mail traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The open source model of software development, pioneered by a
loosely affiliated group of expert programmers, is built on
universal sharing of the programmer's original written instructions
to the computer. In traditional, proprietary development models,
those instructions are hidden because they have been compiled into
the binary 1s and 0s that computers understand.
</P>
<P>
   The open-source model has been gaining popularity in the last
year based on the success of the free Linux operating system, and
in recent months several major technology corporations have
endorsed part or all of the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is IBM's Christmas present to the Internet,'' said Abner
Germanow, a computer security analyst at the International Data
Corp., a market research firm. ``For these are core pieces of
software, and we're going beyond trying to make money off of them,
to the idea that by freely sharing them it will make the world a
better place.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many big companies, the International Business Machines
Corp. seems to be cautiously feeling its way toward an open-source
strategy. Secure Mailer follows by just a week the company's
release of the source code for a compiler, the tool used by
software developers to transform instructions written in a
programming language into the computer's binary machine code.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, IBM is making its software compatible with Apache,
a popular open-source Web server program, and earlier this year it
announced plans to make a version of its DB2 relational data base
program available for the open-source Linux operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still trying to understand exactly what open source
means,'' said Paul Horn, vice president for research. ``It
obviously plays an important role where standards are critical, but
what it means to IBM is still under formulation.''
</P>
<P>
   Secure Mailer offers an alternative to several other freely
available programs that route Internet mail, including Sendmail and
Q Mail, as well as to commercial programs like Microsoft's
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Currently about 70 percent of all e-mail worldwide is handled by
Sendmail, a program that has been developed over more than a decade
and supported by a programmer named Eric Allman and a loose group
of colleagues. Recently, Allman started a company to develop a
commercial version of the program.
</P>
<P>
   IBM researchers said one of the drawbacks to Sendmail was that
it had been written as a large, monolithic piece of software. As a
result it has both performance and security limitations.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Venema has developed Secure Mailer as a cluster of
modules, all of which distrust each other. This creates a more
secure program. The program could be compared to a ship that has
many independent compartments and therefore is harder to sink, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Palmer, who manages a computer security research group
at IBM's T.J. Watson Research Laboratory, said that enabling other
programmers to look at all the original instructions written by the
program's author would give them a high degree of confidence in the
security of a program.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When David Farber stepped down from the public stage of the
witness stand in the Microsoft antitrust trial last Wednesday after
two days of testimony, he found his own private audience eagerly
awaiting his return. And he did not disappoint them.
</P>
<P>
   Logging on hours after returning from Washington to his home in
Landenburg, Pa., the 64-year-old University of Pennsylvania
telecommunications professor dispatched an e-mail message. ``To all
those who I have ignored,'' the subject line read. The text of the
message went on to say, ``I have never felt so drained.''
</P>
<P>
   In Farber's case, ``To all'' refers to a sprawling network of
25,000 Internet users who have maneuvered themselves onto his
formidable mailing list over the last decade. His list _ which he
calls IP, for ``interesting people'' _has a devoted following among
the digerati, as well as less technological types. And it gives him
unrivaled, if unofficial, influence as a voice of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   That status helps explain why the Justice Department chose
Farber as an expert witness for a trial in which a central question
is whether Microsoft tried to monopolize the market in Internet
browser software.
</P>
<P>
   As master of the IP list, Farber typically exercises his opinion
almost solely through a selection process in which he forwards
three or four items culled from hundreds of information sources
that he deems most worthy of attention each day. At most, he may
add a one-line precis, as he did with a simple ``Bye bye liberty''
atop a mailing last month citing an Army Times article about the
government's expanded antiterrorism surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   But in last week's post-courtroom e-mail message, he allowed
himself more room for introspection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am endlessly astonished that all too often the trials seem
not to be interested in extracting the truth,'' Farber wrote, after
a difficult day of cross-examination by Microsoft's lawyer, Steven
Holley. ``Oh well.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing at a trial that has been dominated by software company
executives, Farber was the first technologist to testify without an
obvious ax to grind or damning e-mail record to refute. His
testimony focused on defining the technical terms that are at the
core of the dispute: whether Microsoft illegally used its monopoly
in the personal computer operating system market to give an unfair
advantage to the company's browser software, Internet Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   Farber argued that software was ``infinitely malleable'' and
that Microsoft had designed its Windows 98 operating system so that
consumers could not remove Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft dismissed Farber's testimony as ``nothing more than an
opinion piece on how he thinks Microsoft could have or should have
designed Windows.'' But it was an opinion that had a definite
appeal among a large segment of Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet reaction was like, `Ah-hah, there's our guy,'''
said Esther Dyson, editor of Release 1.0, an influential industry
newsletter, and chief of an international governing agency for
assigning Internet addresses. ``The trial has centered on the
Internet, but it's all been about the corporations of the Internet.
It was nice to finally have the users and creators represented in
the courtroom, as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some of those rooting for Microsoft found cause to applaud
Farber's appearance, including Scott Bradner, a senior technical
consultant at Harvard University. Bradner was in Orlando, Fla.,
last week at an annual meeting of the Internet Engineering Task
Force, an industry association. He said the 2,000 technology
enthusiasts at the conference seemed of mixed opinion about the
Microsoft trial. But he said he and many others were glad that
Farber, a longtime member of the group, had taken the stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more and more examples of where technical reality
has to be reconciled with the law,'' Bradner said. ``It's important
for objective reporters of technology to be able to explain it to
judges and juries in a way they can understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Farber is a bald, grandfatherly figure whose tendency to round
his Rs into Ws finds him affectionately compared to Elmer Fudd. But
it is a demeanor belying a distinguished resume.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in Jersey City, N.J., holds a master's degree in
mathematics from the Stevens Institute of Technology, and helped
invent the first electronic telephone switch in the early '60s as
an engineer at Bell Laboratories. It was there that he also
concocted the computer language Snobol and met his wife, GG, before
moving to Southern California and helping to organize the Internet.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He has been at the University of Pennsylvania since 1989. In
addition to teaching a course there on computer ethics and society
this term, Farber has been a technical consultant for Intel Corp.
and the Internet service provider Earthlink, among others. He
serves on the Presidential Advisory Committee on High Performance
Computing and Communications, and sits on the board of the
nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   But he said in an interview last week that ``the IP list has
made me the most famous.''
</P>
<P>
   The list began about 11 years ago, when Farber's friend Eric
Bloch started a demanding job at the National Science Foundation
and complained that he no longer had time to read news, on the
Internet or anywhere else. Farber began forwarding items to Bloch
and then to others.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the list became to the technology elite what an invitation
to Irving (Swifty) Lazar's Oscar party once was to Hollywood's
glitterati _ the industry's place to be. And by now, the IP list is
widely considered the single most influential source of relevant
and up-to-date news about all dimensions of the technological
world.
</P>
<P>
   When Jon Postel, an Internet founder and a former PhD student of
Farber's, died unexpectedly last month, for instance, IPers learned
about it before anyone else. Word came through a posting by Farber
that was followed by a eulogy from Vint Cerf, a longtime associate
who is now senior vice president at MCI Worldcom and chairman of
the Internet Society, a professional group.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Farber said he had enlarged and diversified the
list, including homemakers and students who had requested to be
added to a group of recipients that also includes Intel's chairman,
Andrew Grove, and many leading technology journalists.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has many mailing lists _ 90,095 by one count _ but
Farber's may reflect more than any other the power of
distributed-information networks. As he adds subscribers to the
list, each becomes an additional source of information. And Farber
performs the function of a trusted filter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has become a social node in a network of people,'' said
David Bennahum, a subscriber to the list and author of a new book,
``Extralife,'' about growing up with computers. ``He helped form
the Internet socially by connecting all these important people
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Even human network nodes have to rest sometimes, though. Late
last week, Farber posted what may be one of his final messages of
the year to the IP list:
</P>
<P>
   ``After Sunday IP will be off the air and so will I for 10 days
as I go off to a place in Hawaii where there are no phones, no
radios, no TVs etc. and certainly no EMAIL,'' he wrote. ``Have a
good Hanukkah and a Merry Christmas etc.''

ANALYSIS: IF MICROSOFT LOSES CASE, REMEDIES ARE THORNY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the Microsoft trial, witness after witness for the government
has described the big software company's industry-standard Windows
operating system as the essential utility of modern computing.
</P>
<P>
   To succeed in the marketplace, they explain, a new software
product must have access to Microsoft Corp.'s technology if the
product is to run smoothly on top of the Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Even a rival like Netscape Communications Corp., the Internet
browser pioneer, must ask for Microsoft's cooperation so that it
can compete against Microsoft _ a situation created by Microsoft's
broad reach across so many software and Internet commerce markets,
from spreadsheets to online travel services.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has depicted Microsoft as unfairly using
the technical leverage and market power that stems from its 90
percent share of the operating-system market to stifle competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case is fundamentally about access,'' said William
Kovacic, an antitrust expert at the George Washington University
Law School. ``Microsoft is accused, figuratively, of saying again
and again that you can't set foot on our bridge unless you agree to
the following conditions. If not, the company is left dangling with
one foot off the bridge or told to learn to swim.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet while the case raises the issue of access to technology, it
also shows that doing anything to force Microsoft to provide access
to its technology will be tricky, on both legal and practical
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, Justice Department lawyers have declared
Microsoft to be a monopoly at every opportunity. But they have
never once called it an ``essential facility'' _ a legal theory
that the courts have been reluctant to apply beyond regulated
monopolies like railroads, electric utilities and telephone
networks.
</P>
<P>
   The doctrine dates to 1912, when the Supreme Court ruled against
a group of railroads, led by a turn-of-the-century robber baron,
Jay Gould, that denied competitors access to a bridge on the
Mississippi River.
</P>
<P>
   But the government will almost certainly have to deal with the
issue of technology access if it wins the Microsoft case and asks
the court to order remedial action.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust experts observing the trial say that at least at the
U.S. District Court level, the government seems likely to win _
based on Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's actions, from giving the
Justice Department plenty of leeway to broaden its case with
last-minute evidence to remarking that Bill Gates, the Microsoft
chairman, ``has not been particularly responsive'' in his
videotaped deposition.
</P>
<P>
   In a related case last year, Jackson ruled against Microsoft,
though he was overruled by an appeals court last June.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department will not discuss possible remedies until
the case is over. Still, the government is stepping up its efforts
to try to devise an effective remedial plan. Joel Klein, the
assistant attorney general who heads the Justice Department's
antitrust division, has asked Timothy Bresnahan, an economics
professor at Stanford University, to study the options for
remedies, according to a person close to the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Bresnahan, known for his rigorous statistical studies of
industry structure and markets, is co-director of the Stanford
Computer Industry Project, a research program whose corporate
sponsors include Microsoft. He will be one of several experts
advising Klein on remedies. Daniel Rubinfeld, the chief economist
of the antitrust division, plans to leave the Justice Department at
the end of this year, but he will remain a consultant on the
Microsoft case.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the role of the economic and legal experts counseling the
Justice Department is mainly to present a set of options to Klein.
And although the White House does not get involved in the Justice
Department's investigations or decisions to file suits, it could
weigh in on the remedies issue.
</P>
<P>
   An effort by the Justice Department, for example, to try to
break up Microsoft or force the company to open up access to its
operating-system technology could well be a major economic policy
decision. Whether the government seeks sweeping or more limited
remedies will depend on how great the finding of liability is, if
any, against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   In the trial, the subject of access to Microsoft's technology is
typically raised in terms of a seemingly arcane three-letter
acronym _ API, for application program interface. APIs are the
software hooks that any program, from spreadsheets to games to
Internet browsers, must use to run smoothly on top of the operating
system, which controls the basic operations of a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every government witness has discussed APIs and has tried
to offer Jackson a nontechnical translation. ``You can think of
these interfaces as connectors, as a socket in a wall, like the
ones you put a plug in for electricity,'' Dr. James Gosling, a vice
president of Sun Microsystems Inc., explained to the judge last
week.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of access to Microsoft's APIs is at the root of the
government's case. Because Microsoft knows where every one of those
plugs is _ and how each one works _ competitors complain that it
has an enormous advantage over other developers in designing
software that will run seamlessly on Windows.
</P>
<P>
   It was to gain access to Microsoft's APIs that Netscape says it
met with Microsoft on June 21, 1995. Two days after that meeting,
responding to a government inquiry, Netscape's outside counsel,
Gary Reback, wrote to the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   At the June meeting, he stated, ``Microsoft indicated it would
not provide this information to Netscape unless Microsoft gets an
equity interest in Netscape, a seat on Netscape's board of
directors, and otherwise controls Netscape's ability to compete
against Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft denied the allegation, saying that Netscape and the
government had distorted a fairly routine meeting in the software
business, where companies often cooperate in some areas and compete
in others. ``There is no proof in the record that Microsoft denied
Netscape anything,'' said Charles Rule, a former senior Justice
Department official who is an adviser to Microsoft. ``The
government simply doesn't have a denial-of-access case.''
</P>
<P>
   Tackling the issue of open access to Microsoft's technology is
crucial to loosening the company's choke hold on the industry, said
Ken Wasch, president of the Software Publishers Association, a
trade group. ``Any remedy that doesn't in some way deal with access
to APIs won't have much of an impact,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But those software interfaces are Microsoft's intellectual
property, and having the government police the distribution of them
to other companies runs the risk of becoming a regulatory
nightmare. A few months ago, a senior Justice Department official
said emphatically, ``I don't want to get into the business of
having to be the arbiter of whether Microsoft has released every
new set of Windows APIs on a timely basis.''
</P>
<P>
   There could, however, be ways to limit the government's
oversight role. Justice Department officials did take note of the
announcement last week by Sun to open up the development of Java,
its Internet programming language. It announced that the accounting
firm Pricewaterhouse Coopers would audit the specification and
would guarantee fair, impartial distribution of Java APIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A behavioral remedy that requires some monitoring of access to
technology does take you down a regulatory path, but it could be
workable,'' said Carl Shapiro, an economist at the University of
California at Berkeley who is a former Justice Department official.

DIGITAL COMMERCE: THE DAY-TRADER PHENOMENON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Internet changes everything!'' has become the rallying cry
for purveyors of the new digital economy. Their enthusiasm has
proved sufficiently compelling that an increasing number of
Internet-based companies _ many with no product, no profits and,
often, no proven or sustainable business model _ are taking their
companies public and hitting the jackpot with shares that are
valued far beyond reason.
</P>
<P>
   On the Friday after Thanksgiving, for example, shares of Onsale
Inc., a Web-based auction service, rocketed more than 60 percent.
Books-a-Million Inc. and Connect Inc., both Web-based businesses,
posted even more spectacular gains.
</P>
<P>
   Most professional investors and market experts are not overly
concerned about this kind of activity. The volume of shares that
such companies make available for trading is relatively small and
thus has little effect on the overall health of the market. In
addition, they say, Internet stocks are widely, and correctly,
regarded as high-risk investments.
</P>
<P>
   But what was noteworthy about the trading action after
Thanksgiving was that it was caused by day traders _ primarily
individual investors, trading online _ who rely on quick market
fluctuations to turn a profit. And on the day after Thanksgiving,
these individuals dominated the trading volume in at least a few
high-technology growth stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet changes everything, indeed. For the first time,
anyone with a computer, a connection to the global network and the
requisite ironclad stomach for risk has the information, tools and
access to transaction systems required to play the stock market, a
game that was once the purview of an elite few.
</P>
<P>
   For those who believe that this kind of decentralization of
power is the primary benefit of an Internet-based economy, this is
good news. But one has to wonder about the unintended consequences
of such a fundamental shift.
</P>
<P>
   Some studies show that the number of individuals jumping onto
the Internet increases by thousands every day; as technology
improves, that number is likely to rise even faster. Information _
especially the kind of information that fuels stock trading, like
real-time quotes and company data _ is on the verge of becoming
ubiquitous.
</P>
<P>
   Couple that with the likelihood that as more individuals make
money in a booming stock market, the word of mouth _ spread in chat
rooms and news groups via the Internet itself _ is likely to
attract still more day traders, and you end up with a model for
exponential growth.
</P>
<P>
   Some market makers, in fact, are already projecting that they
will have to double or triple their technology investments to keep
up with increased volume from Internet traders.
</P>
<P>
   Though he believes the volatility of Internet stocks is not
itself a problem, William Hambrecht, co-founder of the investment
banking firm Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, calls the day trader phenomenon ``a
big thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been amazed they've been able to have such an impact on
some of these big-cap Internet stocks,'' said Hambrecht, who now
runs W.R. Hambrecht &AMP; Co., an entrepreneurial investment firm.
``This isn't a few people with a few small stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   He calls the current day trader phenomenon ``mob rule,'' and
adds: ``In a free market, it plays itself out. Professionals are
trying to tell these people that they're playing with dangerous
stuff, but people don't listen when they're in a feeding frenzy.''
</P>
<P>
   Some investors are anticipating the near-term effects of day
trading on the Internet economy itself, which is fueled in large
part by the hefty prices commanded by Internet-related stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``These price effects have consequences,'' says Ann Winblad, a
co-founder of Hummer Winblad Venture Partners in San Francisco, a
technology investment firm. A prolonged run-up in stock prices, she
says, could prove to be a double whammy for Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Ms. Winblad said, it will become increasingly
difficult to hire talented managers if they believe the shares are
so overpriced that the stock options being offered them _ the
pheromone that draws most executives to technology companies _ are
likely to be considerably devalued when the market comes to its
senses. If the company then resets the options at a lower, more
attractive price, institutional investors, who hold most of the
market's stock and tend to invest in assets rather than concepts,
will balk.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it is only these institutional investors, as well as
program traders who move large blocks of stock in a single,
computer-guided transaction, who can affect the overall stability
of the larger market. But if individual trading on the Internet
continues to grow at its current pace, it is possible to imagine a
situation where the market as we know it today cannot absorb the
shock.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Schwartz, chairman of the Global Business Network, a
strategic planning firm in Emeryville, Calif., points to the fact
that people around the world have access to the stock market
through the Internet. What happens, he asks, when ``vast numbers of
people from all around the world _ 50 million people in India, 5
million in Brazil _ are all trading?''
</P>
<P>
   If the number of individual investors grows large enough to
match the volume of shares held by institutional investors and
program traders, Schwartz says, ``when herd behavior moves the
larger market in these highly volatile ways, unrelated to the value
of the assets themselves, that becomes highly problematic.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is no way to predict whether such a situation
will unfold. Even if it does, Schwartz said, it will be a long time
coming.
</P>
<P>
   But in the short term, the problem may solve itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too many people have the stomach'' for day trading, Ms.
Winblad said. ``The viral effect will eventually settle. Some
industries are maimed, but they don't go away.''

   REDWOOD CITY, Calif. _ If David Farber, the government's central
witness at the Microsoft trial, is noteworthy for the number of
people who want to be included on his influential e-mail list, Paul
Vixie is famous _ some would say notorious _ for publishing an
online list that companies desperately want to avoid being on.
</P>
<P>
   Vixie is the creator and keeper of the Realtime Blackhole List,
a frequently updated list of Internet service providers and
Web-hosting companies that he concludes are being used to send
unsolicited bulk e-mail, or spam.
</P>
<P>
   Inclusion on the list is not merely embarrassing, it can be
costly. Hundreds of Internet service providers, universities and
other organizations around the world, following Vixie's advice,
automatically refuse to deliver messages originating from an
Internet service that has been ``blackholed'' (to use the industry
patois).
</P>
<P>
   When Vixie puts an Internet service provider, or ISP, on the
Blackhole list, the operator of that service will find that not
just spam but also regular e-mail is blocked from reaching all of
the service providers that adhere to Vixie's recommendations. Based
on Vixie's estimate of the number of subscribers to his list, he
says that a blackholed Internet provider will find itself unable to
send e-mail to 25 percent of the addresses on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Those services that have been blackholed at various times
include well-known companies like America Online, Microsoft
Network, ICG Communications' Netcom On-Line Services, and Earthlink
Network.
</P>
<P>
   Time spent in Vixie purgatory may last only a few minutes or can
sometimes stretch out for weeks, depending how quickly the labeled
offender takes anti-spam measures. Last June, the Microsoft Network
spent three-and-a-half days on the list after Vixie concluded the
company's e-mail servers were being used as a launching pad for
spam.
</P>
<P>
   Vixie acknowledges that his tactics may seem harsh, because even
nonspam messages get blocked, too. But he believes the severity of
the consequences provides the best way to get the attention of
offending ISPs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got e-mail from some mother who could no longer send e-mail
to her son in college,'' Vixie said. ``But either I cause a lot of
uncertainty for people until their ISP becomes a model network, or
the spammers win, and you and I, and that mother, would have
hundreds of messages coming in every day.''
</P>
<P>
   His goals may seem admirable. But Vixie, a 35-year old Internet
consultant without so much as a high-school diploma, is generating
increasing controversy because of his virtually unparalleled degree
of power to control Internet traffic.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some critics accuse Vixie of being arbitrary and
capricious. ``He's McCarthy reborn,'' said Alan Bechtold, owner of
BBS Press ServiceInc., an Internet service provider in Topeka,
Kan., which spent several days on the list last month. ``He's
arrogant, he believes in his cause,'' Bechtold said, ``but he's
totally blind to the damage he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Bechtold said his company, which operates Web server computers
on which other people maintain their own Web pages, was blackholed
because it once provided space for a Web page by a businessman who
used spam to advertise his own electronic-commerce business.
</P>
<P>
   But Bechtold said he had not been host to the businessman's site
since last July, and that the businessman was using a different
service to send the spam when Vixie added BBS to the Blackhole
list. When a reporter asked Vixie about this, he conceded that he
had not verified whether the businessman was still operating from
BBS when he added the company to the list.
</P>
<P>
   In his defense, Vixie's supporters say that in the unregulated
world of the Internet, he is tackling a problem that legislation
and technology have not been able to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   The Realtime Blackhole List ``works because people trust Paul to
make ethical, intelligent decisions about who goes on and who stays
off,'' said John Mozena, co-founder and vice president of the
Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial e-mail, an anti-spam
lobbying and trade group. ``If there is a consensus leader among
the anti-spammers,'' Mozena said. ``it would be Paul.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Vixie works from an office here in this Silicon Valley city,
which is lighted by little more than his computer screens and is
shared only with Elroy, his Labrador retriever and German shepherd
mix. Vixie adds an ISP to his list once he determines its network
is the originating source of spam and it does not move quickly
enough to stop once he issues a warning.
</P>
<P>
   He says he promptly removes a company from the Blackhole list
when it has proved to him that its e-mail servers _ the powerful
computers that send, receive and distribute electronic messages _
are no longer being used to send or relay unsolicited bulk e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   He may act without government decree or official appointment,
but his rise to power is hardly inexplicable or without support.
Supporting himself through consulting work and charging nothing to
maintain his Blackhole list, Vixie toils to serve ISPs,
universities and others who operate e-mail servers and are
desperate to stop the flow of spam. They loathe unsolicited e-mail
because it clogs their systems, consumes computer processing power
and annoys their customers. And typically, only the largest
Internet service providers can afford to effectively track down and
fight spammers on their own.
</P>
<P>
   That is why it is typically smaller service providers that
subscribe to Vixie's list. By programming their own e-mail servers
to automatically retrieve and implement his recommendations on
which Internet providers to block, Vixie's subscribers are able to
identify and block the incoming spam. They are also making a
collective statement that other ISPs had better rid their systems
of spammers, or else have even nonspam messages go undelivered.
</P>
<P>
   Vixie said that the average stay on the Realtime Blackhole List
was no more than a few days. He said that on a typical day, he
would add five networks to the list, and remove two or three. He
said that very infrequently, if ever, would a subscriber to his
list wind up being blackholed, because they were companies or
organizations that tended to be as anxious to avoid spam as he is.
</P>
<P>
   Four volunteers working at separate locations help Vixie sift
through potential spam, which they have received directly from
spammers or which concerned cybercitizens have forwarded to the
organization's Web site (http://maps.vix.com/rbl). The team then
tries to track down the origin of the spam and send a warning to
the company that operates the originating mail server.
</P>
<P>
   Vixie recently demanded, for example, that Earthlink, a large
Southern California Internet service with 815,000 users, revamp its
system to guard more effectively against being used by spammers,
according to Steve Dougherty, Earthlink's director of Internet
operations. Dougherty said Earthlink had already been planning to
install such safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   He found Vixie to be terse and inflexible in his demands. And in
the end, Dougherty said he had little choice but to accede.
</P>
<P>
   ``We accelerated our schedule,'' Dougherty said. ``He wields
that kind of power. He's a guy who can drop 30 percent of our
traffic.''

Sites ready to indulge taste for the offbeat 
By Bill Husted  
c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The trouble with the Internet these days is that it's
so danged practical.
</P>
<P>
   If you're heading for a picnic on Saturday, you can check out
the weather at the Weather Channel at http://www.weather.com. Then
you can drop in at
</P>
<P>
   http://members.xoom.com/KountryCook/sofryck.htm to get a recipe
for the fried chicken you want to bring.
</P>
<P>
   That's all well and good, but the real fun of the Web used to be
exploring pages that were totally useless but loads of fun. There
are only so many chuckles in a forecast that tells you it'll be
partly cloudy on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   So today, we'll take a break from the real world and check out
some sites that are just plain fun.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start with a site that may actually be useful. It's called
Roadside America and calls itself a guide to offbeat vacation
attractions. You'll find the home page at
http://www.roadsideamerica.com/.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've visited the page, you'll know things your friends
and co-workers do not. For instance, you'll discover on the east
side of Baltimore, in the restaurant known as Hausner's, ``there is
a huge ball of string in one of the off-rooms. Visitors to the
restaurant can't see the ball of string unless they go in search of
the restroom and make a wrong turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, in case you ever visit the little town of Norton, Kan., the
page will tell you about a ``picture gallery in the First State
Bank, with pictures of all the men who have run for president and
lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that we have your next vacation planned, let's give you
reason to celebrate. If you love holidays and find Christmas,
Hanukkah and New Year's Eve aren't enough to fill your appetite,
then there is good news for you.
</P>
<P>
   Set your browser for
</P>
<P>
   http://www.jpmorgan.com/cgi-bin/HolidayCalendar and you'll find
yourself at the J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. page devoted to holidays around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Just take any date and use the pull-down menu to set the Web
page to find the holidays for that date. You'll learn, for
instance, that tomorrow (Dec. 14) is a Russian holiday,
Constitution Day. You can also use the pull-down menus to look at
holidays specific to other countries. That way you can learn that,
in Botswana, Dec. 26, is Boxing Day.
</P>
<P>
   If you really want to waste some time, and find some surprises,
try WebCrawler Web Roulette. Just go to
http://www.webcrawler.com/cgi-bin/random and you'll be presented
with links to 10 Web pages selected at random. (Parents should keep
in mind the pages are randomly selected and the possibility exists
of being presented with material of an adult nature).
</P>
<P>
   Next let's take a look at a page called Stupid People, Crime and
Current Events at http://www.mindspring.com/(tilde)iam392/. It is
very much as it sounds, a collection of news stories about crimes
committed by stupid people. For instance, you'll learn about the
Nevada robber who let a convenience store clerk make one phone call
during a hold-up, then seemed surprised when police showed up.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if you really don't have a life at all, you may be
interested in a page devoted to people who collect the toys given
away at fast-food restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find the page at
http://www.netcore.ca/(tilde)gkillops/toys.html. If you have a
pantry full of Batman glasses, you'll feel right at home.

Free gifts are lurking in crevices of Windows 98 
By Bill Husted  
c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It probably shouldn't work this way but _ at this time
of the year _ almost everything has a price tag on it. If you are
like me, your credit cards have already worked so hard they're
developing muscles.
</P>
<P>
   That's why we'll spend today looking at my favorite kind of
computer software _ free stuff.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start with some software you already have installed if you
own Windows 98. Now, if you are familiar with Windows at all, you
probably think you know the programs I mean. You're thinking about
the nifty games that come with Windows, or perhaps some of the
utilities such as Scandisk or Defrag. Those are excellent programs,
but I want to introduce you to some strangers that are lurking
around your Start menu or hiding even more skillfully on your
Windows 98 installation disc.
</P>
<P>
   My first candidate is almost certainly already on your hard
disk. It's called Microsoft System Information, and you'll find it
by following this twisting trail. Go to the Start menu, then to
Programs, then to Accessories, then to System Tools and finally to
this program.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have it running, you'll see it provides a window into
the inner workings of your computer. If, for instance, you run into
a conflict that makes it tough to install a new sound card or other
device, you'll find a lot of information here. But, as we used to
say back in the days when I wrote commercials, there's still more.
</P>
<P>
   With the System Information program running, go to the Tools
menu and select Registry Checker. You probably already know that
the Registry is where Windows keeps some of its most basic settings
stored. Problems here can really mess up your computer. When you
start up the Registry Checker, it will also automatically make a
backup copy of these settings.
</P>
<P>
   Now, go back to the Tools menu and select System File Checker.
You'll be given the chance to scan Windows for altered files and
given help automatically restoring an intact version. This tool is
really excellent, and I urge you to use it from time to time. It
also gives you the ability to manually restore files from the
Windows installation disc. If you've ever tried doing that with the
archaic DOS command called Extract, you'll recognize that this
program is worth its weight in RAM chips.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of other useful programs under the Tools menu,
including a Version Conflict Manager and a System Configuration
Utility. Take some time learning about these programs on your own
using the Help menu.
</P>
<P>
   I wish there was time to cover them all, but I want to tell you
about one more free program you already own before I run out of
space.
</P>
<P>
   Editing the Registry is really a complicated mess. And mistakes
can turn your computer into a simpering idiot. There is a program
that can help. However, this program isn't installed on your
computer. You'll need to put your Windows 98 installation disc in
your computer and go to the Tools folder. Continue double-clicking
away into the subdirectories of this folder. Open Reskit and then
open Powertoy. Then find a file named tweakui.inf and click on it
using the right button (make sure to use the right, not the left
button) of your mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Now select Install. Once you have the program called Tweak UI
installed _ and that's what you just did _ you'll get automated
help in editing the Registry file. You'll find ways to change
settings on your computer that can only be edited from within the
Registry.
</P>
<P>
   Even with this tool, Registry editing makes a danged poor hobby.
But at least you'll get familiar-looking Windows screens to make
things easier.
</P>
<P>
   OK. That's my Christmas gift this season _ two free programs
that really can make using Windows 98 easier. If you'd like to
thank me, then do something really radical this holiday season.
Turn the computer off for a few nights and sit next to the
altogether kinder light that comes from your fireplace.

MacPac tunes up PalmPilot's power 
By Charles Haddad  
c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When it comes to hand-held computers, Mac users had
been playing second fiddle to their PC counterparts. No longer.
</P>
<P>
   3Com is finally readying Mac software for its popular PalmPilot
hand-held computer after months of delay. The software had been
promised by last summer. Oh well.
</P>
<P>
   The delay, however, appears to have been worth the wait. Initial
reports in the computer trade press say the Mac version of
PalmPilot software is as good, if not better, than its PC
counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   If true, that's great news for the Mac community. The PalmPilot,
which has sold some 2 million-plus units in the past several years,
is the only hand-held computer that lets you back up and
synchronize your personal information on a Mac.
</P>
<P>
   There are scores of alternatives now for PC users, including the
PalmPilot itself. What makes hand-held computers powerful is the
ability to maintain one calendar and Rolodex across many platforms.
That is, with the right software, you can update and synchronize
the same information on a desktop and a hand-held computer.
</P>
<P>
   For PalmPilot, the Mac version of this synchronizing software is
called MacPac. The first version was a clunky replica of the PC
software. Worse, MacPac didn't even work on a lot of Macs.
</P>
<P>
   PalmPilot hopes to improve on that with MacPac 2.0, which is
based on the old Claris Organizer. 3Com bought the popular personal
information manager from Apple Computer earlier this year and
announced it would remake the software for its PalmPilot.
</P>
<P>
   That proved a more difficult task than initially thought. But
the final results are looking good. Says reviewer Jason Snell in
the January issue of MacWorld, ``This new Palm Desktop is Mac
through and through, right down to the Apple-gray interface.''
</P>
<P>
   MacPac 2.0 is not yet ready for commercial release. But you can
download a beta version of it from several sites, including
MacWorld and PalmPilot.
</P>
<P>
   Be forewarned. Beta software is often unstable and can corrupt
both operating systems and other software.

BORED? TRY UPGRADING THE PRINTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID HOYE   
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - You could upgrade by adding more RAM, a bigger hard
drive or, well, you know the drill.
</P>
<P>
   But here's something you might not have considered: Get yourself
a printer! Already have one? Then get a better one!
</P>
<P>
   Back when I first started using computers, I thought about
printers the same way I once thought about microwave ovens: Yes,
they'd be nice to have, but who really needs one?
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, you can't buy a house or rent an apartment
without finding a microwave in the kitchen. And just as microwaves
have become indispensable, so, too, have printers become a
necessary piece of the personal computing puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   And over the past year or so, printer makers and software
companies have worked hard to push the utility of color inkjet
printers well beyond the stage of spitting out nasty letters to the
landlord.
</P>
<P>
   Want proof? Look no further than some of the latest software
titles available in the stores.
</P>
<P>
   Palladium Interactive, for example, offers four new titles:
``Forever Fun Works!,'' ``Tattoo Time,'' ``Paper Play Studio'' and
``Dino Sticker Time.''
</P>
<P>
   The programs, which range in price from about $19 to $29,
illustrate a new wave of software that takes advantage of today's
printers. The titles allow kids to create their own stickers,
temporary tattoos, stationery, certificates, bookmarks _ the list
is endless.
</P>
<P>
   I tried ``Dino Sticker Time'' and found it well worth the $19.99
price tag. It loads easily, and comes with a supply of blank
Avery-brand stickers. The interface was simple enough for my
4-year-old son to use, and the Jurassic Park-style soundtrack kept
him entertained while he created his very own stickers (which he
then put all over the walls).
</P>
<P>
   Adults can get in on the fun, too. Printer maker Hewlett-Packard
recently offered a list of ways to use their new color inkjet
printers. The list included:
</P>
<P>
   - Gift bags (Create graphic, print it out and glue to outside of
any bag.)
</P>
<P>
   - Gift boxes (Same as above, but glue to outside of any box.)
</P>
<P>
   - Garden tags (Create custom tag for flowers, veggies or herbs,
print out and glue to Popsicle stick.)
</P>
<P>
   - Family recipe book (Create recipe-card size entries, complete
with images and instructions, then have local print shop bind it or
get a photo album and insert recipes where you would otherwise put
photos.)
</P>
<P>
   - Custom greeting cards
</P>
<P>
   - Personalized placemats for holiday dinners or other special
occasions.
</P>
<P>
   - Custom calendars
</P>
<P>
   - Custom T-shirts or aprons (Create image and print on T-shirt
transfers available in office-supply or computer stores.)
</P>
<P>
   - Holiday ornaments (Create and print image, then fold and glue
into desired shape.)
</P>
<P>
   The list goes on and on.
</P>
<P>
   Need more ideas and specific instructions? Check out ``The Color
Printer Idea Book'' by Kay Hall, published recently by No Starch
Press. The $19.95 book offers complete instructions and
illustrations covering some 40 projects all made possible with an
inkjet printer.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does the book help you through the projects, but it
also offers tips that will help you through anything else you do
with your printer. For example, it teaches you how to avoid the
``computer-generated'' look when you create things, how to get the
best images from your printer, how to use special effects and lots
more.
</P>
<P>
   Want more? Today's software titles also include some fairly
fancy stuff _ programs with powerful capabilities that once were
available only to professionals or those interested in shelling out
$300 to $600 for a single title, such as Adobe's PhotoShop.
</P>
<P>
   Kai's ``Photo Soap,'' Microsoft's ``Picture It'' and other
similar titles give the user the ability to import images (either
from a scanner or directly from a digital camera), clean them up
(such as removing that annoying ``red eye''), crop them, add
backgrounds, special effects or text, and then print them out.
</P>
<P>
   Other programs, such as Broderbund's ``Print Shop 5.0'' or
Palladium's ``Ultimate Scrapbook Creator,'' provide the user with
power to create and print a wide variety of products, ranging from
professional-quality newsletters to customized photo pages you can
insert into photo albums or have bound together.
</P>
<P>
   We've come a long way since the days of the dot matrix printers.
Inkjets have opened doors for home and small-office computer users,
doors that were once too expensive to open or just didn't exist
just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   All fired up to go get a new printer? Great! But do a little bit
of research first. Computer magazines are full of printer
information and reviews. Got Web access? Then visit Yahoo! at
www.yahoo.com and search for printer information. Or, check out
``Family PC'' magazine's printer page at
205.181.113.18/familypc/content/970516/fth w/index.html.
</P>
<P>
   In general, you will get the best results from name-brand
printers, such as Epson, Hewlett-Packard or Lexmark.
</P>
<P>
   As with computers, you will get what you pay for. Some inkjets
are available for about $100. But the nice color units, usually
called ``photo-quality'' printers, will cost $300 to $400.
</P>
<P>
   If you can swing the cost of a photo-quality color inkjet
printer, and if you follow the instructions to get top-quality
prints, you will be amazed by the results. I've actually framed
some prints and have them displayed at home!
</P>
<P>
   When looking for a printer, pay attention to things like ``PPM''
and ``resolution.'' PPM, or pages per minute, tells you how fast _
or slow _ the printer will work. Resolution tells you how fine a
print you will get _ the higher the resolution numbers, the more
photolike your prints will appear.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget the other costs involved with printers _ ink
and paper.
</P>
<P>
   The photo-quality printers produce great prints, but they tend
to really suck up the ink. And color ink cartridges can run as much
as $25 or $30 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Another tricky aspect of printers is paper. There's a lot of
generic printer paper out there that will work well if you just
print black-and-white letters. But to get the best-quality color
production, your printer might require a special paper, usually
something made by the printer maker.
</P>
<P>
   My Epson Stylus Photo printer has this requirement. I've tried
alternative glossy papers, but none work as well as the
photo-quality paper produced by Epson. Don't ask me how they do it!
But buyer beware!
</P>
<P>
   So, if you're looking to get more use out of your computer or if
you just want to have some fun, go get a new printer! &QL;

   You've checked your Christmas list not twice but at least half a
dozen times. You think you've covered all the people you want to
buy presents for and also the ones you have to buy presents for.
</P>
<P>
   But is it possible that you've overlooked the most deserving
friend of all? The individual whose steadfast love and support has
never wavered _ not once _ no matter what? Even if he did drool
over your cashmere jacket or chew the claw feet off an heirloom
table, Christmas is a good time to return some of that
unconditional love your pooch shows you all year.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, you could go to a canine Toys ``R'' Us and bring home
something plastic. But what about whipping up some doggie treats in
the kitchen to show you really care? It's fun and easier than you
think.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet offers at least one excellent site with an
abundance of recipes and information about homemade doggie treats.
At http://pages.prodigy.com
</P>
<P>
   /pomathon/pomtreat.htm, you'll find a host of surprisingly easy
and tasty-sounding recipes for treats using bacon, beef, cheese,
chicken, garlic, liver, nuts, vegetables and whole grains. There
also are recipes for party mix, and if you've ever wondered what
those treats are that trainers use to get dogs to do whatever they
want, there's a recipe there for dog handler show bait, too.
</P>
<P>
   Another site to check out ``when store-bought just isn't good
enough'' is
http://ionet.net/(tilde)rkcathey/goldenbone/dogbisc.htm, which
contains a rather festive recipe for peanut butter dog biscuits.

 &HT;    Savannah reader sings praises of Hummingbird Cake
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Michael Rocchins of Savannah(Ga.) requested a
Hummingbird Cake recipe, we didn't have to go any further than the
archives to find it. A perennial favorite, it was last published
here in the summer of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Rocchins said he had tried to find the recipe for two years,
since his mother passed away. She made the cake at Christmastime,
he said, and now he intends to make it, too.
</P>
<P>
   This spice cake with pineapple has nuts baked into it and is
topped with a cream cheese frosting. Pecan halves in a circle on
top make a pretty finishing touch.

GETTING PERSONAL WITH THE COMPUTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PATTI HARTIGAN   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (itals)``I honestly think you ought to calm down; take a stress
pill and think things over.''(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   That is, as cult-film enthusiasts know, one of the most
memorable lines uttered by HAL 9000, the computer that goes berserk
in Stanley Kubrick's 1968 head-trip classic, ``2001: A Space
Odyssey.'' ``Calm down,'' HAL says in that distinctive disembodied
voice, a sort of mellow whine with a malevolent bite. ``Take a
stress pill,'' the dysfunctional computer advises, shortly before
suffering a system breakdown and threatening the mere humans who
brought him into operation one fine day in January 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Poor HAL and his compatriot computers, forever typecast as the
evil menace wreaking danger and destruction. In films ranging from
``Desk Set'' in 1957 to ``The Net'' in 1995, computers have been
characterized on the big screen as dark, sometimes apocalyptic
forces that instill paranoia and fear. Created and operated by
stereotypical programmers portrayed as emotionless bureaucrats,
misfits, or nerds, these huge machines are going to make us lose
our jobs, lose our wars, lose our freedom, lose our very
identities. The message has been clear: Pull the plug.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, that is. The computer has a new screen image _
perky, trim, and so user-friendly you can snuggle up with it in
bed. In ``You've Got Mail,'' the romantic comedy starring Tom Hanks
and Meg Ryan that opens Friday, the laptop computer is more than
just a benign communication tool. It comforts lonely hearts; it
brings unlikely lovers together; it makes folks who live small but
meaningful lives feel significant in the cosmos. It's the yenta of
the 21st century, an unparalleled matchmaker, a silicon chip with a
heart of gold. And the people who use it aren't calculating
scientists or adolescent hackers: They're America's sweethearts,
ordinary sorts harboring that &QC; timeless dream that their soul mate
is out there, maybe just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   The blinking red eye of HAL has segued to the teary hazel eyes
of the adorable Meg Ryan, typing away on the keyboard and praying
for Mr. Right.
</P>
<P>
   And that's a good thing. ``Over the years, the computer has
played the heavy and the villain, but increasingly, we're going to
see the computer as less and less the evil bad guy,'' says
Christopher Morgan, a computer consultant and author of ``The
Official Computer Bowl Trivia Book.'' ``Over the last two decades,
people's impression of computers has changed, and certainly the
personal computer had a role in that. The mystique went away. The
idea that the computer was going to harm us has melted. Now, people
don't think twice about their computers doing good or evil. They're
just an integral part of life, like a car. I can't imagine a movie
about an evil car.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that long ago, it would have been hard to imagine a
children's movie about a friendly computer (HAL the debugged Love
Bug?), but that scenario doesn't seem too far-fetched today.
</P>
<P>
   As the technology has evolved and infiltrated everyday life, so
has the computer's screen image. In fact, the doomsday films of the
last few decades _ and even a few years ago _ seem hilarious today,
even to those without an engineer's sense of humor. It's hard not
to snicker when world leaders with grim faces and trim haircuts are
called in to oversee computer-generated crises in such films as
``Colossus: The Forbin Project'' (1970) and ``WarGames'' (1983).
After all, today President Clinton wants a computer in every
classroom and greets browsers cheerfully on the White House Web
site. HAL, we hardly knew ye.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've Got Mail,'' then, brings the computer image full circle
in more ways than one. Back in 1957, an ``electronic brain'' called
EMMY terrified office workers in ``Desk Set,'' a screwball comedy
starring Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. The computer itself _
a laughably inauthentic wall of steel and flashing lights, complete
with a Teletype machine _ was a thin plot device to get the
Hepburn-Tracy chemistry thing going. She runs a research office at
a television network, and he has been hired to improve office
efficiency. The researchers are convinced the computer is going to
make their jobs obsolete; they do all end up with pink slips, but
only as a result of a computer error made by the payroll
department. The important thing is that the stars get to battle
wits and acknowledge their attraction by the time the credits roll.
Boy gets girl, despite the computer.
</P>
<P>
   That will-they-ever-get-together theme is central to ``Mail,''
though the computer is now the conduit for love rather than the
obstacle. (Coincidentally, Henry and Phoebe Ephron wrote ``Desk
Set''; four decades later, their daughters, Nora and Delia Ephron,
penned the script for ``Mail,'' which Nora Ephron directed; see
accompanying story.) The male romantic lead has evolved, however.
In his usual frumpy fashion, Tracy played an eccentric MIT
graduate, a kind of antisocial character whose socks don't match
and who seems to idle away the time solving differential equations.
By contrast, Tom Hanks in ``Mail'' is, well, Tom Hanks, the
fresh-scrubbed hero who guided Apollo 13 back to earth safely.
</P>
<P>
   In its lighthearted, gentle way, ``Desk Set'' started the
tradition of the computer geek on-screen. The Space Age engineers
in ``2001'' are inscrutable, even when interrogated by HAL. (``What
are you doing, Dave?'') In ``Colossus,'' electronics wizard Charles
Forbin describes himself as ``an impartial, emotionless machine, a
paragon of reason.'' The college students in a 1970 Disney comedy
called ``The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes'' are lovable losers; in
the hit ``WarGames,'' an astonishingly young Matthew Broderick fits
all the criteria of the stereotypical hacker _ a brainy
underachiever who is estranged from his parents and has difficulty
communicating with his peers. Two programmers in ``WarGames'' are
quintessential geeks: One is a nasal-voiced nerd in a plaid shirt,
and the other is a volatile nutcase wearing a smily-face T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   The stereotype gets even more absurd in ``The Net,'' which casts
Sandra Bullock against type as a lonely software engineer who has
no friends, rarely leaves the house, and hasn't taken a vacation in
years. When evil computer mavericks steal her identity, she has
nowhere to turn. The film, which came out just around the time the
World Wide Web was emerging as the great new frontier for
nontechnical types, paints in the kind of paranoid shades that
colored movies during the Cold War. In this case, however, the
enemy isn't the abstract notion of communism: It's simply the
computer. In ``The Net,'' the computer isn't going to blow up the
world with one quick blast; it's going to do it slowly, eliminating
us one by one, erasing our identities as well as our humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock is up against evil manipulators who use the technology
maliciously; the people, not the machines themselves, are the
psychopaths who pull the trigger. But in films made during the Cold
War, computers are sentient things with the ability to learn and to
act on their own. In ``2001'' and ``WarGames,'' they can also play
a good game of chess, which shows what most people thought
computers could do in previous decades _ that is, play games and
destroy the universe.
</P>
<P>
   That fear stemmed from the belief that computers really were
electronic brains with the ability to think. For all its spacy
choreography, ``2001'' offers an astute psychological study of HAL,
who becomes maniacal only after his feelings get hurt. When he's
disconnected, he reverts to childhood in that creepy, classic
``death scene,'' singing ``Daisy'' as he remembers his youth.
Likewise, the computer in ``Colossus'' begins to act on its own and
establishes contact with its counterpart in the former Soviet
Union. The two machines communicate via neon messages scrolling
across a marquee; the machine orders military-style executions,
takes over the global defense system, and threatens to launch World
War III. Not bad for a big box with flashing lights. The looming
threat is that man will become a slave to the machine: ``Obey me
and live, or disobey me and die,'' the computer commands eerily.
</P>
<P>
   The apocalypse is also the underlying threat in ``WarGames,''
which starts out as a sort of ``Ferris Bueller's Day at the Video
Arcade'' and turns into a military thriller. After Broderick's
character inadvertently finds a ``back door'' into the Defense
Department's computer system, the machine starts acting on its own,
simulating an international conflict that could end in nuclear
destruction. Broderick's computer geek joins forces with a mad
scientist played by John Wood, whose darting eyes and nervous tics
make him seem a human version of HAL 9000.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but yesterday's madmen and misfits are today's millionaires.
In ``You've Got Mail,'' Tom Hanks is a perfectly sane, perfectly
handsome fellow who uses his personal computer to reach out and
e-mail his on-line buddy. Oh, he also happens to be a filthy-rich
scion of a bookselling empire, but in the film, that's just a
little plot device to get the two cyberpals together. Hanks's
character, Joe Fox, is opening a superstore around the corner from
Ryan's children's bookstore, appropriately called the Shop Around
the Corner (a nod to the title of the 1940 Ernst Lubitsch comedy
that ``You've Got Mail'' remakes). The two feud like competitors:
He represents big business swallowing up the mom-and-pop shops, and
she is a link to a simpler past, where human contact mattered. In
the meantime, Ryan and Hanks are doing a little flirting dance in
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The computer here is just a part of everyday life, as routine
as, say, a toaster oven. The machine isn't evil; the people who use
it are regular folks. The film, a sort of cyberversion of
``Sleepless in Seattle,'' even has in-jokes about the computer
industry: A batty character played by Jean Stapleton announces that
she is rich, explaining, ``I bought Intel at $6.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, this isn't the first movie that presents computers as
benign: The machines in such film and television series as ``Star
Trek,'' ``Star Wars,'' ``Lost in Space,'' and ``The Jetsons''
certainly did more good than harm. But in ``Mail,'' the computer
actually brings people together, a fact that isn't lost on folks
who have been preaching about the potential of technology for
decades. ``I'm so pleased to see this type of movie come out,''
says computer consultant Morgan. ``I've been proselytizing about
computers for years, and now they've hit critical mass. They're a
very important part of society, and they're going to revolutionize
the way we live over the next 100 or 200 years. It's about time
movies started to reflect that.''
</P>
<P>
   And yes, ``You've Got Mail'' does just that. In the film, both
Hanks and Ryan are avid customers of America Online, the Internet
service provider and communication service that has 14 million
members. Whatever their differences in the flesh world _ he's the
corporate monolith swallowing up the competition, she is the
competition _ the romantic leads open windows to each other's souls
in the cyberworld. The computer is no longer the heavy; it's a
humanizing tool that enables two strangers who might unknowingly
pass each other at Starbucks to actually sit down over a tall decaf
latte.
</P>
<P>
   Without giving away the ending, let's just say computers are no
longer the evil menace. In fact, the movie asks: How were we ever
human without them?

 &HT;    Four metro area chefs offer culinary delights that capture the
special mood of the holidays
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The cards are in the mail, the garland is on the
mantel, the ornaments are dangling from the tree and the presents
are disguised in red and green wrap.
</P>
<P>
   You've thought of everything for a festive holiday _ except the
feast. You want to dazzle, but after all the other preparations,
you're feeling a little frazzled.
</P>
<P>
   Focus.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Thanksgiving, when an entire menu is set in stone, down
to the cranberries ground in grandmother's antique food mill, you
have more flexibility with the Christmas spread. So why not choose
one dish to pour your culinary heart into, and simply assemble the
rest.
</P>
<P>
   For the crowd coming Christmas Eve, follow the Italian tradition
and serve up some succulent seafood pasta offered by Lenny Trovato,
chef of Trovato's in Roswell, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christmas Eve is the biggest night for Italians,'' said
Trovato, who grew up in Brooklyn in a brownstone that was home to a
large family. ``There would be about 40 of us crammed onto four
floors, the steps outside, wherever we could find a seat. We would
start at 4 in the afternoon and eat until it was time to go to
midnight Mass.''
</P>
<P>
   On Christmas morn, give in to indulgence with a fancy French
toast crowned with seasonal toppings made ahead of time. Harvest
chef Justin Ward shared recipes for kumquat marmalade and cranberry
syrup, as served at his Atlanta restaurant throughout the holiday
season.

   Atlanta cookbook author Ray Overton swears by beef tenderloin
with an assortment of condiments, whether for a party buffet or a
sit-down meal. And Edible Art chef Deborah Berry says no Southern
dessert table is complete without a red velvet cake.
</P>
<P>
   Choose one of these stars for the spotlight and pick up a few
prepared or easy-to-assemble dishes _ fruit salad, oven-roasted
potatoes, poundcake _ to fill out the stage. You're sure to impress
without all the stress.
</P>
<P>
   Seafood Mariciare
</P>
<P>
   Lenny Trovato of Trovato's in Roswell offers this seafood
extravaganza as a Christmas Eve crowd pleaser. For appetizers, try
crab meat seasoned with salt, pepper and lemon on crackers, a clam
dip or shrimp _ peel-and-eat, fried or scampi. To complete the
meal, add a simple green salad and fresh bakery bread. Pick up some
cookies or a cheesecake to finish. Pair the entree with pinot
grigio.
</P>
<P>
   Red Velvet Double Chocolate Mousse Torte
</P>
<P>
   Red Velvet Cake is a Christmas tradition in the South. Edible
Art's Deborah Berry and her pastry chef, Rossi Kemp, have taken it
to a new level. Instead of cream cheese filling and frosting, you
have mousse and ganache. Pair with a pie, poundcake or some cookies
from a local bakery, set out nuts and fresh fruits and you'll have
a smashing dessert spread. Serve with hot coffee and liqueurs.
</P>
<P>
   Holiday Toast
</P>
<P>
   Justin Ward at Harvest restaurant in Virginia-Highland offers
this seasonal ``Holiday Toast'' with kumquat marmalade and
cranberry syrup as a sweet starter to the big day. Serve with your
favorite sidekick _ bacon, sausage, ham _ and a fruit salad. Smoked
salmon, capers and cream cheese with bagels can be added for a big
crowd. Serve with coffee, juice, Bloody Marys and mimosas.
</P>
<P>
   Holiday Tenderloin of Beef With Three Condiments
</P>
<P>
   Cookbook author Ray Overton says there are few things easier or
more impressive than beef tenderloin. For a meal, slice thickly;
for a crowd, go thin. He offers a spinach and roasted red pepper
dip, a honey mustard and a lemon and black olive gremolata as
condiments. Round out the meal with oven-roasted potatoes, glazed
carrots and rolls and serve a merlot.

DR. BOMBAY'S WISH LIST FOR THE ULTIMATE HIGH-TECH HOLIDAY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY  
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You don't have to say a word. I can tell you're worrying
yourself to death, wondering what to get me for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose you could take the easy way out and send me the
customary $10,000 Hammacher Schlemmer gift certificate, but I know
you want to put more consideration into it than that. Why don't you
just pick out a few things from the following list? And please
don't feel obligated to get me everything. It's the thought that
counts.
</P>
<P>
   Don't listen to all the killjoys who say you should wait a year
or so before buying me an HDTV. Digital televisions with remarkably
clear pictures and booming stereo sound are here now, and I want
one. Sure, there may be next to nothing to watch on it, but what if
I miss something good?
</P>
<P>
   Buy it in stages. Start with the Panasonic TU-DST50 (about
$1,500), a set-top HDTV decoder that works with normal TVs. Slap
that on the old Philco (as long as it has video inputs), and the
box turns the digital broadcast into a regular TV signal with the
same quality as a DVD player's picture. That's handy, because I'm
not ready to toss my old-fashioned big-screen yet.
</P>
<P>
   The TU-DST50 will decode any of 18 kinds of digital signals a
broadcaster is likely to use, so don't worry about whether it will
work in my area. It also has an optical audio output so I can plug
it into the Digital Dolby stereo receiver you got me last year. I
know my neighbors will love hearing the ``Suddenly Susan'' theme
song at 120 decibels as much as they did ``Twister'' on DVD.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing this magic box doesn't have is a catchy
name. How about ``Bombay Box''? Just a thought. ...
</P>
<P>
   When you get your income-tax refund, you can spend it on the
second HDTV component, the digital-compatible TV. How about the
Bombay Box's stablemate, the Panasonic PT-56WXF90 (about $6,000)?
It's a 56-inch wide-screen projection TV with excellent resolution.
Plug the box into this set _ where there's no digital-analog
conversion to degrade the signal _ and I'll be watching ``Sabrina,
the Teenage Witch'' in wide screen in no time at all. Well, when
they get around to broadcasting it that way, that is.
</P>
<P>
   I guess if you had $15,000 to spare, you could get me the
Philips FlatTV to use as a monitor instead. That's the 42-inch TV
you hang on the wall like a picture. The box will plug into it,
too, and it's got a killer picture. In fact, the only thing wrong
with it is that it's not that easy to set empty beer cans or
pictures of Mama Bombay on top of it.
</P>
<P>
   One of the great things about Walkman-style headphones was that
I could pretend not to hear anyone I didn't want to talk to.
Unfortunately, those people could always stand right in front of me
until I was forced to notice them. Sony finally solves that problem
with the Glasstron Audio/Video Headset (900 bucks).
</P>
<P>
   OK, so I'll look like Geordi LaForge, but plug a video source
into these goggles, and it's supposed to be like watching a 52-inch
television from 6 feet away. To keep me from bumping into the wall,
there's an adjustment that will let a little of the outside world
in, but don't tell anybody. I don't want them to know I can see
them waving.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing spoils my television-watching experience like lukewarm
nacho cheese, so I'll always remember you fondly if you give me
GE's Mike (90 bucks), a tiny 500-watt microwave that would look
right at home on the end table next to my TV chair.
</P>
<P>
   There's only .3 cubic feet of oven space, but that's fine for
nuking a piece of pizza or a cup of coffee. You really should think
about getting me a second one for the office so I don't have to eat
this pastrami sandwich cold.
</P>
<P>
   I can't tell you how many times I've been sitting in a bus
station after midnight with the sudden urge to watch my ``Starship
Troopers'' DVD again.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Panasonic's DVD PalmTheater (about $1,400) comes to the
rescue. It's a portable DVD player with a built-in 5.8-inch
wide-screen monitor. The whole thing is about 6 1/2 inches square,
not too much bigger than a Discman. It'll do about everything the
big DVD players will, but it does it on batteries. Just keep an
extra set handy for the director's cut of ``JFK.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that I don't trust people. Really. I'd just feel a lot
better if I knew for sure they weren't blowing smoke. That's why I
want you to get me a Truth.Quest lie-detector phone from Sharper
Image (129 bucks).
</P>
<P>
   When somebody is lying, psychological stress supposedly causes
subtle changes in voice modulation. The Truth.Quest hears that and,
depending on the size of the whopper, lights up green, yellow or
red.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't want to buy the dorky-looking phone, you can get a
stand-alone Truth.Quest for 79 bucks that works with any telephone.
Can you imagine if these were standard government-office issue? Ken
Starr could have wrapped up that whole sordid mess in two weeks.

 &HT;    Recipes for holiday dazzlers
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's time to indulge. And what better way, after
hitting the malls and decking the halls, than with delectables.
Here are four to choose from, each sure to convince guests you are
a culinary genius. We asked four area chefs to offer recipes that
would capture the special mood of the holidays. Doing one thing
really well will tell your family and friends they are special and
will spare you the maddening multi-tasking. Have guests bring
dishes to fill out the rest of the table, or go with prepared
foods. With a succulent tenderloin, sensational seafood, a seasonal
french toast or sweeter-than-sin red velvet cake, celebration is
all but guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   MAIN DISH
</P>
<P>
   Holiday Tenderloin of Beef With Three Condiments
</P>
<P>
   Makes 10 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 30 minutes Marinating time: 6 hours-overnight
Cooking time: 30-35 minutes Standing time: 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cookbook author Ray Overton says folks needn't be intimidated by
beef tenderloin. It's ideal for a party buffet or as a centerpiece
for a sit-down meal. And it's very easy to prepare, especially if
you purchase one already trimmed of fat. (Try ordering one from a
butcher.) If you really want to get a head start, put the meat and
a marinade in a zip-top bag several days in advance and keep in the
freezer until the night before you plan to serve it. Then move to
the refrigerator until you are ready to cook. You also can make
these condiments up to a week ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
   Tenderloin:
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped fresh ginger
</P>
<P>
   4 garlic cloves, crushed with 1 tablespoon kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon coarse-grained Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup dry sherry
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 (5- to 6-pound) beef tenderloin, trimmed of all visible fat
</P>
<P>
   Kale, fresh herbs, baby vegetables, cherry tomatoes and/or
mushrooms for garnish
</P>
<P>
   In a small bowl whisk together the rosemary, ginger, garlic
crushed with salt, black pepper, Dijon mustard, lemon juice, sherry
and olive oil. Place the tenderloin in a heavy-duty zip-top bag.
Pour the marinade over the meat. Seal the bag and place in the
refrigerator, turning occasionally, for 6 hours or overnight.
</P>
<P>
   When ready to cook, preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Remove the
tenderloin from the marinade and place on a foil-lined baking sheet
with sides, such a jellyroll pan or roasting pan. Tuck the tail or
thinner end of the tenderloin under the rest of the meat so that it
will cook more evenly. Place the meat in the preheated oven and
roast for 20 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees and cook the meat
for 10-15 minutes more or until a meat thermometer inserted into
the thickest part of the tenderloin registers 120 degrees for rare.
</P>
<P>
   Remove from the oven and let the meat sit for 20 minutes before
slicing. Slice the meat thinly and place on a serving platter lined
with the kale and garnishes.
</P>
<P>
   Serve with the condiments on the side.

   Red Velvet Double Chocolate Mousse Torte

   Edible Art chef Deborah Berry loves red velvet cake, something
her pastry chef, being a Northerner, doesn't quite understand.
``Why do you want to eat cake with all that red food coloring?''
muses Rossi Kemp. But he collaborated with Berry and agrees the
stunning version they came up with is delicious. The torte shown on
Page H1 features two layers of cake with one thick layer of mousse.
This recipe calls for the more traditional three layers, with
thinner layers of mousse, but you can build it any way you want.
And you may be used to working with softer frostings or whipped
cream when it comes to piping. The mousse will be stiff, so a
professional tip will work best. Of course, piping is optional. If
you have some of the mousse left over, simply spoon it into a cup
with some fresh berries. As tempting as it may be to set this out
all evening, it's best to keep it chilled until 15 to 20 minutes
before serving.
</P>
<P>
   Red Velvet Cake:
</P>
<P>
   1 cup shortening
</P>
<P>
   3 cups granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   4 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces red liquid food coloring
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   5 cups sifted cake flour
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa powder
</P>
<P>
   2 cups buttermilk
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons white vinegar
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons baking soda
</P>
<P>
   Citrus White Chocolate Mousse:
</P>
<P>
   12 ounces good-quality white chocolate
</P>
<P>
   1 1 1/4-ounce package unflavored gelatin
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup orange juice concentrate
</P>
<P>
   3 cups heavy whipping cream
</P>
<P>
   Dark Chocolate Ganache:
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup whipping cream
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces semisweet chocolate
</P>
<P>
   1 or 2 tablespoons citrus-flavored brandy, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   Dark chocolate shavings or curls (optional for garnish)
</P>
<P>
   For the cake: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour
three 9-inch round cake pans and set aside. Beat shortening at
medium speed of electric mixer until fluffy; gradually add sugar,
beating well. Add eggs, one at a time, beating until blended after
each addition. Stir in food coloring and vanilla, blending well. In
a medium mixing bowl, combine flour, salt and cocoa; set aside. In
a large mixing bowl or 8-cup liquid measuring cup, combine
buttermilk, vinegar and soda. (Mixture will bubble.)
</P>
<P>
   Add flour mixture to shortening mixture alternately with
buttermilk mixture, beginning and ending with flour mixture. Beat
at low speed after each addition. Beat at low speed for 2 minutes
after last addition. Pour batter into prepared pans. Place in oven
and bake for about 30 minutes. Do not overbake. Cool in pans on
wire racks about 10 minutes. Remove from pans, and cool completely.
</P>
<P>
   For the Citrus White Chocolate Mousse: In a heavy medium
saucepan, melt white chocolate over very low heat, being careful
not to burn. Place the white chocolate in a large mixing bowl and
set aside. In a small bowl, combine the gelatin and orange juice
concentrate and set aside. In the large bowl of an electric mixer,
whip heavy cream at medium speed until it forms medium peaks. Place
the small bowl of gelatin and orange juice over a saucepan of
barely simmering water to dissolve gelatin. Fold the whipped cream
and gelatin mixture alternately into the white chocolate, beginning
and ending with the whipped cream. Work quickly, being careful not
to break the whipped cream. Let the mousse chill at least 2 hours
before using.
</P>
<P>
   For the Dark Chocolate Ganache: Heat whipping cream in small
saucepan over low heat, being careful not to scorch. Add chocolate
and stir until completely melted; add brandy. Remove from heat and
set aside until ready to use. As it cools, the ganache will thicken
slightly to a glaze consistency.
</P>
<P>
   To assemble torte: Reserve some white chocolate mousse for
decoration. Spread most of the white chocolate mousse between
layers of cake. Put cake on serving platter. Pour ganache over cake
and let chocolate run down the sides. Let sit for about 5 minutes.
Spoon the reserved white chocolate mousse into a piping bag with
large star tip. Pipe rosettes on top of torte and garnish with dark
chocolate curls or shavings. Serve immediately or keep chilled
until about 15 to 20 minutes before serving.

   Yep. That's right. This recipe calls for two sticks of butter
and four cups of cream. Come on. It's Christmas. You can cut the
butter in half if you like, or at least trade some of it for more
olive oil. You also have leeway with the seafood you include. Don't
like squid? Leave it out. Don't want to cook the lobster? Get it
already steamed (many of the larger grocery stores will do that for
you) or omit it. Add a green salad and some crusty bread for
dipping into the sauce, and you'll have one memorable meal, thanks
to Lenny Trovato of Trovato's in Roswell. The Italian-American from
Brooklyn carries on his family's tradition of a Christmas Eve
seafood feast at his home here in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound (2 sticks) butter
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 large onions, diced
</P>
<P>
   6 cloves garlic, chopped
</P>
<P>
   4 1 1/4-pounds fresh lobsters, cooked, meat removed and shells
discarded

</P>
<P>
   24 littleneck clams
</P>
<P>
   24 mussels
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound cleaned squid, sliced crosswise into 1-inch pieces
</P>
<P>
   2 cups dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   4 cups marinara (see below; or your favorite tomato sauce)
</P>
<P>
   4 cups heavy whipping cream
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chopped basil
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chopped parsley
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds fettuccine, cooked
</P>
<P>
   Lemon slices and parsley sprigs for garnish
</P>
<P>
   In a very large Dutch oven, add butter and oil over medium-high
heat. When butter has melted, add onions and garlic and cook,
stirring frequently, until just beginning to brown. Add lobster,
shrimp, scallops, clams, mussels and squid and cook for 2-3
minutes. Add white wine and simmer for 2 minutes. Add tomato sauce,
cream, basil and parsley. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to
medium and simmer until shellfish opens, stirring occasionally.
Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve over pasta. Garnish
with sliced lemon and parsley sprigs.

   The beauty of this dish is that the festive, seasonal sauces can
be made a few days ahead of time. It's a great way to use kumquats,
which you've probably seen in the produce section but might not
have known how to use. They look like miniature, oblong oranges.
And Justin Ward of Harvest restaurant in Virginia-Highland adds a
special touch by cutting the bread in perfect circles with a
biscuit cutter. You can take it a step further and use cookie
cutters in Christmas shapes.

   1 large loaf fresh bakery bread, such as a Tuscan loaf or
country white

<P>
   1 tablespoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   Using a 2-inch biscuit cutter or a cookie cutter, cut out 12
pieces of bread (no crust) and set aside. In a large mixing bowl,
combine the milk, eggs, nutmeg, allspice, vanilla and sugar. Heat
butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Quickly dunk a bread
piece in the batter, then place in skillet. Cook for about 3
minutes, then flip and cook for another 3 minutes. (You should be
able to cook about 3 pieces of bread at a time.) Cook until firm
and batter no longer oozes from the bread when pressed with
spatula. Serve with Kumquat Marmalade and Cranberry Syrup.

 &HT;    Noteworthy ale stands elegantly above the rest
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At the two Sherlock's Beer &AMP; Wine Warehouses in
Marietta, Ga., you could have chosen from 300 or more bottled beers
this year. At any one time, upwards of 50 were in stock. ``And
that's not counting the suitcase beers,'' says Harry Gregory, beer
manager at the Marietta store.
</P>
<P>
   He means the 12-packs, usually Budweiser but also Miller and
Coors, that young males swing into their pickups like luggage.
</P>
<P>
   A similar plenitude could be found at Jax in Sandy Springs, Ga.,
Tower in Atlanta, Green's in Atlanta and elsewhere. But if beer's
beer, why so many?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that 300, although large for any one store,
doesn't begin to encompass the variety of beer in the world. Not
all are particularly good; some are pretty dreadful. But if some
are mediocre, others are excellent and a few are superlative.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Journal-Constitution's first Beer of the Year award
recognizes one superlative beer among many. The criteria were
happily subjective: Which was the most noteworthy addition to the
local scene? Of which could it be said, ``None other compares?''
</P>
<P>
   Arguments could be made for several. Sierra Nevada's Summerfest
Lager was an example of a pioneer in West Coast ales showing the
industry giants how well an American lager can be made. From Canada
came the silky-smooth McAuslan oatmeal stout. A masterstroke from
one of North America's best female brewers, Ellen Brousnal, it
takes its place among the world's premier stouts.
</P>
<P>
   But one stood clearly apart _ Tuppers' Hop Pocket Ale. More
aromatic and assertive than even Anchor Liberty Ale, Tuppers' Hop
Pocket achieves an elegance rare in an ale. A friend put it best as
we sat over an audacious pale ale at an Atlanta brewpub. ``The
difference between these beers and Tuppers','' she said, ``is that
with these, the hops hit you first and that's it. With Tuppers',
there's so much more complexity. And you realize it at the
finish.''
</P>
<P>
   Poured properly into the glass, it will rise to an immense,
rocky crown, the Cascade and Mount Hood hops giving off an aroma at
once citrusy and spicy (it's dry-hopped during a secondary
fermentation of up to three weeks). The foretaste is firm and
malty, the middle assertive, the finish dry and long.
</P>
<P>
   As remarkable as the beer is, the story of its creation is even
more so. Bob and Ellie Tupper have spent the nearly 30 years of
their marriage compiling notes on the great beers of the world.
They are not professional brewers (he teaches history at a prep
school in Maryland, and she is an editor for the American Society
for Microbiology), but they have carefully cataloged some 7,000
beers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there was one they had not encountered _ an ale that was
assertive in the Pacific Northwest style but with some of the
roundness of a great lager. They conceived it in their imagination
and then talked their friend Jerry Bailey, founder of Old Dominion
in Ashburn, Va., into brewing it. For Tupper, the Mount Hood hops
are a key, imparting herbal notes in addition to the familiar
citrusy character of Cascades. But so, too, is the secondary
fermentation of three weeks _ unusually long for an ale.
</P>
<P>
   Hop Pocket quickly acquired a following in Northern Virginia and
the District of Columbia since its introduction in 1994, and last
year it won the gold medal for pale ales at the Great American Beer
Festival in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   If any beer could have denied Hop Pocket recognition in Atlanta
this year, it would have been its own sibling. Tuppers' Hop Pocket
Pils is brewed to a different style altogether, but is no less
distinctive. It might, in fact, be more so. With the renaissance of
American brewing 20 years ago, well-crafted pale ales are not
uncommon. A distinctive pilsener is another matter, hard to brew
and harder to find. In the United States, there might not be more
than half a dozen that compare with the best in Germany or the
Czech Republic. This is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to brew a North Bavarian pilsener, and I think we
went through it eight times before we got it right,'' Tupper says.
Ironically, the domestically grown Mount Hood hops, used in
conjunction with Saaz hops, again made a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's either a German immigrant or it's a German pils with an
American accent,'' Tupper says. ``When we went back to Germany this
summer, we carried a six-pack of the Pils with us, and were
surprised. It was a bigger beer than all but a few of the German
pilseners.''
</P>
<P>
   At 40 International Bitterness Units, the Pils has a presence
you'll find in few pilseners. But for folks not accustomed to
hoppiness in the range of 60 International Bitterness Units, it's
more accessible than Hop Pocket Ale.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, the quaffer is not the only beneficiary. Half
the proceeds from the sales of Tuppers' Hop Pocket _ ale or pils _
goes to programs to help the needy. A few months ago, Tupper called
the Journal-Constitution to ask a question: Could someone suggest
local charities to which he and his wife might contribute?
</P>
<P>
   Public-spiritedness does not a great beer make. But it's one
more reason why, among 300 beers on the market, Hop Pocket stands
apart.

 &HT;    Perky `Madeline' takes slight series and turns it into
full-length fun
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Madeline'' (PG)
</P>
<P>
   Madeline (Hatty Jones) fools a band of kidnappers. She has an
appendectomy. She falls into the Seine. She's very brave. This
blithe film version of the beloved kids' books unreels like a
colorful object lesson in the art of being perky. And there's
nothing wrong with that. Richly appointed for such a slight series
of anecdotes, the movie co-stars Oscar-winner Frances McDormand as
Miss Clavel, the nun who oversees orphaned Madeline and 11 other
little girls, and Oscar-nominee Nigel Hawthorne as a stern landlord
who intends to sell the girls' home out from under them. The colors
are lively, the Parisian scenery is grand; little girls will love
the movie. You won't mind. Grade: B

 &HT;    Mini reviews of movies released on video
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel and Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Halloween: H20'' (R) _ Jamie Lee Curtis returns in this
unsurprising 20th anniversary sequel to John Carpenter's 1978
frightfest ``Halloween.'' Now, she's a single mom to 17-year-old
John (Josh Hartnett). Also back is Michael Myers, the maniac who
stalked Curtis all those years ago. You can easily guess who'll
survive and who'll get cut out of the picture, literally. But when
Curtis pulls a Sigourney Weaver, a la ``Aliens,'' stalking Michael
instead of fleeing him, the movie finally gets some juice. Grade: C
+ST
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Hav Plenty'' (R) _ Plays like the first draft of what might
have been a good comedy. Writer-director-star Christopher Scott
Cherot is Lee Plenty. Dateless on New Year's Eve he happily accepts
an invitation to a party from his friend Havilland (Chenoa
Maxwell), whom he secretly adores. Cherot is a likable performer,
but he doesn't have the movie star wattage his role needs. Grade: C
ST
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``A Friend of the Deceased'' (R) _ In this bittersweet comedy
about life after Communism in Kiev, a frustrated translator
(Alexandre Lazarev) decides to hire a hitman on himself.
Complications arise when he changes his mind. A meandering but
engaging shaggy-dog story, told with an ironic, vodka-soaked
that's-how-it-is shrug. Grade: B ER
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Air Bud: Golden Receiver'' (G) _ If you're under 8, this
``Bud's'' for you. In this sequel to ``Air Bud,'' Buddy, the
hoop-shooting Golden Retriever, and his boy, Josh (Kevin Zegers)
trade basketball for football. Script-wise, it's little more than a
glorified after-school special, but there hasn't been much around
for younger kids recently and it handles its messages well. And so
what if the movie is essentially a series of Stupid Pet Tricks? In
his K-9 jersey, pads and helmet, Buddy looks more athletically
heroic than Bruce Willis. (In stores Friday.) Grade: B - ER

 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 BY STEVEN T. GOLDBERG 
 ADAPTED FROM ``BUT WHICH MUTUAL FUNDS?'' by STEVEN T. GOLDBERG  
 Copyright 1998 The Kiplinger Washington Editors, Inc. 
 Published by Kiplinger Books  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The stock market's turmoil over the past several months has been
unnerving to almost everyone. When is the turbulence going to stop?
Is the stock market safe? What are good funds to buy now?
</P>
<P>
   Such questions beset nearly all investors in times like these.
But investing in mutual funds can be the right choice _ even when
the market is heading down.
</P>
<P>
   And if you invest in fundamentally sound funds that have proven
themselves over the long haul, a market decline is really the best
time to invest, because stocks are cheaper.
 &UR; WHY PUT YOUR MONEY IN THE MARKET? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Given today's market turmoil, many people want to know: Which
way is the stock market headed next, and what can we expect in the
future?
</P>
<P>
   Alas, despite their frequent pronouncements, none of Wall
Street's highly paid analysts have more than a hunch about which
way the stock market will go today, tomorrow or six months from
now. In fact, you're probably better off paying no attention to
predictions about which way the market is going, because nobody
knows.
</P>
<P>
   Just one example of the experts' fallibility: In 1979, Business
Week ran a cover story: ``The Death of Equities.'' The story argued
that the stock market was never again going to offer the kind of
gains it had in the past. Three years later, the biggest bull
market in history began.
</P>
<P>
   While you should ignore the predictions, do bear this in mind:
Through recessions, wars and all other matter of calamities,
stocks, on average, have returned an annualized 11 percent since
1926. That compares to 5.4 percent for government bonds, and 3.7
percent for ``safe'' cash investments such as short-term Treasury
bills, bank certificates of deposits and money-market funds.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, inflation has averaged 3.1 percent. After inflation,
stocks have actually been less likely to lose money over five-year
periods than bonds or cash.
</P>
<P>
   Over all five-year periods since 1926, stocks have outperformed
bonds and cash more than three-quarters of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ut before you put all your money into stocks, remember:
</P>
<P>
   _ Stocks are far more volatile than bonds, meaning their returns
bounce around more from month to month and year to year. Cash is
the least volatile investment.
</P>
<P>
   _ In their worst year (1931), stocks plunged 43 percent, while
long-term corporate bonds lost only 8.1 percent in their poorest
year (1969), and the worst return on cash was a minuscule loss of
0.02 percent (in 1938).
</P>
<P>
   _ Stocks have fallen by at least 20 percent about once every
five years since 1926. There's nothing unique about this year's
decline. On average, it has taken two years and five months to
break even for an investor who put money into stocks just before a
20 percent or greater drop.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1929 crash (when stocks lost 86 percent of their value
over three years), though, it took until 1944 to break even. And
after the brutal 1973-74 bear market (when stocks fell 48 percent),
it took more than three years to break even _ and 10 years to break
even after inflation.
</P>
<P>
   You get the idea: Stocks are great long-term investments; bonds
and cash make more sense for shorter time periods. Think of stocks
as a roller coaster, bonds as bumper cars and cash as a carousel.
And tune out prognostications about which will do best in the short
run.
 &UR; BEFORE YOU GET STARTED &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you've decided to invest in stock funds, there are a few
things you should do before getting started.
</P>
<P>
   First, make sure you pay off high-interest debt such as credit
cards. Next, amass a cash cushion equal to at least three months of
your after-tax salary in a bank CD or a money-market account. Or,
if you are bolder, take out a home-equity line of credit that you
can tap in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've taken those steps, there are two things you'll need
to determine about yourself: Can you tolerate fear-inspiring market
declines like the recent one without selling your stock funds? And
how long will it be until you'll need your money?
</P>
<P>
   To find out how much risk you can handle, answer the following
two questions:
</P>
<P>
   1. The news media is filled with stories quoting experts who
predict stocks will lose money in the coming decade. Many suggest
investing in real estate. You would:
</P>
<P>
   a. consider selling some stocks funds and buying real estate
</P>
<P>
   b. be concerned, but stick to your long-term goals
</P>
<P>
   c. dismiss the articles as a sign of unwarranted pessimism over
stocks.

   2. Which of the following statements best describes you:
</P>
<P>
   a. I often change my mind and have trouble sticking to a plan.
</P>
<P>
   b. I can stay with a strategy as long as it seems to be doing
well.
</P>
<P>
   c. Once I make up my mind to do something, I tend to follow
through with it regardless of the obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   If you answered ``a'' both times, consider yourself a low-risk
investor. If you answered with one ``a'' and one ``b,'' or two
``b's,'' or one ``a'' and one ``c,'' you're a medium-risk investor.
</P>
<P>
   If you answered with at least one ``c'' and no ``a's,'' you're a
high-risk investor _ able to hold on to stocks no matter how rough
the market gets.
 &UR; HOW MUCH OF YOUR MONEY SHOULD YOU INVEST IN STOCKS? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some stockbrokers and financial planners would have you believe
that figuring out how much to invest in stocks and lower-risk
investments is as difficult as calculus. Not so.
</P>
<P>
   Following are two tables: one for investing for retirement and
the second for investing to meet all other goals.
</P>
<P>
   The table for retirement calls for you to invest a larger
portion of your money in stocks. That's because most people can
expect to live to be 85 or 90 years old _ a long time for your
money to grow, even in retirement.
</P>
<P>
   HOW MUCH OF YOUR MONEY TO INVEST IN STOCKS FOR RETIREMENT OR
WHILE IN RETIREMENT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (The column on the left represents the number of years until
retirement or your age in retirement)
 &UR; .........................TOLERANCE FOR RISK &QL; 
 &UR; ........................LOW...............MODERATE.........HIGH &QL; 
 &UR; More than 15 yrs.........100 percent....100 percent....100 percent &QL; 
 &UR; 10 to 15 yrs..............70.............80............100 &QL; 
 &UR; 6 to 10 yrs...............60.............70............100 &QL; 
 &UR; 0 to 6 yrs................40.............50.............85 &QL; 
 &UR; Early retirement (age 65-75).35..........45.............60 &QL; 
 &UR; Late retirement (over age 75).30.........40.............50 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HOW MUCH TO INVEST IN STOCKS FOR ALL GOALS EXCEPT RETIREMENT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (The column on the left represents the number of years until
you'll need the money)
 &UR; ....................TOLERANCE FOR RISK &QL; 
 &UR; ....................LOW............MODERATE............HIGH &QL; 
 &UR; More than 15 yrs....80 percent........100 percent.....100 percent &QL; 
 &UR; 10 to 15 yrs........60.................80.............100 &QL; 
 &UR; 6 to 10 yrs.........55.................70..............90 &QL;

 &UR; 2 to 4..............10.................25..............35 &QL; 
 &UR; 0 to 2...............0..................0...............0 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Armed with this knowledge, and details that I'll give you on
which funds to buy in the next article, there's no need for you to
buy a fund with a sales charge, or to pay a stock broker or
financial adviser to help you select funds.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, once you become accustomed to the ups and downs of
the market, you may find you're more able to tolerate them. If so,
take the risk test again and see if you should increase the
percentage of your money you put into stock funds.
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; SIDEBAR: GETTING STARTED &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to know you need to get started investing _ or
that you need to invest in a more methodical way. It's another
thing to actually pull the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   Procrastination is the enemy of investors. You know all the
excuses: Either you don't have enough money, you'd rather spend it
on something else, the market seems too risky just now or you're
already so far behind that starting would be pointless.
</P>
<P>
   You'll feel better about making a move if, instead of plunging
in, you take a tentative step or two. Invest a modest but fixed
amount from your salary in shares of stock funds every month.
</P>
<P>
   Funds often allow a monthly (or quarterly) minimum investment of
as little as $25 or $50, as long as you agree to make regular,
automatic investments via your checking account. Having the fund
company take the money out of your bank account each month is a big
plus.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a 401(k) or 403(b) retirement plan at work, your
employer will similarly invest money straight from your paycheck.
And most companies match at least part of your investment, offering
an instant, substantial return.
</P>
<P>
   Money you don't see is money you won't spend and money you soon
will find you hardly miss. If you have to sit down and write a
check to a mutual fund every month, it's much easier to find
something else you'd rather spend the money on than your future.

TIPS FOR MAKING PERFECT HOLIDAY COOKIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROTH FANTASIA  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Although time seems shorter than an elf during
the holidays, some folks are unable to let the season pass without
baking cookies. Bakeries and specialty stores simply can't:
</P>
<P>
   Duplicate grandma's recipe for butter cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Keep the children occupied for an afternoon decorating sugar
cookies and gingerbread men.
</P>
<P>
   Put love and tenderness into every bite.
</P>
<P>
   So, for those who must bake, here are a few tips to make the
process easier:
</P>
<P>
   _ Have at least four cookie sheets, two sets of measuring cups
and two sets of measuring spoons on hand. With enough basic
equipment, the cookie sheets will have time to cool properly
between batches and you won't have to be washing and drying
measures for every kind of cookie.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sift baking soda before measuring to break up any clumps that
may throw off the measure.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chop chocolate bars into small pieces (a food processor makes
fast work of this) before heating to make melting faster and the
results smoother.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chocolate that has a grayish, powdery or oily coating on the
outside has ``bloomed,'' meaning it has melted just enough for some
of the sugar crystals to separate, an occurrence usually caused by
storing chocolate in areas where temperatures and humidity are not
stable. Don't worry, bloom doesn't harm the chocolate; it is still
delicious. Take care, however, when melting bloomed chocolate as it
can separate more easily than chocolate that has been stored
properly.
</P>
<P>
   _ Beat older, room temperature egg whites to make the smoothest
meringues. Adding 1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar for each egg white
used will stabilize the whites enough to prevent them from drying
out by overbeating. (Or, use 1 teaspoon cream of tartar for each
cup of egg whites).
</P>
<P>
   _ When measuring flour, pay close attention to the method called
for in the recipe. The ``dip and sweep'' method means to dip the
measuring cup into a bin of flour and then level off the top using
a knife. If the recipe calls for flour to be ``lightly spooned into
the cup,'' spoon the flour into the measuring cup and then level
the top with a knife. ``Sifted'' flour means to sift the flour
directly into the measuring cup, without shaking the cup, and then
level the top with a knife. Spooning uses less flour than the dip
and sweep method and sifting uses less flour that either of the
other two. If the recipe doesn't specify how to measure the flour,
use the spooning method.
</P>
<P>
   _ Liquid food coloring can be mixed with egg yolk and painted on
cookies before baking to add color.
</P>
<P>
   _ Toasting nuts adds flavor to cookies and other baked goods. To
toast most nuts, spread on a baking sheet and toast in a 350 oven
for about 10 minutes, or until golden brown.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finally, allow cookie sheets to cool between uses so the raw
cookies don't begin to cook before you place them in the oven.
</P>

 c.1998 Foreign Affairs Magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Anyone personally appointed by the president of the United
States to a position of high trust and responsibility in foreign
and defense policy swears to uphold the Constitution and laws of
the United States, has the FBI confirm his or her patriotism, and
accepts a good-faith obligation as a public servant to serve the
interests of the American people.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not all.
</P>
<P>
   Senior appointments entail an obligation of loyalty to the
president who appointed you. That is not the same as unlimited
allegiance, much less subservient obedience or blind faith. It does
not exclude other obligations to Congress, the taxpayers or one's
department. But it is an obligation, nevertheless _ one that, once
accepted, should not be lightly abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   This charge is more than a legal obligation arising out of an
employer-employee relationship. It is even more than loyalty to an
impersonal administration or ``team,'' though that may well be part
of it. Conversely, it is more than a matter of friendship, for it
applies equally to those who have a close relationship with the
president and those who do not.
</P>
<P>
   It is essentially a moral commitment to that president as
president, to respect his leadership, reciprocate his confidence
and trust, and faithfully support his final decisions, even _ or
especially _ when they are under attack.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the meaning and limitations of loyalty to the
president were raised anew by the recent legal and political
imbroglio in Washington arising out of President Clinton's sexual
misconduct. In a futile effort at concealment, he lied not only
under oath and to the public but also to his cabinet and White
House staff.
</P>
<P>
   His secretary of state, secretary of the treasury and other top
aides were in effect dispatched to repeat his denials to the news
media, the grand jury investigating his activities, and
representatives of foreign governments. Several months later, when
the truth was out, their pain was palpable.
</P>
<P>
   Yet not one appointee resigned. Reportedly, only one mildly
rebuked the president. Several told others of their sense of
betrayal, sorrow, shame or anger over their forced grand jury
appearances _ but almost never spoke publicly to the press.
</P>
<P>
   Some appointees were deemed ``gullible'' for believing him,
``gutless'' for not leaving him, or ``foolishly loyal'' for
remaining silent. Yet former Clinton appointees who spoke
negatively to the press about his actions were labeled ``ungrateful
and disloyal.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting commentaries on loyalty to the president can be
divided into two schools. One maintains that loyalty in general is
an antiquated trait that has largely fallen into disuse. Evidence
of this proposition abounds.
</P>
<P>
   In the more cynical, materialistic 1980s and 1990s, few pay
attention to such lofty concepts as honor, steadfastness and
fidelity. A more mobile workforce has become accustomed to slipping
the bonds of devotion to former mentors, employers and friends and
finds time only for acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   Children no longer grow up unshakable fans of ``hometown''
sports teams because they seldom have a ``hometown,'' and the star
players _ and even the franchises themselves _ leave to pursue
greater riches elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Memoirs betraying the secrets of former confidants, spouses or
lovers have been highly successful; unsurprisingly, books by recent
administration officials have not all been discreet, much less
supportive.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, loyalty to the chief was both taught and enforced by
big-city political organizations built on unswerving fealty to the
local leader and the patronage, promotions and perquisites that
came with it. Among federal employees in the pre-civil service
days, William Howard Taft once wrote, ``even the humblest charwoman
... felt a throb of deep personal interest in the political health
of the President.''
</P>
<P>
   But today's political organizations are too weak to provide any
meaningful reward or inspiration for the faithful, much less any
discipline for those who are not.
</P>
<P>
   The other current school of media commentary finds the principle
of loyalty to the president not so much forgotten and underutilized
as all too present and overrated. Loyalty is derided as a
Mafia-like code of silence that prevents current and former
advisers from criticizing unconscionable presidential actions _ an
instrument of ``political serfdom'' that stifles disagreement
within an administration and keeps appointees from either resigning
in protest or speaking out in public.
</P>
<P>
   Kai Bird's recent book on the Bundy brothers and Vietnam
criticizes them and other ``wise men ... so steeped in the
Establishment's culture of discretion that values loyalty over
dissent'' that they could not break with President Johnson on
Vietnam or publicly disagree with him even after leaving office.
``In short,'' Bird writes, ``the Establishment had a problem
speaking truth to power.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert S. McNamara was similarly accused of ``misguided
loyalty'' for withholding his doubts about the winnability and
morality of the Vietnam War even after he left the Department of
Defense for the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   But passion over either the Clinton follies or Vietnam should
not blind us to the long-term value of loyalty. Loyalty is
indispensable to an organized society and to orderly and effective
governance. No American president can provide consistent direction
in foreign affairs if he cannot depend upon those who accept his
trust to also accept his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   No president should need to spell out this obligation to his new
appointees; he has every right and reason to assume it is part of
their instinctive morality and institutional duty. Presidential
aides expect and deserve it from one another to deter leaks,
backbiting and factionalism.
</P>
<P>
   The very concept of ``public service'' requires it from all who
put their personal interests aside to serve. The framers of the
Constitution, having rejected the notion of an executive council
directing the president, assumed his subordinates would support
him.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a difference between a loyal agent and a fanatical
zealot _ or a servile puppet. All obligations of principle have
practical conditions and limitations, and that includes the
principle of loyalty to the president. As a new appointee, you have
a duty to support, protect and defend his interests, success and
agenda even on those occasions when they are inconsistent with your
interests, success and agenda.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not require you to ``fall on your sword,'' go to
prison, or endanger your life or that of others. You are not
expected to forswear commitments to country and conscience, to
family and faith. Your obligation to keep his secrets is not an
obligation to tell lies, especially under oath. Your commitment to
his every cause does not oblige you to conspire in any crime.
</P>
<P>
   If loyalty does not require zealotry, neither does it require
sycophancy. Neither the president nor the presidency is well served
by a toady intimidated by the atmosphere of ``fear and fawning''
surrounding the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   An adviser must be more than an uncritical admirer. Eagerness to
concur must not repress the qualities of mind and character that
caused you to be appointed in the first place. Your duty is not to
please the president but to help him _ bringing him your best
judgment even when it is harsh, the whole truth even when it hurts,
and all the choices even when they are hard.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, loyalty to the president, if it is to endure, must be
reciprocal. A president under fire who blames his appointees for
his failures or shames them in front of their peers is far more
likely to find his aides undercutting him with unattributed
comments to reporters and his former appointees distancing
themselves from his troubles than a president who has consistently
shown ``loyalty down'' by defending his aides in public, reassuring
them in private and protecting them against attacks from Congress
or the press.
</P>
<P>
   No president is required to tell any of his appointees
everything, but he cannot long retain their trust if he tells them
lies. No president is required to be right every time, but he has
no right to risk the very principles that drew his subordinates to
him. No president is required to accept any aide's advice on any
particular issue, but he risks resignation or revolt if he rejects
that advice without ample explanation of his reasons and careful
consideration of that adviser's core values.
</P>
<P>
   One's core values will ultimately test whether one's loyalty to
the president is more than kind words. The obligation to accept his
final decisions is not limited to those about which you do not care
or with which you do not disagree. Living with deep-seated
disagreement and disappointment is an inevitable part of the job.
</P>
<P>
   Despite checks and balances, the American system entrusts
enormous decision- making authority to the presidency. That grant
of power is justified and conditioned on one fundamental fact: Its
occupant is elected by all the people.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps on some critical issue, an aide is certain that the
president was wrong and the aide right. But, as the old question
goes: Who elected you? The president alone bears the final
responsibility, and he receives information, advice, options and
political considerations of which you may be unaware.
</P>
<P>
   Loyally accepting a presidential decision with which you
profoundly disagree does not require a surrender of your rights or
values. Within the limits of loyalty, you can continue to voice
your doubts and dissents privately to the president, ``speaking
truth to power'' as George Ball did on Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   You can ask that you not be assigned to defend that which you
consider indefensible _ a request that serves the president's own
interest, for you may be unable to defend it credibly and
effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can swallow your disapproval, confide your disquietude
only to your diary and distant memoirs (not in leaks to the press
or in disgruntled administration cabals), and stay at your post,
remaining ever hopeful that this too will pass, that on most
important issues within your jurisdiction the president has earned
your support, and that your continuing to prod within his circle
will do more to move him in the right direction than any public
protest you might make.
</P>
<P>
   Clark M. Clifford, by carrying on as secretary of defense even
as his doubts grew about Vietnam, helped steer President Johnson
toward a negotiated exit. That is not a coward's rationale. Staying
often takes more courage than leaving.
</P>
<P>
   If, however, the president's decision involves so overriding a
principle that you can no longer in good conscience continue to
believe in his leadership, much less implement that particular
decision, then it is neither dishonorable nor disloyal to quietly
submit your resignation _ not to continually threaten it, but to
simply do it.
</P>
<P>
   Loyalty may induce you to postpone the effective date until
after that particular crisis or the next election. It may induce
you not to make public your discomfort for months, for years or
forever, depending on the urgency of the issue and the prospects of
changing the president's course. It cannot and should not compel
you to stay when your heart is no longer in your job.
</P>
<P>
   But abandoning a president of the United States in crisis is not
a step one takes lightly. The president's troubles, even if
self-inflicted, are the nation's troubles. It is a time not to jump
ship but to help save it.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer does not abandon a long-term client for ignoring his
advice, withholding facts from him or otherwise falling short of
his standards.
</P>
<P>
   If you leave a president's side, you increase the weight of
those who advised him differently than you, and you leave
shorthanded those in the administration who share your convictions.
</P>
<P>
   In appointing you, the president is promising that he will hear
your advice, not that he will always heed it. He is promising you a
post full of challenge, not a post free from disappointment. He is
expecting not only your wisdom but also your loyalty. There is no
way of knowing at what point, on what issue, that loyalty will be
severely tested.
</P>
<P>
   You may then be required to balance the principle of loyalty
against some other principle you hold dear, the need to recognize
the president's democratic authority against your individual
convictions, his right to your support against your right to speak
out, your prospects for helping to alter his course if you stay
inside against your prospects for influencing that course if you
move outside.
</P>
<P>
   You will receive conflicting advice from concerned friends,
interested groups, and self-righteous columnists. If you cannot
handle that pressure, better reconsider accepting the appointment.

<P>
   Anyone personally appointed by the president of the United
States to a position of high trust and responsibility in foreign
and defense policy swears to uphold the Constitution and laws of
the United States, has the FBI confirm his or her patriotism, and
accepts a good-faith obligation as a public servant to serve the
interests of the American people.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not all.
</P>
<P>
   Senior appointments entail an obligation of loyalty to the
president who appointed you. That is not the same as unlimited
allegiance, much less subservient obedience or blind faith. It does
not exclude other obligations to Congress, the taxpayers or one's
department. But it is an obligation, nevertheless _ one that, once
accepted, should not be lightly abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   This charge is more than a legal obligation arising out of an
employer-employee relationship. It is even more than loyalty to an
impersonal administration or ``team,'' though that may well be part
of it. Conversely, it is more than a matter of friendship, for it
applies equally to those who have a close relationship with the
president and those who do not.
</P>
<P>
   It is essentially a moral commitment to that president as
president, to respect his leadership, reciprocate his confidence
and trust, and faithfully support his final decisions, even _ or
especially _ when they are under attack.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the meaning and limitations of loyalty to the
president were raised anew by the recent legal and political
imbroglio in Washington arising out of President Clinton's sexual
misconduct. In a futile effort at concealment, he lied not only
under oath and to the public but also to his cabinet and White
House staff.
</P>
<P>
   His secretary of state, secretary of the treasury and other top
aides were in effect dispatched to repeat his denials to the news
media, the grand jury investigating his activities, and
representatives of foreign governments. Several months later, when
the truth was out, their pain was palpable.
</P>
<P>
   Yet not one appointee resigned. Reportedly, only one mildly
rebuked the president. Several told others of their sense of
betrayal, sorrow, shame or anger over their forced grand jury
appearances _ but almost never spoke publicly to the press.
</P>
<P>
   Some appointees were deemed ``gullible'' for believing him,
``gutless'' for not leaving him, or ``foolishly loyal'' for
remaining silent. Yet former Clinton appointees who spoke
negatively to the press about his actions were labeled ``ungrateful
and disloyal.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting commentaries on loyalty to the president can be
divided into two schools. One maintains that loyalty in general is
an antiquated trait that has largely fallen into disuse. Evidence
of this proposition abounds.
</P>
<P>
   In the more cynical, materialistic 1980s and 1990s, few pay
attention to such lofty concepts as honor, steadfastness and
fidelity. A more mobile workforce has become accustomed to slipping
the bonds of devotion to former mentors, employers and friends and
finds time only for acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   Children no longer grow up unshakable fans of ``hometown''
sports teams because they seldom have a ``hometown,'' and the star
players _ and even the franchises themselves _ leave to pursue
greater riches elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Memoirs betraying the secrets of former confidants, spouses or
lovers have been highly successful; unsurprisingly, books by recent
administration officials have not all been discreet, much less
supportive.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, loyalty to the chief was both taught and enforced by
big-city political organizations built on unswerving fealty to the
local leader and the patronage, promotions and perquisites that
came with it. Among federal employees in the pre-civil service
days, William Howard Taft once wrote, ``even the humblest charwoman
... felt a throb of deep personal interest in the political health
of the President.''
</P>
<P>
   But today's political organizations are too weak to provide any
meaningful reward or inspiration for the faithful, much less any
discipline for those who are not.
</P>
<P>
   The other current school of media commentary finds the principle
of loyalty to the president not so much forgotten and underutilized
as all too present and overrated. Loyalty is derided as a
Mafia-like code of silence that prevents current and former
advisers from criticizing unconscionable presidential actions _ an
instrument of ``political serfdom'' that stifles disagreement
within an administration and keeps appointees from either resigning
in protest or speaking out in public.
</P>
<P>
   Kai Bird's recent book on the Bundy brothers and Vietnam
criticizes them and other ``wise men ... so steeped in the
Establishment's culture of discretion that values loyalty over
dissent'' that they could not break with President Johnson on
Vietnam or publicly disagree with him even after leaving office.
``In short,'' Bird writes, ``the Establishment had a problem
speaking truth to power.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert S. McNamara was similarly accused of ``misguided
loyalty'' for withholding his doubts about the winnability and
morality of the Vietnam War even after he left the Department of
Defense for the World Bank.
</P>

indispensable to an organized society and to orderly and effective

<P>
   Santa Claus may be able to travel around the world in a single
night, but when it comes to his health, he's no Superman, according
to the latest medical research. That bowl full of jelly, a diet
rich in fatty cookies and a lack of regular exercise all put Santa
at risk for a number of health problems.
</P>
<P>
   But adopting a healthier lifestyle won't be as difficult for
Santa as it may sound, according to Dr. Joseph A. Lieberman, the
chairman of the department of family and community medicine at the
Christiana Care Health System in Wilmington, Del., and a clinical
professor of family medicine at Jefferson Medical College in
Philadelphia. And Santa's jolly nature already gives him a head
start on improving his health, he said. While Lieberman has never
examined Santa himself, he has taken a peek at the Jolly One's
medical records.
</P>
<P>
   Here is Medical Tribune News Service's annual review of the
state of Santa's health.
</P>
<P>
   --Santa needs to trim a few pounds. This may seem obvious, but
the importance of weight loss continues to be a subject of debate
in the medical community.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, the editors of a prestigious medical journal,
The New England Journal of Medicine, published an editorial stating
that Americans are too obsessed with trying to lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   But in the spring, the American Heart Association placed obesity
in the same risk-factor class as smoking, high cholesterol, high
blood pressure and a sedentary lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   And the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in Bethesda,
Md., announced new obesity guidelines, which declared that 55
percent of American adults need to lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with these mixed messages, Santa should stay calm,
according to Lieberman. The Delaware expert recommended that St.
Nick ``use an exercise program and dietary discretion to keep his
weight under control,'' but that he should ``not be so obsessed
that it affects his jolly disposition.''
</P>
<P>
   --Year-round exercise can boost Santa's health. Besides helping
him trim down his bowl full of jelly, research published this year
has highlighted a number of exercise's health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   A Finnish study of about 8,000 sets of twins found that those
who walked or jogged for just 30 minutes six or more times a month
had a 43 percent lower risk of death than sedentary people.
</P>
<P>
   Exercise may also help ward off Alzheimer's disease, according
to a study conducted at Case Western Reserve University in
Cleveland. In a group of 370 people, those who did not have
Alzheimer's had engaged in significantly more exercise during their
lifetimes than people with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Santa may not have much room for error, since ``he's already
making his list and checking it twice,'' Lieberman commented. ``We
want to insure that he forestalls the development of Alzheimer's,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman recommended that Santa exercise for 20 minutes at
least three times a week.
</P>
<P>
   --Lay off the cookies. ``An occasional indulgence in cookies is
OK, but kiddies may also want to put out other things,'' Lieberman
advised.
</P>
<P>
   Veggies may be good substitutes, since they are rich in
nutrients and fiber. And a study from Italy found that some
vegetables, carrots in particular, may help prevent certain types
of cancer. Vegetables and fruits rich in potassium, such as
bananas, may also lower the risk of stroke, according to a Harvard
study of more than 44,000 men.
</P>
<P>
   --Have an occasional glass of wine. While earlier research has
shown that a daily drink or two -- especially red wine -- may help
protect the heart, the habit may also help preserve Santa's sight,
according to a study of more than 3,000 adults that found that
moderate wine drinkers were less likely to develop age-related
macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness among the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman agreed, but he warned against drinking while behind
the reins. ``It would be wonderful to have wine, but not while he's
driving the sled,'' he advised.
</P>
<P>
   --That jolly disposition counts for something. University of
Kentucky researchers have discovered that optimism may improve more
than a person's mood: it may also boost the immune system. ``We
should learn a lesson from Santa that a pleasant disposition may
prolong life,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Santa's outlook may be getting rosier. In a nationwide poll of
2,727 people ages 25 to 74, older men and women were more likely
than younger folks to say that they had felt happy, cheerful or
satisfied in the last month.

   --Eyes. Elderly people are at risk for a number of eye diseases,
including cataracts and age-related macular degeneration. The San
Francisco-based American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends a
complete eye exam every one to two years for the elderly.

   Santa Claus may be able to travel around the world in a single
night, but when it comes to his health, he's no Superman, according
to the latest medical research. That bowl full of jelly, a diet
rich in fatty cookies and a lack of regular exercise all put Santa
at risk for a number of health problems.
</P>
<P>
   But adopting a healthier lifestyle won't be as difficult for
Santa as it may sound, according to Dr. Joseph A. Lieberman, the
chairman of the department of family and community medicine at the
Christiana Care Health System in Wilmington, Del., and a clinical
professor of family medicine at Jefferson Medical College in
Philadelphia. And Santa's jolly nature already gives him a head
start on improving his health, he said. While Lieberman has never
examined Santa himself, he has taken a peek at the Jolly One's
medical records.
</P>
<P>
   Here is Medical Tribune News Service's annual review of the
state of Santa's health.
</P>
<P>
   --Santa needs to trim a few pounds. This may seem obvious, but
the importance of weight loss continues to be a subject of debate
in the medical community.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, the editors of a prestigious medical journal,
The New England Journal of Medicine, published an editorial stating
that Americans are too obsessed with trying to lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   But in the spring, the American Heart Association placed obesity
in the same risk-factor class as smoking, high cholesterol, high
blood pressure and a sedentary lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   And the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in Bethesda,
Md., announced new obesity guidelines, which declared that 55
percent of American adults need to lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with these mixed messages, Santa should stay calm,
according to Lieberman. The Delaware expert recommended that St.
Nick ``use an exercise program and dietary discretion to keep his
weight under control,'' but that he should ``not be so obsessed
that it affects his jolly disposition.''
</P>
<P>
   --Year-round exercise can boost Santa's health. Besides helping
him trim down his bowl full of jelly, research published this year
has highlighted a number of exercise's health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   A Finnish study of about 8,000 sets of twins found that those
who walked or jogged for just 30 minutes six or more times a month
had a 43 percent lower risk of death than sedentary people.
</P>
<P>
   Exercise may also help ward off Alzheimer's disease, according
to a study conducted at Case Western Reserve University in
Cleveland. In a group of 370 people, those who did not have
Alzheimer's had engaged in significantly more exercise during their
lifetimes than people with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Santa may not have much room for error, since ``he's already
making his list and checking it twice,'' Lieberman commented. ``We
want to insure that he forestalls the development of Alzheimer's,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman recommended that Santa exercise for 20 minutes at
least three times a week.
</P>
<P>
   --Lay off the cookies. ``An occasional indulgence in cookies is
OK, but kiddies may also want to put out other things,'' Lieberman
advised.
</P>
<P>
   Veggies may be good substitutes, since they are rich in
nutrients and fiber. And a study from Italy found that some
vegetables, carrots in particular, may help prevent certain types
of cancer. Vegetables and fruits rich in potassium, such as
bananas, may also lower the risk of stroke, according to a Harvard
study of more than 44,000 men.
</P>
<P>
   --Have an occasional glass of wine. While earlier research has
shown that a daily drink or two -- especially red wine -- may help
protect the heart, the habit may also help preserve Santa's sight,
according to a study of more than 3,000 adults that found that
moderate wine drinkers were less likely to develop age-related
macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness among the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman agreed, but he warned against drinking while behind
the reins. ``It would be wonderful to have wine, but not while he's
driving the sled,'' he advised.
</P>
<P>
   --That jolly disposition counts for something. University of
Kentucky researchers have discovered that optimism may improve more
than a person's mood: it may also boost the immune system. ``We
should learn a lesson from Santa that a pleasant disposition may
prolong life,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Santa's outlook may be getting rosier. In a nationwide poll of
2,727 people ages 25 to 74, older men and women were more likely
than younger folks to say that they had felt happy, cheerful or
satisfied in the last month.

COFFEEHOUSE ACQUISITION BREWS SOME DISSENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY DELGADO and MALCOLM GLOVER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Starbucks Coffee Co. plan to acquire Pasqua
Coffee is leaving a bitter aftertaste in the mouths of some patrons
of the San Francisco-based coffeehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks, the nation's largest coffee retailer, announced
Tuesday that it would buy Pasqua for an undisclosed amount. Pasqua
has 56 outlets in the Los Angles, New York and San Francisco areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like it,'' said Tom Bennett, a construction worker who
was sipping a cup of joe at a Pasqua outlet in San Francisco. ``I
like the way it is and that's why I come in here.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Sias, a supervisor with the Department of Public Health,
said he has been a Pasqua customer for five to six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrible, terrible,'' he said. Starbucks coffeehouses
``are already all over the place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're gonna have no more choices soon,'' said Berkeley
resident Claire Greensfelder, 46, who said she avoids Starbucks at
all costs in favor of mom-and-pop cafes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care for Starbucks, and I won't go there,''
Greensfelder said. ``It's destruction of individual choice, and it
takes the fun out of it if every coffee shop is the same.''
</P>
<P>
   With the purchase of Pasqua, Starbucks will inherit a small
chain that had $26 million in revenue last year, adding to an
empire that had sales of $1.3 billion by comparison. The transition
should be complete by February.
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks, with more than 1,700 stores in North America, wants
to add 400 more in the United States and Canada within the year. In
April, the chain paid about $81 million in stock for the Seattle
Coffee Co. in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the addition of the Pasqua locations, we're even more
confident that we'll meet our goal in continental North America,''
said Alan Gulick, a Starbucks spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Sheffield, who works at Pasqua shop in San Francisco,
said she learned about the sale from her sister, who works for
Starbucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that they leave us alone because Pasqua is more
customer-oriented than Starbucks seems to be,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the San Francisco-based Spinelli Coffee Co. was
purchased by Tully's Coffee Corp., another Seattle company.
</P>
<P>
   Pasqua, which Starbucks plans to convert to the Starbucks
banner, operates 48 stores in the San Francisco area, Los Angeles
and New York, and has eight licensed airport locations in
California. In addition, the company has a coffee roastery in San
Francisco, three commissaries and two bakeries.
</P>
<P>
   Pasqua co-founder Martin Kupferman acknowledged it had gotten
more difficult to compete with Starbucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Starbucks, and nobody else is going to touch them,'' said
Kupferman, who added that he was satisfied with terms of the sale.

FOR THE HOLIDAYS, CONSIDER AN OPEN HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The holidays are a festive time often shared with
friends, family, neighbors and colleagues. One of the most
convenient ways to accommodate everybody is to host an open house.
</P>
<P>
   At an open house, guests are invited to stop by for a short
visit and refreshments during certain hours, according to the
rewritten and updated ``Amy Vanderbilt Complete Book of Etiquette''
by Nancy Tuckerman and Nancy Dunnan. It is very much like a large
cocktail party, although liquor is not necessarily served,
according to the Vanderbilt book.
</P>
<P>
   Grown or well-behaved children may be included in invitations to
their parents. If you are not sure if you can take your child or
children, ask the host or hostess first.
</P>
<P>
   Guests are expected to stay about a half-hour or 45 minutes,
long enough to greet the host and hostess, wish everyone a happy
holiday and have a bite to eat. The invitation should state both
the beginning and ending hours, and there is generally no need to
RSVP.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore it's best to be well prepared but keep the food
simple, as guests are basically there for conversation.
</P>
<P>
   If you are doing your own cooking, make it relatively
stress-free by preparing as much as possible ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
   Platters of small sandwiches, cookies and cupcakes, mixed nuts,
cheese and crackers and crudites, along with a punch or eggnog, are
common fare. If planning on a soup, serve one that can be drunk
from a cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``You definitely want to serve bite-sized food, so people can
eat it in one or two bites and hold their drink at the same time,''
advised Liz Mazzone, a caterer in Scotia, N.Y.. ``Whatever you
serve, make sure it doesn't crumble easily or stain, or you'll hate
yourself the day after.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Baker, director of Sales for the Glen Sanders, said that
open houses are mingling parties, so you'll also want to pass hors
d'oeuvres, punch, champagne, especially to those who are trapped in
group conversations and can't make it to the bar, punch or buffet
tables.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't set your table so that people can walk around it,
locate a variety of edibles in various places around the dining,
living and family rooms,'' Baker said. ``You may want to serve four
or five cheeses and four to six types of hors d'oeuvres. If your
party crosses over into dinner time, you might want to serve two
hot dinner-like items, such as a pasta or chicken dish and a baked
ham or turkey, so guests can make a mini-sandwich.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest mistake people make when hosting an open house is,
they think they are only going to be hosting 30 people at a time
the result of scheduling some guests early and others later,
according to Baker.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's always a time in the middle of the open house
where everybody is there at once,'' she said. ``So make sure you
are ready with everything for that kind of rush.''
</P>
<P>
   Plan your party list and invitations at least a month to eight
weeks in advance, followed by the menu and decorations. The
decorations provide holiday mood and pizzazz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christmas is the one time that you should overdecorate,''
stressed floral designer Rudy Grant, co-owner of Experience and
Creative Design Ltd. in Schenectady, N.Y. ``It's expected. Don't
hold back. Go to extremes and overdo. Decorate doors, mantels,
windows, tables and so-on. Use a tree in as many rooms as you can
and something dramatic at the entrance and in the foyer to set the
party and decorating tone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The way to do this is either by theme or color scheme,'' Grant
said. ``If you don't do it this way, your decorations will jump out
at you in an odd mismatched way. Next, you want to add a lot of
candles and soft lighting to set a calm, relaxed mood that's always
right for entertaining.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Alan Boehmer, interior designer and stylist for
Coming Home, the home products division of Lands' End in
Dodgeville, Wis., you can avoid a disjointed look by decorating
your home and property in uniform colors and materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Start with the walkway and front door, as those are the first
things, that your guests will see,'' Boehmer said. ``Try
incorporating nontraditional colors into your holiday decor, which
can give it a fresh feel without dramatically changing the
traditional style.''
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have a lot of room or wherewithal for decorating,
decide on one focal point and make it the most beautiful and
eye-catching piece and build around it, Boehmer said. The buffet
table should be one of the main focal points.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might wish to decorate your buffet table with a small
table-top tree that's simple decorated with plaid ribbon and
berries,'' Boehmer said. ``You can also weave a holiday plaid
ribbon through a row of Granny Smith apples, which adds several
spots of nice color in a runner-like fashion. You may even wish to
add a few votive candles in and around the apples.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Baker said that the table should be very festive with lots of
interest, such as evergreens, ribbon and Christmas ornaments for
lots of glitz and color.
</P>
<P>
   ``Try making several tiers for displaying food,'' Baker said.
``You can do this by stacking several boxes and covering them with
fabric and other decorations, but careful to leave room for the
various dishes you plan to serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Grant said a mixed arrangement of fresh and dried flowers
makes a strong statement, as well as bowls of fresh fruit and
ornaments for accent and color.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional standbys include cornucopias filled with ornaments
or fruits and vegetables, dried hydrangeas, a vase of fresh
poppies, poinsettia plants in various sizes and colors,
pomegranates or a bowl of clove-studded or ribbon-tied lemons,
limes and oranges.
</P>
<P>
   Grant said if eating utensils are going to be used, place them
in small individually decorated Christmas stockings, so that your
guests can keep the stocking as a party favor or holiday gift.
</P>
<P>
   If you are planning on the addition of holiday music, keep it
low enough so that guests can talk without shouting over it.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the party glow should be lots of candles in various
sizes that are placed in safe areas so they don't ruin a surface by
dripping or igniting something. You should also be careful to not
overpower your guests with overly fragrant candles and potpourri.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about buying soft pink bulbs for your electrical lights,
particularly for areas where guests may gather,'' Boehmer said.
``The pink hue gives off a pleasing warm glow to people's skin and
a relaxed, intimate feel to the get-together.''

THANKS TO PHONES AND JUNK MAIL, A 17TH-CENTURY FARMER LIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BOB GARDINIER  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROTTERDAM JUNCTION, N.Y. _ Check the local telephone directory
and you'll find a listing for Jan P. Mabee. The phone will ring
inside a white farm house he built in 1670.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get telephone solicitors calling asking for Mr. Mabee and
when I tell them he's been dead since 1725 I get silence and then a
click,'' Scott Haefner said laughing. Haefner is the town historian
who lives in and is caretaker of the historic Mabee Farm in the
upstate New York hamlet of Rotterdam Junction.
</P>
<P>
   Haefner's listing of the name of one of the junction's first
settlers was not done in jest but out of convenience, along with a
helping of respect. Town historians come and go but the two-story
stone home with many small rooms and short doorways is open for
tours and was built by Mabee to last. The historic plaque out by
the road says it is the ``oldest home in the Mohawk Valley east of
this point.''
</P>
<P>
   The floors creak a little and some muscle is required to work
the thick drop-latch original entry door. Most of the home is still
the way Mabee left it.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at a table in the rough plank-floored kitchen one recent
day, Haefner sorted through the junk mail he has kept that was
addressed to Mabee. An antique grandfather clock by the kitchen
hearth bonged the half-hour as the sun cast a pattern on the floor
made by the wide mullions of the Dutch window that offers a view of
the browned reeds along the Mohawk River in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   The Mabee calls and letters are but an amusing distraction to
Haefner's real work _ sorting through more than 500 historic
photographs of Rotterdam Junction, also strewn on the table, which
he wants to compile into a book on the hamlet.
</P>
<P>
   There are pictures of the railroad workers, the roundhouse,
trains, buggies, horses, taverns and many graduating classes of the
Woestina School (Dutch for wilderness) which is now an elementary
school.
</P>
<P>
   Rotterdam Junction was born literally overnight in January 1884
during the railroad steam-engine era when the Boston and Main and
the West Shore railroads opened a huge round house with a 34-track
rail junction.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the homes have that late Victorian look like they were all
built at the same time,'' Haefner said. ``That's because they
were.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the way America used to be and isn't any more,'' he
continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't put together this history, who will?'' Pickney
added. ``The younger generation seems more distant and this will
all be forgotten.''

</P>
<P>
   This old favorite has lost a following as we've moved on to

SOME PLANTS LIKE NORTHERN EXPOSURE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I have a sweet olive about 20 feet tall. Should I cut it back
and fertilize? I want to plant night-blooming jasmine. How should I
care for them? The north side of my house is 100 percent shade.
Tell me what plants I can put in.
</P>
<P>
   A: Sweet olive (``Osmanthus fragrans'') flowers off and on
during late fall, winter and early spring, and likes a moist,
fertile soil and partial sun or bright shade. I would prune after
flowering and after danger of frost. If it has been some time since
fertilization and the plant could use a boost, you could then apply
a slow-release, balanced fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   Night-blooming jessamine (``Cestrum nocturnum'') prefers sun or
partial sun and a well-draining, organically enriched soil. Mulch
the root area well during winter. This shrub is inclined to be
rangy or irregular in form, even when pruned heavily in late
winter. In order to encourage a bushier habit, you'll need to nip
it back more frequently. Of course, you could rest the lanky limbs
on some type of support. The blossoms, which become so fragrant at
night, typically appear midsummer into fall.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure what height is best for your northside plantings.
From your drawing, it looks as if the area is not in heavy shade.
Easy-care plant suggestions include the dwarf yaupon, a rounded,
dense shrub with small leaves. This plant takes full sun to bright
shade and tolerates various soils. Fertilize in late winter/early
spring to encourage bushiness. Mature height is about 3 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese mahonia (``Mahonia fortunei'') is an attractive
evergreen good for shade or filtered sunlight. The yellow flowers
are followed by blue berries that are food for the birds.
Pest-resistant, the Chinese mahonia likes an organically enriched
soil that drains well. Mature height is about 4 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Hydrangeas like a northern exposure. They flower best with some
sun but will bloom in shade, especially bright shade. They are
deciduous, but our winters are so short, they're not long without
leaves. I like the variegated lacecap hydrangeas for foliage as
well as floral interest. Mature height is in the 4-foot range.
</P>
<P>
   Giant liriope is about the easiest evergreen out there. It takes
sun or shade. This big form of liriope so often used to border beds
or paths has a nice form. There is a variegated variety, too.
Summer flowers are lavender. Mature height is 2 1/2 to 3 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a year-old hydrangea that will not grow or bloom. The
tips of the leaves are brown. What must I do?
</P>
<P>
   A: This was a tough year for all plants, especially newly
planted ones. The drought slowed or stopped growth. Hydrangeas
required frequent watering during the wretched summer months just
to stay alive, then they got too much with 10-inch rains. Such
moisture fluctuations and other environmental extremes will cause
leaf margins to brown.
</P>
<P>
   Mulch your hydrangea for the winter. It will lose its leaves
during the cool weather, but do not prune until after it flowers
next May.
</P>
<P>
   Your shrub will do best in a well-draining, organically enriched
soil. If your soil lacks organic matter, you can use compost as a
mulch to gradually improve conditions. Replenish as needed. You can
give the shrub a slow-release, balanced fertilizer in early spring.
Shrubs that are healthy and growing well in an organically enriched
soil will require little or no supplemental fertilization.
</P>
<P>
   Keep soil moist but not soggy. Pay special attention to watering
during the summer. Again, mulch will help by conserving soil
moisture and keeping roots warm in winter and cooler in summer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We would like to know when to prune our Confederate rose.
</P>
<P>
   A: I would prune it in early spring, after danger of frost.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do I plant my daffodil bulbs?
</P>
<P>
   A: Plant daffodils in late October-December in well-draining
beds of loose soil enriched with humus. Sun or partial sun is best.
Place one tablespoon of bone meal (or superphosphate if squirrels
dig in your beds) in each bulb hole, add a little soil or an inch
layer of sand, then set the bulb on the sand and cover with soil.
There should be about 2 inches of soil above the shoulder of the
bulb. Fertilize with superphosphate or bone meal when the foliage
pops through the soil and following the bloom period. Water in
well.
</P>

REJECTED BY VOTERS, OUTGOING LEGISLATORS STILL COUNT IN VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Several Republican House members rejected by the
voters in the November elections have said they will cast their
votes with a clean conscience on whether to impeach President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Their pronouncements, however, are tempered by the complications
of their status as lame-ducks: Some may favor impeachment even
though their earlier support of Clinton's removal may have been a
factor in their rejection by their constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Their situation recalls a question often taken up in civics
classes: Who are these representatives representing? Their own
conscience? Their district? Only those members of their district
who supported them?
</P>
<P>
   Before the November elections ``there was the nagging concern''
among the representatives ``that you would get fired if you got too
far away from your constituents,'' said John R. Hibbing, political
science professor at the University of Georgia. After the
elections, ``everything changes because now you've been fired.''
</P>
<P>
   These departing Republicans are among 38 lame-duck House members
who are not returning to office in January for a variety of
reasons. And while these House members feel there is nothing wrong
with deciding the fate of the president after the voters have
spoken, others said it raises an ethical red flag.
</P>
<P>
   Deciding whether or not Clinton's conduct in the Monica S.
Lewinsky affair rises to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors
is a tricky question that requires ``profound personal judgment,''
said Bruce Ackerman, professor of constitutional law at Yale
University, who testified before the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a clear-cut question, which is exactly why it is
profoundly illegitimate for people who have been repudiated by the
electorate to make the deciding judgment on Clinton's fate, which
is what it might amount to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the mind of Representative Vince Snowbarger, Republican
of Kansas, what the voters say is neither clear nor decisive for
him. When he became one of the first House members to call on
Clinton to resign, for instance, public opinion was mixed and calls
coming into his office now are evenly split.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this figures in some subtle way, but ultimately I'm the
one who has to live with the consequences of the vote,'' he said.
``I have to uphold my responsibility. Congress will be in real
trouble in determining what's right and wrong by seeing what the
polls are rather than by looking at the law and the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote is expected to be close.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show six in 10 Americans oppose impeachment while support
for the president's removal from office is growing, mostly among
moderate House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Political scientists say the question of whether a
representative is a trustee of the public will or simply a vehicle
for its expression is a question all members routinely grapple
with, especially on votes where they part ways with popular
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   House members are supposed to more closely reflect public
opinion, which makes itself felt at election time every two years,
noted Charles S. Bullock III, professor of political science at the
University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, which was originally elected not by the populace but
by state legislatures, is supposed to be stocked with people who
can more easily take the best interests of the country into account
because they only have to worry about reelection every six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House was supposed to be very sensitive to public opinion,
while as someone once said, the Senate is supposed to be the saucer
that cooled the cup of tea,'' said Hibbing.
</P>
<P>
   That someone was George Washington. Hibbing added that the
impeachment proceedings may see a reversal of those roles.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Republicans who were voted out of office but who are
expected to vote to impeach the president are Representative Mike
Pappas, Republican of New Jersey, who lost his reelection bid in
part because Democrats blasted him for singing, ``Twinkle, twinkle,
Kenneth Starr, now we see how brave you are,'' on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Jon D. Fox of Pennsylvania also supported
impeachment, which ``had a lot to do with why he lost,'' said press
secretary Tony Swanick.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Rick White of Washington was rejected from office when
his opponent, Jay Inslee, became the first Democrat in the nation
to run pro-Clinton, anti-impeachment ads.
</P>
<P>
   These Republicans are among the lame-duck members working to
fullfill their last major political obligation. They were evicted
from their Capitol Hill offices by House rules earlier this month
and are working out of a basement room in the Rayburn House office
building that also serves as a banquet room.
</P>
<P>
   There are cubicles equipped with voice mail, access to a
computer, fax and phone, but no separate quarters for these members
as they sort through the most weighty vote of their careers.

   Here are 10 terrific holiday gift ideas for the traveler:
</P>
<P>
   _ Fill a stocking or a shoe box with practical accessories _
disposable camera, folding rain poncho, crush-proof hat,
travel-size toiletries, batteries, hard-shell eyeglasses case, tiny
flashlight, compact umbrella, pocketknife, travel alarm, insect
repellent and sunscreen, luggage tags, pocket translator,
pocket-size journal, roll of postcard stamps (but remember that
U.S. postage increases in 1999).
</P>
<P>
   _ In conjunction with Cirrus Air Technologies, developer of the
popular EarPlanes, Travel Smart now offers FootPlanes, therapeutic
socks designed to relieve leg discomfort due to swelling
experienced by many air travelers. A special knit gently massages
legs to improve circulation as you flex your ankle. FootPlanes come
in several men's and women's sizes; cost is $16.99. Disposable
EarPlanes help avoid ear discomfort aloft and are available for
about $5. Many specialty and department stores stock the products,
or call 800-327-6151 or access www.earplanes.com to learn more.
Other innovative Travel Smart products include a padded organizer
pouch, outdoor field organizer and padded notebook organizer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ever forgotten to retrieve a credit card from a hotel clerk or
restaurant cashier? An unusual gift for the security-conscious
traveler is Kopel's Beeping Wallet, whichbeeps every 20 seconds
while a credit card is out of its usual place. Inside each wallet
is a replaceable watch battery with a three-year warranty; a
microchip triggers the beeps. In look, size and price ($20-$35,
depending on which of 10 styles preferred), these are the same as
traditional wallets. They're available at many stores or can be
ordered by calling 800-988-6255 or by looking on the Internet at
www.beepingwallet.com.
</P>
<P>
   _ From the urban backpack to the hard-sided trunk, durable
luggage is on any traveler's holiday wish list. Wheeled bags are
the way to go: Check out the Voyager ($124.95) from JanSport; this
handsome and rugged duffel bag boasts wheels, a hard bottom and
7,700 cubic inches of space and weighs less than 6 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether they face an interminable wait at an airport or a
cross-country ride in the back seat of the parents' sedan, youthful
travelers _ and adults who never grow old _ will appreciate the
gift of a small electronic game. Our favorite is the new hand-held
Monopoly Game ($24.99) by Hasbro. It's the same
wheeling-and-dealing game you remember as a kid, only better thanks
to interactive, talking opponents. Other Hasbro hand-helds include
Candyland ($19.99), Battleship ($14.99) and Yahtzee ($13.99). They
are available at many retail outlets.
</P>
<P>
   _ The serious trekker and the vacation walker will relish a
walking stick or a compass, and these handy items come in a variety
of style and prices.
</P>
<P>
   _ Binoculars are useful on almost any trip. Think small and
portable, unless you're buying for a serious birder. We like the
Lightweight Ruby Travel Binoculars from Travelsmith. Look at the
new 6x16 version; it'slightweight, will fit in your pocket and
costs $79. Call 800-950-1600 or access www.travelsmith.com.
</P>
<P>
   _ The quality, depth and practical value of magazines geared to
the traveler have grown in recent years. Most subscriptions are
easily affordable, and they make gifts that last all year. Among
magazines to consider: Travel Holiday (303-603-1464), Conde Nast
Traveler (800-777-0700), Travel &AMP; Leisure (800-888-8728), National
Geographic Traveler (800-647-5463), Business Traveler International
(800-726-1243), Arthur Frommer's Budget Travel Magazine
(800-829-9121), Best Fares Travel Discount Magazine (800-880-1234),
Islands (800-284-7958), Trips (510-834-3433), Porthole
(800-776-7678) and Cruise Travel (P. O. Box 342, Mt. Morris,
Illinois 61054-0342).
</P>
<P>
   _ Automobile-club membership is another valuable resource for
frequent travelers. In addition to dispensing travel planning
information, many such clubs offer discounts at hotels, restaurants
and attractions. Best of all, most clubs provide emergency road
service, which makes this gift particularly attractive. Look at
AAA, Allstate Travel Club and Montgomery Ward Auto Club.
</P>
<P>
   _ While you can't sell your frequent-flyer miles, many airlines
allow you to make a gift of them. The recipient must be enrolled in
the program as well; contact individual airline programs for
details. Consider, too, that some airlines, travel agencies and
other travel-service providers will issue gift certificates in
varying denominations. And for that special senior in your life,
you may want to splurge and purchase a coupon book (usually good
for four or eight flights) that allows travel at bargain prices.
Consult airlines or a travel agent.

PARTISAN DRAMA WILL LACK HEROES, SCHOLARS AGREE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whatever its outcome, the intensely partisan impeachment process
unfolding in Washington doesn't offer a very appealing snapshot of
American politics at the end of the 20th Century. And historians
say the picture is unlikely to improve with age.
</P>
<P>
   Some maintain that President Clinton will go down as a
bottom-rung leader, a victim of his own failings who dragged the
Oval Office down with him. Others argue that congressional
Republicans will be cast as the villains, as die-hard ideologues
who fueled voter cynicism and ultimately hurt their own party.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the political and cultural scholars interviewed
Tuesday agreed on this much, however: None of the principals seem
likely to emerge with enhanced personal reputations or as having
created a lasting, positive legacy for the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the one thing, sadly, that I think there's agreement
on,'' said Doris Kearns Goodwin, a Pulitzer Prize-winning
historian. ``It's hard to see how anyone in this sad tale is going
to come out looking well.''
</P>
<P>
   All of those interviewed this week, as the full House of
Representatives prepared for its own entry into the history books,
emphasized the difficulty of forecasting how current events will be
depicted in the future. Moreover, they stressed that pivotal scenes
of the impeachment drama _ like the final House vote or how the
Senate responds _ still have not been written, and will prove
critical to any eventual assessment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the historians said many major conclusions, some obvious
and others more subtle, already appear clear even without the
perspective of hindsight.
</P>
<P>
   They agreed, for example, that the partisanship exhibited during
the impeachment debate will go down as among the most fervent,
rancorous, and personal in modern times. Nearly all said the GOP
has been the more rigid and ideological party, but they added that
the Democrats' nearly unwavering unity also has demonstrated the
magnetic power of party allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   Such partisan orthodoxy is particularly striking, several
political scientists said, as it comes against the backdrop of
steadily waning party affiliation among American voters. ``It will
certainly be seen, I think, as yet another key bit of evidence of
the disconnect between the people and those they send to Washington
to represent them,'' said Irwin Hargrove, a political historian at
Vanderbilt University.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars on both sides of the ideological divide _ those who
argued that the impeachment effort was wrong-headed and those who
said Clinton had brought it on himself _ alike underscored the
harsh personal edge to the Republican thrusts against the
president. The historians believe that as events are unsorted by
scholars in future years, two principal reasons will be cited for
such emotional rancor in a debate that should, in theory, be
grounded in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I believe it's genuine that the majority of
Republicans. . .take family values and personal values extremely
seriously,'' said Alfred Rubin, a professor of international law at
the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. ``So
I think they're genuinely offended, and it shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Sketching on a far bigger canvas, those interviewed said the
animosity between the Republicans and the president will almost
surely be viewed as the natural tensions that accompany the turning
from one chapter of US history to the next. In this case, Clinton
stands for the generational transition from the 1960s, while the
GOP conservatives bristle at what they view as an era of
ever-loosening moral standards _ a trend the president epitomizes,
in their view.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the disdain people have for Clinton is a disdain for
the 1960s, so much of what we're seeing is a backlash,'' said
Douglas Brinkley, director of the Eisenhower Center for American
Studies at New Orleans University. ``I think quite a lot will be
written in the history books about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Robert Dallek, a history professor at Boston University
and a biographer of Lyndon Baynes Johnson: ``This is another round
in the nation's culture wars. The Republicans are incensed because
they essentially see Clinton ... as the embodiment of the
counterculture's thumbing of its nose at accepted wisdoms and
institutions of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Several academics said the cavernous split between the two
parties _ and divisiveness of the impeachment drive _ also might be
explained partly by a coincidence of history: that Clinton moved
into the Oval Office just as the Soviet empire fell. The presence
of an overarching national enemy or goal, the historians said, had
long mitigated differences and tensions between the Republicans and
the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Cold War were still on, we wouldn't have this crisis;
I'm certain that's how this will be seen,'' said Dallek.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the Republicans ultimately succeed in ousting
Clinton, they already have ensured some important, unflattering
opening paragraphs about him in history books. Similarly, they have
already deprived him of what he hoped would be an essential part of
his legacy: that of a skilled politician who opened a ``third way''
for his party, a Democratic center that would outlast him and for
which he would receive enduring credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's going to run for office ... saying he's a Clinton
Democrat, a new Democrat,'' said Brinkley. Even though he has
presided over a booming economy and ushered in significant changes
like welfare reform, Brinkley added, ``the bottom line is that
he'll be known as a semi-amiable rake who will rate near the bottom
of American presidents of this century.''
</P>
<P>
   Though most of the historians agreed Clinton's personal behavior
would inevitably taint his legacy, many said he would get
considerable credit in areas such as civil rights and the economy.
Some also flatly blamed the Republicans for precipitating a
constitutional crisis, and predicted future scholars would
emphasize that aspect when they chronicled proceedings in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think history will record this as a very strange episode,
very curious,'' said James McGregor Burns, the presidential
historian and Williams College professor. ``It will be judged, not
exactly as an effort to defeat or violate a decision of the last
election, but ... as a very partisan act. ... The reasons, whether
moral, ideological, or political, are something historians will
explore for some time and at some length.''
</P>
<P>
   The profound discontent about Clinton's behavior, coupled with
the lopsided disapproval of the GOP impeachment drive, also appear
certain to increase cynicism about politics during a period when
most analysts believe it's already at a historic high.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to wonder where the bottom is and when we will reach
it,'' said Elmer Cornwell, an expert in presidential history at
Brown University. ``And you have to be concerned about whether we
will have a viable, vigorous democratic system left when we reach
the bottom.''

BOARD GAMES? NO DICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Board games line an entire wall of the Toys R Us store in
Dorchester, Mass., but they draw so few customers at any given time
that young visitors could hold a tricycle race down the aisle
without much risk of hitting anybody.
</P>
<P>
   Someone would surely get hurt in the two adjoining rows of
games, though. They're filled with Christmas shoppers snapping up
cartridges for their Game Boys and PlayStations, jamming their
carts with electronic gadgets and computer games.
</P>
<P>
   Those scenes are repeated every day in toy stores across
America, and they provide far more than just a snapshot of the
nation's technological revolution. They mark the little-noted
closing of an era, the irreversible fading of a Norman Rockwell
scene in which mom and dad sit around the kitchen table with their
kids on a rainy Sunday afternoon, moving pieces and chatting
happily away.
</P>
<P>
   And, as dice rapidly give way to mice, analysts say the trend
simultaneously reflects and accelerates profound changes in our
country's culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt, we're seeing the end of the board game as we
all grew up to know it . . . (it) was part of family life for many,
many generations,'' said Michael Brody, a child psychiatrist based
in Washington, D.C., who studies the role of games in behavior and
development.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effects are unfortunate,'' added Brody. While noting that
other influences in children's lives also play integral parts in
their upbringing, he listed several areas in which he was troubled
by the move toward less personal contact in game-playing: ``the
acceleration of the disintegration of the family unit, the
lessening of parents' influence, and the loss of socialization
benefits that came with board games and the interaction that was
required to play them.''
</P>
<P>
   Other specialists in child and social development said too
little research has been done on the effect on such skills as
conversation, dealing with competition with a sibling, or abiding
by rules to make judgments as pessimistic or conclusive as Brody's.
Some said, for instance, that another reason for the waning
popularity of board games is an increase in after-school sports
activities, which also teach competitive and social skills. Others
argued that children are participating in different, but not
necessarily worse, interactions when they play computer games with
each other or even trade e-mail on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Still, nearly all those interviewed agreed the steady increase
in the use of computer games, particularly ones kids play on their
own, fuels a fundamental societal shift away from an emphasis on
community-based values and behaviors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of a bigger picture of what I call the
post-modern family,''' said David Elkind, the author of ``Ties That
Stress: The New Family Ambivalence'' and a child psychologist at
Tufts University. ``People used to worry about socialization; now
they worry about self-esteem.''
</P>
<P>
   The specialists and consumers also agreed, and lamented, that
the trend away from board games is a manifestation of the growth of
two-earner families, more divorce, more day care, more movement
among jobs and cities, and other factors that can place strains on
family and community ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no more sitting around after dinner with everybody,
family and friends, around the game board. That's the crux of the
whole thing,'' Chris Ireland, a fire-alarm technician, said as he
entered the Toys R Us store in Dorchester. ``My wife and I both
work, so who has time for it?''
</P>
<P>
   Even if they did have time, it's not at all certain how many
eager young players most parents could corral, or for how long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get bored with board games,'' said Leila Duncan, a
10-year-old whose sentiments seem to typify many of her generation.
``I mean, with Monopoly and the other games, it's just luck and all
you can do is buy property and stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   With computer and video games, on the other hand, ``It's more
fun and more interesting because you can do more than one thing at
once. They're more interactive and, really, you can play without
somebody else at the other end. They're just better.''
</P>
<P>
   While the move from kitchen table to computer desk is clear,
precise statistics on toy sales are hard to come by.
</P>
<P>
   Rhode Island-based Hasbro Inc., which owns nearly all the major
brands of board games, considers such figures proprietary and will
not reveal even generic information. The same is true of major US
marketers Toys R Us and Kay-Bee Toys.
</P>
<P>
   But NPD Group, a research company in Port Washington, N.Y., that
tracks the toy industry, estimates retail sales of board games have
fallen from about $450 million in January through September of
1996, to $430 million during the same period of 1997, to $380
million this year.
</P>
<P>
   The video game industry, meanwhile, ``has been going through the
roof,'' said Mary Ann Porreca, an NPD official. She said retail
sales of hand-held and stationary video and computer games have
soared from $1.6 billion to $2.2 billion to nearly $3 billion in
the January-September periods of 1996 through 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to continue this way for the foreseeable future . .
. because people don't play family games anymore.,'' she added.
``You just don't hear about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, no board game has taken off and maintained a big
audience since Trivial Pursuit and Pictionary were introduced in
the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, even as its high-tech offerings proliferate, Hasbro's
marketing indicates its concern about the future of its board
games. It has been promoting Scrabble extensively as a learning
device in schools, for example, and it has been running television
commercials this holiday season advocating once-a-week ``family
game nights.''
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Annicelli, the associate editor of Playthings Magazine, a
toy-trade publication, said board games today are played
overwhelmingly by children too young for computers, or just getting
started on them, and by adults who were brought up without the
faster-moving, multi-graphic new technology. Nearly everyone
in-between, he said, spends the bulk of their gaming hours with
hand-held units, CD-roms, and in cyberspace _ sometimes playing
video versions of longtime board favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we're working against,'' said John Williams, the
executive director of the National Scrabble Association. ``They
might not like to hear it, but I've told Hasbro and everybody else
that 25 years from now, many people will only be introduced to
Scrabble on-line and not at the board at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its other implications, the seemingly inexorable
dominance of computers in leisure activities struck some analysts,
particularly those most comfortable with the new technologies, as a
phenomenon with considerable benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Jenkins, director of the comparative media studies program
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, argued there is a
flip side to kids being deprived of socialization when they use
one-person games or communicate on the Internet. For the many
children whose parents aren't home, who don't know their neighbors,
or whose outside activities are restricted for safety reasons, he
said, computer games offer unprecedented opportunities for
entertainment, learning, and establishing relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Jenkins agreed the extraordinary popularity of
computer games is abetted by and reflects fundamental changes in
family and social structure. He said people are ``moving away from
playing games in immediate environments and toward playing games in
environments not bound by the vagaries of geography.''
</P>
<P>
   Some wondered whether the weekly family games of Parcheesi of
yore have been romanticized over the decades. Almost all, however,
recalled their time at the game board fondly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too bad, I guess,'' sighed Veronica Wall, the mother of
boys ages 3 and 6. ``They're really just interested mainly in the
video games.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's no going back,'' Wall added as she put a Land
Before Time computer game into her shopping cart at the Dorchester
toy store. ``We're going into a new era.''

   TAKE-BOS  
 (a and s coding)  
 BOSTON: ... help, either.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I think the Boston press is more negative and critical than
any I've ever seen,'' said Gifford, a friend of Kraft's. But, he
conceded, ``We went too far with others before going to (Mayor
Menino and the community). There were great tactical mistakes made
on the part of people involved, including me.''
</P>
<P>
   One fact stands as a metaphor for just how badly the South
Boston stadium effort was bungled: Menino says he first learned of
the plan when he heard some business leaders had met with Kraft at
BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was taken aback by it,'' said Menino. ``I just don't think
he (Robert Kraft) was listening. I don't think he was flexible. And
he just didn't do his homework'' in the community.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Kraft said Weld had assured them he would take care of
all the political spadework necessary to sell the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Weld basically led us to believe Tom Menino, as an
elected official, was his responsibility,'' the younger Kraft
recalled. ``He said, `You guys work on putting a plan together. I
will deal with the mayor.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But that clearly didn't happen. Tocco says the administration
was still forming its plan when the word broke, catching everyone
off guard. The news helped galvanize neighborhood opposition. A
convention center, not a stadium, was Menino's priority. Moreover,
with South Boston as riled as it had been about anything since
busing, and his own reelection approaching, the mayor was hardly
eager to go to bat for Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   But there was another reason as well, according to several
well-placed sources. ``When Kraft didn't get everything he wanted
(from Menino) in five minutes, he goes around town saying that
`this guy's elevator doesn't go all the way to the top floor,' ''
one source said. ``That took about one minute to get back to
Menino. That, as much as any other thing, I believe was responsible
for Menino not lifting a finger in South Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Kraft strongly denies this, saying, ``I've only heard
my father speak about the mayor in respectful tones. But when it
came to the stadium situation it was always curious why he didn't
want a privately funded stadium in his city.''
</P>
<P>
   But Menino wasn't the only one growing exasperated with Kraft.
Inside the administration, some of Weld's top aides, who already
felt the governor was expending too much political capital trying
to help Kraft, were put off by the owner's demanding ways. When he
called, he expected Weld to take his calls. And when the governor
didn't, Kraft treated staffers brusquely.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought he should be dealing with the governor directly,
and he made that clear to people on the governor's staff,'' said
Ray Howell, Weld's former director of communications and a close
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Administration sources say several top officials had
confrontations with Jonathan Kraft, whom they considered accusatory
and overbearing.
</P>
<P>
   At one meeting, Jonathan accused Transportation Secretary James
Kerasiotes of not having done enough to help. Kerasiotes, who was
overseeing $40 million in infrastructure and transit improvements
designed to help make Foxboro Stadium workable, bluntly challenged
him on what hadn't been done.
</P>
<P>
   When Kraft whipped out a cellular phone to call Patriots
business manager Andy Wasynczuk, Kerasiotes replied: ``What's the
matter, Jonathan, you need Andy to come up and hold your hand?''
Kerasiotes then walked out of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Administration and Finance Secretary Charles Baker
had a similar blowup, warning the younger Kraft to stop badmouthing
Weld. Baker declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all under tremendous pressure from the governor to try
to accommodate the needs of the team, and when we were told over
and over again that we weren't doing that, and that the governor
and the administration weren't following through, it got a little
hard to take,'' said Kerasiotes.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the Krafts understand the careful preparation and
attention it takes to get things done with the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for Kraft it was a whole new arena he had never been
involved in before,'' said Flaherty. ``He didn't know the players,
and he couldn't understand why everybody wasn't laying out the red
carpet for him because he had `saved the team.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Joyce, a Beacon Hill lobbyist who worked for Kraft during
the Megaplex discussions and parted with the owner on strained
terms, said Kraft made a common mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in Robert's case, he tried to deal with political
leaders like they were members of his board of directors,'' Joyce
said, adding that Kraft would have been more successful if he
accepted political advice. ``Robert wouldn't leave the room until
he had a commitment. . . . I have never asked for a commitment from
a government official. I have asked for consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   Admitted Jonathan Kraft: ``We are politically naive. But from
our perspective, if you're going to spend hundreds of millions of
dollars of your own money, you'd think they'd cut you a little
slack.''
</P>
<P>
   While Robert Kraft did deal successfully with Governor Rowland
in Connecticut, he grew to annoy Weld, who prided himself on his
imperturbability. Several sources said that after one Weld
fund-raiser, Kraft, uninvited, hopped into the governor's car and
began to unroll a set of stadium plans to explain them to Weld.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was typical of Kraft,'' said one source. ``He thought he
should be able to deal with Weld whenever he wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   Weld thought otherwise. Irritated by what he considered an
inappropriate intrusion, the governor made it clear he didn't have
time for Kraft, sources say. Weld says he can't recall the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft was clearly bitter. In February 1997, when US Rep. Joseph
Moakley finally talked him into abandoning his South Boston stadium
hopes, Moakley suggested a press conference with Kraft, Menino,
Weld, and himself.
</P>
<P>
   Moakley still remembers his response: ``He said, `No, I have
dealt with with all of those people before. I was misled, and I
don't want any of them there when I make my statement.' . . . He
was very upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Some administration officials insist that above all else, it was
the Krafts' personal style that impeded their efforts with top
decision-makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very simple,'' said one top-level official. ``There are
two reasons why this didn't get done. Reason Number One is that Tom
Menino hates Bob Kraft. Reason Number Two is that Tom Finneran
hates Bob Kraft.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite being stymied in South Boston, Kraft wasn't ready to
give up. Thus, the stadium struggle entered its third and final
phase, where Kraft's requests for state help collided squarely with
Finneran's insistence that state funds not be used to pay for land
for private businesses.
</P>
<P>
   When Finneran said in February of 1997 that building a
71,000-seat stadium in Foxborough would be ``the easiest deal in
the world,'' the Krafts were once again hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   But when Weld resigned in July of that year, Kraft lost his
principal ally in state government.
</P>
<P>
   Although Acting Governor Paul Cellucci pushed a Patriots plan,
several sources say that Cellucci was less willing to push a bill
for infrastructure improvements in Foxborough when he needed
Finneran to help approve campaign-year tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   While Cellucci introduced his own $50 million plan for road and
other improvements along Route 1 _ issued around the time Rhode
Island officials were also wooing the team with offers to pay about
half of stadium construction costs _ he made no efforts remotely
comparable to Rowland's in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at times a Foxborough deal seemed tantalizingly close. In
February, Senate President Thomas Birmingham negotiated what in
retrospect looks like a very good deal: For a net state cost of
$2.3 million a year over 20 years, Kraft would have built a new
$200 million stadium, and the state would have spent $72 million on
land and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   One Democratic legislator says that package, costing only about
$100,000 more a year than the deal Finneran had offered calling for
$52 million in infrastructure spending, would have passed if put to
a secret ballot. But Finneran refused to budge. Meanwhile, his
references to Kraft as ``a whining multi-millionaire'' and a
``fat-assed millionaire'' _ a comment Finneran says was directed at
Baltimore Ravens owner Art Modell _ only underscored speculation
about a personal grudge. According to that theory, Finneran was
determined to thwart Kraft because the owner's wife, Myra, was an
ally of Richard Voke, whom Finneran defeated to become speaker.
</P>
<P>
   But while Finneran pleads guilty to being an inner-city
``street-corner kid'' who sometimes ``fires back with a wise
comment,'' he denies any personal animus against Kraft, noting that
he maintained the same posture toward other private concerns in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran also claims that he was willing to work a fair deal all
along, but he resolutely refuses to go along with the state
acquiring land for a private enterprise, saying the precedent is
just too dangerous _ even if it means losing Boston's professional
sports teams.
</P>
<P>
   Stripped down, the fundamentally different world views of
Finneran and the Krafts are best described this way: Finneran says
that the deal the House proposed was the most generous subsidy
package the state has ever offered a single private concern. But
Jonathan Kraft notes that the package was one of the least generous
offered any NFL owner during the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was that irreconcilable difference that made the
Krafts decide to look elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran said he has only two real regrets. One is making his
``whining multi-millionaire'' jibe. The other, he said, was in
believing Kraft really wanted to keep the team in Massachusetts in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is about nothing but money,'' said Finneran. ``Expressions
of loyalty to Massachusetts, affection for the fans . . . is
propaganda.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the basement of BankBoston, where Jonathan Kraft sits in
a stadium model that now mocks the family's failed hopes for a new
facility in Massachusetts, the perspective is very different:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm personally disappointed because I really wanted this to
happen for my dad _ in Massachusetts. I personally feel like I
failed and I didn't get it done. But I wonder what else we could
have done. I wonder . . .''

ANNUAL CHRISTMAS DANCE SHOW AN ACT OF FAITH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He got the dancing bug early in life, influenced by his artistic
parents, both of whom were opera singers. When he was as young as
5, the Rev. Robert VerEecke was a big fan of swing dancing.
</P>
<P>
   But back then, in the late 1950s, dancing ``wasn't considered
manly enough,'' for boys, said VerEecke, a Jesuit priest and pastor
of St. Ignatius Loyola parish on the campus of Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   So VerEecke did not take his first ballet class until he was 21
and a young seminarian preparing for the priesthood. ``It was an
epiphany,'' VerEecke said. His Jesuit superiors encouraged the
talented young dancer and, as a result, VerEecke has woven his
passion into his ministry.
</P>
<P>
   This is a busy time for VerEecke because it is when his most
ambitious artistic work is unveiled on stage. For the past 18
years, ``A Dancer's Christmas'' has drawn rave reviews from
audiences and critics alike as a beautiful spiritual alternative to
more secular Christmas shows.
</P>
<P>
   The show, being performed this weekend and next at BC's Robsham
Theater Arts Complex, does not garner anywhere near the kind of
attention that the ``Nutcracker'' or other Christmas works do, but
it draws a loyal following and attracts top dancers.
</P>
<P>
   For VerEecke, who also is Jesuit-artist-in-residence at BC, ``A
Dancer's Christmas'' is as much a labor of love as it is an
artistic endeavor. It is, he makes clear, a serious religious work
that uses music and dance to tell the Nativity story.
</P>
<P>
   But VerEecke also wanted to make it fun, which is why the final
act features contemporary and familiar Christmas carols. This year
VerEecke gave the opening act a new twist. He retells the Nativity
story but from the perspective of an older Mary recalling the life
and death of her son.
</P>
<P>
   And the first act juxtaposes on the same stage the tableau of
Jesus's birth _ Mary and the young baby surrounded by angels and
shepherds _ with that of his death _ Mary holding her son's corpse
after it has been taken from the cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christmas is not just the story of the birth of this baby,''
said VerEecke in an interview over lunch at BC recently. ``It's
about this tremendous mystery of birth leading to death and then
resurrection. It's all connected and I wanted to try to make that
come across.''
</P>
<P>
   VerEecke debuted ``A Dancer's Christmas'' in 1980 with 10
dancers staging one performance in a chapel on campus in front of
about 50 people. The show has evolved into a staple of the
Christmas season for thousands of people. VerEecke says the show
draws many people who attend year after year.
</P>
<P>
   The show also features some of the most talented performers in
the dance world. Andrew LeBeau, of the famous Peter Taylor Dance
Company in New York, is performing in ``A Dancer's Christmas'' for
the third time.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to dance in it when he was a student at the Boston
Conservatory of Music but could not because of commitments to other
shows. ``But the first time I could do it back in 1994 I fell in
love with it,'' says LeBeau, 31, who appears in ``A Dancer's
Christmas'' courtesy of Paul Taylor. ``I never was really a
particularly religious person. So for me, at a time when people are
thinking about religion, it helps make the season complete for me.
It's a foot in the door. And it's a beautiful story.''
</P>
<P>
   VerEecke notes that the idea of a Jesuit working as a dance
choreographer is perfectly natural given the historical role the
order has played in promoting dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 16th and 17th century Europe dance was a required part of
the curriculum in Jesuit universities,'' VerEecke said. ``Some of
the early dance manuscripts we have were written by Jesuits. The
Jesuits very much believe in using whatever is necessary or popular
to communicate the Gospel story.''
</P>
<P>
   At St. Ignatius, VerEecke has made music an integral part of the
church, which has helped boost the parish's popularity. VerEecke
would like to see dance incorporated into the Liturgy, something,
he says, the Roman Catholic Church views with suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our tradition there seems to have been this split between
the body and the spirit,'' he says. ``But prayer and worship
doesn't just go on in your head. Jesus himself, as a good Jewish
person, must have danced as part of his religious celebrations.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``A Dancer's Christmas'' VerEecke hopes to convey the
possibility of triggering a spiritual response through dance. ``I
hope they are moved by the beauty of the dancing and the singing
and that it may provide some deeper spiritual insight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>

Religion Notes
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --The religious right has begun weighing in on President
Clinton's impeachment process. Last week, the Christian Coalition
brought more than 250,000 petitions to Congress urging lawmakers to
remove Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Tate, executive director of the coalition, told reporters
Thursday that the petitions ``allowed citizens to address this most
important issue in a timely way.''
</P>
<P>
   Tate, a strong supporter of Clinton's ouster, said the president
should be forced out of office because Tate believes he perjured
himself.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition began circulating the petition in October. Copies
were sent to every member of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   --A group of evangelical Christian scholars recently passed a
resolution reasserting their belief that the Bible ``teaches that
homosexual conduct is always an abomination.''
</P>
<P>
   But the group denounced the national media for
``unsubstantiated, untruthful and hateful accusations'' about
evangelical Christians following the murder of gay student Matthew
Shepard in Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We abhor the terrible sin of doing intentional physical harm
to another human being for no reason other than hate,'' the
Evangelical Theological Society said in a statement passed last
month during the society's meeting in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   But, the statement added, ``We equally abhor using the rhetoric
of hate to prejudice the power of civil government against the open
and complete proclamation of moral standards revealed in God's Holy
Word _ including both God's love for sinners as well as his
judgment of sin.''

HAVE HOLIDAY COOKS STUCK A FORK IN TURKEY TRADITION?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sitting here on high center between Thanksgiving turkey and
Christmas goose, I can't help but wonder how much longer we can
expect to enjoy those holiday meals.
</P>
<P>
   Convenience and common sense have muscled their way into our
celebrations. Suddenly, people are thinking that because they don't
know how to cook a goose, or because turkey can take from daylight
to dusk to prepare and then end up drier than dust, we shouldn't
use them as our festive centerpieces anymore. We need change.
</P>
<P>
   I fear it is too late to save the Christmas goose. I really
don't know anyone who has goose for Christmas. I watched the ``Two
Fat Ladies'' cook one on PBS one time, but gastronomically
speaking, I've never had a goose.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a lot of families savor turkey twice each year: once on
Thanksgiving, again on Christmas. That would be acceptable, but the
holidays are too close together. We can't space them out more,
because we have to start shopping for Christmas the day after
Thanksgiving. It's the national pastime.
</P>
<P>
   It's too much turkey, but without the turkey I wouldn't get the
oyster dressing I enjoy. There is, I am relatively certain, a
regulation that requires oyster dressing be made only with roasted
turkey. And if you have oyster dressing for one holiday, you must
have corn bread dressing for the other.
</P>
<P>
   The law is the law.
</P>
<P>
   Some exceptions have been made for deep-fried turkey and
turducken.
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies part of our problem. Look at what we're doing
to a simple turkey just to make it seem like something else: Place
it on a hook and lower it into boiling peanut oil.
</P>
<P>
   It tastes great, but you could burn down the neighborhood if you
accidentally spilled all that grease. Even if you don't spill it,
where are you going to dump it? You don't want to end up as the
Exxon Valdez of your cul-de-sac.
</P>
<P>
   And turduckens ... they are wonderful, as well. I had my first
this season, and it was certainly different. A chicken stuffed in a
duck, stuffed in a turkey; all boned. It made the carving a cinch.
</P>
<P>
   It did not, however, work well with white bread and mayonnaise
for after-dinner sandwiches. Without the sandwich, there is no need
to have the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   I wrote about the turduckens a while back, asserting that the
triple-stuffed birds migrated here from Louisiana about 10 years
ago. I was wrong. Frank Heick, a staffer at ``The Philadelphia
Daily News,'' informed me that George Washington had a similar dish
at Mount Vernon. Washington was not Cajun.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he didn't get to be the father of our country by
being ordinary, either. His dish was special: It was a turkey
stuffed with a duck, stuffed with a capon, stuffed with a squab,
stuffed with a quail. All were boned.
</P>
<P>
   The dish was placed in a large cube of partially baked pastry
along with 7 pounds of butter and cooked all day.
</P>
<P>
   George was apparently not health-conscious.
</P>
<P>
   I have since found that this kind of dish went on well before
Washington. A friend sent me several recipes for stuffed camel _ a
meal often prepared by Bedouins for a wedding feast.
</P>
<P>
   One of the recipes called for one medium camel, one lamb
(large), 20 whole chickens (medium), 60 eggs, and assorted measures
of rice, pine nuts, almonds, pistachio nuts and 110 gallons of
water. Salt and pepper to taste.
</P>
<P>
   If we can't cook our goose, I doubt we'll do a camel, but we are
beginning to look at bison, wild boar, venison and pheasant as
alternatives. GoodHeart Brand Specialty Meats in San Antonio said
it had ``zero'' requests for turkey this year. Instead, the gourmet
game meat company shipped out capons, quail and pheasant.
</P>
<P>
   It's all fine enough, but capons aren't prepared much
differently from turkeys. Quail and pheasant are wonderful, but the
meat is delicate and can be overcooked in a flash.
</P>
<P>
   Vegetarians are already striking out against meat at Christmas
with what they call ``Tofurkey,'' a seasoned, stuffed roast made of
tofu. You can find the nearest retail outlet by calling 1 (888)
TOFURKY. A percentage from the sale of each Tofurkey goes to
support the efforts of ``The Farm Sanctuary's Turkey Adoption
Program.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not making this up.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we should just go along with Calvin Trillin, the
misguided New York-based writer who mistakenly promotes Kansas City
barbecue over all others. He says spaghetti carbonara should be the
ideal Thanksgiving meal. He fantasizes that the Pilgrims were
served the pasta dish by the Indians, who picked up the recipe from
Christopher Columbus, whom they called ``the big Italian.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, spaghetti would be easier, and the kids would like
it. It does not, however, slice very easily nor make good
sandwiches. Nor does it go well with oyster dressing.

CHEAP PRICES DRAW SNOWBIRDS TO SOUTH TEXAS

   SAN BENITO, Texas _ A warm south wind ruffled towering palm
trees as Bart and Ann Vanderlans sat on the shady side of their new
travel trailer. The brutal Canadian winters and their country's
lingering currency crisis were distant memories as they quickly
settled into retirement life at the sprawling, 1,515-space Fun N
Sun &UR;  &LR; R.V. Resort.
</P>
<P>
   Bart Vanderlans, 60, who retired in September after 22 years as
a Toronto bus driver, and his wife selected the Rio Grande Valley
over Florida for their first extended winter vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like the weather, we like the prices, we like the people.
The people in the stores are awfully friendly,'' 56-year-old Ann
Vanderlans observed as she sat in a lawn chair in shorts and a
sleeveless top. ``This beats the snow. I'll take it any time.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a sentiment tourism officials in the Valley _ and in the
state capital _ are hoping will translate into more Canadian
tourists. Even though the Canadian dollar has sunk to historic lows
_ now worth just 65 cents in this country _ Texas last year saw a
modest 3 percent rise in Canadian visitors.
</P>
<P>
   To lure more Canadians this winter, the Texas Department of
Economic Development launched its first international promotion in
October. The department held news conferences in major Canadian
cities and is running ads on television and in six major regional
newspapers. It is also offering a free coupon book called
``Buckaroo Bucks.''
</P>
<P>
   For Texas, the benefits of increased tourism are considerable.
</P>
<P>
   In the Valley alone, an estimated 120,000 so-called Winter
Texans took up residence in more than 800 trailer parks and other
forms of housing during the winter of 1997. The visitors were
mostly Midwestern retirees from Illinois, Iowa, Michigan and
Minnesota; 7 percent were Canadians.
</P>
<P>
   Winter Texans have become a &UR;  &LR; bonanza to an impoverished border
region whose agricultural economy is periodically decimated by
droughts and freezes, and a commercial sector often flattened by
abrupt devaluations of the Mexican peso. But each fall, the Valley
can count on an infusion of law-abiding, affluent retirees who not
only fill cash registers but also swell the ranks of volunteers at
hospitals, schools and nonprofit agencies by the thousands.
</P>
<P>
   University researchers who survey and study the Winter Texans
estimate the retirees spent $319 million on food, rent, gas, cars,
homes and entertainment in the four-county Valley last year. A full
30 percent, or 36,000, said they had served as volunteers in the
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're expecting the Winter Texan season to be strong,
including the Canadians,'' predicts Cheryl La Berge, vice president
of the Harlingen Chamber of Commerce. ``If they go south, they have
to go somewhere, and the Valley is a very appealing destination.
Quite honestly, their dollar will go farther than most places in
the American South.''
</P>
<P>
   You won't get an argument from the Vanderlans or their Canadian
friend Jannie Van Schagen, who has spent the last seven winters at
Fun N Sun and invited the Vanderlans down for brief visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find Florida very commercial, and the Valley isn't. The
best way to put it is they're too stuck-up. You don't seem to fit
in particularly well there,'' Van Schagen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And one important thing _ it's cheaper here.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a state income tax, low rent and housing costs
compared to Arizona and Florida, bargain prices for fruits and
vegetables grown in Valley groves and fields, and the proximity to
shopping in Mexico all help reduce living expenses for retirees on
a fixed income.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Vern Vincent, who directs the Center for Tourism
Research at the University of Texas-Pan American at Edinburg, notes
that the number of Winter Texans has increased in the Valley an
average of 24 percent over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is phenomenal growth,'' Vincent said. ``We have no reason
to think it's going to be anything but continued growth. You've got
more retirees, and they have better health and more financial
resources than they've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Vincent said growth could only be stymied if Valley recreational
vehicle parks run out of space, noting that the average occupancy
was 97 percent and a fourth of the parks were completely full
during the last survey in February 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Another trend Vincent and fellow researchers found is that
Winter Texans are spreading out from the trailer parks, with a full
25 percent in 1997 either staying in motels, renting houses or
apartments, buying condominiums or staying with friends. That was a
10 percent increase from the previous survey in 1995, Vincent said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question about it, they contribute. They give far
more than they take away,'' Vincent said of the northern visitors.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, state tourism managers say they have been kept busy
answering Canadian responses to the advertising and coupon book
campaign launched in October. Texas Department of Economic
Development figures show 15 percent of some 509,000 Internet
requests for the Texas State Travel guide (between Oct. 1 and Nov.
5) were from Canadians, and Canadians made 62 percent of the 16,000
calls to the state's toll-free information line.
</P>
<P>
   And more than 15,000 Canadians were mailed the ``Buckaroo
Bucks'' coupon book, which provides discount rates at hotels and
motels, restaurants and state parks across Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Kimberley Baker, U.S. and Canada project coordinator at the
development agency, said the Canadian campaign is making its mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be effective, just because of the
response we've seen so far on our toll-free line and some of the
comments we're getting on the Web site,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A Canadian marketing firm, TravMark Group Inc., was hired three
years ago by state officials to help promote Texas tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Rosalyn Hunter, communications manager for the Toronto firm,
noted that 278,900 Canadian tourists of all kinds, including
retirees, came to Texas in 1997. That is second only to Mexico in
the number of international visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the diversity Texas offers is something great for
Canadians. There's so much in one state to see,'' Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many vacation options in Texas, whether you're a
senior wanting a long stay on the Gulf Coast or more adventurous
and want to go river-rafting in the Big Bend, or someone who wants
to do a big city and go to Houston and Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   The Canadians interviewed had seen Texas' advertising campaign
and called Austin for the travel guide and coupon book. But they
said they decided to winter in South Texas at the urging of friends
or acquaintances who had visited before.
</P>
<P>
   Benoit Beauregard, a 57-year-old retired schoolteacher from
Montreal, and his wife, Claudette, who is 56, arrived in the Valley
on Nov. 27 in their small motor home. They towed a compact car and
had a pair of bicycles on roof racks.
</P>
<P>
   They had never heard of Harlingen, but consulting the tour book,
they picked out the Sunshine RV park at random. ``I looked at the
name of the campground, and it was just a feeling,'' recalled
Claudette.
</P>
<P>
   After taking a quick look at the park, they decided to stay
until April. ``I saw the palm trees, and it was clean. So we
stopped here and stayed here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Beauregards have made monthlong visits to Key West and Key
Largo during previous winter trips, but last winter they happened
to meet a woman at a ski resort near their Montreal home who
extolled the charms and low prices of South Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said she had a lot of fun,'' Benoit said with a laugh as
he lay next to the resort's hot tub, ``so we are trying to have a
lot of fun, too.'' &QL;

   BANK-Y2K BUG &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The Year 2000 computer bug bit Bank One
Texas a little early. And it all happened because the bank was
trying to make sure that it would not have computer problems with
the new millennium. The bank confirmed this week that it had
accidentally mailed out notices to 2,013 Texas customers saying
they had bounced checks. The notices were generated because Bank
One wanted to make sure that its computers were Year 2000
compliant, meaning that they could recognize the difference between
1900 and 2000. The notices carried a post-2000 date. By DAN PILLER.

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Laurie Bloom's 8-year-old daughter wanted a new menorah for
Hanukkah, the Newton, Mass. mother made sure not to go anywhere
near the Mickey Mouse versions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just going a little too far for me,'' said Bloom.
Instead, her daughter chose a much more traditional _ and staid _
Hanukkah candelabrum made from pewter. ``It's beautiful and
definitely not kitschy,'' she said. ``No Mickey for us.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Jews around the world celebrate Hanukkah, Mickey and
other cash-ins are harder to avoid, as the festival has become a
merchandising bonanza.
</P>
<P>
   Although the holiday is not as religiously important as Yom
Kippur or Rosh Hashana, Jews worry that the meaning of Hanukkah is
falling victim to rampant commercialization surrounding Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   This year Disney has licensed not one but five different Mickey
menorahs _ not to mention three Winnie the Pooh designs, all
ranging in price from $70 to $90.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the Curious George musical water ball, which shows
the famed fictional primate lighting Hanukkah candles. Wind up the
ball and it plays the classic Hanukkah tune, ``Maoz Tsur,'' or
``Rock of Ages.'' Go to any of the 81 Starbucks coffee shops in New
England and find Hanukkah goodies, including a Hanukkah travel mug.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, Jews flock to stores, flip through catalogs,
and surf the Internet to stock up on gifts and decorations for the
eight-day festival of lights, which celebrates the victory of a
small band of Jews over a massive Greek army in the second century
B.C.
</P>
<P>
   This year, a California-based company is even offering Jews a
chance to order dog biscuits shaped like a dreidel, a four-sided
Hanukkah top. Drive down some streets and you'll see homes
decorated with outdoor blue and white Hanukkah lights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like we've made Hanukkah into the Jewish Christmas
with all the whistles and bells,'' said Ilene Springer, who lives
in Brookline and has two children. ``But Hanukkah isn't Christmas.
It's supposed to celebrate freedom of religion, not the freedom, it
seems to me, to go crazy at the mall.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, say it is hard to stay out of the mall,
especially when Jewish children see their Christian friends getting
Christmas gifts or writing wish lists to Santa Claus.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Hanukkah's importance in America has been inflated,
there is a growing backlash among some Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Temple Emanuel in Newton, for example, the largest Conservative
congregation in New England, is going against the tide and
deliberately downplaying the holiday by not scheduling any special
Hanukkah celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   And many parents are trying to tone down the materialism by
giving gifts to their children on only one night as opposed to all
eight nights, as other parents do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're tired of stuff,'' said Marla Choslovsky, who has two
children. ``My daughter's birthday was in October and she still
hasn't even opened all those gifts yet. She doesn't need more
stuff. So we're going to give her tickets to the ballet and our son
tickets to a hockey game.''
</P>
<P>
   Bloom not only gives her children only one gift, but makes sure
it's a Judaica item, such as a menorah or a yarmulke, the
traditional skullcap for men and boys. ``When other kids call them
up and say they got Nintendo, I want my kids to say they got a
menorah,'' Bloom says.
</P>
<P>
   Some families also are taking the money they would use to buy
presents and giving it to charity.
</P>
<P>
   Yosef I. Abramaowitz of Newton gives each of his two daughters a
dollar bill for each day of Hanukkah, to put in envelopes from
charities. Then, he tells them what the charities are about and
lets them decide where to donate the money.
</P>
<P>
   Even some Jews who are merchants acknowledge that Hanukkah may
have been overinflated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for business, but is it getting a little too much?''
said Avohom Levine, manager of the Israel Book Shop, a large
Judaica store in Brookline, Mass. ``Maybe. Ten years ago we maybe
sold 10 different kinds of dreidels. Now we have about 40. It is
the single biggest Jewish holiday in terms of gift giving.''
</P>
<P>
   Jewish religious leaders are split on the issue. Many decry what
they consider to be commercialism and pressure to keep up with the
Christmas rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a certain irony to what has happened with Hanukkah,''
said Rabbi Andrew Warmflash, spiritual director of Temple Emanuel
in in Newton. ``We celebrate the victory of the Maccabees and their
refusal to assimilate into the dominant Hellenistic culture. And
now we are sort of mimicking the dominant culture by making it this
big commercial enterprise. We're making Hanukkah exactly what it
was not intended to be.
</P>
<P>
   But other rabbis believe elevating Hanukkah into a major
celebration fits in with the message of the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're supposed to publicize the miracle of Hanukkah and how
the weak overcame the mighty,'' said Rabbi William Hamilton of
Congregation Kehillath Israel in Brookline. ``We don't light these
candelabras on the Boston Common or in front of the State House
because we're trying to get equal time with Christmas. We do that
to publicly proclaim that Jews have survived and preserved their
identity through the ages in spite of whatever odds they have
faced.''
</P>
<P>
   Levine notes that many of his customers are in interfaith
marriages and are buying Jewish gifts to ``make sure that their
kids do not forget about their tradition. This could be seen as a
good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Jonathan E. Kraus, spiritual leader of Beth El Temple
Center in Belmont, Mass., believes there should be a balance to
Hanukkah celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of trying to resist Hanukkah, perhaps we could make
sure that if it is going to be enlarged in scope that we observe it
in the right way, rather than succumbing to commercialization,''
Kraus said. ``Use it to emphasize the notion of charity and
justice. Use it as a time to reflect on ways we respond to the
pressures of assimilation.''

HOW THE KRAFTS' MASSACHUSETTS DREAM FIZZLED 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH AND TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Behind locked doors in the basement of BankBoston's
downtown headquarters, the suite of rooms sits like a secret vault
preserving dreams of what might have been.
</P>
<P>
   One enters over mahogany floors, walks along silk-hung walls,
and smells the faint hint of new leather club chairs. A sparkling
granite bar flanks one wall, a panel of large-screen TVs fills
another.
</P>
<P>
   But what draws the eye is this colorful sight: six rows of blue
stadium seats, ten per row, facing a huge blowup of a New England
Patriots game in which players are frozen in gridiron glory.
Overhead, stereo speakers pipe in the voice of Gil Santos doing
play-by-play as the crowd roars in the background.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Patriots owner Robert Kraft spent more than $1 million
to build this subterranean section to help sell clients on the club
seats for his proposed stadium in South Boston. During his doomed
quest, Kraft was host to a half-dozen community groups in the plush
suite, hoping he could bring opponents around to the advantages of
his stadium plan. Build it, and they will succumb, he seemed to
think.
</P>
<P>
   But with Tuesday's approval by the Connecticut General Assembly
of the deal to move the Patriots to Hartford, the mockup stands as
a mausoleum for Kraft's dream. Even now, with the South Boston plan
almost two years dead, the Krafts haven't quite been able to give
up on the fantasy. They still pay more than $100,000 a year to
maintain the BankBoston rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just one of the testaments to our work; this was our
vision,'' Kraft's son Jonathan said recently on a tour of the site.
``I just hope it comes across how much effort we put in. It wasn't
a fool's errand. We wanted to spend our own money and keep the team
here.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an effort that began with the state's grand plans for a
Boston Megaplex, which morphed to ever-more ambitious schemes for a
South Boston stadium, and then dwindled to shrunken hopes for a
renovated home in Foxborough or a new facility there before ending
in bitterness and recrimination on both sides with the announcement
last month that Kraft had signed a deal to move to Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, the Krafts and Beacon Hill policymakers viewed
each other warily across a cultural chasm separating two very
different worlds.
</P>
<P>
   The Krafts, seeing themselves as community heroes who had saved
the Patriots for Massachusetts, still can't understand why state
politicians never turned their rhetoric into reality.
</P>
<P>
   The family found that even more perplexing because Kraft was
willing to pay for a $200 million stadium himself, asking state
help only for infrastructure, while other National Football League
teams were receiving huge taxpayer funding for their facilities.
</P>
<P>
   They aren't the only ones perplexed by what often appears to be
the state's politically balkanized, can't-do climate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Massachusetts would never offer the kind of expensive deal
that Connecticut did to keep the team, but the point is, we didn't
have to,'' said US Rep. Martin T. Meehan. ``We had several
proposals for a privately financed stadium.'' Still, a particularly
Boston blend of problems would combine to doom the stadium plans _
and cost Massachusetts its NFL franchise, along with the associated
prestige and the millions of dollars in annual tax revenue it
generates.
</P>
<P>
   With the Patriots long ensconced outside of Boston, the capital
city's business and civic leaders felt no strong connection to the
franchise. Its political community was always divided about the
appropriate site for a stadium and about how much state aid to
contribute, while voters themselves were seemingly indifferent to
the fate of the team. Ironically, in a city and a region that has
long been seen as passionate about politics and sports, politics
was instrumental in killing a major sport.
</P>
<P>
   But if politicians and businessmen were ambivalent about a new
stadium for the Patriots, Kraft had high expectations when state
officials asked him to be part of the Megaplex and, later, when
former Gov. William F. Weld suggested he build a stand-alone
facility on state land in South Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been led to believe that if we bought the team, that it
would get done,'' said Jonathan Kraft, citing Weld's words.
</P>
<P>
   But no one should have taken that as an ironclad guarantee, said
House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can feel sympathy. But at the same time there's an
extraordinary naivete, which is a kind word for it _ an absence of
comprehension of the steps one should take,'' said Finneran.
``There's no one person who speaks for the government.''
</P>
<P>
   As Kraft became exasperated, he turned into his own worst enemy.
On Super Bowl Sunday in 1995, Patriots fans woke to disturbing
news. In a Globe interview, Kraft charged that commitments to help
him, made when he was contemplating purchashing the team, were
being reneged on. Saying he had lost $13 million in his first year
owning the Patriots, Kraft seemed to raise the specter of moving or
selling the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can last like this maybe two or three more years, but if I
don't see something happen in the next six months, I'll have to do
some planning,'' Kraft said.
</P>
<P>
   On Beacon Hill, even the once-supportive Weld administration
came to be annoyed by a team owner who never seemed satisfied with
the state's effort _ and whose demanding demeanor and sharp tongue
alienated many who tried to help him.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two days stand as stark bookends in the saga of the New England
Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   On the most recent date, Nov. 19, 1998, Kraft stood with
Connecticut Governor John Rowland and, flanked by legislative
leaders and businessmen, announced he would relocate his football
team to Hartford. Rapid reverse to Feb. 25, 1994. On that day,
Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino and Weld joined Kraft at Quincy
Market for an appreciation ceremony. Weld was delighted by Kraft's
decision to buy the team for $170 million and keep the franchise
here. Menino told the grateful crowd that within several years, the
team would be playing in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Between the two events would come three frustrating attempts to
find an in-state home for the team, an effort spread across two
changes of legislative leadership, a mayoral election during which
Menino did not want to squander votes in South Boston, and a US
Senate election that distracted Weld.
</P>
<P>
   But that day at Quincy Market, the award seemed appropriate.
Kraft appeared less the hard-bargaining NFL mogul than a local
white knight who had brushed aside bottom-line concerns to stop the
Patriots from moving to St. Louis, in the process sparing Boston
and the region a blow to their civic psyches.
</P>
<P>
   But the realities of operating in the NFL would soon hit home to
the Krafts. In a recent interview, Jonathan, who does much of the
public speaking for his family and who has spearheaded the stadium
projects for his father, said it quickly became apparent that to
afford top-flight players, the Patriots needed a stadium that would
let them tap revenues other NFL franchises enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   The first attempt to find a new home flowed from Weld's
invitation to the Patriots to be part of a proposed Boston
megaplex, consisting of a convention center and domed stadium. By
most accounts, the Krafts were initially skeptical, but later
agreed, thinking it was what policy-makers wanted.
</P>
<P>
   It was and it wasn't. If Weld had an edifice complex, there were
signals from the start that the Legislature was skeptical. Only a
year or so before, legislation needed to clear the way for a new
Boston Garden had gotten snagged on Beacon Hill, passing only after
a protracted struggle.
</P>
<P>
   During that battle, Finneran, then chairman of the House Ways
and Means Committee, had attracted headlines with a blunt challenge
to Garden owner Jeremy Jacobs: If he didn't like the deal the
Legislature was offering, ``I invite him to walk.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a portent of things to come.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Charles Flaherty seemed no more enthusiastic about
a megaplex; ironically, Kraft's purchase of the team _ reducing the
threat the Patriots would leave _ had lessened the urgency for it.
``There were just too many problems to it,'' Flaherty said in a
recent interview. ``The money didn't make any sense, the financing
didn't make any sense, and the site didn't make any sense.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next attempt _ a free-standing South Boston stadium _ would
fail in the face of community opposition. Policy-makers said Kraft
should pay for the $185 million stadium himself. He agreed.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1996, Weld and Stephen Tocco, then executive director of
the Massachusetts Port Authority, secretly guided Kraft to a mostly
vacant parcel on the Reserve Channel owned by the quasi-public
agency. Kraft, by then hooked on the vision of building a stadium
in Boston, had his architects design a state-of-the-art facility
and began work on the BankBoston showcase to sell the luxury
suites.
</P>
<P>
   Keep it quiet, was the word from Weld and Tocco. When they had a
concrete proposal, that would be the time to inform the community
and its leaders. But when news of the plan leaked in December of
1996, it took not only South Boston but also most of its
politicians by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was it the right tactic? It didn't work, so certainly there
was room for improvement,'' Tocco said. ``We wanted to make sure we
had a deal first.''
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston chairman Charles Gifford said press negativity did
not help, either.

LAW AT 76: PORVRAIT OF A LEADER TRANSFORMED 
</HEADLINE>
\   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When he came to Boston more than 14 years ago, Cardinal
Bernard Law wasted little time making his hard line position on one
of the nation's most explosive issues perfectly clear.
</P>
<P>
   In his first public appearance inside Holy Cross Cathedral
before hundreds of bishops and a small army of journalists, Law
called abortion the ``primordial evil of our day.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a memorable line that foreshadowed the strident and very
public broadsides Law frequently launched during his early years as
leader of the fourth largest archdiocese in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   As he celebrates 25 years as a bishop in the Roman Catholic
Church, Law recently reflected on the successes, disappointments
and challenges of his tenure as the eighth archbishop of the
Archdiocese of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, those who know him, say Law, 67, is a different
leader now than he was in his earlier years here.
</P>
<P>
   Then, they said, Law came across as an agressive and stern
moralist using church teachings to scold and lecture everyone from
former Gov. Michael Fukakis to then Lieutenant Gov. Paul Cellucci
to leaders of the Boston public schools.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1986, he chided Dukakis for speaking to an abortion
rights rally in Boston saying, through a spokesman, that he was
``less than pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in 1991, Law said Cellucci should not be allowed to speak
at Hudson Catholic High School, Cellucci's alma mater, because the
then lieutenant governor supported a woman's right to an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, as he has emerged as one of the nation's
most prominent and influential Catholic churchmen, Law, has toned
down the volume of his rhetoric, say some colleagues and others qho
have worked with the prelate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there has been a sort of mellowing,'' said the
Reverend Walter H. Cuenin, pastor of Our Lady Help of Christians, a
large parish in Newton.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Law has wavered one bit on issues he has
frequently been outspoken about, ranging from abortion to the death
penalty to US policy on Cuba. But, observers say, Law is less prone
to engage in public battles than he was when he came to Boston as a
fairly unknown archbishiop from a diocese of less than 50,000 in
southern Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the head of over 2 millikn Roman Catholics in the
archdiocese tends to work on more issues behind the scenes than in
front of the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Law acknowledges that _ perhaps _ his style, but not his
position, has changed. ``If that's the case, it isn't the case by
design or strategy,'' said Law, in an interview inside(the
cardinal's sprawling Brighton residence. ``It might be the case by
age. It might be the fact that when I was the new kid on the block
people tended to cover what I had to say more often than they do
now. I think what I've been saying has been quite consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Law adds, ``I don't think it's my job to be a culture
cop. My job is to teach about the Lord, about the church and about
how we should live our lives as Catholics as convincingly as I can.
If you have that as your prime focus, you're not going to leave
that to respond to every blip that comes across your radar screen.
If something is particularly obnoxious, then I'll try and react but
I think others should be doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, observers say, Law has become a savvy politician with a
keen talent for cultivating relationships with people in key
positions, even with those he sometimes tangles with.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he worked with US Rep. Joseph Kennedy to secure
federal funding for hepatitis vaccinations for poor people in the
Boston area. Law also made a visit to the State House to asj
Cellucci for National Guard planes to ferry supplies to Honduras,
which was ravaged last month by Hurricane Mitch. Neither of these
two episodes made the news, but they are good examples of how Law
can make t`ings happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things that you do effectively you're not going to be
able to do all the time in the public arena,'' Law said. ``You have
to network in order to get things done.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Phelan, executive vice president of the giant real estate
firm, Meredith and Grew, and one of the many movers and shakers in
Boston that Law can call upon, saqs: ``I think his Rolodex would
challenge anybody's in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Law also has used this archdiocese, which is considered one of
the key Catholic communities in America, as a springboard to become
a well-known and highly-regarded international spokesman,
particularly on issues affecting Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   He has played a vital role in strenghtening the Catholic church
in Cuba, traveling regularly to one of the world's last Communist
strongholds, enjoying a close friendship with Cardinal Jaime Ortega
of Havana and regularly sending money and medical supplies to the
island nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt Cardinal Law is a respected leader in the
Catholic Church,'' said Rev. Thomas Reese, an expert on church
hierarchy and editor of America, a Jesuit magazine.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, in fact, there has been speculation(that Law
could be headed for the Vatican, not necessarily as pope _ most
Vatican insiders say fear of granting too much power to the United
States leaves little chance of an American pope anytime soon _ but
as head of a pontifical agency. 
</P>
<P>
   At the same time as his international prestige has grown, Law's
critics say he has failed to pay sufficient attention to problems
at home, such as the declining number of priests end growing number
of Catholics who feel alienated from the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not as keyed in to local affairs as other bishops of
Boston perhaps have been,'' said Thomas H. O'Connor, emeritus
professor history at Boston College and author of ``Boston
Catholics: A History of the Church and Its People.''
</P>
<P>
   After more than 14 years at the seat of power, Law remains an
enigma to many Catholics, a churchman who can adroitly articulate
and defend thm church's position on welfare reform, for example,
but a pastor who has not really made a strong personal connection
with his flock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's been very open to talking with Catholics
who disagree with some of the church's practices,'' said Dot
Landry, of North Reading, and a former local leader of Call to
Action, a national church reform group that advocates, among other
things, married and women priests.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Landry said, Law did not respond to an invitation
to attend Call to Action New England's annual conference. Law has
said repeatedly that there is little room for discussion on church
teachings.
</P>
<P>
   Those who know him say Law can come across to strangers as
somewhat aloof, that's just one side of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``In public, the official side of him is very formal and less
personally revealing,'' Cuenin said. ``But when you get to know him
as a person you realize he is a warm, compassionate !nd friendly
man.''
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, observers say, it would be impossible to have much
of a rapport in an archdiocese of Boston's size.
</P>
<P>
   And Law's defenders say he has not ignored critical issues such
as the falling numbers of priestw. Indeed, earlier this year Law
said he expected to close 40 to parishes by the year 2006, in part,
because of the shrinking supply of priests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's conscious of the realities he faces,'' O'Connor
said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps where Law has had the biggest impact locally is on
parlaying his clout and his networking skills into tangible
results, whether it be raising money to build AIDS hospices,
working with black clergy on youth programs or improving relations
with Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Law is one of the best connected leaders in Boston who can count
among his friends people like Jack Connors, the public relations
guru, Thomas Flatley, the real estate developer and Peter Lynch,
the investment wizard at Fidelity Investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the cardinal calls, I take it right away,'' said Phelan,
who helped chair a party Law hosted last spring that raised several
hundred thousand dollars for archdiocesan programs. ``He could
easily be running any number of Fortune 500 companies. He's tough
to say no to.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Connors said, Law has drawn from the strong
tradition of charity among Jews to convince some Catholic civic and
business leaders to become more generous in providing financial aid
to the archdiocese. One well-known local businessman, for instance,
recently gave Law $50,000 to provide relief to Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has grown into the job and became a very powerful person,
but he understands how to use that power for good,'' said Connors.

TESTING LEAVES COLUMNIST SUBDUED, RESPECTFUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have decided to perform a service for the schoolchildren of
Massachusetts. I have taken the much-dreaded Massachusetts
Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) test.
</P>
<P>
   But first _ what exactly is the MCAS? A full-employment scheme
for PhD-wielding education ``experts''? Yes. A ludricrous, $20
million boondoggle ``revealing'' that lily-white suburbs like
Harvard, Medfield, and Wayland, primarily populated by lawyers,
junior executives, and Globe staffers, have good schools? Yes. A
subject of mindless chatter for shiftless soccer moms, lacking for
conversation topics now that Louise Woodward has crawled back under
her rock? Indeed.
</P>
<P>
   But just as important, it is one more stick for lazy teachers
and apathetic parents to beat kids over the heads with. Because
that's really what the headlines are screaming, isn't it? ``You
dummies! You're so stupid! When I was your age blah blah blah . .
.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, take heart, young people. I know you've been frittering
your lives away playing video games like Crusader: No Remorse. And
I've seen you stare slack-jawed at Dave Matthews music videos, and
ogling Adam Sandler and Neve Campbell movies. But who am I to
criticize? As it happens, I'm no smarter than you.
</P>
<P>
   What's the MCAS like? Think: ``Jeopardy!'' from hell. It's
divided into three parts _ English, Math, and Science and
Technology _ combining multiple-choice questions with short- and
long-form essay responses. I chose to take the 10th-grade test in
Math and Science and Technology. I skipped the English test,
figuring I'd ace it. What's more, I couldn't bear to read that
turgid excerpt from the wrong Tom Wolfe, which was printed in the
Globe a few days ago, one more time.
</P>
<P>
   Schoolchildren had 17 45-minute blocks to take the test, or, um,
let's see . . . about 12 hours, right? I took a little bit less
time, partly to minimize the damage to my weekend, and partly to
avoid penning long essays on such subjects as the chemical
transformation of moistened steel wool, on which I can safely plead
total, complete, and utter ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of questions invoking the median and the mean
_ is there a difference? _ I thought I performed creditably on the
Math. I got 24 out of 27 right on the multiple choice, half of the
short-answer questions, and again half of the open-response, i.e.
essay questions. When Question 39 invited me to peruse the attached
trigonometric tables, I scrawled ``NO CREDIT'' across the page and
switched on the last few moments of the Patriots debacle.
</P>
<P>
   Science and Technology promised to be another kettle of fish.
When the Globe printed a sample question about the eukaryotic cell,
whatever that is, that put me on guard. But yet again, I thought I
acquitted myself with honor. I answered 22 of 29 multiple-choice
questions correctly, even the one that alluded to ``TIF computing
systems,'' a term that _ are you listening, Mr. Silber? _ doesn't
exist. (If you enter the phrase into FOLDOC, the Free Online
Dictionary of Computing, you get ``no match.'' Could they have
meant TIFF, tagged image file format? Or does TIF refer to what the
Chambers Dictionary of Science and Technology calls T.I.F. _
telephone interface factor? But that doesn't make sense . . .)
</P>
<P>
   I answered fewer than half of the Science and Technology essay
questions. I could handle the physics of the tennis ball, but when
confronted with questions about semi-permeable membranes and the
mutant DNA strand actttgac _ hey, have pity, already!
</P>
<P>
   How did I do? Jeffrey Nellhaus, the Department of Education's
director of standards, delivered the bad news. In Math, I got a
246, rendering me ``proficient.'' Proficient?! Twenty-four out of
27 on the multiple choice, and you're calling me proficient? I have
a college degree! ``Multiple-choice tests tend to overestimate what
people can do,'' Nellhaus told me. ``I think now we have a truer
picture of your math ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise in Science and Technology, Nellhaus told me that I
``just hit the cut point for proficient'' with a score of 248.
``Not bad,'' he continued, sensing the damage to my normally
healthy sense of self-esteem. ``I think you did very well for
someone who's been away from these ideas for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Like my intellectual peers, I think I'll go drown my sorrows in
``The Waterboy.''

MY MOTHER, MYSELF _ AND LILLIAN HELLMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHFIELD, Mass. _ When Rosemary Mahoney was 17, in the summer
of 1978, she worked as housekeeper and cook for the writer Lillian
Hellman whom she had admired for ``her bravery, her strength and
her intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she says now, ``what I thought I saw in her, I already had
in my mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney, now 37 and a writer herself, has written a memoir of
that summer on Martha's Vineyard, ``A Likely Story,'' published
last month by Doubleday. But, reflecting the fact that it is her
mother who possessed those qualities of bravery, strength and
intelligence, ``A Likely Story'' became, in large part, an account
of the role which her mother, Nona Rohan Mahoney, played in her
growing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I really wanted to write about,'' Mahoney said, ``was
being 17.'' And while the summer with Hellman provided ``the
catalyst for writing about what was happening to me,'' Mahoney
said, ``my mother became a big part of the story as well.''
</P>
<P>
   It was actually Mrs. Mahoney who urged her daughter to write to
Hellman about working for her on the Vineyard. Rosemary, then a
student at St. Paul's School, had expressed her admiration for
Hellman _ and her complete uninterest in working behind the counter
at a local Howard Johnson's.
</P>
<P>
   And, despite all the resentment which Mahoney felt towards
Hellman as the summer staggered from one humiliation to another, it
was a comment which Hellman made, Mahoney recalls _ that allowed
her to express for the first time, and to an outsider, her deep
feelings about her mother.
</P>
<P>
   One noontime, Hellman surprised Mahoney by asking if she'd like
to have lunch with her. And as they worked together in the kitchen,
Hellman _ for the first and only time that summer _ asked Mahoney
about her family.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney told her about her mother being a widow, crippled with
polio, and raising seven children _ but not that she was an
alcoholic, a shaming fact that Mahoney had desparately kept hidden
from feiends and classmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brave woman,'' Hellman said. ``She must be very strong.''
</P>
<P>
   The words, and the sincerity with which she spoke them,
``glittered in the air before me like a small gift,'' Mahoney
recalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is,'' Mahoney told Hellman. And, she recalls, ``I knew it
was true. She was stronger than anyone I knew.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both Rosemary Mahoney and her mother had a rose-tinted
expectation of what the summer would be. ``I thought they'd be
rocking in chairs on the porch, talking about books,'' Mrs. Mahoney
said. And Rosemary, concurring, added ``I guess I thought we'd be
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work out that way. Rosemary Mahoney admits she was
``woefully unsuited'' for the housekeeping job and had absolutely
no idea of how to prepare the gourmet meals that Hellman expected.
Not only didn't she know how to make sorrel soup, one summer day,
but she didn't even know what sorrel was _ or what sorrel would
look like growing in Hellman's garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were stubborn,'' Mrs. Mahoney said, ``and so was she.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what it was,'' her daughter agreed, ``a contest.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hellman which the schoolgirl Mahoney had admired from
reading her memoirs, ``An Unfinished Woman'' and ``Pentimento,''
turned out to be vain and acerbic and a mean-spirited employer. And
the summer, one of continued humiliation when she was sent on
errands _ or attempted, unsuccessfully, to cash her paycheck, which
Hellman had made out to ``cash.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, in one humiliating incident, Mahoney recalls being sent to
ask writer John Hersey's cook for help when she spoiled botched a
batch of cookies being prepared for an afternoon tea-time visit
from Carly Simon and James Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't grow up in the country, did you,'' Hellman says
offhandedly one day. Mahoney actually had, with woods and fields
behind the house in Milton. ``You don't seem to recognize
vegetables,'' Hellman says by way of explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney recalls that ``ridiculous postulation infuriating her
more than anything else Hellman had said all summer,'' and asks
what hadn't she recognized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mint, for one,'' Hellman says.
</P>
<P>
   And Mahoney, ``mind furiously scrambling for a defense,''
replied, ``Mint isn't a vegetable.'' And Hellman crumples her
napkin, crushes her cigarette, in her eyes what Mahoney saw as ``a
studied expression of amused boredom.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney has been criticized for writing harshly and judgmentally
about a American literary icon. She could have been equally harsh
and judgmental about her mother, now 75.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mahoney, society editor of the Boston Post when she was in
her 30s, before leaving to raise a family, had been a social
drinker. ``The cocktail parties made it legitimate,'' she said. The
serious drinking started after her husband died when Rosemary, the
youngest of her seven children, was 7. ``Then, the only guests at
my cocktail parties were the alcohol and myself.''
</P>
<P>
   But she stopped drinking years ago. ``I just grew out of it,''
she said. ``I never went to AA or anything like that.'' And
Rosemary Mahoney, spending a morning in Marshfield with her mother,
adds, ``I think I stopped worrying about your drinking about 15
years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the things I feel proud about my mother for,''
Rosemary Mahoney said, ``that she's willing to talk about it. That
takes courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary Mahoney recalls a Chicago Tribune reporter who
interviewed her a few weeks ago, following the publication of ``A
Likely Story.'' She told Mahoney that its didn't seem ``nice'' for
her to have written so bluntly about her mother's drinking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not ashamed,'' Rosemary Mahoney said she told the
interviewer. ``And she's not ashamed,''
</P>
<P>
   But back in 1978 and the years before that when Rosemary Mahoney
was growing up in Milton, in a houseful of older brothers and
sisters, she was so ashamed of her mother that she would jump
quickly into the car when her mother picked her up at school,
rather than let her classmates see her drunk.
</P>
<P>
   And fearful. She remembers times _ long before she had a
driver's license _ when she would slide over and take the wheel of
the car away from her mother as she drifted into a drunken stupor.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney graduated from Harvard in 1983 and is now 37, with two
previous books in her credits, ``The Early Arrival of Dreams,'' an
account of a year teaching English at a provincial college in China
which was a New York Times notable book in 1990, and ``Whoredom in
Kimmage,'' a gritty study of the changing role of Irish women which
was a National Book Critics Circle finalist in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   And on a late-fall morning earlier this month, Rosemary Mahoney
has driven up to Marshfield from her apartment just off the
Providence, R.I. waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   Marshfield holds memories of happy summers, and also of the very
protective feeling Rosemary Mahoney had for her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Swimming was the only athletic activity Mrs. Mahoney was able to
continue after being crippled by polio. As both she and Rosemary
recall, she would wade thigh-deep into the ocean, then call for
someone to come take her crutches.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mrs. Mahoney had made sure all the children could swim
because of her inability to rescue them _ and dressed them all in
red swimsuits ``so I could look out and count them'' _ Rosemary
would stand on the beach while her mother was swimming.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling,'' Rosemary Mahoney said to her mother as she
talked about those days, ``was not only that you couldn't save me,
but that you'd drown and I couldn't save you.''

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Five years have passed since Leo Williams left General
Electric Co., but the Boston financial services executive has not
forgotten the advice he received from his mentor at GE.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was working as a mechanical engineer in the Wisconsin
division when he decided he wanted to become a manager. He
mentioned his goals to James Shepard, general manager of GE's
global X-ray tubes and detectors business, and Shepard suggested he
go to business school. That meeting proved to be a turning point in
Williams' career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim helped me make the best moves within the company, and
within my own objectives, which was to move from engineering into
management,'' said Williams, 37, president of Williams &AMP; Associates
Investments in Boston. ``He was a black man, a senior manager who
took an interest in me. I looked up to him. We bonded. By the time
I left in 1993, he had been promoted to general manager.''
</P>
<P>
   How important are mentors? ``They are definitely critical to
professional success,'' says Ann Bartels, a professor of labor
economics and human resources at Columbia University's School of
Business.
</P>
<P>
   Bartels is among several researchers at Columbia University and
Korn/Ferry, a worldwide executive search firm, who took part in a
1998 study of the professional lives of 280 minority achievers
whose annual salaries range from $100,000 to $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   When Bartels interviewed the respondents, she was struck by the
fact that 50 percent had had a mentor, or a series of mentors, who
played a significant role in their work lives. Seventy-percent had
informal mentors, while 20 percent said they had formal mentors who
were assigned to them by employers. Additionally, a majority spoke
of role models who had encouraged achievement in childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``In each case, mentors actively advocated for the promotion of
the executive,'' said Bartels. ``They introduced the executive to
important formal and informal networks; they helped explain the
informal rules of the organization, the unwritten rules no one ever
tells you about. They also provided important advice about career
goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the respondents, 161 were African-American, 63 were Asian, 43
were Hispanic, and 13 belonged to other nonwhite racial categories.
Seventy-six percent were men; 24 percent were women.
</P>
<P>
   All were employed by a Fortune 500 company or a financial
institution among the top 200 in the country as measured by assets.
Moreover, all had high-ranking positions: 24 percent were general
managers, 19 percent were financial service or accounting
executives, and 16 percent were marketing or sales executives.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard, 42, of Montclair, N.J., the GE mentor, said common
interests and a common background helped him forge a relationship
with Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leo and I went to Princeton. I graduated in 1978. He graduated
a few years later, but we were both part of the National Society of
Black Engineers,'' he recalled. ``I would come back to the campus
and give talks, which is how we met. We became friends. I worked in
aerospace at GE; he was in a different division, but we kept in
touch. Then, our paths crossed in GE's medical division.''
</P>
<P>
   It was at that point that Williams realized he wanted to become
a manager and was interested in the marketing and financial end of
the business. ``Based on what he had decided he wanted to do,''
said Shepard, ``I felt he should pursue the MBA even though he was
a good engineer. So, for him, the question became: What should I
do? Leave engineering to pursue a business career?''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Williams enrolled at Wharton Business School, but
remained at GE, which sent him overseas during a summer break to
work in a global division.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many cases, in a large company there are different paths
and it can be difficult to determine which one to take,'' said
Shepard. ``Leo was an engineer in entry-level manufacturing and
could have continued in engineering, but he also could have
remained in manufacturing or gone into marketing. At that time, it
was unusual to switch from engineering to business and it really
required that he go and get an MBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartels, who included Williams in the Columbia
University-Korn/Ferry study, said the participants shared many
other characteristics. ``The majority were not from the middle
class, but were from two-parent, blue-collar families and, in 67
percent of the cases, both parents worked,'' said Bartels.
</P>
<P>
   Joanna Miller, a managing director at the Stamford, Conn.,
office of Korn/Ferry, said the company got involved with the
research because many of its clients were looking for ways to
train, recruit, and retain minority executives.
</P>
<P>
   She, too, was surprised by some of the findings. ``Ninety
percent said they were better off financially today than they were
three years ago,'' said Miller. ``But the real surprise was that
about 50 percent said they would change companies for a greater
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``For them, the most important reasons to stay with a company
were that their talents and abilities were being utilized, they had
respect and authority, a supportive work environment, and that
there was a clear link between performance appraisals and career
goals.''
</P>
<P>
   A common thread among all the executives, Miller said, ``was
they all had developed successful strategies for dealing with
discrimination and their own career goals and advancement.''
</P>
<P>
   When faced with discriminatory actions by peers or midlevel
supervisors, they analyzed the situation and then developed a plan
for dealing with it. ``They also spoke directly to the person
involved in order to correct the situation,'' said Miller. ``Some
waited until the incident had passed, and then spoke separately and
individually to the person involved.''
</P>
<P>
   While others might have become embittered, these professionals
saw such incidents as an opportunity to learn how things were done
at the organization.
</P>
<P>
   The tendency to develop a plan and stick to it, attention to
detail, and the ability to discuss business issues with authority
while showing respect for other kinds of expertise and perspectives
were all instrumental in helping them achieve their career goals,
said Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, whose family is from Jamaica, grew up in New York
City, where he attended local public schools. His mother was an
elementary teacher who rose to assistant principal. His father was
an insurance inspector.
</P>
<P>
   ``In high school and in junior high school, there were teachers
I looked up to, but I also looked up to my parents,'' said
Williams. ``In business, there were many different mentors along
the way.''

A FAMILY CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE IN AFTERMATH OF HURRICANE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIPITAPA, Nicaragua _ German Castro's neighbors are gone, having
escaped to refugee centers in nearby schools. Just a block closer
to Lake Managua, not a house remains.
</P>
<P>
   But Castro, his home flooded, his business destroyed by a
hurricane named Mitch, is sticking it out.
</P>
<P>
   Castro, with patience, determination and a little help from
cousins in San Francisco, figures to regain his livelihood and
rebuild the family home in Tipitapa for his seven children and
young grandson.
</P>
<P>
   With the city on the shores of Lake Managua and the Tipitapa
River, both swollen by torrential rain, there was no stopping the
flooding when the hurricane hit in late October. The Red Cross
estimates that 9,000 Tipitapa residents lost their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The storm, which stalled over Central America for days, killed
more than 9,000 people and left as many as 2 million others
homeless in Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two months later, the river still rushes through town.
Children use it as a swimming spot despite potential health
hazards. A block from Castro's house, the water is still
shoulder-high inside many homes.
</P>
<P>
   Residents now spend time in line, waiting for donations of food
and other basic items. Recently, the Red Cross handed out sacks of
rice and oats, along with cooking oil, a few plastic dishes,
toothpaste, toilet paper and soap. People haul the goods away on
city buses or in wheelbarrows, back to their shattered homes or
temporary shelters.
</P>
<P>
   The Castros were luckier than most because their home survived.
Nevertheless, the kitchen and bedrooms were flooded, and the shop
where Castro sold soft drinks and snacks, his main livelihood, was
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these conditions, Castro, whose wife of 35 years died
last year, making him sole caretaker for their children aged 12 to
25, didn't want to leave his home. With such a large family, moving
to a shelter would have been difficult, and leaving his home and
belongings unprotected would have been dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The Castros have found ways to adapt. Family members moved their
beds into a wide hallway where they sleep side-by-side. One
daughter, though, found the conditions too dangerous for her
3-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   So Doris Castro, 23, and her son moved to a friend's house in
another part of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too many diseases down there. I don't want my boy to
get sick,'' she said of the flood zone surrounding her father's
home. ``There's cholera, dengue, and the water's polluted. There
are millions of mosquitoes.''
</P>
<P>
   German Castro wonders where he will find the money to repair his
little shop and to whom he will sell Pepsis now that the
neighborhood is nearly empty. Still, with the help of his older
children, he hopes to keep the family fed and healthy and to
rebuild their home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to be father and mother to these kids now,'' Castro
said.
</P>
<P>
   His spirits were lifted two weeks ago when he received $150 from
two cousins in San Francisco, though with nine mouths to feed, it
won't last forever.
</P>
<P>
   Castro's first-cousin, Laura Perez, said she wished she could do
more for her family in Nicaragua. On a recent afternoon, she
slipped into the chapel at St. Luke's Hospital in San Francisco
where the medical secretary prayed for her relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Perez grew up in Nicaragua but has been back only twice since
she moved to the United States in 1979. She has seen the damage of
Mitch only through news reports and her relatives' accounts.
</P>
<P>
   As Christmas approaches, German Castro has a wish list of things
he hopes his cousin can provide or maybe pray for: a pair of rubber
boots, a fishing pole to catch food for the family and someone to
call a partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell her to send me a new wife in a package from San
Francisco,'' he joked wistfully.

WHITAKER SIGNS ON TO MAKE COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After more than a year layoff following a suspension for twice
testing positive for drugs and alcohol, Pernell Whitaker will come
back to boxing with a bang Feb. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Intense negotiations between promoters Don King and Dino Duva,
as well as executives at HBO, led to an agreement Tuesday for
Whitaker to meet International Boxing Federation welterweight
champion Felix Trinidad Feb. 20 on HBO, with the winner fighting
No. 1 contender Vincent Pettway, also on HBO, later in the year.
</P>
<P>
   Although neither fighter has yet signed, sources familiar with
the negotiation said, ``It's 90 percent done. What remains is not
significant, although in boxing, you always worry about these
things even after the contracts are signed.''
</P>
<P>
   The belief is that King has decided following his successful
negotiation with HBO for the Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis
heavyweight title unification match that this is the time for him
to reacquaint himself with HBO, the largest cable outlet for boxing
_ and the most lucrative. King saw a 13-year relationship with HBO
disintegrate seven years ago in a power struggle when he tried to
force Time Warner executives not to use analyst Larry Merchant on
Mike Tyson telecasts.
</P>
<P>
   HBO and King had already agreed on a contract extension for
Tyson, but when the network backed Merchant, King took his fighter
to cable rival Showtime. Although King retains a connection with
Showtime, that relationship has cooled since King lost control of
Tyson last year. Tyson continues to fight for Showtime and in fact
signed a contract extension recently that will commence with his
Jan. 16 comeback fight vs. Frans Botha. But King no longer controls
him and appears to be trying to angle his top fighters into more
lucrative HBO contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker has not fought since winning a 12-round decision over
Andrei Pestriaev at Foxwoods Oct. 17, 1997. Following that bout,
Whitaker tested positive for an illegal substance and was
suspended. That suspension was later overturned, and Whitaker, once
hailed as the world's finest fighter, pound for pound, was set to
fight then World Boxing Association welterweight champion Ike
Quartey earlier this year. But he tested positive a second time
after agreeing to random testing as part of the deal to have the
suspension lifted. The fight was canceled, and Whitaker (41-2-1)
was suspended until September.
</P>
<P>
   The three-time world champion will be 35 next month and has not
looked sharp for nearly two years, so the Trinidad match is a
crossroads fight for him. If he wins, he would get Pettway and then
a likely rematch with Oscar De La Hoya, who defeated him in a
surprisingly close fight April 12.
</P>
<P>
   If Trinidad (33-0) wins, he would get Pettway as well as a
likely relationship with HBO but no immediate shot at De La Hoya.
That's because King does not want to negotiate such a match with
rival promoter Bob Arum without first having Trinidad in a near
parity situation with De La Hoya, HBO's most popular fighter. To do
that, King thinks, he must at least get him two of the three major
welterweight titles by matching him next fall with WBA champion
James Page, whom King also controls.
</P>
<P>
   That would also be a lucrative HBO fight. Beyond that, it would
allow King to enter into contract negotiations for a megabucks
unification match with De La Hoya on HBO in 2000 with Trinidad at
least controlling the majority of the titles at stake.
</P>
<P>
   But for any of that to happen, Trinidad first will have to get
by a wily old man named Pernell Whitaker.

THE RAT PACK; SPIN'S TOPS; WHO'S OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although he's been dead seven months, we still aren't quite
ready to bury Frank Sinatra.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, there were news stories about the release of the
40-year confidential file the FBI kept on the entertainer,
especially in regards to his friendships with underworld figures.
Elaborate displays bearing stacks of his classic CDs still adorn
most record stores, and hardly a week goes by without some Sinatra
chestnut _ his scintillating duet with Ella Fitzgerald on ``The
Lady Is a Tramp,'' or such films as ``From Here to Eternity'' or
``Guys and Dolls'' _ flickering across our television screens. But
just as much attention has been paid to the man as well as the
artist. A few months ago, an academic conference on Sinatra was
held, and Pete Hamill, in his book, ``Why Sinatra Matters,'' said
the entertainer, through his ambitions, loves, and fears,
``indirectly changed the way all of us lived.''
</P>
<P>
   Now comes American Heritage, and Max Rudin's ruminations on the
Rat Pack, the Sinatra-led group of entertainers _ Dean Martin,
Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Lawford, and Joey Bishop _ who turned Las
Vegas into a personal playground onstage and off in the late 1950s
and early 1960s. Rudin rehashes much of what is already known about
height of Sinatra's so-called ``Hat'' years: his infamous temper,
the Kennedy connection, and the Pack's often unbelievably boorish
behavior. But he also makes a convincing case for a method behind
all that ring-a-ding-ding madness. Sinatra, a proponent of civil
rights long before it became popular or fashionable, was presenting
in his multicultural Rat Pack, a ``giddy version of multiethnic
American democracy,'' where race and ethnicity were not only
featured, but flaunted. Comic bits that now seem offensive, such as
Martin picking up Davis and saying, ``I'm proud to accept this
award from the NAACP,'' had quite the edge at the time. The Rat
Pack thumbed its nose at the great racial divide by implying
relations had so improved we could joke about our differences. In
his way, Sinatra, Rudin writes, was ``teaching a lesson in American
possibilities.'' Not bad for a guy from Hoboken who often referred
to himself as ``just a saloon singer.''
</P>

   This being December and all, we're up to our elbows in year-end
lists _ the best movies, the best sports moments, the best
explanations for what exactly constitutes a sexual relationship.
Spin has its annual Year in Music issue, featuring the 20 best
albums and 20 best singles. Anyone who heard Lauryn Hill's stunning
solo debut should not be surprised that her CD, ``The Miseducation
of Lauryn Hill,'' was selected best album of 1998. Writes Craig
Seymour of the record the 23-year-old wrote and produced, ``From
spirituals to Stevie Wonder to dancehall, Hill harvested the
history of black music for an idiosyncratic brew _ sing-song
melodies, edgy productions, enviable rhyme skills, back-to-church
vocals _ that definitely played to the people, but also challenged
them to meet her ambitions halfway.'' Seymour calls Hill, also
named Artist of the Year, ``one of the woefully few career artists
to emerge this year'' _ which says a lot, but also damns her with
faint praise when you consider this was also the year of such vapid
pretty-boy groups as Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync.
</P>
<P>
   Other notables on the list: Garbage's sorely overlooked
sophomore effort, ``Version 2.0,'' (No. 9); ``Celebrity Skin,'' the
Hole album few us ever expected to see, let alone enjoy (No. 11);
and Fatboy Slim's cracking good ``You've Come A Long Way, Baby.''
Speaking of Fatboy Slim, also known as Norman Cook, his ``The
Rockefeller Skank'' clocks in as the mag's best single. Some may
argue that there were better singles this year, but really was
there anything more infectious than that ``Check it out now, the
funk soul brothers'' riff? And hey, does anyone remember the days
when singles were truly singles, and you could even buy them?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere on Spin's list is George Michael, whose had quite the
naughty, if less than commercially successful, year. Back in April,
Michael was arrested for public lewdness after he played a game of
``I'll-show-you-mine-if-you-show-me-yours'' with an undercover cop
in a Los Angeles park. Since then he's finally come clean about his
sexuality (not that it should have been a surprise to anyone), and
has released a greatest-hits CD that has been largely ignored
stateside. Now, the singer who spent most of his career avoiding
comments about his sexuality is talking, talking, talking about his
sex life like there's no tomorrow, this time in Britain's cheeky Q.
Michael speaks frankly about his late lover, Brazilian designer
Anselmo Feleppa, who died of an AIDS-related brain hemorrhage in
1993, as well as of his current boyfriend, Kenny Goss, the most
patient partner this side of Hillary Clinton. He's rather
unrepentant about his arrest _ ``I've always liked having sex in
places I shouldn't have. I did it because I couldn't resist a free
lunch,'' Michael says. And he admits that having to come out
because of his arrest wasn't exactly the way he wanted to deal
publicly with his homosexuality. ``Running naked up and down Oxford
Street singing `I Am What I Am' would have been a more dignified
way to come out.'' Which is exactly why Michael should have come
out years ago.

FIDELITY'S RETURNS SIZZLE, SALES FIZZLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many of Fidelity Investments' biggest mutual funds are putting
up sizzling performance numbers this year. Peter Lynch's familiar
face is all over television, the financial pages, and business
magazines in maybe Fidelity's biggest ad blitz ever.
</P>
<P>
   And the sales of it most important product, its stock funds?
They're down right puny.
</P>
<P>
   At a time of strong investment gains and a big marketing push,
the world's largest mutual fund company finds itself looking up at
a host of smaller competitors who are taking far more new dollars
into their stock funds from investors.
</P>
<P>
   The gap is startling.
</P>
<P>
   According to Financial Research Corp., a Boston consulting firm,
Fidelity's equity funds through October recorded $2.7 billion in
net sales, or new money invested excluding redemptions and
transfers among Fidelity funds. Archrival Vanguard Group took in an
extraordinary $28.5 billion over the same period, FRC says, a
tribute to investors' growing commitment to Vanguard's specialty,
funds designed to track market indexes. In all, 10 fund complexes
took in more new equity dollars than Fidelity, including
Massachusetts Financial Services and Putnam Investments, which both
outsold Fidelity 3 to 1. Fidelity also trailed Vanguard in
fixed-income sales more than 2 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity would not comment for this column. But the FRC numbers
indicate that October was a particularly ugly month for the
Boston-based giant. Roughly $2.3 billion flowed out of the Fidelity
equity funds during the month at a time when Vanguard and MFS both
added $1.2 billion, FRC estimates. Fidelity previously said it was
having a better November, with about $3 billion coming into its
equity funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is almost like the Grand Canyon: It is kind of
breath-taking to see the difference between equity sales (at
Fidelity) this year vs. Vanguard,'' says James Lowell, editor of
Fidelity Investor, a newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Why is Fidelity lagging?
</P>
<P>
   In part it has to do with investors' jitters about the market
and their resulting ``flight to safety,'' or low-risk investments.
For example, US money market funds took in far more cash than stock
funds through November. That is the first time money market funds,
which hold relatively safe government and corporate bonds, have
outsold equity funds since 1990. Fidelity has taken roughly $22
billion into its money market funds this year; last year the
company saw a net outflow from money funds.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity also has a problem that none of its rivals have: A
company with one of the best brand names in the world ironically
finds itself with virtually no brand names on the shelf to sell.
That oddity is a result of its decision to close some of its
biggest and best-selling funds to new investors. After years of
maintaining the big funds were manageable despite their increasing
heft, Fidelity changed direction last year, closing its flagship
Magellan. This year it has closed Growth &AMP; Income, Contrafund, and
Low-Priced Stock, all well-known and top-selling funds.
</P>
<P>
   Existing investors and those who had the funds in their 401k
retirement menus could continue to put money into them, but sales
have fallen off dramatically. Fidelity had only one fund _ the
top-performing Dividend Growth _ among the top 10 selling equity
funds, according to FRC. Two of Fidelity's best-selling equity
funds are index funds, long the province of Vanguard.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't hear Dividend Growth and think of Fidelity,''
says Lowell. ``When you hear Magellan and Contrafund you think of
Fidelity.''
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity slow sales come at a time that it is enjoying terrific
performance numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Big funds like Magellan, Growth &AMP; Income, Retirement Growth,
Large Cap Stock, Blue Chip Growth, and Advisor Equity Growth are
beating the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, the Holy Grail for
managers who actively pick stocks.
</P>
<P>
   As a group, Fidelity's US equity funds are ranked number one by
return among the 10 largest fund families this year, according to
Kanon Bloch Carre, a Boston consulting firm. Fidelity's funds were
up 17.41 percent through November compared with number two
Vanguard, which was up 15.25 percent, says Kanon Bloch.
</P>
<P>
   After its highly publicized performance problems in 1996 and
early 1997, Fidelity has turned its results around by making a huge
bet on big-capitalization stocks. Fully 80 percent of Fidelity's
equity assets are in big-cap stocks, and many of the funds own many
of the same stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell, the newsletter editor, believes Fidelity's sales
problems indicate just how much the world has changed for the
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fidelity used to be a name you could take to the bank,'' he
said. ``Today they have to earn their stripes, just like any other
fund company. They are earning their stripes, which I find
ironic.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not enough investors are noticing.

SEAL FEARLESSLY SEARCHES FOR ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After winning three Grammy awards for his graceful,
adult-soul music, the artist known as Seal is getting back on the
road for a much-awaited tour. He's played only one show so far this
year _ appropriately enough at the Gentleman's Quarterly awards in
New York _ but he was to play his second Wednesday in Boston as
part of KISS-108's Jingle Ball with Cher, Bryan Adams, Joe
McIntyre, and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very fortunate,'' Seal said Tuesday during a rehearsal at
Avalon. ``The thing I enjoy most about performing live is the
connection with the audience. That's too euphoric to describe. But
the other thing is that I get a chance to work with such great
musicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Seal, who plans a full-scale tour in March, has a new, all-star
band with former Bruce Springsteen/Sting keyboardist David
Sancious, ace studio guitarist Michael Landau (who rarely tours),
and drummer Brian Blades, who last toured with Joni Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, his six-piece group ran through ``Human Beings,'' his
new single. The sumptuous sound flooded the room, while the
London-born Seal (whose real name is Sealhenry Samuel) sang ``It is
only love, I feel, that will give us peace of heart,'' before
adding, ``Tell me, is it death you fear?'' and ``We're mere human
beings, we die.''
</P>
<P>
   That's strong stuff by today's radio standards, but Seal is an
intensely spiritual man whose new album, ``Human Being,'' is about
his personal search for answers _ again, an uncommon theme in the
pop world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to respect life,'' says Seal, 35. ``We can't live in
an irresponsible way, as in the case of the two rappers, Tupac and
Notorious B.I.G., who had disrespect for life. If you play with
fire, you will die that way. We're not indestructible.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the song is also saying that death is as much a part of
life as being born. We shouldn't spend a whole life fighting it. We
should embrace it as an integral part of life, rather than fearing
it as this void that will take us away.''
</P>
<P>
   The new album grapples with such issues as loss of faith and
loss of love (Seal has had a couple of romances go awry, including
a much-publicized one with supermodel Tyra Banks), but the ultimate
tone of his dreamily alluring album is quite positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always ask me about the lyrics and what space I was in
when I wrote the songs,'' says Seal, sipping a cup of tea
backstage. ``They're just another chapter in my journal. I'm trying
to walk unafraid and be completely open.''
</P>
<P>
   For inspiration, Seal sees the West Coast-based Guru Singh, but
doesn't want people reading too much into that. ``He's a friend,''
Seal says. ``Some people have shrinks, some go to confession, some
stay at home and pray. For me, he's a guy you go to unload on.''
</P>
<P>
   During his career, Seal has unloaded a lot of hits, topped by
``Kiss from a Rose'' (from the ``Batman'' soundtrack), which in
1995 won record of the year, song of the year, and best male pop
vocal performance. He also scored a hit with a version of Steve
Miller's ``Fly Like an Eagle'' for the ``Space Jam'' soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   While Seal is known for his soundtrack successes, he is much
more personal in his sleekly understated solo albums, which have
been produced by ex-Buggle Trevor Horn.
</P>
<P>
   The new album requires some extra listening, but rewards the
effort. ``A lot of people say it's an introspective record,'' says
Seal. ``But in terms of content, I think it's fearless. I don't
mean in breaking musical barriers, but I'm striving constantly to
be more open and address certain issues in my soul.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, Mass. _ Shortly after being tapped to become chief
executive of Raytheon Co., Daniel P. Burnham gathered senior
managers in the company's sunny cafeteria and offered to answer
questions about himself and his plans for the defense contractor.
</P>
<P>
   Of the several hundred people seated in rows at that meeting
July 1, no one spoke up. Such gatherings, after all, had been rare.
Following an uncomfortable silence, Burnham told the meeting,
``That's OK, you'll get used to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The message was clear: Raytheon's new top officer aims to foster
a more open culture at an institution known for its Pentagon-style
secrecy under Dennis J. Picard, who formally turned over the title
of chief executive on Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham's ascension comes at a crucial time for Lexington-based
Raytheon. He is just the fifth leader in its 76-year history, and
the first outsider brought in to take its helm. He takes over
following an acquisition spree last year that elevated the company
to the top tier of the defense industry, facing off with giants
Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp. Now, it's his job to ensure
Raytheon's growth amid tight military spending in a consolidated
defense industry.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Burnham must capitalize on the empire that Picard
built.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham, 52, a midwesterner with an MBA and a penchant for fast
cars, intends to decentralize decision-making, reduce the company's
bureaucracy, and put Raytheon's 115,000 employees through a
quality-control training program. Another 14,000 defense workers
are scheduled to be laid off in coming months, a reduction Burnham
says is needed to improve efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham, a productivity expert, took similar steps at his
previous job, heading the aerospace units of AlliedSignal Inc. in
southern California. But at Raytheon, Burnham's initiatives may run
contrary to the hands-on management style of Picard, an engineer
more comfortable with aircraft-weight memorandums than with Wall
Street analysts. At least, company insiders expect more focus on
financial analysis.
</P>
<P>
   One telling sign: behind Burnham's desk sit two sleek computer
screens displaying the latest stock quotes and headlines from
Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned the technical side under one CEO and I'm going to
learn a hell of a lot of the financial side from another CEO,''
says William Swanson, chief of Raytheon's big defense business.
Warren Rudman, the retired New Hampshire senator who sits on
Raytheon's board, says Burnham's focus on new management techniques
will be a good fit for the newly bulked-up company. ``He's probably
right for the time,'' Rudman says.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews last week, Burnham and Picard noted the outgoing
chief executive had already begun some of the reforms, which they
say could save Raytheon as much as $1 billion over the next several
years.
</P>
<P>
   Picard agrees he has been tight-lipped to employees and to Wall
Street analysts about Raytheon's plans. But he attributes his stern
reputation to securities trading rules he says gagged him.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he asks, ``What's better, building a $20 billion
company or being nice to the Street?''
</P>
<P>
   Burnham inherits a complex legacy at Raytheon, whose 15,000
employees in Massachusetts at the end of 1997 trailed only Bell
Atlantic Corp. and Stop &AMP; Shop Supermarket Co. among the Bay
State's largest employers.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after becoming CEO in 1991, Picard tried to diversify
Raytheon into more civilian industries such as home appliances and
construction services to shield it from defense cutbacks. But he
switched course as military spending cuts following the end of the
Cold War prompted consolidation in the defense industry. Picard
says the company had to leap into the top echelon or be swamped by
competitors. In 1997, Raytheon spent $12.5 billion to buy large
defense units from Texas Instruments Inc. and Hughes Electronic
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The purchases will give Raytheon record revenue of about $20
billion this year, but they brought total debt to nearly $10
billion, putting pressure on earnings. To handle the integration of
the disparate units in California, Texas, and Arizona, board
members asked Picard to stay on as chief executive through 2000 or
so.
</P>
<P>
   Picard, now 66, says he declined because he had already stayed a
year longer than planned and had promised family members he would
step down to spend more time with his eight grandchildren. ``If I
was younger I would have accepted it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Raytheon named Burnham president and chief operating
officer last June and scheduled his appointment to become chief
executive this month. Sometime in 1999, Picard plans to turn over
the chairman's title as well.
</P>
<P>
   In the top job, Burnham will oversee a defense business _ which
represents about 75 percent of Raytheon's sales _ striving to win
Navy contracts worth billions of dollars to develop electronic gear
for destroyers and aircraft carriers. He also intends to improve
profits at the company's laggard engineering and construction unit,
which faces reduced demand for its power plant projects in Asia and
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Stock analysts think Burnham's goals are realistic, but note the
company depends heavily on limited Pentagon budgets. ``I think
they're shrewd, but obviously they have to win the contracts that
are coming up,'' says Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. analyst
Peter Aseritis. He rates Raytheon a `buy' and expects shares to
rise to between $65 to $70 by 2000; Raytheon Class B shares closed
at 53 13/16 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham says the management transition is going smoothly and
that employees speak their minds more now than when he first
arrived. ``I can't shut them up,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   While Burnham grew up in a Detroit suburb, he has significiant
New England roots. His parents moved there from the Boston area
during World War II, and his father was a manager at General Motors
Corp. The younger Burnham graduated from the University of New
Hampshire in 1970 with a master's degree in business
administration. After a three-month Army stint, he went to work as
a budget analyst for a division of RCA Computer Services, in
Marlborough. But within a year, he was laid off, he recalls, an
experience he says ``was as disruptive as a death in the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Broke, he was forced to move with his pregnant wife into the
home of his parents who had just retired to Atkinson, N.H. He
turned down the next job he was offered, with a local bank because
it seemed too dull.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought my parents were going to kill me,'' he recalls.
Instead Burnham went to work for Carborundum Co., a maker of
abrasive materials, becoming its controller at age 28. He joined
AlliedSignal Inc. in 1982 and by 1991 was named to head its large
aerospace division based in Torrance, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, the units faced a dramatic downturn in
military orders and he oversaw the layoffs of more than 10,000
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He walked into a situation that was collapsing at a fast rate,
and he had to create a consensus and make some fast decisions,''
recalls Joe Leonard, a Burnham appointee at AlliedSignal. But he
also brought in many new managers, aiming to find new markets for
the company's aviation components.
</P>
<P>
   From 1993 to 1997, annual sales grew 42 percent to $6.4 billion
and profits rose 130 percent to $515 million, according to a book
that describes Burnham's experience, ``Every Business is a Growth
Business,'' by consultant Ram Charan and Noel M. Tichy, a professor
at the University of Michigan.

   Moving to Boston over the summer, Burnham and his wife _ who now
have four grown children _ have rented an apartment in the
Financial District and are in the process of buying a Beacon Hill
townhouse. Burnham also brought his turbocharged Porsche from
California but regrets he doesn't have time to attend the
performance-driving courses he enjoys.
</P>
<P>
   At Raytheon, employees expect him to launch growth campaigns
similar to his initiatives at AlliedSignal. Along with the ongoing
Raytheon layoffs, Burnham replaced the company's top human
resources executive with General Electric Co. veteran Dennis
Donovan and named new legal and communications officers. Another
new vice president will be named this week, says Burnham, who adds
that he thinks the changes aren't so significant given Raytheon's
size.
</P>
<P>
   But on the shop floor, line employees say managers lately seem
more willing to discuss performance goals and attribute the changes
to Burnham. ``With Picard it was a like news blackout all the time.
You never knew where you stood,'' says Bill Guthrie, a Raytheon
electrician. Refering to Burnham, he says: ``It's amazing how
rapidly things can change.''
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon says increased communication with employees was taking
place before Burnham's arrival but only now is apparent to workers.
Picard himself says contact with line workers during the last six
months was ``a void'' because the company hadn't yet reorganized
following last year's multibillion-dollar acquisitions. ``We didn't
have anything to tell them,'' Picard says.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham also faces questions about just what obligations the
company took on in 1995, when state lawmakers granted its request
for large reductions in taxes and utility bills in exchange for
keeping its payroll and property holdings at certain levels in the
state. Picard told lawmakers those cuts were needed to keep its
missile plants in the state competitive. But in October, Raytheon
said it would lay off 1,200 in the state and close a large plant in
Waltham.
</P>
<P>
   The decision angered previous allies like Waltham Mayor Bill
Stanley, who now says he feels used for having testified on
Raytheon's behalf. Burnham says that's unfair because the tax cuts
improved the economic climate overall and says the company can
avoid further layoffs by improved productivity.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Picard says he will stay on the board, if asked,
after he steps down as chairman next year. Meanwhile, he plans to
continue living in Concord and to write a book, for which his
working title is ``Pragmatic Management.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a book about how it happens in real life, versus what you
learn in universities,'' where many business management tomes are
written, Picard says.
</P>
<P>
   He also plans to spend more time fishing for striped bass and
tuna off Cape Cod, in a 37-foot boat equipped with the latest in
Raytheon-built radar, fish-finders, and night-vision gear. Picard
says he looks forward to passing along, even from retirement, his
famously blunt reviews of the devices' performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to pity my Raytheon Marine people,'' he says.

TO IMPEACH, OR NOT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   She's just one little old lady of 82, in her activist sneakers,
with her homemade sign, standing on the sunny side of Harvard
Square. She stood outside the Coop with her petition for three
hours, till her feet got cold and she quit.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Iten Fales did not go home empty-handed Monday
afternoon. ``People were queueing up to sign my petition. It was
exhilarating. I got 300 signatures against this impeachment
business. There were men with suits and briefcases, lots of women
of every size and color and origin. There was one alcoholic who
signed. It was very interesting to see. When people smiled at my
sign, you could see they would sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Her sign said ``Clinton Stay, Starr Go Away'' on one side, and
``Clinton Stay, No Impeaching'' on the other. Mrs. Fales took her
stand in Harvard Square for two reasons. ``I saw a photograph in
the paper of a lady in southern California carrying a sign that
said `Impeachment ASAP'.''
</P>
<P>
   The other reason? ``I was born in Berlin, and lived through the
collapse of the Weimar Republic. I saw Germany disintegrate under
Hitler, and I know the signs. I am very sensitive to the beginnings
of dictatorship.'' She believes the Republican leaders in Congress
are plotting to overthrow the elected president in a conspiracy
with Kenneth Starr. ``I can see and smell the signs of an embyronic
takeover of our government.''
</P>
<P>
   Iten Fales is not a woman to be taken lightly. ``I've been
married twice, have four children, nine grandchildren, two
great-grandchildren. I've lived in Cambridge for 30 years. My
husband is an archeologist, who's dug in Cyprus; he's a Harvard
man. My husband, who is a cradle Republican, stood with me and
collected signatures. He even sent a $1,000 check to the Democratic
National Committee for the first time in his life.''
</P>
<P>
   This elderly couple gathering signatures in Cambridge is part of
the 60-percent-plus majority against impeachment. But most of the
intensity in the debate is on the other side, which is why the vote
in the US House Thursday or Friday is too close to predict and may
well go against Clinton. This governmental crisis, triggered by a
partisan four-year investigation of the presidency that cost
$40-plus million, now threatens to cost us a president and all his
policies to boot.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment drive, greased by right-wing Republican
congressional insiders, snuck up on the nation during Christmas
season. ``Jingle Bells, Ken Starr sells, Henry Hyde is on his way;
oh, what fun it is to ride all the way with Tom DeLay.'' And here
we are impeaching Bill; happy holidays, everyone!
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the ``It's not about ---- '' crowd: ``It's not
about sex, it's about (perjury, lying, misleading, trimming, not
being sufficiently repentant, etc., choose one or more).'' There's
the ``I'd be for censure if only Clinton would (admit he lied, wore
a different necktie, crossed-his-heart-and-hoped-to-die, held his
breath to the count of 30, etc.)
</P>
<P>
   There's not one vote for impeachment from the Commonwealth's 10
congressmen, all Democrats. But four New England Republicans, two
from Connecticut and two from New Hampshire, where the Manchester
Union Leader calls the tune, have come out for impeachment, joining
the chorus of GOP impeachers who insist this is a matter of
principle. Whenever I hear one party on Capitol Hill insist that an
issue is a matter of principle, I duck.
</P>
<P>
   This has been a Sun Belt rebellion from start to finish. With
nine of the 10 Republican congressional leaders from the South or
West, this struggle has been not only partisan and ideological, but
personal and geographical. The Republican House members, knuckled
by their right-wing leaders, decided to go with the anti-Clinton
flow, apparently fearful that they'd have trouble raising money or
evading primary challenges from conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans like Chuck Bass in New Hampshire and Nancy
Johnson in Connecticut may find that this vote will bring them down
November after next. Because the vote to impeach may become the
largest political mass suicide of the 20th century for Republicans
looking over their shoulder instead of two years into the future.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market last tanked bigtime on Aug. 31 of this year,
dumping 512 points off the Dow Jones Industrials, wiping out in one
trading day the paper gains of a full year. Fasten your 401(k) seat
belts for Thursday and Friday and next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A House vote to put Clinton on trial in the Senate for what he
did with a young woman and what he said about it afterward puts the
country in a terrible bind.
</P>
<P>
   A weakened, emasculated presidency imperils the world economy,
not just ours. War is never far over the horizon in the Middle
East. Are we supposed to take comfort in the belief that Saddam
Hussein will show more restraint than the Republican members of
Congress?
</P>
<P>
   The chorus for resignation resonates from the right, despite a
2-1 division in the citizenry against impeachment. Solid Midwestern
Republicans like Gerald Ford and Bob Dole say no, don't go there,
but the House is melting down.
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich's final stab at Clinton is this drift into the
impeachment Twilight Zone. Speaker-to-be Bob Livingston let
majority whip Tom ``The Hammer'' DeLay of Texas hijack the process.
Over the cliff they go, risking the House, the Senate, and the next
presidential campaign on their furious folly.

MEDICINE, LAW AT ODDS IN COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN McNAMARA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What happens when the ethical canons of law and medicine
collide?
</P>
<P>
   That's what Superior Court Judge Peter M. Lauriat must decide in
the case of Eric Brown, a 30-year-old Boston man facing trial for a
double murder in the city's South End.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's attorney wants his client to stop taking antipsychotic
drugs in order to allow a jury to see him in the throes of paranoid
schizophrenia, the mental condition he was in when he allegedly
gunned down Athos Oliveira, 30, and Thomas Meyer, 38, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's psychiatrist objects to a legal strategy designed to
intentionally worsen her patient's already tenuous mental health.
</P>
<P>
   In a pretrial hearing concluded Tuesday, both the lawyer and the
doctor claimed to have Eric Brown's interests at heart; the problem
is that those distinct interests are very much in conflict. Bernard
Grossberg's obligation is to provide his client with a ``zealous
defense.'' Dr. Inguenn Hodgson's responsibility to her patient is
to ``first, do no harm.''
</P>
<P>
   He cannot do his job if she insists upon doing hers.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's is only the most recent murder case to demonstrate that
a criminal courtroom is the wrong venue to deal with mental
illness, no matter how violently expressed.
</P>
<P>
   From John Salvi, the abortion avenger, to Theodore Kaczynski,
the Unabomber, to Russell Weston Jr., the deranged gunman who shot
and killed two police officers in the US Capitol last summer, the
judicial system finds itself ill-equipped to deal with horrific
acts perpetrated by men who belong in psych wards, not cell blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Paranoid schizophrenics present a particular challenge to a
lawyer trying to mount an insanity defense. One characteristic of
the condition is the ability to plot and scheme, even while in the
grip of paranoid delusions. Given the misconceptions about mental
illness, it is not surprising that juries often interpret evidence
of rational planning as confirmation that a defendant is a faker,
his insanity plea nothing more than a staged act of desperation.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, the Supreme Judicial Court reinforced our
ignorance about schizophrenia in 1983 when it set aside the murder
conviction of a defendant who claimed that his right to a fair
trial had been compromised by the refusal of the trial judge to
allow the jury to see him in an unmedicated state.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a case where an insanity defense is raised, the jury are
(sic) likely to assess the weight of the various pieces of evidence
before them with reference to the defendant's demeanor. Further, if
the defendant appears calm and controlled at trial, the jury may
well discount any testimony that the defendant lacked, at the time
of the crime, substantial capacity either to appreciate the
wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the
requirements of the law,'' the court wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability to present expert testimony describing the effect
of medication on the defendant is not an adequate substitute. At
best, such testimony would serve only to mitigate the unfair
prejudice which may accrue to the defendant as a consequence of his
controlled outward appearance. It cannot compensate for the
positive value to the defendant's case of his own demeanor in an
unmedicated condition.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, hearing that a defendant is mentally ill from
his doctors pales next to actually seeing him have a psychotic
episode at the defense table.
</P>
<P>
   What would that look like exactly? Would a videotape of an
unmedicated Eric Brown show him responding to voices heard only by
himself? Would he behave erratically or sit silently?
</P>
<P>
   What would happen after Brown had been psychotic enough to be
captured on videotape? Grossberg said the plan would be to resume
his medication. But would stability return, in turn?
</P>
<P>
   The hallmark _ and Achilles' heel _ of psychiatry is the
unwillingness of its practitioners to say, ``We don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Rosmarin, a psychiatrist called by the defense
Tuesday, brought himself to the brink of such humility but was
unable to cross the threshold.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Dr. Rosmarin's testimony was laced with qualifiers
about the consequences of destabalizing a mentally ill man, with
the effects variously described as ``speculative,'' ``relative,''
``potential,'' ``hopeful,'' ``probable,'' ``anecdotal,'' and
``inferential.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Brown's psychiatrist at Bridgewater (Mass.) State Hospital
is a woman of considerably fewer words. This whole idea, she
rightly noted, is simply ``unethical.''

HIGGINBOTHAM'S MESSAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When A. Leon Higginbotham wrote his scalding admonition to newly
confirmed Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, it was a letter
meant not only for the eyes of Thomas but for all who have
benefited from the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you may not want to be burdened by the memory of their
sacrifices,'' Higginbotham wrote in 1991. ``But I also know that
you have no right to forget that victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Higginbotham, 70, the chief federal judge and scholar who fought
to preserve victories in civil rights and affirmative action, died
of a stroke Monday in Boston. Except for the late Supreme Court
Justice Thurgood Marshall, few people were as filled with the
history of the legal fight against racism as was Higginbotham. That
history was in the missive to Thomas. The following is the part of
the letter in which Higginbotham challenges Thomas's criticism of
civil rights leaders who ``bitch, bitch, bitch, moan and moan,
whine and whine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I suggest, Justice Thomas, that you should ask yourself every
day what would have happened to you if there had never been a
Charles Hamilton Houston, a William Henry Hastie, a Thurgood
Marshall, and that small cadre of other lawyers associated with
them, who laid the groundwork for success in the 20th-century
racial civil rights cases. If there had never been an effective
NAACP, isn't it highly probable that you might still be in Pin
Point, Ga., working as a laborer as some of your relatives did for
decades?
</P>
<P>
   ``The philosophy of civil rights protest evolved out of the fact
that black people were forced to confront this country's racist
institutions. For example, in January of 1941, A. Philip Randolph
planned a march in Washington, D.C., to protest widespread
employment discrimination in the defense industry. In order to
avoid the prospect of a demonstration by potentially tens of
thousands of blacks, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt issued
Executive Order 8802 barring discrimination in defense industries
or government.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1940, President Roosevelt appointed William Henry Hastie as
civilian aide to Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson. Hastie fought
tirelessly against discrimination, but when confronted with an
unabated program of segregation in all areas of the armed forces,
he resigned. His visible and dramatic protest sparked the move
toward integrating the armed forces, with immediate and
far-reaching results in the Army Air Corps. A. Philip Randolph and
William Hastie understood _ though I wonder if you do _ what
Frederick Douglass meant when he wrote: `If there is no struggle,
there is no progress.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Though the Brown decision was issued only six years after your
birth, the road to Brown started more than a century earlier. It
started when Prudence Crandall was arrested in Connecticut in 1833
for attempting to provide schooling for colored girls. It was
continued in 1849 when Charles Sumner, a white lawyer and
abolitionist, and Benjamin Roberts, a black lawyer, challenged
segregated schools in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was continued as the NAACP, starting with Charles Hamilton
Houston's suit, Murray V. Pearson, in 1936, challenged Maryland's
policy of excluding blacks from the University of Maryland Law
School. It was continued . . . when Houston challenged a 1937
decision of the Missouri Supreme Court. The Missouri courts held
that because law schools in Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, and Nebraska
accepted Negroes, a 25-year-old black citizen of Missouri was not
being denied his constitutional right to equal protection under the
law when he was excluded from the only state-supported law school
in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was continued in Sweatt v. Painter in 1946, when Heman
Marion Sweatt filed suit for admission to the Law School of the
University of Texas after his application was rejected solely
because he was black . . . It was continued in a series of cases
against the University of Oklahoma, when, in 1950, in McLaurin v.
Oklahoma, G.W. McLaurin, a 68-year-old man, applied to the
University of Oklahoma to obtain a doctorate in education. He had
earned his master's degree in 1948, and had been teaching at
Langston University, the state's college for Negroes. Yet he was
`required to sit apart at . . . designated desk(s) in an anteroom
adjoining the classroom (and) on the mezzanine floor of the library
and to sit at a designated table and to eat at a different time
from the other students.'
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1960s, it was the conservatives, including the
then-senatorial candidate from Texas, George Bush, the
then-Governor from California, Ronald Reagan, and the omnipresent
Senator Strom Thurmond, who argued that the 1964 Civil Rights Act
was unconstitutional. If 27 years ago, George Bush, Ronald Reagan,
and Strom Thurmond had succeeded, there would have been no position
for you to fill as assistant secretary for civil rights in the
Department of Education. There would have been no such agency as
the Equal Employment Commission for you to chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the conservative agenda . . . had been implemented, what
would have been the results of the important Supreme Court cases
that now protect your rights? Charles Bowser, a distinguished
African-American Philadelphia lawyer, said, ``I'd be willing to bet
. . . not one of the senators who voted to confirm Clarence Thomas
would hire him as their lawyer.' ''

ON DEER HUNTER'S TRAIL, RIVALS AND A SPOOF 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's open season on Deer Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   Since its debut last holiday season, more than a million copies
of the lo-fi Bambi-hunting simulation have been shipped, and
bandwagoneers have spawned countless imitations.
</P>
<P>
   Walk into a computer store or a Wal-Mart, which commissioned
Deer Hunter in the first place, and you'll see a wall of
rifle-and-shotgun expeditions to every hunting ground on earth, to
say nothing of the fishing titles.
</P>
<P>
   GT Interactive Software, which publishes Deer Hunter under its
Wizardworks label, has made a cottage industry out of the genre,
releasing a herd of follow-up titles into the retail wilderness:
Deer Hunter Extended Season (the add-on pack), Rocky Mountain
Trophy Hunter, Bird Hunter, Bow Hunter, Deer Hunter II 3D and
Browning Elk Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   Partridge in a Pear Tree Hunter is presumably in the works for
holiday '99. But in the meantime, we can look forward to Alaskan
Expedition, which adds grizzly bears and caribou to the menu, and
Grand Slam Turkey Hunt, which is endorsed by the National Wild
Turkey Federation. (There are 2.5 million wild-turkey hunters in
the United States, and their software needs will not be denied.)
</P>
<P>
   For people who like shooting things on screen but don't
necessarily consider themselves the ``hunting type,'' there is
Carnivores for PC (www.wizworks.com), which takes Deer Hunter back
to the Jurassic age so players can trudge through steamy
prehistoric jungles in search of tyrannosaurs, triceratops and
velociraptors.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the standard shotgun, crossbow and sniper rifle,
you get tranquilizer darts. But basically, it's the same game.
Hunker down, wait for the critters to appear, then shoot them. It's
obviously a formula that works.
</P>
<P>
   Even hard-core console developers have ventured into the woods
with titles like TNN Outdoors Pro Hunter (www.tnnhunter.com), which
harnesses the Unreal engine (the software that powered this year's
breakthrough first-person shooter) to produce an experience that
combines real-world wildlife with the modus operandi of Quake
(i.e., shoot anything that moves).
</P>
<P>
   Instead of going after a single prey species, as in most hunting
titles, TNN Outdoors Pro Hunter lets you pick off anything that
crosses your path, from white-tailed deer and elk to wild turkeys,
doves, rabbits and quail.
</P>
<P>
   If you are really determined and an excellent shot, you can fire
at squirrels. And you can do it with a .357 Magnum. It's a starkly
absurd comment on the National Rifle Association's party line. Or a
good laugh, depending on your politics.
</P>
<P>
   But more than anything, the confluence of Deer Hunter and Doom
illustrates that most computer games are hunting games. You may be
gunning for terrorists or space aliens (be vewy vewy qwiet, I'm
hunting extwa-tewwestwials) but you're still stalking and shooting.
Hunting games are everywhere, and people don't seem to have a
problem with them _ as long as they're figurative.
</P>
<P>
   It's only the literal hunting games that push our buttons
because real-world recreational hunting is freighted with
associations about culture, politics and social class. Deer
Hunter's mind-boggling commercial success shows us something about
how the demographics of computing have changed since PC's dipped
below the $1,000 mark, now that people are buying software for
$19.99 at Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   Computer software, once a medium of the elite, is becoming a
medium for the masses. And that creates a certain amount of tension
for the former.
</P>
<P>
   And where there is tension, there is humor. Witness Deer
Avenger, a parody of Deer Hunter by Brian McCann, a staff writer on
``Late Night With Conan O'Brien,'' published by Simon &AMP; Schuster
Interactive. You play the title character, Bambo, a camouflage-clad
buck out for blood.
</P>
<P>
   Your arsenal includes a slingshot loaded with deer dung, an
M-16, a bazooka and a stream of snide one-liners. Your quarry is
big-bellied rednecks, goofy Minnesotans. Oh, yeah, and
over-equipped yuppies _ moronic cartoons irresistibly drawn to
hunter calls like, ``Help! I'm naked and I have a pizza!''
</P>
<P>
   Like Deer Hunter, the game offers you a choice of locations:
Connecticut (``picturesque, peaceful Colonial New England. A
breathtaking backdrop for vengeance''); Minnesota in winter
(``10,000 frozen lakes and a lot of dumb hunters'') and West
Virginia (``come for the hunting, stay for the wacky dancing,
banjo-playing, inbred freaks'').
</P>
<P>
   Deer Avenger makes fun of the software, cracking jokes at Deer
Hunter's low-resolution graphics and interminable pace. ``So,'' the
deer snorts, ``this is what you bought a Pentium for. Can you
believe how great these graphics are? This action alone is worth
the price of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, it just pokes fun at hunters. Instead of deer
droppings and tree scratchings, they leave beer cans, toilet paper
and freshly wrinkled pornographic magazines. When you spot them,
you hear, ``Well, well, well, if it isn't that guy from
`Deliverance,''' or an audio clip of dueling banjos. And when they
die, they say things like, ``I'm coming to meet you, Beulah!''
</P>
<P>
   Some laughs are more comfortable than others. It's easy to laugh
at yuppie sportsmen with their cellular phones and sport utility
vehicles and Ralph Lauren hunting outfits because when you're
making fun of people at the top of the socioeconomic totem pole,
humor is a leveling device. And if you happen to be one of those
people, it's self-deprecating charm because you can afford to take
a shot at yourself.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're making fun of the beer-swilling, tobacco-chewing,
incestuous rednecks, it's a less comfortable laugh because you're
spitting down. (Unless you happen to be a redneck, in which case
it's recreational self-loathing, which can also be quite funny.)
</P>
<P>
   Deer Avenger takes a lot of cheap shots at what the software
industry euphemistically calls the ``Deer Hunter demographic.'' But
it's good to see products like this coming out of the New York
media establishment because parody, not imitation, is the sincerest
form of flattery. It validates Deer Hunter's success in a way that
the copycats cannot.
</P>
<P>
   As the killer buck likes to say, ``Bonjour, Bubba.''

</P>
<P>
   Vanilla wafer crust:
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups vanilla wafer crumbs (see Note)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup fine-ground dry roasted peanuts
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
</P>
<P>
   Peanut butter mousse:
</P>
<P>
   3 (8-ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
</P>
<P>
   1 cup creamy peanut butter
</P>
<P>
   1 cup confectioners' sugar

   CHRISTMAS CRANBERRY GALETTE
</P>
<P>
   Serves 8
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup granulated sugar, preferably superfine, divided
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup packed light brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   3 cups fresh or frozen cranberries, picked over
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup walnuts, coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   Pie-crust dough for a 14-inch free-form tart
</P>
<P>
   Confectioners' sugar
</P>
<P>
   At least 1 1/2 hours and no more than 24 hours ahead of baking,
place the superfine sugar (reserving 1 teaspoon for the border) and
the light brown sugar in a medium bowl and use your fingertips to
combine them and rub out lumps of brown sugar. Cut each cranberry
in half and add the halves to the sugar mixture. Stir the mixture
well and set it aside for 1 hour at room temperature or,
preferably, overnight in the refrigerator. Stir the cranberry
mixture well, then stir in the walnuts.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 400 degrees at least 20 minutes before
baking. Roll the pastry into a circle roughly 18 inches in diameter
on a floured pastry cloth or two sheets of lightly floured plastic
wrap. Using an expandable flan ring, or using a sharp knife and a
cardboard template as a guide, cut out a 16-inch circle. If the
dough has softened, slip it (still on the cloth or plastic wrap)
onto a baking sheet and refrigerate it for about 30 minutes,
covered, until firm, before lining the pan. The pastry is too large
to slip your hands under and support adequately. When rolled (and
chilled, if necessary), transfer to a 12-to-14-inch flat, round
heavy steel pizza pan or an inverted baking sheet, preferably
black. To transfer it to the pan, roll it loosely over the rolling
pin or dust it lightly with flour and fold in quarters, then unfold
on pan. Leave the overhang.
</P>
<P>
   Scatter the cranberry mixture evenly over the dough, covering a
13-inch area and leaving a 1 1/2-inch border. Fold the overhanging
border of dough over the outer edge of the cranberries, using your
fingers to pleat it loosely at even intervals. Brush this border
with a little milk or water and sprinkle on the reserved sugar.
(This will give the border a crunchy texture.) Cut a 10-inch round
of foil and place it gently over the cranberries, leaving the crust
uncovered. Bake the galette for 30 minutes. If not using a black
pan, plan to bake the galette directly on the oven floor;
alternatively, set an oven rack at the lowest level and place a
baking stone or cookie sheet on it before preheating.
</P>
<P>
   After 30 minutes, cover the tart with a second round of foil
large enough to cover the filling and the crust border and continue
baking for about 10 minutes more, or until the bottom crust is
golden brown. (Slip a small, angled metal spatula or flexible knife
under the edge of the tart, lifting it slightly, to check
doneness.)
</P>
<P>
   Cool the tart on the pan on a rack for about 20 minutes or until
warm. Dust with confectioners' sugar.

RIDING AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If voice, data, and Internet traffic is like water spewing out
of a garden hose, imagine 10 to 30 times more water coming out of
the hose.
</P>
<P>
   Sycamore Networks Inc. wants to build a new type of high-volume
nozzle that directs the gusher as well as the meters needed to
measure it.
</P>
<P>
   Within the last 10 years, fiber-optic glass cables have widely
replaced bulky copper wires to accommodate long distance voice and
data communications. And with the growth of the Internet,
telecommunications carriers have built extensive glass fiber
networks that carry pulses of light to handle the load.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, fiber-optic lines carried data at the rate of 10
billion bits a second. However, a new technology, known as dense
wavelength division multiplexing, promises to significantly
increase the volume of data transmitted on a single glass wire.
</P>
<P>
   The multiplexing equipment, used by carriers, acts like a prism
by splitting a beam of light into 10 to 30 streams. That enables
one fiber-optic cable to move data at the rate of 100 billion to
300 billion bits of information a second. The result is a mammoth
increase in traffic without digging up streets or stringing new
cables on telephone poles.
</P>
<P>
   Capturing and managing this high speed flow of data is the
mission of Sycamore and several other companies. They want to build
the routing and measuring equipment required to funnel these
voluminous light streams to corporate customers.
</P>
<P>
   Company founder and chairman Desh Deshpande and president Daniel
Smith estimate there's a $20 billion annual market for the new
generation of optical networking equipment. Customers include local
and long distance telephone companies along with other independent
carriers, Internet service providers, and cable television service
companies.
</P>
<P>
   These customers, in turn, would sell optical networking services
to corporate customers and consumers.

SURPRISINGLY SIMPLE DESSERTS FOR THE HOLIDAY TABLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To compete with the glitz and glitter of the holiday, it's
imperative that your buffet be exuberant. Big, over-the-top
desserts are a must-bake.
</P>
<P>
   But those stunners don't have to be difficult to make. Here are
four centerpiece desserts, including this macadamia fudge torte,
that will bring a chorus of hallelujahs from your guests.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   TRIFLE
</P>
<P>
   Serves 8-12
</P>
<P>
   1 loaf day-old poundcake, cut into thick slices
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup raspberry, blackberry, strawberry or currant jam,
seedless
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup slivered almonds
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup grated fresh coconut, optional
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup dry sherry
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup PLUS 2 tablespoons brandy
</P>
<P>
   2 cups half-and-half
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon cornstarch
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   5 large egg yolks, well-beaten
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   2 cups heavy cream, whipped
</P>
<P>
   Whole almonds and/or strawberries, optional, for garnishes
</P>
<P>
   Select a large glass bowl and arrange cake slices to cover the
bottom completely (you can cut pieces to patch with). Spread
thickly with jam, then sprinkle with a few slivered almonds and
coconut, if desired. Sprinkle generously with sherry and brandy.
Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   In the top of a double boiler, heat half-and-half to the point
of boiling. Remove from heat. Mix cornstarch and sugar together,
then stir into egg yolks. Add a few tablespoons of the hot
half-and-half to yolks to warm them, then a few more tablespoons to
make mixture liquid and pourable.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the heat (over barely simmering water), pour warmed
yolks into cream, stirring all the while. Continue to cook until
custard becomes thick and smooth. Don't let it boil, because this
will cause it to curdle. Remove from heat, then stir in vanilla.
</P>
<P>
   Allow custard to cool, then pour a heavy layer over the cake in
the bowl. Make another layer of cake, followed by the jam and so on
as before, then cover with more custard. When you have used up all
the ingredients (except whipped cream and optional almonds and
strawberries), top with whipped cream and garnish with nuts and
fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Cover and allow to chill in refrigerator for at least half a day
before serving, to let flavors meld.
</P>
<P>
   Additional fresh fruit, nuts and/or coconut may be sprinkled on
top.

STARTUPS TURN TO CASH-RICH GIANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A &UR;  &LR; pathway to profits? Or a road to regrets?
</P>
<P>
   Glenn House had stood at this crossroad before, as vice
president for strategy at an Oregon software company. There he
sought out young companies with promising technology that suited
his employer's needs, invested in them _ and when all went well,
tried to engineer an acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring he was on the other side of the intersection, as
chief executive of a two-year-old Cambridge, Mass. company, Atreve
Software Inc., since renamed WebSpective Inc., now headquartered in
Needham, Mass. The company produces load-balancing applications
that smooth out delivery of Internet Web pages, and needed
investment cash.
</P>
<P>
   Up stepped Cisco Systems Inc., the $8.5-billion California maker
of computer servers used to direct Internet traffic, wanting to
join in the financing alongside three venture funds.
</P>
<P>
   House, who says WebSpective ultimately wants to go public and
not be taken over, cheerfully said yes _ joining the increasing
ranks of technology-based start-ups forging cash-rich alliances
with big firms, each side hoping to gain benefits that outweigh the
potential pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Once viewed as a sure avenue to a takeover and resisted by many
small companies, strategic relationships, partnerships, and
alliances betwen giant technology and entrepreneurial start-ups are
growing in number and frequency, reflecting the complexity of the
Internet, telecommunications, and technology in general.
</P>
<P>
   And rich with the profits of their own successes _ Microsoft
Corp. alone has $17 billion in spare cash _ companies such as
Microsoft, Cisco, Intel Corp., and Novell Inc. are welcomed as
allies in promoting the development of software or other products.
Along with the cachet that comes from associating with a big gun,
small companies say they gain broader understanding of their
industry and leads on new customers.
</P>
<P>
   Also, House added, teaming up with a giant familiar with the
Internet world is a form of insurance. ``You want to work with a
big partner who, when things get tough, understands the dynamics of
the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the big companies say while they hope to make
money on these investments, their purpose is to support development
of any product that will lead to greater use of their own
technologies. ``This is a limited way of outsourcing our research
and development,'' said Chris Stone, Novell's investment overseer.
Microsoft's senior director of business development, Greg Stanger,
said: ``We want to make sure that everyone who is going to develop
something based on Windows, regardless of what they might say in
the press, is going to do as good a job as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, big companies like being able to buy access to
fresh perspectives. Ammar Hanafi of Cisco says his company's $2
million investment in Atreve and companies like it provide insight
``on some of the issues of electronic commerce and that Web-based
companies face. We get to work with entrepreneurial people.''
</P>
<P>
   The money these big fish have available to pass down the food
chain is overwhelming. Microsoft says it now has 45 such
investments, ranging from $1 million in several small start-ups to
the multimillion-dollar stake it has in Andover-based CMG
Information Services Inc. and a $1 billion investment made in
Comcast Corp. last year. The company also plans to put up to $100
million more into technology-focused venture funds.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems since 1995 has made about 40 investments, between
$1 million and $5 million each. Hanafi won't disclose the total but
says about three quarters of these investments are aimed at
``technologies that are emerging, where it is important for us to
know what is going on.'' Like most of his peers, he hopes to make
money on these _ but that's not paramount.
</P>
<P>
   Novell, which set aside $100 million earlier this year for
partnership investments, so far has put $20 million into nine
companies, mostly in California. His prime objective is to help
entrepreneurs who are developing software to support Novell's
Network Service Directory initiative _ a program that aims to link
every computer system in the world, in the same way corporate
computer networks now can perform on a limited scale.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics about corporate investments are elusive. ``It is very
difficult to get the entire picture about what corporations are
doing. A lot of it is strategic and they are not likely to talk,''
said Jean Yaremchuk, research director at VentureOne, a California
company that tracks venture capital investments.
</P>
<P>
   VentureOne's limited count for 1997 found 46 investments in
start-ups by corporations or corporate investment arms, for a total
of $482 million. Through the first nine months of this year,
VentureOne identified 27 such investments totaling $460 million _ a
61 percent jump per round.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Lerner, a Harvard Business School professor, thinks as much
as 30 percent of all investment in start-up companies may come from
corporations. This estimate includes participation in privately
managed venture fund rounds, where individual dollar contributions
by funds and corporate players aren't broken out. That was the case
in Cisco's investment in Atreve.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is corporate investment in venture funds, also
seldom disclosed. Lerner and Paul Gompers at the National Bureau of
Economic Research in Cambridge found through VentureOne data that
30 percent of all venture fund investment in 1997 was from
corporations _ triple the average for the preceding 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The last such wave of corporate involvement in start-ups was
around 1980, when windfall oil profits and gains from defense
buildups created mountains of cash for investment _ and led to such
flops as Raytheon Co.'s ill-fated entry into commercial data
processing and Exxon Corp.'s failed attempt to build office
computers and fax machines. The current burst, says Lerner, is ``on
a lot better footing, far better thought out.''
</P>
<P>
   This time around the buyers are zeroing in on technology. And,
although there are significant exceptions _ Microsoft's $425
million acquisition of WebTV last year is one _ they usually don't
want full control _ just insights. ``We target companies that meet
our own strategy,'' says Stone of Novell.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Langer, a Boston business consultant who specializes in
partnerships, says the model for this activity was set in the
pharmaceutical industry, which ``couldn't develop drugs fast
enough'' to keep up with gains in entrepreneurial biotechnology.
Microsoft was among the first high-tech firms to take the cue, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although alluring, partnerships are also risky. James Dolce,
chief executive at Redstone Communications Inc. in Westford, Mass.,
warns that taking money from one company can lock a small firm out
of deals with others. ``The small company can't afford to put all
its eggs in one basket,'' he said. Avid Technologies Inc.'s William
Warner also warns against giving a single investor so much control
that ``they start to push the company toward ends that meet only
that one corporation's needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel Corp.'s desire to invest $2 million in ServiceSoft Corp.
of Needham last winter raised another concern for ServiceSoft chief
executive David Tarrent. Intel was a customer for his diagnostic
software, and ``bringing a customer into the inner sanctum'' made
him nervous. ``But once we did the deal they were so supportive. .
. . Previously it was a business deal. Suddenly they became our
buddies.'' One otherwise unattainable reward: Contacts with
important computer industry standards-setting committees, who write
agendas for future product development.
</P>
<P>
   Not all stories have such a happy ending, to be sure.
</P>
<P>
   America Online Inc. and Banyan Systems Inc. of Westborough,
Mass. became best of friends in 1995 when Banyan, a money-losing
local area network supplier, decided to shift into Internet
products. The first was Switchboard.com, a telephone listing site,
which AOL agreed to feature on its computer network that now has 14
million members. Along with a deal to share advertising sales
revenues, AOL invested $3 million in Banyan's Switchboard
subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Then AOL began pulling the plug. First it announced a rival to
Switchboard, InfoSpace Inc., will get the ``white pages''
individual listings when the Banayn contract expires Jan. 1. Last
week came the second blow: The ``yellow pages'' commercial listings
will go to a Bell Atlantic Corp.-GTE Corp. partnership.
</P>
<P>
   AOL said along with $31 million in upfront payments, the Bell
Atlantic-GTE combo offered an experienced Yellow Pages sales force
to sell local advertising _ an enormous, untapped market for
Internet revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Banyan's chief financial officer, Richard Spaulding, says AOL
isn't pulling its investment. And AOL's imprint attracted other
Internet partners, including the top-rated AltaVista ``portal
page,'' and corporate subscribers who pay for add-on services.
</P>
<P>
   Outcomes such as these, says Lerner, the Harvard professor, are
perhaps the greatest value of such partnerships. ``We're talking
here about visibility and credibility,'' he said, ``that would be
difficult to get in any other way.''

<P>
   Sometimes the success of a season is defined late in the
proceedings, in the harsh reality of football in December when the
stakes are high and the energy level low, sapped after a full
regular season and three weeks of playoff competition.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it comes earlier than that. Much earlier. Like in
August, before practice begins.
</P>
<P>
   Some teams know their fate, know that playing for championships
is merely a goal, not a wish.
</P>
<P>
   At the Division 1-AA level, Georgia Southern knew. ``The goal of
this team since August has been to win the national championship,''
said coach Paul Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Simple statement, without a hint of boastfulness. That's what
happens when you are at a program which has produced four national
championships, dating back to the marvelous days of Erk Russell,
who compiled an 83-22-1 record and won three national titles in an
eight-year span from 1981-89.
</P>
<P>
   Now, four days away from its final game of 1998, Georgia
Southern is approaching the summit one more time. Fourteen games
have turned into 14 wins. Only the University of Massachusetts
stands in the way of a perfect Eagle landing.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, whose link to Russell is stronger than that of the two
coaches who followed Russell when he stepped aside following his
third national championship in 1989, knows the bar has been set
high enough that a loss will wash out much of the joy of the
season. ``We've not accomplished the final goal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Georgia Southern, the story probably begins in 1981 when
Russell, a longtime Georgia assistant, revived the football program
after a 40-year hiatus.
</P>
<P>
   By 1985, the Eagles had a national championship. Johnson, a
member of that staff before moving to the Division 1-A level at
Hawaii, remembrs the excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big part of the state got involved,'' he said by phone from
his office in Statesboro, Ga. &UR;  &LR; ``It was just a great feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   In the years following Russell's retirement, the excitement
faded. The Eagles faded into the also-ran pack. When Johnson
returned two years ago, he knew he had to rebuild once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were real young a year ago,'' said Johnson, who has
reestablished a link with Russell that had been missing for nearly
a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson says he has watched UMass on tape and assumes nothing.
``You don't get to where you are without being good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he sees in UMass a lot of what he saw at Georgia
Southern in 1985 _ a sense of excitement and enthusiasm that comes
with new experiences.
</P>
<P>
   For Georgia Southern, the experiences also have been pleasant,
especially in the playoffs. The Eagles rolled over Colgate and
Connecticut before trouncing Western Illinois, 42-14, in last
weekend's semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   With quarterback Greg Hill and fullback Adrian Peterson, the
Eagles offense has produced at a championship pace for most of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson thinks he knows what UMass's strategy will be. ``It's
simple,'' he said. ``They're going to try and hold the ball.
``Obviously, they have done a pretty good job of that or they
wouldn't still be here. They beat two outstanding teams on the
road, and you have to be pretty good to have done that in the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Southern is pretty good as well. The Eagles, whose only
losing season since 1981 came two years ago, now have a chance to
match Russell's 15-0 record of 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Russell feels they are back to where they once were. ``For a
while, I think we were letting everything slip away,'' Russell told
the Atlanta Constitution this week. ``But it is suddenly all back.
I feel like I'm a real part of things around here and I've felt
like that forever. But that's particularly true now that the
program is in good hands.''
</P>
<P>
   All that's missing is for the Eagles to get their hands on
another national championship trophy.

A HOLIDAY GUIDE TO NEW BOOKS FOR CHILDREN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Accent mark needed over e in Coppelia) 
 
By JANE P. MARSHALL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Snowy nights and Jedi knights. Ancient heroes and new heroines.
Tales retold, reprinted, recited. Cupid shooting, hamsters
counting, dolls dancing.
</P>
<P>
   New children's books on a wild variety of subjects pour into
stores this time of year, enticing, beckoning, pleading. They stuff
shelves along with thousands of old books waiting to be uncovered
or rediscovered.
</P>
<P>
   But the new ones are a challenge _ not tried and true like Pooh.
</P>
<P>
   To help guide holiday shoppers through the maze, we have
selected these books from hundreds of newly published works. A
couple _ ``Miss Spider's ABC'' and ``10 Minutes Till Bedtime'' _
are the latest from popular authors who have, once again, lived up
to their creative past.
</P>
<P>
   Others scatter off in many directions, like children at recess.
Each one is for giving _ to newborns (the perfect time to begin a
library), to X-Generation ``Star Wars'' freaks who will probably
find minute errors in the fact-filled books, to great-grandmas who
no longer see the tiny print of their beloved Jane Austen or P.D.
James but who will glow at bright art and short yet wise stories.
</P>
<P>
   Each is gloriously special.
</P>
<P>
   The best holiday present is hugs and kisses and reading
together.
</P>
<P>
   The second best is a book.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``10 Minutes Till Bedtime'' by Peggy Rathmann (Putnam,
$16.99).
</P>
<P>
   We never learn the name of the little boy, but we know he has a
very unusual hamster. Via the Internet, the hamster offers a
10-minute bedtime tour centered around the child. The tour is for
hamsters only and boasts free snacks and clean restrooms; families
welcome.
</P>
<P>
   When Dad announces, ``10 minutes till bedtime,'' the tour _ with
hamsters on motorcycles, in tour buses and in motor homes _ begins
and stays with the little boy in fuzzy green slippers through his
whole bedtime routine.
</P>
<P>
   Rathmann, who won the 1996 Caldecott Medal for ``Officer Buckle
and Gloria,'' offers the cutest, most charming counting book to
come along in a long time. Well, maybe it's not a counting book at
all. Maybe it's about imagination. Maybe it's about what pets
really do when we aren't watching.
</P>
<P>
   The book has hundreds of hamsters, one dad, one little boy, 10
numbers and three words. A work of genius and an utter delight.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Snow'' by Uri Shulevitz (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $16).
</P>
<P>
   This utterly enchanting story by the much-awarded Shulevitz
tells what happens to a gray city and one little child when a
snowflake falls. The wonderful art dances with color and shape. The
story is about the power of color, of a child and of believing.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Sitting Ducks'' by Michael Bedard (Putnam &AMP; Grosset,
$15.99).
</P>
<P>
   This is a silly, wonderful story about a duck factory run by
alligators _ alligators who eat ducks. One day an egg rolls off the
conveyor belt, a duck hops out, and a worker-alligator sneaks him
home in a lunch bucket.
</P>
<P>
   They become unlikely friends, and the alligator decides not to
fatten and eat the duck as originally planned. The duck, being a
curious duck, goes on an adventure and finds ... well, we won't
tell you. What he was trying to find was Ducktown.
</P>
<P>
   The illustrations are better than anything on Saturday morning
television. You end up loving the ducks and the alligators. Perhaps
there is a lesson here.
</P>
<P>
   Nah, probably not. Just a clever and charming story with a happy
ending.
</P>
<P>
   But beware _ this will become a child's favorite to be read over
and over and over.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``My Name Is Georgia'' by Jeanette Winter (Harcourt Brace,
$16).
</P>
<P>
   ``My Name Is Georgia'' tells, for 6- to 10-year-olds, the story
of Georgia O'Keeffe, her childhood and her yearning for sky.
Illustrations mimic, in a respectful and enchantingly childlike
way, O'Keeffe's art.
</P>
<P>
   Winter shows and tells children about what inspired O'Keeffe and
about the legacy she left for us all. In a broader sense, the book
is about following dreams and touching others with art.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Miss Spider's ABC'' by David Kirk (Scholastic, $16.95).
</P>
<P>
   Miss Spider is back, this time with the alphabet.
</P>
<P>
   Insects from A to Z are coming to Miss Spider's birthday
surprise party. Kirk, toymaker turned best-selling children's book
writer and artist, has no surprises here. His insects are as lively
and brilliantly colorful as usual. The publishers recommend this
book for ages 4 through 7.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``A World of Words: An ABC of Quotations'' by Tobi Tobias,
illustrated by Peter Malone (Lothrop, Lee &AMP; Shepard, $16).
</P>
<P>
   Tobias and Malone ingeniously use quotations from literature to
spell out the alphabet. Example: C is for circus, and the quote is,
``when god decided to invent everything he took one breath bigger
than a circustent and everything began'' by e.e. cummings. Quotes
are by Emily Dickinson, William Shakespeare, Carl Sandburg,
Langston Hughes, J.R.R. Tolkien and others. The paintings mix
whimsy with emotion.
</P>
<P>
   This is a special book for young and old.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Boshblobberbosh'' by J. Patrick Lewis, illustrated by Gary
Kelley (Harcourt Brace, $18).
</P>
<P>
   One of the quotations in the Tobi Tobias book is from Edward
Lear (``The Owl and the Pussy-Cat''), who inspired Lewis' clever
``Boshblobberbosh.'' Whenever Lear was at a loss for a word, he
made one up. He made up words like ``jumblies,'' ``fizzgiggious
fish,'' ``oblong oysters'' and ``quangle wangle.'' The word
``bosh'' means ``nonsense''; Lear invented worlds of bosh.
</P>
<P>
   Lear's magical words inspired Lewis and artist Kelley. Author
Lewis made up the word ``boshblobberbosh'' for his unusual poetry
book, a tribute to Lear.
</P>
<P>
   While the poems are not Lear, they are Learlike and fun to read.
The book, beautifully designed and printed, also contains a bit of
history and background on each poem. For all ages.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``To Every Thing There Is a Season'' by Leo and Diane Dillon
(Blue Sky/Scholastic, $15.95).
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the prettiest books of the season. Leo and Diane
Dillon, much-honored with Caldecotts and other children's book
awards, take the ancient verses of Ecclesiastes and pair them with
stunning artwork representing 16 cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian wall murals express ``A time to be born, a time to
die.'' A Chinese fishing scene illustrates ``A time to keep and a
time to cast away.'' Australian traditional aboriginal bark paints
were mimicked (gouache on bark paper) for ``A time to keep silence
and a time to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   The lesson here is more than just the singing Biblical phrases.
The Dillons celebrate life, diversity and the universal human
condition. The cover is magnificent. For all ages.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Coppelia'' told by Margot Fonteyn, paintings by Steve
Johnson and Lou Fancher (Harcourt Brace, $17).
</P>
<P>
   Fonteyn, one of the most influential ballerinas of the 20th
century, wrote a version of the classic ``Coppelia'' shortly before
her death in 1991. The ballerina did the job with heart and
empathy. She knows the human doll as few others can know her
because she danced the role. She knows about creating beauty as did
Dr. Coppelius, the dollmaker.
</P>
<P>
   But the beauty of this book isn't in the retelling of the famous
story, a ballet (and two operas) based on a story of E.T.A.
Hoffmann and first performed in 1870.
</P>
<P>
   The illustrations are breathtaking. They are oil, acrylic and
fabric on canvas and create the mood of a rich old European
painting.
</P>
<P>
   For all ages but especially for the young dancers in the family.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Shake Rag: From the Life of Elvis Presley'' by Amy
Littlesugar, illustrated by Floyd Cooper (Philomel, $16.99).
</P>
<P>
   Cooper's magic has touched another story.
</P>
<P>
   An 11-year-old boy's daddy loses his job and moves his family
near Shake Rag, where mostly black people live. The little boy, who
loves his old guitar, plays songs he heard on Memphis blues radio
stations and mimics music swirling in the streets in his
neighborhood. He catches on fast. He loves the music and can sing
it as well as his neighbors can.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, in a Memphis recording studio, that music
comes pouring out of him. It is, writes, Littlesugar, ``the sound
of a brand-new day.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy is Elvis Presley.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The 20th Century Children's Book Treasury'' edited by Janet
Schulman (Knopf, $40).
</P>
<P>
   Schulman has done a commendable job of selecting 44 beloved
children's books for this treasure.
</P>
<P>
   There's enough bedtime reading in here for months. For parents
who want to understand her choices, Schulmann explains her reasons.
A color code indicates recommended ages. This is a wonderful
bargain and a great gift, a whole library in one _ Seuss, Amelia
Bedelia, Babar and Tigger, old books and new.
</P>
<P>
   But the book is heavy. So the youngster needs strong fingers and
wrists and a reading voice from someone older.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Apollo &AMP; Daphne: Masterpieces of Mythology'' by Antonia
Barber (Getty Museum, $16.95). The story of Apollo and Daphne, you
recall, is about the Greek god who, stung by Cupid's gold-tipped
arrow, fell hopelessly for the water nymph Daphne. Apollo had
insulted Cupid, and Cupid, being a young brat, sought to give him
pain. Ah, love.
</P>
<P>
   This myth and others are illustrated with beautiful great-master
works of art from the National Gallery in London, the Louvre and
other collections. The book ends with a list of the Roman names for
the Greek gods and the family tree of the gods, of the children of
earth and sea and of the children of Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   The retelling is direct and respectful in this beautiful book
for all ages.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Life of Jesus: In Masterpieces of Art'' by Mary Pope
Osborne (Viking, $17.99).
</P>
<P>
   As with Apollo &AMP; Daphne, masterpieces from around the world
illustrate ``The Life of Jesus.'' ``I tried to be as clear and
direct as possible, without sacrificing the wonder and passion of
the story,'' Osborne writes. Most of the paintings were done in the
15th and 16th centuries. Osborne chose them for their beauty and
inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Pope Gregory the Great, she says, wrote, ``Painting can do for
the illiterate what writing does for those who can read.'' In this
book is the best of both.
</P>
<P>
   This is a beautifully produced book for all ages.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Star Wars: The Visual Dictionary'' by David West Reynolds
(DK, $19.95). ``Star Wars: Incredible Cross-sections'' by David
West Reynolds (DK, $19.95).
</P>
<P>
   In 1999 you will (1) get sick and tired of hearing about Star
Wars, or (2) pant for more. But you will not feel ambivalent about
the subject. The eagerly awaited ``Star Wars: Episode One _ The
Phantom Menace'' is scheduled to open in theaters May 21.
</P>
<P>
   If someone on your list falls into category 2, buy one or both
of the new ``Star Wars'' books. They are amazingly detailed.
Frankly, it's amazing that anybody would go so overboard about a
movie. The cross section book is 32 pages of Star Destroyers,
Sandcrawlers, Jabba's Sail Barge and more. Death Star folds out
into a four-page spread. It's full of minute characters and
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Where did all this come from? Certainly George Lucas didn't plan
the upper laser cannon mount or the primary sensor array in the
T-65 X-wing.
</P>
<P>
   The dictionary is called the ultimate guide to ``Star Wars''
characters and creatures. Most fascinating is the list of how the
books were actually researched and executed. Reynolds is an
archaeologist who ``approaches the world of ''Star Wars`` like
ancient Rome or Egypt, considering it a culture from another time
and place to explore.''
</P>
<P>
   We see inside a Stormtrooper's helmet. Biographies detail
Boushh, Logray, Interrogator Droid and even the gross ones like
rancor monster and ephant mon.
</P>
<P>
   Yoda does deserve more than one page. For ``Star Wars'' fans of
all ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women of Hope: African Americans Who Made a Difference'' by
Joyce Hansen (Scholastic, $16.95).
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the most beautiful books of the year. It is based
on a series of posters created by Bread and Roses, the cultural
project of 1199 National Health and Human Services Employees Union,
AFL-CIO, in New York. The union, with the hope of nourishing the
hearts and minds of members and their families and to honor courage
and creativity in women of color, ended up inspiring a nation.
</P>
<P>
   The black-and-white posters are elegant in their simplicity.
They pack a wallop. So does the book.
</P>
<P>
   The book tells a one-page story of each woman, and on the facing
page reproduces the poster photo, some new images, some old. The
women are Ida Wells-Barnett, Fannie Lou Hamer, Mae Jemison, Ella J.
Baker, Ruby Dee, Maya Angelou, Toni Morrison, Marian Wright
Edelman, Alice Walker, Alexa Canady, Septima Clark and the Delany
Sisters.
</P>
<P>
   These women paved the way for a better future, and that makes us
proud.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Meet My Staff'' by Patricia Marx, illustrated by Roz Chast
(Harper Collins, $14.95).
</P>
<P>
   Most readers will take this book personally. It is about you,
and me, and the person next door, and your teacher, and ``my
staff.'' But the author claims the book is about Walter. And young
Walter's staff. Sure it is.
</P>
<P>
   Walter's staff includes Miss Peck, who is in charge of kissing
Aunt Winnie, ``which is something I would rather not do,'' he
explains. And that's how the book goes. The cat practices the
piano, Delores De-cruster cuts the crust off Walter's bread. Sir
Yes ... well, you get the picture.
</P>
<P>
   We all need 'em, have 'em, and suffer when they take the day
off.
</P>

'78 UMASS TEAM KNEW THE FEELING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMHERST, Mass. _ Two significant events in the history of
University of Massachusetts football occurred on this date. The
latter came last season, when the school named former Brown coach
Mark Whipple to head its beleaguered program.
</P>
<P>
   The former came 20 years ago, when the Minutemen played Florida
A&AMP;M in the first NCAA Division 1-AA national championship game
ever.
</P>
<P>
   How coincidental that on the 20th anniversary of the biggest
game in UMass football history, the Whipple-led 1998 Minutemen
depart Wednesday for Chattanooga, Tenn., in preparation for the
school's second 1-AA championship game _ a showdown against
undefeated Georgia Southern Saturday at 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``People used to call us the greatest team in school history,
but I think you can say that about this team now,'' said Kevin
Sullivan, a defensive back on the 1978 team, which finished 9-4
after losing to FAMU, 35-28, in Wichita Falls, Texas. ``I think we
were similar in the fact that both could score at will and both had
great defenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, both knocked off previously unbeaten teams en route to
the final. The 1978 team defeated heavily favored Nevada-Reno,
44-21, in Reno in the semifinals (back then, the tournament
consisted of two rounds rather than today's four).
</P>
<P>
   This year's squad knocked off previously unbeaten Lehigh, 27-21,
at Warren McGuirk Stadium in the second round, earning UMass's
first home playoff victory ever.
</P>
<P>
   And as if that weren't enough of a coincidence, both teams were
headed by first-year coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Pickett, who coached the '78 team after serving seven years
as an assistant under Dick MacPherson, says his scenario was much
different from that of Whipple. MacPherson had taken the program to
the Division 2 playoffs in 1977. ``Mac didn't actually leave the
cupboard empty,'' said Pickett.
</P>
<P>
   Whipple, whose 11-3 team set a school record for victories in a
season, was appointed after UMass lost nine games for the first
time this century.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most striking differences between the two teams was
their talent pools. The 1978 Minutemen consisted predominantly of
in-state players.
</P>
<P>
   In their Nov. 16 contest against New Hampshire, 20 of 22
Minutemen starters hailed from Massachusetts (both the offense and
defense had one starter from New York).
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 Minutemen are typical of many of the better teams in
the Northeast _ their talent pool covers many states. The starting
lineup for last week's semifinal victory over Northwestern (La.)
State included three offensive starters and five defensive starters
from the Bay State.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly the biggest difference between the teams is style of
play. The 1978 Minutemen were run-oriented. They set a school
record with 3,000 rushing yards. They relied on ball control and
aggressive defense to stymie the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were not a lot of zone defenses back then; everything
was strictly man-to-man,'' said Pickett. ``Back then, we had
defensive objective charts like four shutouts in a year and no
(yielding a) play of more than 20 yards. Back then, those
objectives were reasonable. You couldn't do that today.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1978 team registered one shutout _ a 27-0 decision over
Boston College in the regular-season finale. It held five other
opponents to 8 points or fewer.
</P>
<P>
   The closest the 1998 team has come to a shutout was a 23-13 win
over Rhode Island. Its forte has been Whipple's wide-open passing
attack, which scores in bunches. These Minutemen have scored 40
points or more five times, something the 1978 team did only twice.
</P>
<P>
   Still, members of the 1978 team see similarities. ``We both had
a few losses early and a loss late and then we excelled in the
playoffs,'' said Bruce Kimball, former UMass offensive lineman and
member of the Washington Redskins' Super Bowl XVIII team. ``I've
seen their running back, Marcel Shipp, and he's outstanding. He
reminds me of the guy we had, Dennis Dent.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the game itself, members of the 1978 team hope this
year's squad has better fortune. Pickett's defense played much of
the game without three starters. Sullivan broke his ankle in the
first quarter. He spent much of the day watching a gusty wind wreak
havoc with the football.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were punts that were sailing backwards,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't stop placekicker Sandro Vitiello from booting a pair
of 20-yard field goals in the first half, the second of which gave
UMass a 6-0 lead. But Florida A&AMP;M, playing without leading rusher
Ike Williams, had a pair of rushing touchdowns in the second
quarter to take a 14-6 halftime advantage.
</P>
<P>
   A 29-yard field goal by Vitiello and two touchdowns by Cliff
Pedrow put the Minutemen ahead, 22-21, with 8:26 left in the game.
Then FAMU converted a UMass fumble into a 29-yard touchdown run by
Mike Solomon. He caught a 2-point conversion pass to put the
Rattlers ahead, 29-22.
</P>
<P>
   UMass punted the ball back to FAMU after stalling on three
downs, and the Rattlers took advantage again as Solomon scored on a
20-yard run for a 35-22 advantage. UMass scored the game's final
touchdown on a last-second 34-yard pass from Mike McEvilly to Chris
Kurtz.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a chance to win,'' said Kimball, ``but we missed some
scoring opportunities early and we settled for field goals rather
than move the ball inside the end zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan hopes to gather members of the 1978 team to watch
Saturday's game on television. As dominant as the program was back
then, he can't believe it took another 20 years for the Minutemen
to reach the final.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we would be right back there the next year with all
the talent we had,'' he said. ``I'd say to this year's team, `Make
the best of it while you can.' ''

<P>
   So you made a fortune by selling the company you cofounded and
helped build. With leisure time and new wealth on your hands, you
sink a few bucks into some promising young companies where you sit
on the board. And best of all, you now have plenty of time to spend
with the family.
</P>
<P>
   Idyllic for some, but the change in lifestyle left millionaires
Gururaj ``Desh'' Deshpande and Daniel Smith restless.
</P>
<P>
   What was left to do?
</P>
<P>
   Start over again.
</P>
<P>
   Both were leaders of Cascade Communications Corp. of Westford,
Mass., a telecommunications equipment maker that was one of the
most successful technology companies in New England during the
1990s. It grew to $500 million in annual sales and had 900 workers.
In 1997, six years after establishing Cascade, they sold it for
$3.7 billion to Ascend Communications Inc. of Alameda, Calif. They
split more than $150 million in Ascend stock.
</P>
<P>
   The duo represent a breed of incurable entrepreneurs _ too young
and too restless to retire with the riches; too independent to work
for the new bosses. Deshpande and Smith say they love the start-up
life and couldn't resist the chance to build another successful
company. And in an unusual twist, they ended up together again in
the entrepreneurial trenches.
</P>
<P>
   Barely a month after the Ascend deal closed, Deshpande, chairman
of Cascade and one of its four founders, took a vacation to his
native India and started sprinkling some of his new wealth into
several companies.
</P>
<P>
   In February _ barely seven months out of Cascade _ he launched
Sycamore Networks Inc. in Tewksbury, Mass., another
telecommunications start-up. Last month Smith, who stayed 15 months
with the merged Ascend/Cascade, joined Sycamore as president and
chief executive. Deshpande is chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recruited him over a sandwich and an ice cream cone _ and he
paid for both,'' recalls Deshpande, 48, referring to a lunch near
Smith's summer home in Watch Hill, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 49, enjoyed cheering his kids on at soccer games and
overseeing some of their school activities, but he says the slower
pace left him wanting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to build things _ I can't walk past a construction site
without stopping to figure out how the building is put together,''
comments Smith, who says he puts in 13-hour days at Sycamore.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Desh and I talked, it was the challenge of building
something very new. We had made enough money. That was not our
primary motivation'' with Sycamore, adds Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Sycamore, which was started without a business plan, got $5
million right away, half from Deshpande and half from Matrix
Partners, a Waltham, Mass. venture capital firm that had financed
Cascade. Much of the company's subsequent financing came from
Matrix and North Bridge Venture Partners of Waltham, two venture
firms known for backing early-stage telecommunications companies.
</P>
<P>
   The start-up's aim is to build a new generation of
telecommunications equipment that uses waves of light to deliver
huge amounts of voice, data, and Internet traffic through
fiber-optic cable to business and residential customers.
</P>
<P>
   The young company's core technology comes from Richard Barry and
Eric Swanson, two research scientists at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology's Lincoln Laboratories, who developed a way
of testing an all-optical network for data communications. They
were persuaded by Deshpande to leave the lab and risk their futures
in a startup. At Sycamore, Barry is director of ``optics
architecture'' and Swanson is chief scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Sycamore has grown to 50 employees and drawn a total
of more than $20 million in investments. Aside from Deshpande's and
Smith's funding, money also came from Chi Shue another cofounder of
Cascade, who rose to vice president of software and systems
engineering at Ascend's switching division in Westford, Mass. He is
now Sycamore's vice president of technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``This trio at Sycamore is probably the most experienced
management team of any start-up we have done,'' says Paul Ferri of
Matrix Partners. ``They want to be leaders at the beginning of the
technology curve while others are developing products that are more
straightforward extensions of existing technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Deshpande, who holds a doctorate degree in data
communications from Queens University in Canada, and Smith, an
engineer and Harvard Business School graduate, acknowledge they
each questioned whether they had the energy to start another
company. Each had plenty of job offers after selling Cascade.
</P>
<P>
   After all, very few successful entrepreneurs still have the same
hunger and passion to start all over.
</P>
<P>
   For Deshpande, to begin again meant personally arranging for
office furniture, workspace cubicles, computers, and fax machines.
Six-day work weeks sometimes blended into a nightlife of cell phone
conversations from home.
</P>
<P>
   But Deshpande's and Smith's success with Cascade also made it
easier to attract people and money for Sycamore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to brag, but it took 15 minutes on the phone to
get venture funding and we've got very talented engineers
approaching us,'' says Deshpande, noting that Sycamore is the sixth
start-up to spin out of Cascade.
</P>
<P>
   Adds Smith: ``You give up power when you leave a big company and
to start over takes an emotional maturity. There are no trappings
of a big office.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, few entrepreneurs are as successful the second or third
time around.
</P>
<P>
   William Poduska, a founder of Prime Computer, succeeded with
Apollo Computer, which was acquired by Hewlett-Packard Co. But he
later failed with Stardent Computer Inc. of Concord, Mass. And
Henry Burkhardt III, prospered handsomely as a cofounder of Data
General Corp. only to see his next company, Kendall Square Research
Corp. of Waltham, fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started Cascade, people thought we were eccentric, and
frankly, you have to be a bit crazy to start again,'' says
Deshpande. ``But Dan and I work very well together and the
opportunity in optical computing is what really excites us.''
</P>
<P>
   For all its promise, Sycamore must still reach certain
milestones commonly expected of telecommunications start-ups:
completing development of a first product in 15 months; getting a
product onto the market six to nine months later, before
competitors arrive; and achieving profitability about a year later,
followed by either an initial public offering or selling out to a
bigger company.
</P>
<P>
   Still, things are advancing much more quickly for Deshpande and
Smith the second time around.
</P>
<P>
   Ten-month-old Sycamore will have its first product developed for
customer testing next spring. By comparison, Cascade took a year to
get its venture capital funding and a second year to get its first
product out the door, notes Deshpande.
</P>
<P>
   Sycamore's tight time schedule means grueling 12- to 15-hour
days for nearly all Sycamore employees during the first year. And
so far, Deshpande says, there has been no shortage of engineering
applicants, looking to strike it rich and get in on the ground
floor of emerging technology.
</P>
<P>
   And while both have complementary skills, each has strengths
gained at Cascade that carry over to Sycamore. Smith, the chief
salesman, drives the business. Deshpande is the strategist and
technology guru.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan and Desh are a killer team because they complement each
other. Desh can figure out markets, navigate around problems, knows
more about the details of a product than anyone else. Dan is the
street fighter, the team leader and the best manager under fire of
anyone I ever worked with,'' says Kurt Melden, a Cascade cofounder
who is now chief technical officer of Redstone Communications Inc.
of Westford. ``Together again, they will do very well.''

SQUEEZE PLAY FOR FISK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (itals)``The only thing that will keep Carlton Fisk out of the
Baseball Hall of Fame would be a traffic jam on the road to
Cooperstown.''(unitals) &QL; 
_ Boston Globe, April 2, 1993 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, a certain wisecracking baseball writer with a Boston
address wrote this about the Chicago White Sox catcher.
</P>
<P>
   While the prospect of Fisk joining baseball's elite is a given,
so, too, is the notion that there might be several obstacles to him
being included in the Class of 1999. The onetime Red Sox star is
traveling the same path as Nolan Ryan, George Brett, and Robin
Yount, also first-time candidates. Support for holdovers Tony Perez
(321 votes in last year's balloting), Jim Rice (203), and Gary
Carter (200) could also block the way.
</P>
<P>
   History tells us nothing is automatic. Since 1936, only 26
players have been elected on the first ballot by members of the
Baseball Writers Association of America. The last was Mike Schmidt
of the Philadelphia Phillies in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Having said all that, it remains clear that the Class of '99
will be considered lacking if Fisk is not a first-ballot selection.
As much as Ryan, Yount, and Brett, he has become a legend. He
lasted 24 years at a killer position, and he wound up with 376
homers and 1,330 RBIs, plus 10 All-Star Game appearances and the
records for homers by a catcher (351) and games behind the plate
(2,226).
</P>
<P>
   But his credentials transcend raw numbers. In the 1975 World
Series, he provided one of the most indelible moments in baseball
history. His 12th-inning home run that gave the Red Sox a 7-6
victory over the Cincinnati Reds in Game 6 _ and his dance down the
first base line as he implored the shot down the left-field line to
stay fair _ remains a staple in Boston lore.
</P>
<P>
   For this quintessential New Englander _ born in Bellows Falls,
Vt., raised in Charlestown, N.H., the embodiment of flinty,
hardworking Yankee values _ that stood as the signature moment from
his 10-plus years with the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   But that tenure ended on a decidedly sour note. Five years
later, during contentious contract negotiations, Fisk became a free
agent when general manager Haywood Sullivan committed a contract
blunder that ranks just behind the sale of Babe Ruth as the biggest
in Red Sox history. After getting assurances it wasn't necessary,
Sullivan failed to send Fisk a contract by the deadline of Dec. 20,
1980. Fisk was susequently declared a free agent on the grounds
that the option year on his contract called for a new salary offer
before the deadline and the Red Sox had not made one. Sullivan's
initial offer to Fisk was $210,000. The White Sox snapped him up
for five years at $700,000 annually, and he spent the remaining 13
years of his career in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter where he went, New England was always home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been around since 1942,'' said Red Sox great Johnny
Pesky. ``And I played on a great team in 1946. You've got to put
Fisk among the list of greats who have ever played around here _
Williams, Yaz, Doerr, DiMaggio, Rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been some great catchers to come along over the
years _ Gabby Hartnett, Bill Dickey, Johnny Bench, and Yogi Berra.
Fisk has got to be in that group. He never should have left here.
But I'm happy he's still got a chance to be in the Hall of Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   The ability Fisk showed as a skinny 6-foot-2-inch kid was
special, and it didn't surprise Pesky or anyone else in the Red Sox
organization that he became a fixture at Fenway Park. In 1972, Fisk
not only won a Gold Glove as the best defensive catcher in the
American League but was named Rookie of the Year. He finished in
the top 10 in the Most Valuable Player balloting four times and
played in two League Championship Series (1975, '83), and of
course, the aforementioned World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that Carlton Fisk belongs in the Hall of
Fame,'' said former Red Sox batterymate Dennis Eckersley, recently
retired after 24 seasons. ``I don't think even Johnny Bench could
match what Pudge could do. It's hard to explain. But I'd say
offensively, Fisk put it together better than any other catcher at
that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``For him to have the kind of career he had at his age is
something; the numbers he put up. He was 33 when he left Boston.
But he had some great years after he became 33. Who knows what he
would have done if he hadn't left Boston?''
</P>
<P>
   We do have a clue. In 13 seasons against Boston, Fisk hit .308
(119 for 386) with 27 home runs and 68 RBIs. In 1987, he became
only the third catcher with 300 career homers, 1,000 runs scored,
and 1,000 RBIs. He had eight 20-homer and two 100-RBI seasons _ all
while serving as a masterful handler of pitching staffs.
</P>
<P>
   What also set Fisk apart in his Red Sox days, Pesky reminds, was
his unmistakable leadership, the ability to drive not only himself
but those around him. Behind the dish, Fisk took command. He
smothered nearly every errant pitch. He made catching foul balls an
art. True, his trips to the mound seemed endless, as did his
propensity for hitting foul balls down the left-field line. But he
got results.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was at the plate,'' said Pesky, ``he never backed off.
Maybe that's why he went after every ball. Maybe that is why he hit
1,000 foul-ball home runs. He wasn't always a pull hitter. But as
he got bigger and stronger, he became quick inside _ almost as
quick as DiMaggio, although Joe straightened out quite a few
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisk played in 1,078 games for Boston, batting .280 _ .011 above
his career average. He represented Boston seven times in the
All-Star Game, missing the 1974 showcase because of injury.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, there was that epic homer in the '75 World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can still see the shot he hit,'' said Pesky, a Red Sox coach
in 1975. ``It wasn't a cheap shot. It was a pea. People kept
yelling, `Stay fair, stay fair!' I looked over at Pudge, and he was
pushing his hands towards right field while trying to steer the
ball fair at the same time. If the screen hadn't been there, the
ball would have gone to Kenmore Square.''
</P>
<P>
   After an injury-plagued stretch early in his career, Fisk became
a paragon of durability and longevity because of his monster
pregame and postgame workouts. They encapsulated the demands he
placed on himself, a commitment to excellence that also manifested
itself in a lack of tolerance with with those above him who
disagreed with his views.
</P>
<P>
   What remains to be seen is whether he'll wear a Red Sox or White
Sox cap in Cooperstown. But it's beyond dispute that he belongs
there. Now.

IN FINLAND, US HOCKEY PUT ON ICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Canada won the tournament, but US coach Julie Sasner likes what
she saw over in Finland nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team played well,'' said Sasner Tuesday by telephone after
the US beat Finland, 3-2, to clinch second place in the round-robin
Three Nations Cup, with only Wednesday's statistically meaningless
game between Canada and Finland remaining. ``I think we
accomplished our goal of being able to blend in some of the rookies
with the veterans.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago in this Three Nations Cup, the US beat Canada for the
first time in an international hockey tournament; two months later
the Americans would defeat their northern neighbors and fierce
rivals, 3-1, for the Olympic gold medal. But these are new teams _
just over half of each are Olympians _ and this first competition
since Nagano signaled the beginning of a new cycle for all three
medal-winning squads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've closed that Olympic book, and now we're starting
fresh,'' said Sasner, who will hand the reins back to Olympic coach
Ben Smith for the World Championships next March. ``This is a new
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, its Olympic triumph has taken the target off the backs of
the Canadians, perennial world champions, and transferred it to the
Americans. ``Everybody's out to beat us now,'' said Sasner.
</P>
<P>
   Canada did just that in this tournament, though not by much. In
their first game, the US fell, 2-1, while on Monday the Americans
lost, 4-3, in a sudden death shootout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both losses to Canada were disappointing,'' Sasner said, ``but
more so because of the result than the way the team played. Our
second game against Canada was just a great hockey game. It's too
bad either team had to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   In that game, typical of the drama when these teams meet, the US
went ahead early when Karyn Bye scored her second goal of the
tournament just 5:33 into the first period, and built its lead to
2-0 at 16:07 in the first on a slapshot by Shelley Looney. Canada
responded with three unanswered goals to go ahead, 3-2, at 4:32 of
the third period. Sue Merz converted on a power play about six
minutes later to tie the game at 3-3, and when neither team scored
in the 10-minute overtime period it went to a shootout.
</P>
<P>
   Several newcomers stood out for the US, among them left winger
Krissy Wendell, a 17-year-old from Minnesota; Natalie Darwitz, a
15-year-old from the same state; and defenseman Kelly Halcisak, a
Michigan 16-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   But Sasner was also impressed with the gold medalists. ``They
really showed the younger players what it takes,'' she said.
``They're not ready to just kick back and rest on the laurels of
the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   That's bad news for the rest of the teams coming to Finland
early next year for the World Championships, a title Canada still
holds and the US desperately wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are bigger wars ahead,'' Sasner said, looking ahead to
March.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blizzard stay popular
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The New England Blizzard has already lost five home games this
year, equalling its 17-5 home mark of last season, but fans don't
seem to be deterred. With attendance averaging 7,945, the 2-9 squad
is drawing only slightly fewer fans than this time a year ago and
is still luring almost 4,000 more spectators per game than the
league average. The Blizzard is 1-5 since losing top scorer Carolyn
(Jones) Young to a torn ACL. Young is scheduled to undergo surgery
Jan. 4 and will be out for the season . . . Elsewhere in the ABL,
34-year-old Teresa Edwards is still going strong: the four-time
Olympian is just nine points away from becoming the first ABL
player in league history to reach the 2,000 milestone. Her 20.8
points per game for the Philadelphia Rage leads the league this
season . . . It's a hat trick for the Harvard women's ice hockey
team, which boasts ECAC player (A.J. Mleczko), rookie (Angela
Ruggiero) and goaltender (Crystal Springer) of the week. On a
seven-game winning streak, the Crimson (10-1-0 and ranked No. 1 in
the nation) have not allowed a goal in the last 168:39 of action
and have outscored their opposition 49-7. Their only loss of the
year came Nov. 15 to Brown, 4-2 . . . For the second year in a row,
Cindy Parlow of North Carolina has been named the top women's
college hockey player. The Tar Heels forward becomes only the
second two-time recipient of the Hermann Award. Mia Hamm was the
other.

<P>
   When University of Vermont freshman Libby Smith was in high
school in Essex Junction, Vt., she was juggling three sports and
excelling at all of them.
</P>
<P>
   She was a basketball player who as a senior was named USA Today
Vermont Player of the Year, was a two-time all-state soccer player,
and won the Vermont Girls' High School State Championship in golf
as a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   Now Smith, 18, has narrowed the juggling _ she only plays two
sports competitively _ but is still excelling.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, in her collegiate debut with the basketball team,
she scored 23 points, including the game-winning basket in
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   She's been named America East Rookie of the Week twice,
including this week; has started all seven games with UVM, and
leads the conference in three-point percentage (44 percent).
</P>
<P>
   All this comes after her fall season with the men's golf team,
where she shot an average of 81 and was the Vermont medalist at the
New England Intercollegiate Golf Championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a special kid,'' said basketball coach Keith Cieplicki.
``As a coach you get certain players you call once-in-a-lifetime
players, and that's what she is. She has a very strong mind and
will, but a very kind way. It's a really neat mix.''
</P>
<P>
   Cieplicki said he recruited the 5-foot-9 point guard after her
team at Essex won four straight state championships and amassed a
93-3 record. He also faced her team when he was a coach at
Burlington High.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's just someone that knows how to win,'' he said. ``I felt
she was a key to our future.''
</P>
<P>
   But someone else at the school had his eye on Smith, too. That
was Mike Gilligan, the men's golf coach. The school has no women's
golf team, but he was sure Smith was good enough to play with the
men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd been reading about her for years, because she had been one
of the better amateur golfers in the state,'' Gilligan said. ``So
we had a kind of combined recruiting effort for her.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that the first priority at UVM was to get Smith
to sign on for basketball, for which she was offered a full
scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I had to put in my two cents,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gilligan, who has been golf coach for six years, said he could
offer Smith a shot at the men's team, but that was about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her I had never had women on the golf team, and that
she would be allowed to try out with the men, and if she scored
well, she'd make the team,'' he said. ``But I'd keep her on the
roster no matter what she scored. Well, not only did she score
well, but she started out at No. 5, and is now No. 2 on the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said she was torn between the two sports when looking at
colleges, and was tempted by the University of Hartford, which has
a women's golf team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough decision, but academically, it didn't work
out,'' said Smith, an engineering major.
</P>
<P>
   As far as juggling the two sports, Smith said the two seasons
did overlap, and there were preseason basketball practices going on
while the golf season was winding down.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I did have to balance the two,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Which she did quite well, said Gilligan.
</P>
<P>
   After the America East golf championships in Portland, he said,
Smith had a sandwich and a nap on the three-hour ride back. When
the van arrived at the UVM campus in Burlington, Smith hopped out
and was on her way to the first day of tryouts for the basketball
team. She ran _ OK, she won _ the team's two-mile mandatory run.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was after walking 18 holes and carrying her bag, and
riding back for three hours,'' Gilligan said. ``She never even told
me she had to get back.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Smith understates that she has to play from the men's
tees, which are farther back than the women's tees.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've always played from the mens' tees _ it presented more
of a challenge to me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cieplicki said he had no problem with Smith being a two-sport
athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I encourage players to do as many different things that they
enjoy,'' he said. ``I discourage specialization. I think this has
been great for Libby and a model for her teammates, I think it adds
a lot in respect for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith is earning plenty of respect on the court, too.
</P>
<P>
   She has scored in double figures in five of the team's seven
games, averages 36 minutes per game, ranks first on the team in
assists (4.57 per game), and second in free-throw percentage
(.818).
</P>
<P>
   The team is 5-2, and hopes to make it back to the NCAA
tournament, as it did in 1992, '93, and '94. Junior co-captain
Karalyn Church (6-foot-0) is the reigning America East Player of
the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said she's been playing basketball ``ever since I could
dribble,'' and started playing golf when she was 7 years old, but
``wasn't serious about it until I was 11.'' That's when Smith and
her older brother played virtually all summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family has a summer home in northern Vermont, and it's a
mile-and-a-half away from the course, so we'd just hang out all
day,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   She went on to join the boys' team in high school, since there
weren't enough girls to form a girls' team. But she did compete
individually in the state tournaments, which she won in 1995. Smith
also was named New England High School Girls' Golf Champion her
freshman and sophomore years.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said she's grown to take it as a given that she has to
prove herself on the boys' and men's teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've kind of had to make a name for myself, but it's not like
the boys were mean,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gilligan agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the returning players were pretty skeptical, but she's
like one of the guys now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gilligan said he especially took delight when the team played
other schools for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun to see the opposing teams get to know her,'' he said.
``They say `the word is that there's a pretty good player at UVM,
and it's a woman.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled with a chuckle that at the Intercollegiate
championships at New Seabury, a player on another team told his
coach that if he got beat by a woman, he'd sell his clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I was sure to match her with him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith beat the man _ whom Gilligan diplomatically declined to
name _ by six strokes. No word on whether he sold his clubs.

SAVE THE HEADWATERS FOREST PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CAMPBELL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The last chance to preserve the Headwaters
Forest and protect thousands of additional acres of wildlife
habitat in Northern California is about to move into the final
phases of implementation.
</P>
<P>
   Or is it? Powerful forces are arrayed to block the plan the
Clinton and Wilson administrations have developed for protecting
these old-growth redwoods, no matter what the cost for the
environment would be.
</P>
<P>
   This is the moment for Californians and the rest of the nation
to look past the banner-waving and the shouting, to assess how much
the Headwaters plan would actually accomplish for the sake of the
environment, and to measure how much would be lost if the opponents
succeed in destroying this effort.
</P>
<P>
   The Headwaters plan will preserve in perpetuity the largest
remaining privately owned tract of old-growth redwoods on Earth. It
goes far beyond existing law to provide unprecedented levels of
habitat conservation on 210,000 other acres owned by the Pacific
Lumber Co.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, one-fourth of our company's entire existing ownership
will be dedicated to preservation. That means permanent protection
not only for 7,500 acres in and surrounding virgin old-growth in
the Headwaters and Elk Head Springs forests, but also all of the
8,000 acres in the so-called ``lesser cathedrals'' of old growth
trees. In addition, we will place 30,000 acres in riparian buffer
zones and set aside nearly 10,000 acres to mitigate landslide
risks.
</P>
<P>
   No other timber company in the nation has to operate under the
restrictions we have adopted under the plan to protect coho and
chinook salmon, steelhead trout, and other aquatic resources. Since
logging would largely be limited to previously harvested areas that
have little or no habitat value for the marbled murrelet, state and
federal wildlife experts have affirmed that enactment of the plan
will ensure the long-term conservation of these birds.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, the plan will put an end to more than a
decade of confrontation and turmoil on California's North Coast. It
will restore stability and security to the lives of the 1,600 men
and women who work for Pacific Lumber, and their families. It will
help to lay the foundation for the region's future prosperity. And
it will accomplish all this while securing the objective that
environmentalists have pursued since 1985 _ Headwaters will be
saved.
</P>
<P>
   Support for the Headwaters plan is broadly based and bipartisan.
It has the support of President Clinton and Gov. Pete Wilson, Vice
President Al Gore, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt and California Secretary for Resources Doug Wheeler. Both
Congress and the state Legislature have approved the funding to
acquire Headwaters and the other lands designated for permanent
preservation.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the same small band of activists who have claimed for
more than 10 years that they want to save Headwaters are now doing
everything they can to prevent it. When the Legislature voted in
August to approve the funds to save the ancient redwoods, this is
the group that denounced the effort, shouting from the balcony.
They have put their own followers' lives at risk in a reckless
campaign that their own instructional materials say is intended
simply to create chaos. And when the federal government last month
sent its top wildlife scientists to take public testimony on the
Headwaters plan, these activists rose and pointedly turned their
backs on the process, making a mockery of a serious environmental
review.
</P>
<P>
   What happens if they succeed? The funding to save Headwaters
will be withdrawn permanently if the plan has not been adopted by
March 1. The plan itself will collapse and there is nothing to take
its place. Since it has taken three years of delicate negotiations
to carry the effort to save Headwaters this far, there is no way
that the scores of scientists and political leaders who have
committed so much of their time and expertise to the development of
the plan could ever be reassembled to start over again.
</P>
<P>
   If the opposition succeeds, all of the provisions of the plan
that currently go far beyond existing law will be lost. That means
there will be far less land that will be required to be preserved
or protected. The Department of the Interior, for example, has
already pointed out that the Endangered Species Act will not
provide nearly as much protection as the Headwaters plan. Moreover,
the plan would conserve habitat for approximately 30 species that
are not currently listed; without the plan, they will receive no
protection under the state or federal endangered species acts.
</P>
<P>
   Without the plan, salvage logging in Headwaters, Elk Head
Springs, and the other virgin old growth forests can proceed. The
courts have already affirmed Pacific Lumber's authority to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Streamside protections will likewise revert to existing law _
which means that far less land will have to be set aside. The
Headwaters plan in some instances triples the level of protection
that would otherwise be required. And under the plan, Pacific
Lumber has committed to stormproofing 50 miles of roads in its
forests every year _ another provision that goes beyond any
statutory responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The people who are fighting to stop the Headwaters plan offer no
alternative. If they succeed, the future will only bring more years
of conflict and chaos. And defeat of the plan would leave Pacific
Lumber with little alternative except to proceed with a
constitutional takings lawsuit against the state and the federal
government that could wind up costing taxpayers hundreds of
millions of dollars more than implementing the plan.
</P>
<P>
   With so much to gain if the plan is adopted _ and so much to
lose if it is not _ it makes no sense for the environment, for the
economy, or for the public interest to throw away our last, best
chance to save Headwaters.

PATRIOTS RUNNING INTO YOUNG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We would have the right to expect that since they got whipped in
St. Louis Sunday, the Patriots might be dragging, sagging, and just
plain listless.
</P>
<P>
   Well, if they are, they better got over it fast, because Mr.
Uptempo is coming to town, and he'll do a number on them Sunday in
Foxborough if they are not ready to run with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one who makes San Francisco so tough to defend,'' said the
New Orleans Saints' highly regarded defensive coordinator, Zavan
Yaralian, ``is Steve Young. Young is the guy. He makes them play
the game faster than any other team. The way they set the pace of
the game to play faster is different than any other team.''
</P>
<P>
   Young and the 49ers do not come to town bearing gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are refreshed,'' said coach Steve Mariucci the morning
after his team whacked the Detroit Lions, 35-13, Monday night in
San Francisco. ``We did a good job in that game and we want to keep
playing well right into the playoffs. I wanted to play a physical
game against Detroit, so we rested the team the two days before the
game and they responded. We beat them on the line of scrimmage on
both sides of the ball. We shut down their running game (Barry
Sanders). On offense, we spread the ball around to our receivers.
Steve did a good job. He ran more than usual. They gave it to him
and he took it. He's playing at a very high level right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Young is the most accurate passer in NFL history and has the
numbers to prove it. His 97.0 pass efficiency rating is the best
ever, 5 points above that of the man in second place, his 49ers
predecessor, Joe Montana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young has great vision,'' said Yaralian, who must try to stop
Young twice every year. ``He sees the field as well as anyone. And
because he can scramble so well, he can buy more time for receivers
to get open by moving out of the pocket and making plays. Then, if
there is no one open, he can run. His running ability limits what a
defense can do against him. If you are playing man-to-man coverage
and he sees it and you have your defensive backs covering with
their backs to the line of scrimmage, he'll take off and make big
plays in the running game.''
</P>
<P>
   Young has thrown a league-high 32 touchdown passes in directing
the NFL's No. 3 scoring offense, which averages more than 30 points
per game.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two key questions for local NFL fans these days seem to be:
</P>
<P>
   (1) After owner Bob Kraft takes the Patriots to Connecticut, can
Boston get another team?
</P>
<P>
   Here is the official answer from the league: ``The location of
our teams is decided on a three-quarters vote of the teams in the
league. If another NFL team wanted to play in Boston, it would
require the approval of 75 percent of the teams in the league. This
is true whether the Patriots are playing in Foxborough or Hartford.
It would require a three-quarters vote of the teams in the league
for a second team to play in Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Interpretation: Another team can come to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   (2) Will Patriots games that aren't sellouts in Hartford be
televised in the Boston market?
</P>
<P>
   The league response: ``The issue of the Patriots' games being
televised in Boston has not been discussed in detail by the league
at this point. There are several issues, including the fact that we
probably are talking about something which probably will not take
effect until the 2002 season.''
</P>
<P>
   Interpretation: The decision has not been made. However,
Jonathan Kraft of the Patriots said on WEEI Radio in Boston Tuesday
that his family wants the games televised in Boston, and that being
the case, the presence of his father, Bob, on the owners'
television committee would seem to ensure that the games will be
televised here.

Thursday, Dec. 17:
</P>
<P>
   VINOLY-DESIGN (Undated) _ The high-style status of modernism is
putting the once proudly democratic design movement at odds with
people who just want to live with it. Lucas Michael and Roman
Vinoly, two brothers, grew up with modernism; cut their baby teeth
on Florence Knoll sofas when they were new; and learned to walk in
one of the first modernist concrete interiors in Buenos Aires,
built by their father, Rafael Vinoly, a committed modernist
architect whose career, though launched in Argentina, took off in
the United States. By Julia Iovine.
</P>
<P>
   CHIAT-OFFICES (Los Angeles) _ The advertising agency that urged
Apple Computer buyers to ``Think different'' has managed to be on
the cusp once again of an evolution in workplace design. Four years
ago, Chiat/Day led the charge into the brave new world of ``virtual
officing'' when their headquarters in Venice, Calif., proved too
small for a fast-expanding staff. Jay Chiat, the company's founder,
equipped everyone with a mobile phone, a laptop and a personal
locker, and turned a problem into a vaunted workplace experiment.
Now, just months shy of the third millennium, TBWA/Chiat/Day, as
the company is known, has traded virtual communication for the real
thing. It has just moved into a new space in the Playa del Rey
section of Los Angeles, where everyone has his own desk, and human
interaction is key, in a plan that draws from a model both ancient
and new: the city. By Frances Anderton.
</P>
<P>
   CARS-VIDEO (Undated) _ Given how screen-saturated our world has
become, it shouldn't be a surprise that the family car now comes
with a video monitor so that back-seat passengers don't have to
rely on the passing landscape _ plain old reality _ for
entertainment. The recent commercial for an Oldsmobile minivan, the
first car with factory-installed video entertainment, was just an
affirmation of the inevitable. By Karrie Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   SWARTHMORE-NATURE (Swarthmore, Pa.) _ It was my search for
beautiful hollies that led me to Swarthmore College, where I found
hundreds of them marching down a hill, like some jolly medieval
procession heading for the meadow. I followed along, looking for
the best berries, the bluest leaf and the secrets of how they grow.
Swarthmore was founded by Quakers in 1864, and the 400-acre campus
includes 200 acres of native forest, a meandering stream called
Crum Creek, and the magnificent trees and plant collections of the
Scott Arboretum, founded in 1929 by Arthur Scott, class of 1895,
and heir to the Scott Paper Co. By Ann Raver.
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTMAS-GIFTS (Undated) _ Christmas is a crapshoot. People
give each other gifts. A. They like them. B. They don't. What odds.
If you are one of the 70 million family households in the United
States, according to a Census Bureau report released last week, you
have 2.18 other family members to gamble with, if you celebrate the
December holidays. Of course, you load the dice by knowing some of
these people well. Too well. Like your mother, who taught you how
to exchange. Or your father, who owns more neckties than your
broker. What do you get your wife for the 10th Christmas in a row?

<P>
   This you call living? That retort springs to mind after one puts
down the poet and novelist Alvin Greenberg's latest collection of
short stories. In ``How the Dead Live,'' Greenberg's subject is the
existential dread that seems to permeate life in the Minneapolis-
</P>
<P>
   St. Paul area, and he covers it with all the knowingness but
none of the whimsy that his fellow Minnesotan, Garrison Keillor,
brings to Lake Wobegon. Greenberg's storytelling can be mannered
and self-conscious, but if there is something a little too flat in
his spare style, something a little too pat in the anomie and
disconnectedness that buffet his characters, there is still real
life in these pages.
</P>
<P>
   A discerning ear, a wicked tongue and a sharp dramatic and
visual sense are evident throughout the collection. Greenberg can
put you into predicaments that are at once familiar yet alien:
behind the wheel with a man suffering from such severe prostate
pain that it obliterates every other sensation; in the training
room with a professional baseball player who is literally on his
last leg; in a house where clouds of dust from a construction
project, like Vesuvius's ash settling on Pompeii, entomb all signs
of human life.
</P>
<P>
   Such uncanny moments bring a sense of mystery as well as comedy.
In ``Gruber in Traffic,'' the protagonist, suddenly haunted by the
fact of death, is unnerved by the sight of an Orthodox rabbi
driving a Jaguar. In ``No Loose Ends,'' a divorced couple --
Greenberg's men and women circle warily like Beckett characters on
a Midwestern ash heap -- exchange venomous recriminations in
late-night phone calls that often require decoding:
</P>
<P>
   ``What Henry meant . . . was that if you expect the worst of
people, then, indeed, they probably will live up to your
expectations. . . . What Malvina meant . . . was wreathed in the
poison gas aura of sarcasm, as befits the battlefield. Aware of the
lethal hazards of modern warfare, however, Henry was . . . safely
ensconced behind the gas mask of irony.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we want to know is: Can anything of value --
civilization, for example -- survive the conditions of such a
no-man's-and no-woman's land as this?''
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg's wit and ability to bring a character quickly to life
are perhaps best exhibited in ``Scholars and Lovers.'' The story's
narrator teaches in a college humanities department, and his
deadpan descriptions of students and colleagues are pitch perfect.
The reversals Greenberg deftly plants and expertly sets off before
the eyes of the unsuspecting reader are a succession of wry
epiphanies.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them involve the enigmatic Weinstein, a brilliant member
of the ``Adult Scholar'' program whose presence in the narrator's
class reawakens his passion for teaching but prompts an unwelcome
revelation. Weinstein seems to be a descendant, albeit a too
philosophically freighted one, of Nabokov's Pnin. Known as ``old
hat-and-gloves,'' the student with the heavy accent is notorious
for standing when addressing his professors and for never taking
off his coat or gloves. ``My heart leaps when he climbs slowly out
of his desk in my classroom and rises bulkily to his feet,'' the
professor confesses, ``fur hat, black woolen coat, leather gloves
and all, and I will go to the wall for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein, like the aimless freeway night rider Joey Ampersand
in the story ``FREE-43,'' is a singular creation. You want more of
him. But Greenberg is stingy. An elusive confrontation between
professor and sagelike student brings ``Scholars and Lovers'' to a
merely cryptic conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these stories peter out in a similar way. Too many
characters are sacrificed to an assumed faith in life's futility.
With his acute ear for the emptiness of so much of modern American
aspiration, Greenberg captures the truncated words and lives of a
society deprived of spiritual oxygen. One wishes he were better at
lifting up this world of mundane conflict and uncertainty, turning
it 90 or 180 degrees and allowing us to see things we never knew
existed, or only dimly perceived.

 &UR; RED GOLD
</P>
<P>
   BY DEBORAH BLUM
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ON Sept. 1, 1939, a young British physician named Janet Vaughan
received a much-dreaded telegram: ``Start bleeding.'' Vaughan had
been working frantically to establish a blood supply system in
London, racing against the possibility of war with Germany. The
city had no blood supplies and barely any place to put them if it
had. Vaughan's group was setting up refrigerators, anywhere -- in
empty hospital wings, in the back room of a bar. A year later, when
the bombing of London was under way, delivery drivers were
careering around the city at night. Vaughan and her colleagues had
been bleeding in earnest: doctors used almost 70,000 pints of
blood. As Douglas Starr shows in his fine book, ``Blood: An Epic
History of Medicine and Commerce,'' the destruction of war, and the
demands it made, greatly accelerated medicine's ability to use
blood well. The desperate scramble by services like Janet Vaughan's
led straight to the take-it-for-granted use of blood and blood
products.
</P>
<P>
   It's a difficult notion to convey in these post-Vietnam,
``Saving Private Ryan'' days, that there could be a silver lining
to the darkness of war. And Starr's book does not, in any sense,
favor combat. His description of the carnage of the battlefield is
unflinchingly grim; there's an especially bitter recounting of
Americans fighting in the Pacific, where in some battles 60 percent
of the medical personnel present were killed trying to help, or
just get near, dying soldiers. But it's that horror that shows why
researchers drove the science so hard, drove the technology, rushed
through ways to package blood, process it, preserve it, deliver it
by any means possible. Vaughan told of finding a small girl so
badly burned in a bomb-lighted fire that she couldn't find a vein.
There in the darkness, she remembered a research article that
theorized that one could transfuse through bone marrow. She punched
her biggest needle into the child's breastbone and it worked. The
technique was adopted at sea: ``You see, on a rocking boat getting
into a vein is very likely to be difficult, whereas you could hope
to get into a sternum.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that this is just an extended war story. Starr begins his
history of blood as a mystery, back when physicians had no idea,
really, what this warm, red liquid was. They regarded it as a
semimystical substance and practiced the kind of semimystical
medicine that encourages one to rejoice in the fortune of being
born much later. In the 17th century, for instance, personality was
considered literally to flow through the veins, and transfusion a
possible means of improving character in both people and animals.
At one point, trying to alter a wife beater's behavior, a doctor
dosed him with the blood of a mild-mannered calf. The idea of blood
as necessary to health had no credence; most doctors believed that
they could cure illness by letting the ``bad'' blood drip away.
George Washington, as the author reminds us, died in late 1799
after two straight days of being bled in response to a streplike
infection.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the notion of replacing lost blood -- and, equally
important, of using typed and tested blood -- didn't catch on until
this century, and then not really until the 1930's. Starr, who is
co-director of the graduate program in science journalism at Boston
University, tells this story graphically and well. The writing is
straight-ahead, calm amid the goriest events. He's done a
tremendous amount of research too, and deftly uses anecdotes and
personalities to enliven potentially dry descriptions, like the
separation of blood into its myriad components. By the war's end, a
whole industry is taking shape and, equally important, as Vaughan
and her counterparts in the laboratory persist, as they demystify
blood, they drive a cultural shift. Blood itself begins to seem
less essentially human, merely a formula. As perception changes --
as blood becomes industrial chemistry -- so does the way in which
it is handled. Starr compares blood to oil: a necessary and
profitable product that starts belonging less to researchers and
more to a sometimes motley collection of entrepreneurs and a
territorial collection of blood bankers.
</P>
<P>
   The story of blood illustrates more than one of the real
paradoxes of medicine. Practice balances on a perilously imperfect
point, between detachment and compassion. Blood is, indeed, a
remarkable formula; understanding that, in the most clinical way,
is what allows us to use it and market it effectively. Starr, in
fact, insists that there's a logical parallel between the blood
industry and the oil industry; indeed, some people have actually
called blood ``red gold.'' Still, the comparison makes it only
partway home. The early physicians had a point: blood, unlike oil,
is the stuff of life. The failure to recognize or at least honor
that difference led to a tragic miscalculation on our watch: the
failure of the blood industry after the rise of the AIDS epidemic
to protect its products, and so all the people who receive them,
from infection. In France, as became clear in a continuing national
scandal, officials knew that blood supplies could kill, and chose,
in a cost-benefit analysis, to let it happen anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Starr methodically takes apart the French bureaucrats who found
the deaths of others so acceptable an answer. He does an even
better job of showing how contamination of clotting agents ripped
apart the American community of hemophiliacs. He writes not only of
betrayal but of the demoralizing sense of shared guilt, perfectly
illustrated in this quotation from the mother of a child infected
with AIDS through the injections of clotting factor: ``Today, I got
up to shower and dress and while brushing my hair looked in the
mirror and saw for the umpteenth time the person who injected the
lethal dosage into the veins of my hemophiliac son.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a haunting image, and this is so sad and so intense a piece
of recent history that the somewhat tentative final chapter that
follows -- where are we going, what have we learned -- comes as an
anticlimax. ``We have to be careful how we use it'' is a thought
that had occurred to me about blood before I read several hundred
pages on the topic. I didn't finish this book with confidence in
the safety of the blood supply. We have reliable procedures for
handling for blood, but not for insuring reliable caretakers; the
next chapter in the history of blood will doubtless contain its own
measure of heroics and of arrogance. Those ancient mystics had a
point: the story of blood is still the story of human nature.

 FORBIDDEN FAIRWAYS:

<P>
   African Americans and the Game of Golf.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   While many African-Americans have loved golf for generations,
the sport has not always returned that love. Calvin H. Sinnette
shows that in ``Forbidden Fairways,'' a straightforward and
informative book that describes the exploits of many courageous,
innovative and determined individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The book's jacket cover depicts Bill Spiller, a legendary black
golfer during the 1940's and 50's, sitting forlornly on a bench at
the 1952 San Diego Open, head in his hand, dejection on his face,
after being excluded from the tournament because of the
Professional Golfers' Association's color bar. Yet, as Sinnette
notes, many blacks have overcome great odds to make important
contributions to golf's history. After diligent research and
hundreds of interviews, he chronicles triumphs and tragedies to
give a revealing look at men and women who simply longed for a fair
shake on fairways that were forbidden to them.
</P>
<P>
   Sinnette -- giving credit to black newspapers for providing
critical references, because mainstream newspapers seldom published
information about minority exploits in golf -- begins with the
sport's all-too-little-known African-American trailblazers. George
Grant, a dentist from Boston, designed the first golf tee
registered by the United States Patent Office, in 1899. John
Shippen was the first black American to play in the United States
Open, in 1896, even though some competitors threatened to withdraw.
Dewey Brown, who learned the game as a caddie, became a renowned
club designer and teacher during the 1920's and 30's. Around the
same time, Joseph Bartholomew, a noted architect, designed and
built more than a half-dozen golf courses in the New Orleans area.
Because he was black, Bartholomew was not allowed to play on the
courses he built. ``Finally fed up with the prejudice that was
preventing African-Americans from playing the game,'' Sinnette
writes, ``Bartholomew constructed a seven-hole course for black
golfers on property he owned in nearby Harahan, La. It was
separate, but -- even with his superb skills -- he could not make
it equal.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980's and early 90's, country clubs with affluent
white members that barred blacks and other ethnic groups became
increasingly popular. The first documented country club owned by
blacks was the nine-hole Shady Rest Golf and Country Club in Scotch
Plains, N.J. It was originally a white-owned club called the
Westfield Country Club, but when Westfield's members decided to
expand to an 18-hole course, they sold the club to a group of black
investors. Shady Rest survived from 1921 until 1963, when it became
a public facility and changed its name to the Scotch Hills Country
Club. As of 1998, Sinnette could find only four black-owned golf
courses in existence, the oldest being the Clearview Golf Course in
East Canton, Ohio, owned by William Powell, the father of Renee
Powell, who played on the Ladies' Professional Golf Association
Tour for 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks who dreamed of careers in professional golf were rebuffed
during the 40's and 50's. The best black golfers played primarily
in events sponsored by the United Golf Association and other black
organizations. The P.G.A. did not delete its infamous ``Caucasian
race'' clause until 1961. Talented golfers like Spiller, Ted Rhodes
and Charlie Sifford were barred from most P.G.A. Tour events for
years, but their legal and moral battles, as well as their ability
on the golf course, helped pave the way for others, like Lee Elder,
Calvin Peete and, of course, Tiger Woods. And in a chapter devoted
to women's golf, Sinnette, a retired pediatrician, tells of the
accomplishments of Ann Gregory, who won many U.G.A. events and who
became the first black woman to play in the United States Women's
Amateur, in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   There is ample room for more books on African-Americans in golf.
However, ``Forbidden Fairways'' required passion and persistence,
and Sinnette has done a significant service in bringing attention
to achievements and struggles that are an important part of golf's
history.

 THE CORROSION OF CHARACTER

   Personal Consequences of Work in the New Capitalism.
</P>

 &UR; YOU CALL THIS PROGRESS?
</P>
<P>
   BY ALAN EHRENHALT
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   One of the more unusual events in recent American politics was
the sudden appearance and rapid disappearance of the Angry American
Worker. For a few noisy weeks in the spring of 1996 he was the star
of the Presidential campaign -- a decent, hard-working citizen who
had been rudely downsized out of a job and was casting about for
someone to blame. Candidates in both parties struggled for
effective ways to offer him sympathy, and promised him governmental
relief.
</P>
<P>
   Then, almost as quickly as he had entered, the Angry American
Worker left the stage. By the time of the fall campaign between
Bill Clinton and Bob Dole, he had ceased to be a topic of
discussion altogether. Nor has he emerged very often since. In the
thousands of campaigns waged this year for state, local and
national office, I know of none that centered on the issue of the
displaced worker's plight.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is a simple explanation for this sequence of
events. It is that the booming national economy of the mid-1990's
took care of the problem. At a time when unemployment is just over
4 percent and good new jobs are being created in ample numbers, the
50 million or so jobs that have disappeared over the past two
decades need not preoccupy any of us very long. Even the poster
child of early 1996 -- the middle-aged white-collar employee
downsized onto the street after a career of consummate corporate
loyalty -- becomes whole again once he finds new work somewhere
else.
</P>
<P>
   This is what the majority of mainstream economists will tell
you. It is not what Richard Sennett believes. A sociologist at New
York University and the London School of Economics, Sennett is the
author of several provocative books on work, family and social
class. He thinks the wrenching changes of late-20th-century
capitalism are having subtle but profound consequences that will
endure far into the next century. ``Many more are hurt,'' he warns,
``than cry out.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Sennett is an unusual writer. He has always brought to
his topics a combination of broad historical and literary learning
and a reporter's willingness to walk into a store or factory,
strike up a conversation and write down what he hears. In ``The
Corrosion of Character,'' he reports on his regular visits to a
bakery in Boston, a bar in Manhattan and a self-help club of
middle-aged I.B.M. castoffs in upstate New York, interspersing his
observations with excursions into Marx, Diderot, 17th-century
mathematics and Virgil's ``Georgics.''
</P>
<P>
   The argument may take an occasional detour, but the ultimate
point is always clear: the working conditions of modern capitalism
are eating away at loyalty, commitment and the kind of long-term
thinking that used to make even the most routine work a central
ingredient in orderly human life.
</P>
<P>
   In the Boston bakery where 25 years ago Sennett interviewed
sweating Greek-Americans grumpy about the conditions but proud of
themselves and their product, he returned to find a collection of
interchangeable transients pressing buttons to produce loaves of
bread they never saw or touched. They do not consider themselves
bakers; they do not plan to stay in the job more than a few months,
even if they could; most of them have no idea what they will be
doing in a year, let alone where they will be in a decade. They are
not angry, or alienated -- they lack the necessary emotional
investment for that. They are merely indifferent.
</P>
<P>
   The disaffectedness of Sennett's bakers differs only by degree
from that of the workers he meets at higher levels of the economic
ladder. Rico, the son of a janitor who lived for his children's
future, has achieved almost everything the father dreamed about. He
is a consultant to computer companies, with a good income and a
spacious house in the New York suburbs. But his working life has
been no picnic. He has moved four times in 14 years, been downsized
out of a job by virtue of a corporate merger, and patched his
career back together as an independent operator whose professional
relationships are, in their way, as transient and unstable as those
in the bakery. He has no more idea where he will be in 10 years
than the bakers do.
</P>
<P>
   Rico tells Sennett that he feels the decline of loyalty and its
depressing result all around him, not just in the business world
but in the culture and in his family life. ``You can't imagine how
stupid I feel,'' he says, ``when I talk to my kids about
commitment. It's an abstract virtue to them; they don't see it
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   THE downsized I.B.M. executives Sennett talks to at the River
Winds Cafe, in a town in New York's Hudson Valley, seem at first to
be making a peaceful adjustment to the earthquake that hit them.
Perhaps these were some of the Angry American Workers of early
1996, but they are mellower now, wistful rather than bitter about
the fact that they spend their afternoons in a cafe rather than in
a cubicle at Big Blue. But anyone who wishes to count this as
progress might still be well advised to ponder Sennett's account of
the consequences. The I.B.M. exiles have not only accepted
responsibility for their fate, they have turned inward in general,
expending energy on self-awareness that used to be devoted to
school boards, local government and other forms of public
participation. ``They aren't afraid of holding up their heads in
the community,'' Sennett reports. ``They've just lost interest in
civic affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it is a bleak picture. But Sennett leaves the reader
with a tantalizing morsel of optimism. He believes that
end-of-century Americans, denied the satisfactions of order and
rootedness in the workplace, will finally begin to rebuild them
from scratch in the rest of their lives. ``One of the unintended
consequences of modern capitalism,'' he writes, ``is that it has
strengthened the value of place, aroused a longing for community .
. . for some other scene of attachment and depth.'' The reader must
fill in for himself where this will happen -- on neighborhood
streets, in schools, perhaps most of all in the trenches of family
relationships. But one reaches the end of this book convinced, with
Sennett, that the reaction is bound to come.

 &UR; AS HE LAY DYING
</P>
<P>
   BY DAVID FINKLE
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FIRST pressing reason to read ``The Sin Eater'': the appearance
in it of a sheep called Virginia Woolf. Of an animal that moves
through the action with oblivious purpose, the omniscient narrator
observes, ``The sheep had been named because of the facial
resemblance, which was very marked.''
</P>
<P>
   If more persuasion is needed to hook readers into Alice Thomas
Ellis's sly novel of (bad) manners, perhaps the best way to put it
is that the book's bipeds walk around as if outfitted in spiked
armor. It's Ellis's conviction that the idiosyncratic attitudes by
which people live render connections between them impossible. Their
pricking interactions inevitably have comic or sad repercussions --
more likely, both.
</P>
<P>
   Set in Wales, where Ellis's previous novels and memoir take
place, the book examines a contentious family that's fetched up for
a long weekend in a house outside the village of Llanelys to see
whether the ailing patriarch, identified only as the Captain, is
going to die. The sulfurous deathwatch is attended by the Captain's
three children, Henry, Michael and Ermyn; his sons' wives, Rose and
Angela; and Edward, a journalist friend. Tending to their needs, or
spitefully holding out on them, are the housekeeper, Phyllis; her
son, Jack; and grandson, Gomer.
</P>
<P>
   As the discontented relatives and retainers go about their busy
but superficially uneventful schedules -- shopping, cooking,
napping, attending a picnic, participating in an annual cricket
match -- it's Rose and Ermyn whom Ellis observes most closely.
Rose, a Roman Catholic and therefore deemed inferior to the family
into which she has married, runs the household with sour
efficiency. Her every thought is wry. When, for instance, Angela
and Michael arrive, she is ``gratified to see they both wore silly
hats.'' Ermyn, entering adulthood, is so unsure of her ability to
manage anything that she responds most readily to inanimate
objects. ``It seemed foolish to envy a train, but its determination
was astounding,'' she muses on the trip home.
</P>
<P>
   In a book where, to paraphrase Nichols and May, there's
proximity but little relating, Rose and Ermyn do join up for a
venture into town, but, typically, they're at cross-purposes.
Later, Ermyn -- hiding the Bible between the pages of Country Life
because she fears her religious interests are ``very poor form'' --
contemplates a conversion to Catholicism. ``You'd never get in past
the people falling over themselves to get out,'' Rose snaps.
</P>
<P>
   Since Ellis is so taken with Rose and Ermyn, the other players
in this juicy blend of Anton Chekhov and Ivy Compton-Burnett get
less page time. That, though, is part of Ellis's unknowability
thesis. It's what allows her to hint at shenanigans rather than
announce them obstreperously. When the others disappear into
literal and symbolic bushes, Ellis is provoking speculation on what
they've been up to. Rose is lusted after -- and knows it -- by the
gormless Gomer, but with whom else is he dallying? What's going on
between boozy Edward and self-impressed Angela? When Phyllis
tinkers under the hood of Michael's car, what is she planning?
</P>
<P>
   Choosing to leave answers to the imagination is Ellis's way of
saying that imagination is all we have in our efforts to comprehend
one another. We're too detached, she suggests, for anything else to
work. Letting our suppositions fill in the blanks doesn't, however,
excuse her from the novel's one drawback -- the sketchiness with
which the men are depicted. Perhaps Ellis feels that she
understands her own sex but is reluctant to portray men any more
than is absolutely necessary. Unfortunately (fortunately?), she's
so skillful at making a reader want more that it's noticeable when
she's been casual about characters prowling the fringes.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis takes her title from a Welsh custom whereby the ingestion
of funeral meats represents ridding the deceased of his sins.
Though ``The Sin Eater'' may be about dealing with poisonous
natures, it lends itself all the same to being gobbled up whole.

 &UR; KING OF ALL MEDIA
</P>
<P>
   BY TOM GOLDSTEIN
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of what her publisher labels an ``unauthorized
investigative biography'' of S. I. Newhouse Jr. and his influential
publishing family, Carol Felsenthal devotes 22 chunky paragraphs to
Tina Brown's stepping down from The New Yorker, the flagship
magazine of the Newhouse collection. The chapter, called ``The
Queen of Buzz Buzzes Off,'' is short on fresh insights. This is not
surprising given that a blunderbuss endnote for the episode lists
more than 50 articles, mostly from the three New York City dailies,
which covered Brown's resignation with the thoroughness generally
accorded a sudden change of leadership in a medium-sized European
country.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by her endnotes, Felsenthal has read just about
everything ever written about this very private family. Like other
Newhouse biographers before her, she did not get to interview any
of the immediate family members, who famously shun publicity. So
Felsenthal, whose earlier book on Katharine Graham of The
Washington Post received some good reviews (and some withering ones
as well), faced a formidable task: to pierce a shield of privacy.
She interviewed more than 400 people, a remarkable number, which
only shows that an author can interview a lot of people and still
not come up with the story. She talked to many of Si Newhouse's
high school classmates, some of his former colleagues and employees
(many of whom were dismissed or left with a grievance) and his
former wife, Jane Franke, who generously concludes, ``I think it
was the blind leading the blind in our marriage and our
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Citizen Newhouse'' was initially signed with Viking, but new
management there took the unusual step of canceling the book when
it was done -- a decision that was itself the subject of news
articles and gossip columns. Felsenthal said that once she turned
in the manuscript, Phyllis Grann, president of Penguin Putnam Inc.,
parent of Viking, told her she couldn't publish it because too many
people mentioned in it were friends. (Until earlier this year, the
Newhouses owned Random House.) It is equally conceivable that Grann
turned down the manuscript because it was deficient and was too
polite to say this. No other publisher came forward until Seven
Stories Press volunteered. Felsenthal's agent, Philippa Brophy,
represents Gary Webb, whose controversial ``Dark Alliance: The CIA,
the Contras, and the Crack Cocaine Explosion'' is also published by
Seven Stories. According to her notes, Webb is a source for
Felsenthal's assessment of The Cleveland Plain Dealer, one of many
Newhouse newspapers, which she calls ``perhaps the most
relentlessly reviled paper in the country.'' (I have read many
lists ranking newspapers as good or bad or up or down, but never as
reviled.) She then quotes Webb: ``Of all the newspapers I've worked
for, that is the most bizarre operation, where the business side
essentially runs the newspaper.'' This is annoyingly unfair. If she
tried to determine whether the business side ran the paper, it
doesn't show. And she fails to mention that Webb left more than a
decade ago, a period during which that paper and most Newhouse
papers have improved significantly.
</P>
<P>
   What this book is, then, is a rather dull hatchet job. The
contradictions of the Newhouse family, which through its various
publications, including Vogue and Vanity Fair, has done so much to
promote the culture of celebrity while remaining intensely private,
remain unexplained. Felsenthal suggests that Si Newhouse's younger
brother, Donald, is the real force behind the company's success,
but supplies incomplete evidence. She describes little of the
interplay between the brothers except to note that they dine once a
week with their families at the same East Side restaurant and that
they like each other. Si Newhouse and his brother, like their
father before them, are rich and shrewd. Just how shrewd and how
rich are not knowable. Unlike most families in their business, they
have not taken their company public. In this book, Si Newhouse, in
particular, comes across as opaque, hard-working, introverted and
addicted to celebrity employees, some of whom he dismisses on whim.
This is an oft-told tale. How the quirky figure Felsenthal portrays
has been able to build such an influential enterprise remains
unexplored.
</P>
<P>
   An afterthought: publishing moguls often make fascinating
subjects for biographies, but perhaps it is time to retire the
honorific Citizen in the title. Let this book be the last of its
kind.

 &UR; IRIS AND JOHN
</P>
<P>
   BY MARY GORDON
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   John Bayley, the distinguished literary critic, author of books
on Shakespeare and Tolstoy, has been married for more than 40 years
to Iris Murdoch, the eminent novelist and philosopher. Now Murdoch
has been stricken with Alzheimer's disease and Bayley has the sole
care of her. His caretaking is an act of heroic love, but every now
and again he loses his composure. He speaks of ``the horrid wish,
almost a compulsion at some moments, to show the other how bad
things are. Force her to share the knowledge, relieve what seems my
isolation. I make a savage comment today about the grimness of our
outlook. Iris looks relieved and intelligent. She says, 'But I love
you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   These heartbreaking sentences exemplify an important part of the
greatness of ``Elegy for Iris.'' It is a greatness that must be
seen simultaneously in literary and moral terms, for the moral
trustworthiness of Bayley's voice is inextricably connected to its
rightness of tone. Bayley is indeed engaged in a continuing act of
heroic love, but the heroism plays itself out in a register that is
unfamiliar to contemporary audiences, particularly American ones.
Its dominant notes are humility, modesty, patience and humor. The
heroism is all the more admirable for its reluctance to acknowledge
that heroism might be defined in such terms.
</P>
<P>
   It may be surprising to speak to the pleasures of a book that
recounts a tragedy, but Bayley has been throughout his life a
determined searcher, in a particularly English way, for life's
pleasures. His descriptions of these are in themselves a cause for
joy. He speaks of the roses in his failed garden: ``They had
tissuelike petals and smelled of wine. The white petals looked as
transparent as ice.'' The book is full of humor: he tells us that
he is grateful that he and Iris were spared ``the media-haunted
kitchens of today.'' He chronicles, with a quiet relish, the
pleasures of a successful and enjoyable marriage in which two
singular souls found a happiness as luminous as any we have heard
of in the annals of marriage (a genre not noted for appealing
models). For John Bayley and Iris Murdoch, marriage was much
concerned with the preservation of individual solitude. Bayley's
aphorisms about marriage have the formal satisfaction of La
Rochefoucauld's, substituting self-reflective generosity for
knowing bitterness: ``Inside marriage, one ceases to be observant
because observation has become so automatic, its object at once
absorbing and taken for granted''; ``To feel oneself held and
cherished and accompanied, and yet to be alone. To be closely and
physically entwined, and yet feel solitude's friendly presence, as
warm and undesolating as contiguity itself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rivers and pictures were our holiday ideals,'' Bayley says,
and we enter the story of Iris Murdoch's decline at a moment by a
river. This is not the mighty Mississippi or the romantic Danube.
It's a poky little river near Oxford, where the couple have taken
dips on hot days for nearly half a century. The scene of their
final bathe in this river is as masterly as a moment of Chekhov:
</P>
<P>
   ``In her shabby old one-piece swimsuit . . . she was an awkward
and anxious figure, her socks trailing round her ankles. She was
obstinate about not taking these off, and I gave up the struggle. A
pleasure barge chugged slowly past, an elegant girl in a bikini
sunning herself on the deck, a young man in white shorts at the
steering wheel. . . . We must have presented a comic spectacle --
an elderly man struggling to remove the garments from an old lady,
still with white skin and incongruously fair hair. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Once in the water, Iris cheered up a bit. It was almost too
warm, hardly refreshing. But its old brown slow-flowing
deliciousness remained, and we smiled happily at each other as we
paddled quietly to and fro. Waterlily leaves, with an occasional
fat yellow flower, rocked gently at the passage of a pleasure boat.
Small bright blue dragonflies hovered motionless above them. The
water was deep, and cooler as we moved out from the bank, but we
did not go out far. Looking down, I could see her muddy feet, still
in their socks, moving in the brown depths.'' Anyone who has cared
for an Alzheimer's patient will be struck by the detail of the
socks. A balked willfulness about routines of life like bathing and
dressing can become characteristic, and can darken the morning of
the most cheerful caretaker. The details of this river swim are
metaphoric for Bayley and Murdoch's life together: the ``brown
slow-flowing deliciousness,'' the ``occasional fat yellow flower,''
the ``small bright blue dragonflies,'' the depths noted but not
explored, the glamorous world glimpsed from the corner of the eye.
The sources of Bayley and Murdoch's bond are not those of
conventional heterosexual romance, ending up at the altar; what
they both seemed to be after was submersion in a pool that would
allow them a dependable refreshment and also the occasional glimpse
of brilliance. It is possible to say they married for privacy and
comfort, but to say that is to ignore the mystery and complexity of
their union.
</P>
<P>
   John Bayley fell in love with Iris Murdoch when he was in his
late 20's and she was in her early 30's; she passed his window on a
bicycle. ``I indulged the momentary fantasy that nothing had ever
happened to her; that she was simply bicycling about, waiting for
me to arrive. She was not a woman with a past or an unknown
present.'' This almost mystical vision, in which Murdoch appears as
timeless as God, foreshadows the timelessness that is the curse of
the victim of Alzheimer's, in which past and future are collapsed
into a moment that is a mix of blankness and anxiety. Bayley
suggests that the comparative lack of anguish with which he can
experience his wife's condition is explicable by its echoes in his
past perception of her. Always she was, for him, a person for whom
identity was not important; she was always protean, hidden; he
rejoiced in her unknowableness. The impermeability of her mind now
is, for him, only another type of something he has always known.
</P>
<P>
   Radical privacy, sealing compartments of her life off from each
other, was always a condition of Iris Murdoch's selfhood, and
anyone who married her had to deal with that. From the beginning,
she had friendships that she kept from Bayley, and love affairs
that he was meant to understand had nothing to do with him. There
are some hints that this was not always easy, but Bayley rose to
the challenge. ``In early days, I always thought it would be vulgar
-- as well as not my place -- to give any indications of jealousy,
but she knew when it was there, and she soothed it just by being
the self she always was with me, which I soon knew to be wholly and
entirely different from any way that she was with other people.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-IRIS-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: other people.'') &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bayley did desire Iris Murdoch, but it was a desire both simpler
and more complex than the kind we are used to hearing about. Its
source was the body, but its satisfactions contained intimations of
a kind of pastoral comedy in which the true Eden is a return to
childhood. When they first embrace after a dance in which Iris
appears ridiculous to him in a flame-colored brocade, falling down
the stairs by way of entrance, we are told that ``she seemed to be
giving way to some deep need of which she had been wholly
unconscious: the need to throw away not only the maneuvers and
rivalries of intellect but also the emotional fears and
fascinations, the power struggles and surrenders of adult loving.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Bayley tells us ``I think one reason we fell in love, and
got on so well, is that both of us have always been naive and
innocent, at some deep healing level.'' Bayley asserts that Murdoch
has always been free of professional competitiveness and
ambitiousness; her having forgotten that she has written books is
an extension of the modest self-forgetfulness that marked her as a
writer. Neither of them seemed interested in any sort of
fashionableness; they dressed badly and lived in domestic chaos in
a crumbling house. They were remarkably free of the demands of the
outside world; they pleased themselves and each other.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is no one else but him in her world, and his days are
shaped by caring for her. That he can see this as a great hardship
but not a martyrdom is a triumph not only of goodness but also of
the imagination. The greatest anguish for someone who loves an
Alzheimer's patient is the sense that the beloved is no longer
there, but Bayley uses his luminous and supple mind to prevent that
anguish; he insists upon the continuity between their past and
their present. The couple who spent hours in front of a Piero
fresco now devote their mornings to watching ``Teletubbies'';
nevertheless, they share an act of visual apprehension. He is quite
aware of the cruel irony that their marriage, which was marked by a
desire to return to the innocence of childhood, condemns them to
the radical simplicity of childhood because Murdoch is no longer
capable of anything else. Bayley suggests that their marriage was
not most importantly a marriage of true minds, but a marriage of
domestic closeness, of shared routines, shared jokes, rituals,
songs, of physical proximity and the dependability of seeing each
other regularly. They still have all that, in terrible spades.
</P>
<P>
   BayleY is neither a fool nor a deceiver, of himself or of us. He
does not forget the loss, or the fact that the main victim is his
wife, not himself. ``All this sounds quite merry, but in fact, most
days are for her a kind of despair,'' he writes. He recounts a
harrowing bus trip from Gatwick Airport to Oxford, during which
Murdoch panics, harassing the bus driver and her fellow passengers.
Bayley arrives home desperate, sick with flu, knowing they won't
make such a trip again. He is adamant about resisting the invasive
help of the welfare state, but I wanted to beg him to call on his
beloved friends, to whom he and his wife have given so much for so
many years, to suggest to him the limits of a stiff upper lip and
the tonic effects of an afternoon off.
</P>
<P>
   But such practical considerations seem almost to defile the
sacred enclosure of the Bayley-Murdoch marriage, of which Murdoch's
illness is, after all, only the latest chapter. ``Elegy for Iris,''
a title with its own rather dark double meanings, is a celebration
of the mystery of human connection, which marriage metonymically
enacts. Bayley wanted Murdoch in his life; he treasured her as a
benevolent, constant, and finally incomprehensible presence. He
still rejoices in her presence beside him in the marriage bed; he
is still able to swim in the river of his desire: ``It is
wonderfully peaceful to sit in bed with Iris reassuringly asleep
and gently snoring. Half asleep again myself, I have a feeling of
floating down the river, and watching all the rubbish from the
house and from our lives -- the good as well as the bad -- sinking
slowly down through the dark water until it is lost in the depths.
Iris is floating or swimming quietly beside me. Weeds and larger
leaves sway and stretch themselves beneath the surface. Blue
dragonflies dart and hover to and fro by the riverbank. And
suddenly, a kingfisher flashes past.''
</P>
<P>
   Santayana said that everything in nature is lyrical in its ideal
essence, comic in its existence and tragic in its fate. In its
evocation of the lyrical, the comic and the tragic, this splendid
book enlarges our imagination of the range and possibilities of
love.

 &UR; THE EMPEROR'S NEW DOG
</P>
<P>
   BY JONATHAN KEATES
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Until the end of the 19th century, almost every novelist or
dramatist felt honor bound to respect the canons of traditional
storytelling. Plots carried no obvious suggestion of alternative
beginnings or endings. Events occurred in chronological sequence
and the omniscient author, while entitled to direct reaction to the
narrative, was not expected to interfere drastically with its
progress or behave too waywardly in developing characters. Now and
then a writer might feel bold enough to kick over the traces.
George Eliot abruptly halted the majestic progress of
``Middlemarch'' to examine a flaw in her technique as narrator. At
a crucial moment in one of his comedies the Italian dramatist Carlo
Goldoni inserted an astonishing address by the heroine to the
audience, telling us what she might have said if her creator could
have been bothered to observe correct dramatic protocol.
</P>
<P>
   With Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis, however, whose novel
``Quincas Borba'' was first published in 1891, we arrive at a
genuine subversive, bent on overturning convention but always with
an air of leisurely nonchalance. Steeped in the work of
contemporary French and British novelists, he nevertheless rejected
the missionary realism of Zola or a Trollopean matter-of-factness
in favor of an authenticity based, with conscious irony, on
emphasizing contrivance. Truth to life in ``Quincas Borba'' depends
not on incidental details of calling cards, carriages or newspapers
but on the author's continuing presence as ringmaster and stage
manager, constantly reminding us of his power to dissipate or
rearrange the universe he created.
</P>
<P>
   This deliberate air of transience is partly induced by Machado's
own world of late-19th-century Brazil, poised to become a republic
after 70 years as an empire ruled by a branch of the royal family
of Portugal. Machado had long ago perceived the inherent frailties
of the imperial charade, sustained by halfhearted attempts at
constitutional democracy in a nation that still relied extensively
on slave labor. The ultimate madness of his hero, Rubiao de
Alvarenga, is emblematic of the country's dubious political
destiny, while the man himself, according to one authoritative
reading of the novel, is Brazil's last Emperor, Pedro II.
</P>
<P>
   Such an interpretation matters less perhaps for the ordinary
reader than the book's links with its predecessor among Machado's
works, ``The Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas,'' whose principal
character, the eccentric philosopher Quincas Borba, here provides
us with a deliberately misleading title. After a lingering illness
Borba dies, leaving vast wealth -- ``slaves, bonds, stocks in the
Bank of Brazil . . . jewelry, coins, books'' -- which he himself
acquired at the last minute after years of shabby penury, to a
genuinely grieving Rubiao. The sole proviso is that the heir must
look after the dead man's dog (also named Quincas Borba) and in the
fullness of time bury the animal with sufficient decorum.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few predictable elements in the novel is the danger
lurking beneath the allure of Rubiao's surprise inheritance. An
innocent and a dreamer, he drifts from the provinces to Rio de
Janeiro in search of sophistication and the chance to snub those
who earlier mocked his stubborn loyalty to Borba and his canine
alter ego. Meeting Cristiano and Sofia Palha, a brace of plausible
social climbers not unlike Dickens's Mr. and Mrs. Veneering, he is
shamelessly exploited by the greedy husband, while the wife, having
coaxed him into a liaison, flings him aside when he appears most
vulnerable. By now Rubiao starts to go mad, having his beard
trimmed to resemble Napoleon III's and then convincing himself that
he is indeed the Emperor.
</P>
<P>
   Through the clarity of Gregory Rabassa's spirited translation,
such plot elements may seem simple enough, but the author is
constantly trying to detach us from the mere exercise of threading
together a sequential narrative. What in fact happens here occurs
not within the story itself but on a foreground created by
Machado's determination to sabotage the resources used effectively
by earlier novelists. Scarcely a chapter goes by without the
accompanying sense of its creator as critic, not just of other
writers but of the expectant reader besides. Interrupting a
significant episode in which Rubiao is being duped by a wily
political journalist, Machado pauses to consider whether or not he
should make use of the habit of using chapter headings to summarize
contents. He decides not to, but mocks the reader's desire for
explanations before taking up the story once more, apparently
because ``I don't know if all of the next chapter could be
contained in a title.''
</P>
<P>
   Characters become handy vehicles for this speculative approach
to putting a novel together. In a passage reminiscent of Alice's
conversation with the flowers in ``Through the Looking Glass,''
Sofia Palha, uncertain whether to reject Rubiao, projects her
doubts onto a pair of roses, both of which supply her with an
answer of sorts. And Machado seizes the chance to meditate on the
psychological collusion of human beings with inanimate objects:
``The expression, 'Talking to his buttons,' which looks like a
simple metaphor for 'Talking to himself,' is a phrase with a real
and direct meaning. The buttons operate synchronically with us,
forming a kind of senate, handy and cheap, that always votes in
favor of our motions.''
</P>
<P>
   In this new edition of ``Quincas Borba,'' interpretative
guidance by David T. Haberly and Celso Favaretto consoles us
somewhat for the mistrust of readers implied in Machado's endless
shifts of direction. Both commentators maintain that it is not hard
to grasp the book's fascination, whether as a political allegory, a
drama of solitude amid multitudes, a critique of Brazil's failure
to reconcile the imperatives of past and present or a celebration
of skepticism. Features like these brought Machado his earliest
constituency of English-speaking readers when ``Bras Cubas'' was
translated in 1952. For some its sequel, ``Quincas Borba,''
consolidates the triumph of a Latin American proto-modernist. For
others the author's interventionist tactics, amounting at times to
a peevish, high-handed impatience with the task in front of him,
may offer discouragement to the normally pleasing experience of
hailing an undiscovered masterpiece.

 &UR; DIGGING DOWN
</P>
<P>
   BY EDWARD MENDELSON
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In the first poem in ``Opened Ground,'' Seamus Heaney
contemplates the pen resting between his finger and thumb, then
says, ``I'll dig with it.'' The ground opened by his pen in poem
after poem is dense with the bodies of the ancient and recent dead,
and the emptiness left by his digging is filled with glowing
visionary memories. Heaney has selected the contents of this volume
from all his earlier books, added a few previously uncollected
works and appended his 1995 Nobel Prize address, ``Crediting
Poetry,'' as a commentary on the poems. The book belongs, he
writes, ``somewhere between the two categories'' of a ``Selected
Poems'' and a ``Collected.'' At 59, with the prospect of decades of
work ahead of him, Heaney has assembled a collection with a
satisfying heft and more than enough variety of subject and style
to delineate the shape of a long and constantly evolving career. It
eloquently confirms his status as the most skillful and profound
poet writing in English today.
</P>
<P>
   Heaney began by writing about objects, then turned to absences,
some of them caused by the violence of the northern Irish
``Troubles.'' More recently, as he says in his Nobel lecture, he
has tried ``to make space in my reckoning and imagining for the
marvelous as well as for the murderous,'' but in fact the marvelous
has never seemed distant from him. In his early poems, simply by
repeating a local place name to himself, he was able to dig deep
into the ground of memory. In ``Toome,'' his mouth shapes the name
of a childhood village, and ``under the dislodged /
</P>
<P>
   slab of the tongue /
</P>
<P>
   I push into a souterrain /
</P>
<P>
   prospecting.'' He works his way down ten thousand years of
</P>
<P>
   loam, flints, musket-balls,
</P>
<P>
   fragmented ware,
</P>
<P>
   torcs and fish-bones,
</P>
<P>
   till I am sleeved in
</P>
<P>
   alluvial mud that shelves
</P>
<P>
   suddenly under
</P>
<P>
   bogwater and tributaries,
</P>
<P>
   and elvers tail my hair.
</P>
<P>
   Other poems from his first three books, ``Death of a
Naturalist'' (1966), ``Door into the Dark'' (1969) and ``Wintering
Out'' (1972), imagine in the soil of Denmark and Ireland the
preserved bodies of the ``bog people,'' to whom Heaney gives voices
in poems that leave the reader uncertain, in the first few lines,
whether the speaker is the poet or someone unimaginably ancient.
</P>
<P>
   Heaney invented for these early poems an abrupt tactile
vocabulary of moisture, stickiness and fullness. The poems display
a craftsman's delight in compressed, short-line stanzas packed with
phrases like ``mucky gaps'' or ``his hands grub,'' often followed
in the closing stanzas by Latinate or learned phrases, as if the
poems were returning to the world of words with a prize taken from
the world of nature. The lines of these stanzas often open with an
unusually harsh, strong beat, and Heaney typically postpones more
comfortable iambic meters until a poem has established a trochaic
opening as its norm.
</P>
<P>
   Heaney's reputation was made by this memorable and authoritative
style, but it threatened to become a tic. In ``North'' (1975),
``Field Work'' (1979) and ``Station Island'' (1984), his verse
became more meditative and expansive, with no loss of excitement,
and he sometimes dispensed with verse in order to write spare,
almost entirely unrhythmical prose poems that relied on the
exactness of their vocabulary for their effects. All these books
were suffused with affectionate domestic detail, but they were
shadowed by the Troubles, as Heaney labored to incorporate
questions of justice into his poetry without joining the haters on
either side. His first responses were angry ones, as in ``Whatever
You Say Say Nothing'': ``O land of password, handgrip, wink and
nod, /
</P>
<P>
   Of open minds as open as a trap.'' Then they modulated into
mourning, sometimes in puzzled, tentative memorial poems to those
killed in earlier wars, like the Irish poet Francis Ledwidge, who
died for England in World War I: ``In you, our dead enigma, all the
strains /
</P>
<P>
   Criss-cross in useless equilibrium.''
</P>
<P>
   Heaney is a poet of localities, not nations. Villages and rivers
are named throughout his early poems, but in ``Opened Ground'' the
name ``Ireland'' first occurs halfway through the book, in a
translation from a medieval romance that refers to ``all the
madmen'' there. Later in the book it occurs only in poems on
historical subjects and in his Nobel lecture. During the Troubles,
Heaney translated fragments from Dante, and took lessons from
Dante's exemplary combination of local loyalties with universal
themes.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he wrote the disturbing profundities of ``The Haw
Lantern'' (1987), Heaney had worked his way past the angers and
bafflements of his first responses to public themes. Many reviewers
regretted the loss of his earlier glint and hardness, but Heaney
had stopped writing clever poems and had begun writing great ones.
The magnificent parable ``From the Republic of Conscience'' records
his return from the ``frugal republic'' named in the title of the
poem and his status as ``a dual citizen'' of the republic of
conscience and the profligate monarchy of esthetics, expected to
speak on behalf of the first in the tongue of the second.
</P>
<P>
   Having won his wrestle with politics, Heaney now wrote more and
more as a visionary. The first poem in ``Seeing Things'' (1991)
translates the lines in the ``Aeneid'' about the golden bough that
opens the way to the underworld -- yet another instrument for
opening ground -- and the rest of the book glows with
breathtakingly luminous visitations to empty places and lost
persons. The three-line poem ``An August Night,'' evidently a
memory of Heaney's father, reads like an extended haiku: ``His
hands were warm and small and knowledgeable. /
</P>
<P>
   When I saw them again last night, they were two ferrets, /
</P>
<P>
   Playing all by themselves in a moonlit field.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-HEANEY-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: field.'') &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his most recent collection, ``The Spirit Level'' (1996), and
in his Nobel lecture, Heaney combines the visionary and the
concrete with a hard-won air of effortlessness. He compares the
``order of poetry'' to two varieties of worship, one illustrated by
a legendary Irish saint who let a bird build a nest and raise her
young in his hand, the other by a carved relief in a museum in
Sparta, ``possibly set up to Orpheus by a local poet.'' Like the
Spartan poet, Heaney claims a sacred vocation for his art, but,
like the Irish saint, his vocation is in service to the bird's nest
and its fragile contents.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Vendler's compact study, ``Seamus Heaney,'' traces the
full arc of Heaney's career with lucid efficiency. A rapid series
of close readings emphasizes the literary ancestry and techniques
of individual poems. Each of Vendler's seven chapters summarizes
the central themes of one or more of Heaney's books, then describes
his ``second thoughts'' on these themes in later books. If Vendler
sometimes belabors the obvious, as in a three-page catechism
summarizing Heaney's poem about the bird-nurturing saint, her book
is nonetheless a model of a kind of criticism now alarmingly rare,
a sympathetic exposition addressed to intelligent readers in or out
of academia.
</P>
<P>
   At crucial moments, though, Vendler writes less as a critic than
as a courtier reassuring a conscience-stricken monarch that his
troubles are not of his own choosing. She writes on her opening
page that ``conditions forced Heaney . . . into becoming a poet of
public as well as private life'' and later that the ``carnage in
Northern Ireland . . . compelled Heaney to gather representative
alter egos,'' as if his pen had been guided by forces outside
himself. She closes by reasserting her book's recurring argument
that ``the genre of the lyric obliges its poet'' only to represent
his responses to his personal situation ``in adequate imaginative
language.'' But Heaney's efforts to reconcile ethics and esthetics
are more generous and complex than Vendler implies, and the effect
of her polemic is intermittently to represent him as a lesser poet
than he is.
</P>
<P>
   Like every ambitious writer who continuously seeks a larger
field for his vision, Heaney sometimes missteps. He is superb at
rendering menace -- he transforms the thuggish roadblocks set up by
Northern Irish combatants into mythical way stations on a dangerous
quest -- but when he portrays violence his verse turns lifeless,
estheticized and inert. Every few years since the early 1970's he
has written a poem detailing violent acts against women or
children, sometimes in a crude vocabulary that in recent years has
included the starkest of four-letter words. Although eloquently
appalled by such violence, Heaney in his prose also speaks
repeatedly of his wish to make his art equal to it. But in these
few poems he achieves only the spurious toughness that afflicts
much 20th-century writing when an inherently gentle imagination
tries to think its way into moods it finds repulsive. Critics,
Vendler among them, become notably defensive when praising what she
calls the ``merciless'' quality of these poems, and it is perhaps a
measure of the value placed on toughness for its own sake in modern
literary culture -- and of an underlying sense of vulnerability --
that they feel obliged to praise them at all.
</P>
<P>
   Heaney finds a more plausible and powerful treatment of these
matters in his forthcoming translation of ``Beowulf'' (recently
excerpted in The Sunday Times of London), in which archaic hatreds
and mythical violence sound out through the harshest glories of his
verse. ``Opened Ground'' is the work of the one living poet who can
rightly claim to be the ``Beowulf'' poet's heir.

   The Untold Story of American Submarine Espionage.

 &UR; THE SONAR WAR
</P>
<P>
   BY TIMOTHY NAFTALI
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, two ballistic missile submarines, one Soviet and one
American, died similar deaths. In each case an unexpected explosion
set off a series of catastrophic events culminating in a dramatic
plunge to depths where submarines collapse from bow to stern like
accordions. Entombed in these blocks of steel were 200 men.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Cold War ended less than a decade ago, it is
farther away from us emotionally than World War II. There is
something about the carnage and moral certainties of that war that
makes it accessible even to the notoriously ahistorical Generation
X. But the Cold War, with the notable exception of the morality
play of Vietnam, seems in retrospect a time of contingency plans
and unrealized fears, now gratefully dissipated.
</P>
<P>
   Yet every day for over 40 years, young Russians and Americans
went to very difficult jobs not knowing whether that day would be
their last. It is fashionable now to play down the fears of the
statesmen, to describe as manipulative or insincere presidential or
Kremlin statements of concern. But what is beyond doubt is the fear
that the individual sailor, pilot or spy periodically felt in doing
his duty.
</P>
<P>
   In deftly exploring the lives of engineers and sailors who spied
on Soviet power from the depths of the world's oceans, Sherry
Sontag and Christopher Drew have produced an evocative and
important look at the Cold War. ``Blind Man's Bluff: The Untold
Story of American Submarine Espionage'' is also satisfying to read,
at times hurtling forward with the speed of a Polaris submarine.
The use of submarines to plumb Soviet intentions and capabilities
involved some of the most secret, or blackest, American projects of
the Cold War. Sontag, who has covered government and international
affairs for The National Law Journal, and Drew, who is a reporter
at The New York Times, cultivated veteran submariners who talked
for the first time about spying. With the help of Annette Lawrence
Drew and of an intrepid Russian colleague, they tracked down Soviet
counterparts where appropriate, and set the sea stories into a
wider Cold War context.
</P>
<P>
   The effect is a compelling study of magnificent men and spying
machines. Take the case of Capt. James E. Bradley Jr., a diesel
submariner with World War II service. One of the frustrating truths
of the Cold War was that it was always extremely difficult to
figure out what the Russians intended to do. Unlike General
Eisenhower in World War II, President Dwight D. Eisenhower and his
successors were rarely presented by their intelligence chiefs with
the high-level strategic chatter of their adversary. The Russians
took better care with their codes and ciphers than the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who by 1966 was director of undersea warfare for the
Office of Naval Intelligence, came up with an ingenious partial
solution: why not bug transmissions that the Russians would assume
could not be bugged? Recalling the signs ``Cable Crossing. Do Not
Anchor Cables'' from childhood days on the Mississippi, Bradley
assumed that Russian shores would have similar warnings posted for
underwater telephone cables. In 1971, with its periscope up, the
nuclear submarine Halibut secretly traced the Siberian coastline
and confirmed Bradley's hunch. After divers attached the largest
telephone tap ever made to a cable on the floor of the Sea of
Okhotsk, a stream of useful information about Soviet naval
deployments and military exercises flowed to Washington. Had the
Russians ever prepared for a first nuclear strike, this tap would
have provided critical warning. Code-named ``Ivy Bells,'' this
source would remain active for a decade, one of the greatest
intelligence hauls of the Cold War, until an American, Ronald
Pelton, sold the secret to the Russians in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The authors also provide simple stories of individual courage,
beginning with a thrilling episode from the first days of Cold War
submarine spying. The diesel submarine was about as inhospitable a
place to work as one could imagine. Smelly and moist, these
120-foot long canisters were often buffeted by waves. And they were
vulnerable. If they didn't regularly approach the surface to pull
fresh air in through a snorkel, their batteries would lose their
charge while the crew suffocated from carbon dioxide in the air.
With fear growing in 1949 that the Soviet Union would soon deploy
its versions of U-boats in the open seas, the Navy sent submarines
close to Soviet ports to follow such vessels or listen to their
communications. As Sontag and Drew tell it, crews on the Tusk and
the Cochino, with newly trained spooks aboard, learned that year
that even in the Cold War the greatest adversary could be the sea.
</P>
<P>
   On-board nuclear reactors would eventually scrub submarines of
the pervasive ``Eau de Diesel'' and allow them to sail underwater
for months at a time, but this progress reduced neither the tension
nor the dangers of underwater spying. By the mid-60's, the arms
race extended into the seas. Not only were the Russians deploying
nuclear tipped ballistic missiles on submarines, but the French and
the superpowers were using the ocean as a firing range to test new
missiles. Among the new American fleet of nuclear submarines were
spy boats with specially designed hulls to permit deep-water
investigations, to detect strategic Soviet junk and when necessary
to violate Soviet territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
   The twin submarine disasters of 1968 provided a test of the new
American approach to the deep. That year the Russians lost a Golf
class diesel submarine in the Pacific, while the American nuclear
attack submarine Scorpion disappeared on its way back to Norfolk,
Va. In a mark of the sophistication of the naval spy game by that
time, neither the White House nor the Kremlin blamed the other for
the unexplained disappearance of a ballistic missile submarine.
Unlike the United States, however, Moscow had no way of finding its
sailors. Soviet submariners were trained to send signals from
predetermined points along a tight path from the motherland to
their firing positions off the American coast.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-BLUFF-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: coast.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Russian sub's failure to send its position triggered a
desperate search by a dozen Soviet ships. But Moscow lacked the
underwater technology to investigate the ocean floor for her dead.
Five years earlier, the loss of 129 men on the American nuclear
submarine Thresher had inspired the Navy to promote a serious
deep-water program to investigate wrecks. In 1968 this program
grabbed the attention of the White House by finding the Scorpion
11,000 feet below the surface, and by locating the Soviet sub 1,700
miles northwest of Hawaii, with its complement of cipher machines
and nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   This hunt seemed to capture the spirit of the entire Cold War.
Not only did technological prowess permit Americans to set new
standards for the Russians to match, but it also led to costly
American overreaching. Learning of the Navy's achievement, the
C.I.A. persuaded the White House to finance a joint venture with
Howard Hughes to recover the Soviet submarine from the Pacific
floor. Warned that the submarine was too fragile and would break
apart under the stresses of a climb to the surface, the C.I.A. went
ahead anyway -- and 90 percent of the Soviet sub sheared away as it
was lifted by the Hughes-designed ship Glomar Explorer in 1974. The
C.I.A. found only six Russian corpses in the portion brought to the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   So was all this courage and innovation worth it? The authors are
careful not to offer grand theories. However, they suggest that
espionage played a significant role. It reduced uncertainties and
increased confidence that neither superpower was bent on blowing up
the world. But it also increased the tension of the Cold War, the
need to follow enemy submarines closely, to enter hostile waters
and to push old ships beyond their limits. The Russians did not
rely as much as the Americans on this highly technological spying,
but they enjoyed equally dramatic results. From 1967 until the
mid-80's, an American Navy officer, John Walker, and some members
of his family gave the Russians the keys to copying our submarine
technology and to following changes in our naval doctrine. As
Soviet ships got quieter, their payloads more dangerous and their
use wiser, the need for American spying increased. Until the very
last days of the Cold War, in the rarefied world of undersea chess,
ignorance seemed the greatest danger. With their book, Sontag and
Drew introduce us to one of the least known and most harrowing
battlefields of the superpower conflict.

   A Los Angeles doctor, trying to save his lover after she is
bitten by a snake she is studying, is forced to track down a
psychopathic criminal who shares her rare blood type. Part love
story, part thriller, this novel explores ``highly emotional
conflicts without resorting to either sentimentality or cliche,''
Scott Bradfield wrote here last year.

   In a series of tales centering on a powerful tycoon and his
family, the prolific Mexican author explores the troubled relations
between his native country and the United States. Last year our
reviewer, Jay Parini, found the stories uneven but said that at
their best they display ``acute observation'' and a fine ``sense of
satire.'' Eccentric Neighborhoods, by Rosario Ferre (Plume,
$12.95), is a sweeping novel about the shifting fortunes of two
upper-crust families in Puerto Rico, one representing the nation's
agrarian past and the other its industrial future. ``The author's
voice is bright and vital,'' Mark Childress wrote here earlier this
year. ``The magic in Ferre's fiction arises from the intertwined
experiences of human beings, carrying the story of 20th-century
Puerto Rico in the arc of their lives.''

   This chronicle of adultery, homosexuality and intrigue among the
British aristocracy focuses on Alice Keppel, the winsome mistress
of Queen Victoria's eldest son, both as Prince of Wales and as King
Edward VII, and her daughter, Violet, whose heart was broken when
her affair with the writer Vita Sackville-West hit the skids. The
result is a ``fascinating, richly textured story,'' Kennedy Fraser
wrote in the Book Review last year. In The Queen: A Biography of
Elizabeth II, by Ben Pimlott (Wiley, $18.95), a professor of
politics and contemporary history at the University of London
argues that the Queen's dutiful, passive reign is in keeping with
Britain's sense of itself and its history. In 1997 our reviewer,
Andrew Sullivan, called this a ``superbly judicious biography''
with ``a wry awareness of the paradox of a populist monarchy being
at the center of a constitutional democracy.''

</P>
<P>
   In this historical novel, set in rural North Carolina early in
the century, a religious woman tells of her difficult marriage to
an industrious, practical-minded man, and their conflicting views
of salvation and devotion. '' 'The Truest Pleasure' is a quietly
audacious book,'' Richard Bausch wrote in these pages in 1995. ``It
contains characters and situations that aren't easy to forget.''

</P>
<P>
   By Jeffrey Steingarten.
</P>
<P>
   Vintage, $14. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In these obsessively omnivorous essays, the food critic for
Vogue describes his far-flung gastronomic adventures, stopping
along the way with morsels of culinary advice and medical and
scientific digressions. ``Steingarten writes with marvelous ease
and clarity and humor,'' Alexander Chancellor said here last year.
``His facts are fascinating and so are his recipes.'' Olives: The
Life and Lore of a Noble Fruit, by Mort Rosenblum (North Point,
$15), is a journalist's freewheeling homage to Athena's gift to
mankind, crammed with history, recipes and health tips. This is an
``edifying new book,'' Christopher Lehmann-Haupt wrote in The New
York Times in 1996. ``Pit by pit, his savory details add up.''

</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel in the Iran-contra affair answers his
many critics, charging that Congress, conservative judges and,
above all, Reagan Administration officials prevented him from
meting out justice. ``Walsh's book is a useful record of the
scandal and its aftermath,'' John B. Judis wrote here in 1997.

<P>
   University of Nebraska, $14.95. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This first novel is about a bloody confrontation between Federal
agents and Indian protesters in the Black Hills of South Dakota.
The result is an ``unflinching look at the conflicts among the
Sioux, and . . . the pervasive cynicism and slow-burn despair that
accompany a history of frustrated attempts to set right several
generations of wrongs,'' Scott Martelle said in these pages in
1996.

<P>
   Hungry Mind, $12.95. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This profile of a brave and cunning Federal agent named Garland
Bunting is also a history of bootlegging, which these days mostly
exploits alcoholics among the rural poor. In 1985 our reviewer, Bob
Lancaster, found the author's ``reporting style so sharp and
economical that the prose fairly crackles.''

   A precocious housecat recounts his life and times, from his

 &UR; COLOR VISION
</P>
<P>
   BY JONATHAN RIEDER
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the motion picture ``Lethal Weapon 2,'' the black
detective played by Danny Glover shouts to his white partner in his
arms (Mel Gibson): ``You're not dead until I tell you. Now
breathe!'' To which Gibson replies: ``Did anyone ever tell you, you
really are a beautiful man? Give us a kiss before they come.''
</P>
<P>
   This is only one of the moments that catch Hazel V. Carby's
fancy in ``Race Men,'' her provocative and exasperating look at
depictions of black masculinity in novels, jazz, film and
photography. Ranging from the Caribbean writer C. L. R. James's
search for heroic black manhood to the efforts of the folklorists
John and Alan Lomax to fabricate Leadbelly's primitivism, the book
chronicles the deforming power of ``the gaze,'' as Carby might put
it. Her concern is with acts of symbolic violence -- by whites
against blacks, but also by men of all hues against women. They are
a form of soul murder, she argues, in which the image turns on the
imagined. Even images that don't seem virulent may be backhanded
compliments, as when the glorification of blacks as superior
sensualists serves to deprive them of rationality. Looks can kill,
sometimes with kindness.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to necromancy than to science, this sort of cultural
decoding is notoriously dicey, especially if you think a handful of
texts can be made to give up the secrets of a culture. Moreover,
Carby's interpretations are often far-fetched. Her notion that
Miles Davis's sidemen symbolize both a phallus and the breasts from
which he sucked creative inspiration seems a bit much. She is at
her best when she curbs the excess fanciness and keeps close enough
to her targets to illuminate them in all their subtlety.
</P>
<P>
   Her detailed examination of a series of modernist photographs of
Paul Robeson by Nickolas Muray in the 1920's illuminates the
murderous power of the glance. To stare at Robeson's naked body in
the light of Carby's commentary makes for a wretched poignancy.
This ``homoerotic'' rendering of Robeson made him a hapless
plaything of the photographer's lust. Here, the look is a leer; the
eye is invited to follow the placement of the body toward the
genital triangle. White reviewers of Robeson's spirituals who
hungered for primal ``authenticity'' offered a similar
constriction. They sifted out of the spirituals the veiled urging
to ``steal away'' to freedom. Fetishism, reshaping the object in
jarring ways, is always selfish; it stripped Robeson of his
prideful dignity, his political core, his sense of himself.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just whites who are conjurers. Black men too have
worked their symbolic mischief, on themselves and on black women.
Carby takes her lead from Phillip Brian Harper's comment, ``All
debates over and claims to 'authentic' African-American identity
are largely animated by a profound anxiety about the status
specifically of African-American masculinity.''
</P>
<P>
   If you ever wondered what's the deal with Cornel West's suits
(or his cuffs), it may be neither stylistic affection nor
affectation. To Carby, the suit betokens his link to W. E. B. Du
Bois and the shared cult of manhood both men's clothes ``embody'';
it secures critical intelligence ``as irrevocably and
conservatively masculine.''
</P>
<P>
   This dynamic of manhood underlies the entire structure of jazz,
Carby argues in her chapter on Miles Davis. Davis was a shameless
misogynist who beat women and called them bitches. Even Davis's
music sounds ``patriarchal and phallic'' to Carby. All these men
musically pleasuring one another with their equipment is also
``homoerotic.'' But Carby hears a gentler manhood in the magical
symbiosis achieved by Davis, John Coltrane and Bill Evans on the
album ``Kind of Blue'' (1959). Their ``refusal to resolve the
tension through any single climax'' represents nothing less than a
``democratic sensibility'' and a ``revolutionary mode of being.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure how the refusal of climax gets to define democracy.
In any case, the heavy, old-school Freudian-style reductionism that
reappears throughout ``Race Men'' raises a contradiction that
intensifies as the book moves toward the present. Even as Carby,
who teaches African and African-American studies and American
studies at Yale University, applauds the lingering foreplay of
``Kind of Blue,'' she herself marches to the ideological end point.
In such moments she seems not to be communing with the images so
much as using them to score her points. There is a similar tension
between the flashes of insight and the lifeless jargon into which
she presses them. We are in a universe of ``subject positions,''
``hegemony of a racialized social formation'' and ``inscribed''
bodies, in which an individual ``genders his narrative'' and has
``privileged a discourse.''
</P>
<P>
   One doesn't want to be too fussy about unlovely writing. A lot
of academics write like this; it's post-modern Muzak. It's also why
so much criticism sounds like a cross between Sid Caesar shtick and
Monty Python parody. But in Carby's case, this speaking in tongues
is frustrating because it betrays her imaginative, boldly
distinctive voice; her beloved ideal of jazz, with its image of
free play and artful spontaneity; and her feminist ideal of
intimacy, in this case with her own data.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-RACE-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: data.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This distancing language matches an ideological distance from
American culture. Much has changed since the days of the old
defamatory images, but Carby sees many continuities. In a
patronizing aside to Tiger Woods, Michael Jordan and Danny Glover,
she warns them that they risk the same symbolic capture Robeson
suffered. Actually, it's too late for Glover, she says; his
crossover roles signify ``the exploitative and oppressive nature''
of white dream work. White liberal men in Hollywood use Glover to
expel ``the alien black presence'' and to heal, symbolically, white
men damaged by post-modern life. The affection between Glover and
Gibson -- and the famous embrace that closes ``Lethal Weapon 2'' --
represents not humanizing intimacy but the director's fascination
with homoeroticism.
</P>
<P>
   This verdict strikes me about as wrong as it could be. By airily
removing herself to the cosmic narratives of Huck and Jim, Carby
leaps over more recent and relevant buddy pairs who affirm loyal
partnership while also making way for women, blacks, Jews and
Latinos -- Starsky and Hutch, Crockett and Tubbs, Cagney and Lacey,
Bobby and Sipowicz, Chris and Rita in the original ``Silk
Stalkings.'' ``Lethal Weapon 2'' reverses the old racial
iconography in other ways. The white Riggs (Gibson) is the
dangerous primitive, the defiant Dionysian, while the black
Murtaugh (Glover) is enveloped in caution and domesticity. When his
daughter appears in a condom ad, he's the consummate Dad, foolish
and befuddled -- which is to say the black man gets a crack at
normality. As their racial banter indicates, such universalism
doesn't come at the price of blackness, any more than Oprah
Winfrey's or Michael Jordan's white fans stop seeing them as black.
</P>
<P>
   Carby's interpretation of masculine intimacy is no less
heavy-handed. She ignores the vernacular codes of male feeling for
cartoonish representations of masculinity; once again, it's as if
she has internalized male anxiety and sees every moment of men's
connection as homoerotic. But Riggs and Murtaugh do not favor the
talky confessionalism of feminist men; they express intimacy in
their own way. Sex can serve as a metaphor for love rather than
vice versa: Gibson's insouciant ``Give us a kiss'' may not mean
what it says, but it says what it means, precisely: ``I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You gotta represent,'' goes the pop tune, and it's true, one
can't help it. That's also true for the people who try to fathom
other people's images. For some time now, the cultural left has
been going around in a funk, deconstructing everything in sight,
wavering between scolding a culture that seems hostile to
liberation and conducting a promiscuous search for signs of
resistance to that culture's dominating symbols. But in all this
rage for representation, the left has often committed soul murder
too, projecting disappointment onto the objects of its gaze,
representing itself rather than the complex reality of a vibrantly
imperfect culture. Given that liberals won the imagery wars on the
racial and sexual front, there is an irony here. Maybe culture just
isn't that important. And maybe it's better to direct the rage not
for, but against, the suffering and inequality that cultural
triumph has been unable to arrest.

<P>
   My Journey to Jewish Orthodoxy.

 &UR; OLD-TIME RELIGION
</P>
<P>
   BY MARK SILK
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Midway through this arresting spiritual autobiography, an
Orthodox rabbi tells the author: ``It sounds like you've been
searching for what you consider to be religious truth. That's not
the way it happens to most converts.''
</P>
<P>
   To non-Jews, the remark may seem surprising. What could be more
likely to result in religious conversion than the quest for
religious truth? But traditional Judaism is less a system of belief
than a way of living, an orthopraxy that tends to convert people
for emotional rather than intellectual reasons. David Klinghoffer,
who edits the Books, Arts, and Manners section of National Review,
is an exception. For him, the heart of the matter is: Is Judaism
true? All else is secondary.
</P>
<P>
   From an early age, Klinghoffer displayed a religious
sensibility. The adopted child of a well-to-do Los Angeles dentist
and his wife, he took Judaism a good deal more seriously than was
customary in the Reform Jewish milieu in which he was raised. As an
adolescent, he experimented with tefillin -- the leather-strapped
boxes that traditional Jews don in obedience to Deuteronomy 6:8
(``and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they
shall be as frontlets between thine eyes''). He began to be
troubled that his circumcision was not ritually correct, and sought
to remedy the situation by immersing himself in a bathtub and, in
line with Orthodox teaching, drawing a drop of blood from the tip
of his penis with a straight razor. There are two more
re-circumcisions -- first by a Conservative, then by an Orthodox,
mohel -- before he is satisfied that he truly is a Jew.
Klinghoffer's spiritual journey winds through undergraduate years
at Brown University, a summer at the Jewish Theological Seminary, a
passionate love affair with a Roman Catholic woman and the
discovery of his birth mother -- a Swedish Christian who picked out
Jewish parents for her son. The son comes across as an agreeable
young man, open about his shortcomings, modest about his spiritual
accomplishments, un-self-righteous.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he pulls many punches. He has no kind words for the
liberal Judaism of his youth, describing the Reform movement as ``a
thing entirely of this world.'' He cuts Conservative Judaism a
little more slack, but still writes it off as ``untenable.'' A
Jewish pluralist he is not. He is fixed on molding himself to
divine truth, and, as he sees it, that means adopting the belief
that God handed down both the Pentateuch and all rabbinical law
(the ``oral Torah'') to Moses on Mount Sinai. As David Weiss
Halivni has shown, this fundamentalistic account of tradition arose
relatively late in Jewish history, but since the Middle Ages it has
been embraced ever more fervently by Orthodox rabbinical authority.
To say that it rejects modern scholarly understandings of the
composition of the Bible and the Talmud is to say the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Klinghoffer reasons that if the God of the Hebrew Bible is
incapable of guaranteeing the purity of revelation then He is not
the Almighty God He claims to be, and is in fact no God at all.
That God might permit corruptions of the tradition, like other
forms of evil, is intolerable, as is the view that extrabiblical
Jewish law is the result not of direct revelation but of scriptural
exegesis by fallible human beings.
</P>
<P>
   If Klinghoffer's adherence to the inerrancy of Torah is
traditional, his unconcern for Jewry as such is distinctive. He has
nothing to say about the Holocaust or the state of Israel. He
attacks Jewish tribalism, including the self-satisfied subculture
of some birthright Orthodox, and takes a poke at Irving Kristol and
William Safire for advocating Jewish education without subscribing
to Jewish truth. That the covenant was made with the entire Jewish
tribe doesn't seem to concern him. Jewish survival should be solely
a function of belief. With his convert's zeal, David Klinghoffer
has issued a prophetic challenge. Whether he will be honored for it
in his adopted house is an interesting question.

 BREAKFAST ON PLUTO

 &UR; A COMEDY OF TERRORS
</P>
<P>
   BY COURTNEY WEAVER
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Patrick McCabe firmly established himself as a master of the
literary macabre in 1993 with the lurid and brilliant novel ``The
Butcher Boy,'' which escorted us through the mind and world of the
child-murderer Francie Brady in claustrophobic 1960's Ireland. So
when I read the blandly hopeful prelude to his new novel,
``Breakfast on Pluto'' (which was short-listed for Britain's Booker
Prize this year), my immediate thought was: Uh-oh. ``The war
over,'' McCabe ironically writes of the recent Good Friday
agreement in Northern Ireland, ``now perhaps we too can take --
however tentatively -- those first few steps which may end unease
and see us there; home, belonging and at peace.'' For in McCabe's
world, hope is only the flip side of horror, a red herring to lull
you into a kaleidoscopic land riddled with brutality and comedy.
</P>
<P>
   It makes perfect sense that the protagonist of ``Breakfast on
Pluto'' is not an I.R.A. guerrilla, or a war-weary priest, or any
other well-plundered stereotype of literary Northern Ireland.
Rather, this is the tale of Patrick (Pussy) Braden, an effusively
cheerful transvestite who gallivants from his Irish border village
of Tyreelin to swinging-70's London, in search of his ``Sergeant
Rock or Captain Yum Yum Be-My-Girl-For-Ever!'' Abandoned as a baby
by his teen-age mother, unacknowledged by his father, the village
priest, Puss wages a personal campaign of vengeance that takes his
own mental health prisoner, while he's listlessly looking for love
in all the wrong places. Set against the backdrop of a London
paralyzed by I.R.A. bombs, ``Breakfast on Pluto'' is a wretchedly
uplifting story within a story, with Puss as ringmaster, gaily
writing his memoirs for his psychiatrist as he dips in and out of
sanity.
</P>
<P>
   London in the early 70's was more Patrick McCabe-ian than he
could have made up. It was a sinister, garish city in the heady
throes of glam rock and skyrocketing inflation, and the bombing
campaign waged by the I.R.A. insured that in 1974 cars and pubs
exploded almost daily, it seemed, while department stores were
routinely evacuated. In Northern Ireland, ``13 people had been shot
dead by British Army paratroopers,'' Puss recounts with some
regret, yet ``I sat . . . in the darkened square, shamefully not
thinking about the dead victims or their relatives but what
combination of my luscious goodies I should go and try on first!''
Puss is ``much too preoccupied with my own personal revolution to
be bothered with anything so trivial'' as Irish Republicanism, yet
his internal world is filled with the rage of bombing victims and
terrorized London denizens. Friends and lovers are murdered,
guerrilla soldiers torture and maim, while Puss, refusing to take
any of it seriously, announces, ``It's Bombing Night and I haven't
got a thing to wear.''
</P>
<P>
   It is McCabe's particular brand of humor that Puss is arrested
not for prostitution, a trade he successfully plies in London's
West End, but for planting bombs. ``So to all intents and purposes
you were living as a woman now?'' the psychiatrist asks him later.
</P>
<P>
   '' 'Well, I didn't have any yucky briefs if that's what you
mean, my sweet!' said Puss and chuckled in her chuckly way, her
head as light as air. . . . 'I'd dance for them and husky-coo until
they could take no more. And other times----.'
</P>
<P>
   '' 'Other times?'
</P>
<P>
   '' 'Why I'd be a right old whore!' . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Then dropped my eyelids and sexy-whispered: 'Before I became a
bomber, of course!'
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard not to laugh -- because he took it so serious!
Which he had to -- as indeed I ought to -- after all, people lost
their limbs and eyes!
</P>
<P>
   ``But I couldn't, Pussy as a bomber -- I simply had to clutch my
sides!''
</P>
<P>
   As a character, Puss Braden has great propensity to become
another kind of stereotype -- the campy gay boy on whom to project
silly dreams and adventures worthy of Screen Parade, which he so
avidly reads. And yet McCabe, whose dexterity with marginalized
kooks was brought into high relief with ``The Butcher Boy,'' lends
so much cheerful optimism to Puss that one can't help feeling a
wrenching sense of empathy. In another failed attempt at finding a
``Home-Loving Man,'' Puss remembers: ``When I look back on it, I
really have to hand it to Silks. To listen to him you would have
thought he was the sort of person who started drenching the place
with tears anytime anything remotely upsetting came on the cinema
screen, for whom the abuse of a dumb animal was a tragedy of
awesome proportions.'' Silks, it turns out, was a john intent on
strangling Puss to death, and very nearly succeeded. Nevertheless,
``just because you get a kick out of strangling people doesn't mean
that another side of you can't be humane and kind and sensitive --
perhaps even more so indeed,'' Puss observes wistfully.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the victim of Puss's vengeance is his guilty priest
father, still living in the Irish border village; as the
psychiatrist points out, ``there appears to be no similar
generosity of spirit evident'' when it comes to Puss's treatment of
his father. Puss dreams of burning him alive, but before leaving
for London, in one of the novel's funnier moments, he boldly enters
the church intent on confrontation. ``Just then the door of the
confession box opened and in I went. . . . He drew the shutter
back. 'Hello, Daddy,' I said as I knelt down in the dark and you
can imagine the shock I get when it wasn't him. . . . 'What are you
doing here?' I said. 'I work here,' he says, as I began to realize
just what an idiot I'd made of myself!''
</P>

 &UR; UNDATED: myself!'') &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1955 in the heavily Republican border town of Clones in
the Irish Republic, McCabe is an avid musician and former
schoolteacher whose creative coming of age in the 1970's couldn't
have avoided being affected by the political storm in the North.
``Breakfast on Pluto'' falls in a logical progression from ``The
Butcher Boy'' (whose 13-year-old narrator must have given the
parents of McCabe's former students some food for thought) and
``The Dead School'' (1995), which is about two Dublin
schoolteachers caught in a psychological maelstrom of drugs, music
and youth culture. ``Breakfast on Pluto'' (the title refers to a
bit of musical frippery by Don Partridge, high on the British
charts in 1969) embodies the kinetic frenzy of its predecessors
through the eyes of a new kind of Irish enfant terrible -- a
sentimental yet ironic 19-year-old transvestite with a temper.
</P>
<P>
   The Troubles in Northern Ireland have pricked scores of literary
imaginations throughout the years, and will no doubt continue to do
so. McCabe's latest may be the most successful book yet to be born
out of the violence, and with its surety of voice and stunning
originality, it moves beyond the parochial Troubles novel. Where
``Breakfast on Pluto'' succeeds is where others have failed -- by
underlining the vast contradictions inherent in the Irish conflict,
of brutality and kindness, horror and gaiety, conviction and
apathy. With a sassy narrator clad in an ice-cream-pink mohair
sweater, humming the tunes of Barry White as he sashays into a
London disco-pub on the verge of exploding, it is a mosaic of
sound, color and spirit. The underlying grief resonates deeply and
personally, transforming what could be a literary trifle into an
obsessive gift, from a man who may be one of Ireland's finest
living writers.

 &UR; FAMILY BUSINESS

<P>
   BY GEOFFREY WHEATCROFT
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   They might have been the Hinterpfanns. Apart from the ancient
priestly names of Cohen and Levin, Jews in Europe were called by
patronymics (as ``Isaac ben Elchanan'' -- ``Isaac, son of
Elchanan'') until little more than 200 years ago, when they began
to acquire, often at the caprice of officials, what we think of as
``Jewish names'' like Bernstein or Rosenthal. But in the
Judengasse, the squalid Frankfurt ghetto, the downtrodden
inhabitants were known by their addresses. One family had lived in
a house with a red shield hanging outside, ``zum roten Schild,''
before moving to another, ``zur Hinterpfann'' (``the warming
pan'').
</P>
<P>
   The red shield name stuck nonetheless, and Mayer Amschel
Rothschild, born probably in 1744, was the first member of his
family known by what would become one of the most famous names in
Europe. By his death in 1812, he had risen from obscure coin dealer
to international financier, establishing his sons in London, Paris,
Vienna and Naples, as well as in Frankfurt. And his tightknit
family firm grew into what Niall Ferguson calls ``for most of the
century between 1815 and 1914 . . . easily the biggest bank in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Their enthralling story has often been told before, but never in
such authoritative detail. Ferguson is a young Oxford don of
remarkable energy and prolificity, who has previously written a
learned book on German financial history and has just published in
England a long book on World War I, as well as this Rothschild
history in its 1,300-page entirety. The American publishers have
taken pity on their readers' wrists and split it into two volumes:
``The House of Rothschild: Money's Prophets, 1798-1848'' will be
followed in the fall of 1999 by ``The House of Rothschild: The
World's Banker, 1848-1997.'' The study marks the bicentenary of
Nathan Rothschild's arrival in London, where N. M. Rothschild &AMP;
Sons of New Court was to become the most famous of all the branches
of the great cousinage and whose archives were opened to the
author.
</P>
<P>
   Why the explosive Jewish success in finance during the 19th
century? The simplest explanation is that, as the Jews began to
emerge from the heaviest restrictions of the ancien regime,
money-dealing was at first the only avenue open to them. The
Rothschilds' particular rise to greatness is a complex story, but
the outlines are clear enough: the coincidence of the opening of
the ghetto doors, the French Revolution, the ensuing two decades of
war across Europe and the burgeoning Industrial Revolution in
England. Thus the family progressed rapidly from coin dealing and
money-changing to trading in Lancashire textiles and transmitting
the funds for the Duke of Wellington's armies.
</P>
<P>
   There were eminent Victorians, notably the great English
financial writer Walter Bagehot, who argued that the House of
Rothschild wasn't really a bank at all, in the sense of a place
where one could deposit and withdraw money. The crucial Rothschild
role in high finance wasn't through deposit banking but through the
development of an international market for transferable,
interest-paying government bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The career of Mayer Amschel Rothschild saw an intimate
partnership with Landgrave William IX of Hesse-Kassel, a libidinous
and avaricious prince whose begetting 12 illegitimate children
still left him time for speculating with a large inheritance
(partly acquired a generation earlier when the Hessian Army was
hired out to the highest bidder, which was to say the King of
England fighting his war in America). In this relationship,
Rothschild remained in some ways the junior partner, the
``Hofjude'' or court Jew of tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the Rothschilds were floating government bonds on a much
larger scale -- and then speculating in them. They shrewdly got out
of British consols in 1817, but England was the nation where the
family flourished above all. They acquired opulent houses in London
and the country, and in 1850 Lionel Rothschild was finally accepted
as an M.P. when the parliamentary oath ``on the faith of a true
Christian'' was dropped.
</P>
<P>
   The family moved from Tory to Whig, but they were never
democratic egalitarians, and their story isn't necessarily evidence
for the comforting notion that capitalism is the midwife of
freedom. There was nevertheless a political reason for their
affinity with England: a constitutional country with responsible
government was quite simply a better bet. Whatever else the British
Government did, it was not going to repudiate its debts in the
manner of Continental autocrats. And so, as Ferguson shows, from
Nathan's time ``relations with the Bank of England were close and
mutually beneficial.''
</P>
<P>
   In this period, England was also a better bet than the United
States. The Rothschilds never became big American players. They
liked to lend to the government of a country before they did
commercial business there, but this was difficult when the United
States was a genuinely loose federation, some of whose states were
``among the least reliable'' of all borrowers in the 19th century,
and especially when Andrew Jackson was conducting his war against
the Bank of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   To say that Ferguson doesn't reach the heights of ``Gold and
Iron,'' Fritz Stern's great biography of Gerson Bleichroder,
Bismarck's Jewish banker, would be to judge him by the most
stringent standards. The two books have much in common,
illuminating European history in general and Jewish history in
particular. Like other great Jewish financial dynasties, only more
so, the Rothschilds were soon absorbed into the life of the
countries they lived in, but stood at an angle to them.
</P>
<P>
   During the present century, the Rothschilds have been
characterized by complete assimilation into the European upper
classes and regular ``marrying out.'' From what I know of the
English and French branches of the family, their ranks now include
few if any observant Jews, and thanks to inter-marriage many people
bearing the Rothschild name barely count as Jews at all by strict
rabbinical standards.

 &UR; UNDATED: standards.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For all that, the Rothschilds have always been considered -- and
have always considered themselves -- Jewish. In the 19th century,
this was truer still. Unlike many other such families, they did not
change ther names or their religion. In 1814, Carl Rothschild
lamented the tendency of rich German Jews to Christianize
themselves: ``I am a Jew in the depths in my heart.'' And in 1839,
the family was traumatized when Nathan Rothschild's second
daughter, Hannah Mayer, renounced the faith and married a
Christian, Henry Fitzroy, the first such apostasy the family had
known. ``Nothing could possibly be more disastrous for our
family,'' her uncle James wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not he prayed for retribution, the poor woman was
visited by a series of well-nigh Egyptian plagues. Her husband's
career languished and he died young, her son died in a riding
accident, prompting their niece Constance (then a tough cookie of
15) to say it was ``a punishment for having deserted the faith of
the fathers.'' And when Hannah herself died miserably, her
sister-in-law Charlotte reflected with evident satisfaction that
her life had been ``a long martyrdom.''
</P>
<P>
   More charitable was the family's growing position as tribune of
``our nation,'' in Mayer Amschel's phrase, when he was using his
new financial muscle to demand relaxation of the oppression under
which the Frankfurt Jews languished. More than 30 years later came
the Damascus affair of 1840, one of the turning points in modern
Jewish history.
</P>
<P>
   There was a coarse blood-libel in that town in the Ottoman
empire when a Catholic friar mysteriously disappeared. After
prolonged torture, several Jews ``confessed'' to ritual murder. But
this news reached the West, and it was the first time that rich
Western Jews conducted a public campaign on behalf of their
oppressed brethren, with some of the Rothschilds taking up the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Not all were enthusiastic. Lionel Rothschild was uneasy about
the Damascus ``rumpus.'' And, for that matter, the remarkable
notion that the Jews might be restored to Palestine was at this
time an enthusiasm primarily of evangelical Christians. ``There is
no evidence that the Rothschilds harbored any such intentions,''
Ferguson writes. ``The involvement of individual members of the
family in what became known as Zionism was a much later
development'' -- to be told, along with many other grandeurs and
miseres, in the second volume of this absorbing book.

   It is no easy task to hold a reader's attention when a novel's
outcome is obvious from the very first page. But Susan Isaacs has
such a knack for entertaining her reader with the details of
American pop culture -- from brand names and television shows to
the most fashionable neuroses -- that it's easy to be distracted
from the predictability of her plot. In her eighth novel, RED,
WHITE AND BLUE (HarperCollins, $25), Isaacs has taken on a
formidable project: to write a multigenerational family drama that
is also a romantic comedy and a murder mystery and a serious
consideration of weighty issues like anti-Semitism and assimilation
-- all without losing her sense of humor or her eye for the
entertaining detour. At the center of the novel are Charlie Blair,
an F.B.I. agent from Wyoming, and Lauren Miller, a reporter for a
Long Island newspaper called The Jewish News. It is clear from the
start that Charlie and Lauren are lovers-to-be; they are also
distant cousins, several generations removed. The story of their
common ancestry, which reads like a tale of ``city mouse-country
mouse'' ad-libbed by a Jewish grandmother, makes up the first half
of the novel. It begins in the late 19th century with the arrival
of Lauren and Charlie's great-great-grandparents on a ship in New
York harbor and follows the divergent paths of the family's two
halves in Wyoming and New York -- all the way up to the present. In
the novel's second half, Lauren and Charlie are at last brought
together after a series of it-could-only-happen-in-a-novel
coincidences surrounding their investigation of Wrath, an
anti-Semitic, white supremacist hate group in Wyoming. Never mind
the preposterousness of this subplot. ``Red, White and Blue'' is
nothing if not a delightful diversion. _ NORA KRUG

   By Michelle Herman.

   Carnegie Mellon University,

<P>
   paper, $15.95. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Herman's trio of novellas features artists or academics
trying to arrive at the truest direction in which to take their
lives. The heroine of the bittersweet, somewhat schematic
``Auslander'' is a translator who is introduced to a brilliant
Romanian poet, only to be pulled into a self-destructive tragedy
involving the mysterious author and her deliberately unpublished
work. Herman's strongest work occurs in the title novella, in which
a composer and a poet discover true love at an artists' colony.
Watching them struggle to understand and manage the bond that grows
between them is an unexpectedly moving experience. In addition,
Herman's use of her love story's setting (drawing particularly on
the strained friendliness between artists who are also competitors)
is shrewd and amusing. In her less successful final selection,
``Hope Among Men,'' she cuts loose with some humorous and teasing
post-modern effects, only to wind up steering dangerously close to
cuteness. _ PATRICK GILES

</P>
<P>
   By Linda Watanabe McFerrin.

<P>
   Coffee House Press, paper, $14.95. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be horrible to be so strange that nobody knows what
you really are,'' observes 10-year-old Ellen, examining a preserved
sea cucumber in her biology classroom. With her protagonist's
perception of this strange plantlike animal, Linda Watanabe
McFerrin aims for an emblematic suggestion of what it's like to be
on the cusp of adolescence. Unfortunately, McFerrin's brief,
occasionally exquisite debut is often as imprecise as its titular
metaphor and as awkward as its young narrator. ``Namako: Sea
Cucumber'' follows Ellen, her father, her mother (who is half
Japanese) and her three siblings as they transplant themselves from
the United States to Japan in an attempt to hold their family
together. ``I was shocked by the order, the absence of clutter and
the silence,'' Ellen notes on their first night in a stately Tokyo
hotel. ``We children were loud without saying a word.'' What ensues
is a series of episodes at once overstuffed and attenuated.
McFerrin touches on so many bold thematic contrasts -- childhood
versus adulthood, America versus Japan, spirituality versus
sensuality, violence versus serenity -- with such a gently
equivocal prose style that ``Namako'' is as slippery to grasp as
its namesake. McFerrin is clearly ambitious, attempting to blend
the powerful mythological approach of a Maxine Hong Kingston with
the earthy realism of a Dorothy Allison. It is generally too much
for this small book to bear. _ JIM GLADSTONE

<P>
   Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, $23. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   At times, Barbara Neil's fourth novel has the feel of a
tantalizing Gothic mystery instead of a carefully calibrated foray
into the destructiveness of repression -- and these are the times
when the story springs to life. Robbie and her sister, Laura, are
bound by a vague but insistent belief that they were sexually
abused in their early childhood. Their mother, Esther, seems to
have been aware of the abuse but did nothing to stop it. The three
share an unbreakable closeness, but only Robbie, a physiotherapist,
seems anxious to bring her memories out in the open. Frustrated,
she leaves her London home for an estate in Louisiana, where she
has been hired to work with Raoul Patout, a charming elderly stroke
victim. Eventually, Laura and Esther are drawn into Robbie's new
life in America, but the three never confront their past, and
that's what makes ``A History of Silence'' so frustrating. Neil has
an eye for detail, but her narrative builds toward a devastating
revelation that never comes: the only resolution offered is that
there's no possible resolution. _ STEPHANIE ZACHAREK

   &UR; THE VAMPIRE ARMAND
</P>
<P>
   By Anne Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Knopf, $26.95. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In the latest volume of her Vampire Chronicles, Anne Rice offers
an absorbing account of another all-too-human ghoul, this one
struggling to reconcile vampirism with devotion to Christ. She
first sketched out his story in ``Interview With the Vampire'' and
``The Vampire Lestat,'' but here she colors it in, using a vibrant
palette suitable to its initial 16th-century Italian setting. As a
boy, Armand is kidnapped, sold into slavery and taken to the
Venetian palazzo of the vampire Marius, under whom he happily
studies history, painting and law. Later, Marius initiates Armand
into the family of the undead and together they practice a sort of
vigilante vampirism, preying only on ``evil people.''
Unfortunately, their beneficence and worldly humanism invite the
wrath of a more traditional and diabolical Satanic vampire coven,
which destroys Marius and forces Armand to join it. A perfunctory
second section relates Armand's perspective on events that will
already be familiar to Rice devotees, culminating in his modern-day
viewing of a relic imprinted with the image of Christ's face.
Caught up in mystical transport, Armand is exposed to the sunlight,
and only the intercession of a wealthy young orphan and her
scampish companion saves him from obliteration. A grateful Armand
promptly adopts the two and journeys with them to New Orleans,
where he attempts to feed on Lestat, comatose after his own
mystical encounter with Christ. But, of course, the end of this
uneven but enjoyable story is surely only the prelude to another.

<P>
   By Ethan Coen.

<P>
   Rob Weisbach/Morrow, $24. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Ethan Coen and his brother, Joel, have made some of the more
interesting movies of the last two decades: ``Blood Simple,''
``Raising Arizona,'' ``Barton Fink'' and ``Fargo.'' Ethan Coen
writes and Joel Coen directs. And while Ethan Coen isn't quite as
stylish with language as his brother is with a camera, he does have
a distinctive voice and an offbeat worldview, both of which come
through with varying degrees of success in his first collection of
stories. ``Have You Ever Been to Electric Ladyland'' is a brilliant
monologue by a record executive trying to figure out who had a
motive to castrate his dog. But ``Johnnie Ga-Botz,'' composed of
nothing but dialogue and stage directions, is the sort of exercise
that talented, undisciplined creative writing students pound out at
3 A.M. The title story is a good example of what the Coen brothers
are known for: a leap into an off-kilter yet fully imagined world
in which a bureaucrat with the California Department of Weights and
Measures thinks and acts like a hard-boiled detective. All of these
stories take place in Coen Brothers Land, a parallel universe
similar to our own -- except it's weirder, funnier and better
edited. _ MARK LINDQUIST

   The French archeologist Jean-Yves Empereur worked at the
excavation of Alexandria, the Egyptian city founded by Alexander
the Great in 331 B.C., for more than 25 years, as he details in the
lavishly illustrated ALEXANDRIA REDISCOVERED (Braziller, $60). In
spite of the somewhat lackluster telling, Empereur's stories about
the excavations are fascinating, particularly those about the
underwater dig of Fort Qait Bey, a find that uncovered details
about the Pharos lighthouse, one of the seven wonders of the
ancient world. Empereur does excel in illuminating the difficulties
of uncovering a lost city that industrialization continually
encroaches upon. With limited financial means and tough physical
conditions, Empereur writes, ``the Alexandrian experience can also
be wearisome: one has to confront various obstacles, such as the
hostility of the developers who have quite other interests at heart
than the enhancement of their cultural heritage.'' Today, for
instance, only engravings and old maps indicate where Cleopatra's
Needles, now located in London and in Central Park, once stood in
Alexandria. ``People lost no time in erecting buildings in their
place,'' Empereur writes. ``Do the guests of the Hotel Metropole
realize, I wonder, that they are sleeping on the spot where almost
two millennia ago the monumental entrance markers of the Caesareum
stood?'' _ SANDRA MARDENFELD

   &UR; OUTSIDER, INSIDER

   By Andrew Heiskell with Ralph Graves.

<P>
   Marian-Darien Press, $22.95. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Heiskell has had a fascinating life: a nomadic childhood
in Europe, three marriages (one to Madeleine Carroll, the actress,
and later to Marian Sulzberger Dryfoos, sister of Arthur Ochs
Sulzberger, then the publisher of The New York Times) and a career
at Time Inc., where he began as a wholly unqualified medical editor
at the fledgling Life magazine in 1937 and ended up running the
company from 1960 to 1980 as chairman and then chief executive
officer. ``Outsider, Insider'' has plenty to engage anyone
interested in the machinations of a major media company, but mostly
the book is a witty and charming look at what goes into making
magazines work -- and what makes them fail. During his tenure at
Life, Heiskell was involved in the creation of the magazine's major
stories, from the German occupation of France to the sinking of the
Andrea Doria. He also recounts with great wit his dealings with the
titans of the day who published their memoirs in Life. Winston
Churchill, for example, was an extraordinary writer but knew how to
run up an expense account, and the Duke of Windsor was ``a world
class nonwriter'' whose ``effective attention span was about two
minutes.'' As the originator of the idea for the extraordinarily
successful People magazine, Heiskell cannot contain his relish
recounting the stories of various staggeringly expensive magazine
start-ups and failures after his retirement (like TV Cable Week and
Picture Week). And that, finally, may be the charm of this book: a
corporate warrior with such frankness is a rare bird indeed. _

</P>
<P>
   Life has been good to one Anthony Dominick Benedetto, born 72
years ago in Queens and better known as Tony Bennett. The son of a
grocer and a seamstress, growing up during the Great Depression the
aspiring singer played hooky from the High School of Industrial
Arts to take in Frank Sinatra at the Paramount. ``I was one of the
original Sinatra groupies,'' Bennett writes. ``He communicated
precisely what he was feeling at any moment. He knocked down the
wall between performer and audience, inviting listeners inside his
mind.'' After serving under Patton in early 1945 and helping to
liberate the Landsberg concentration camp near Dachau, Bennett
returned to Manhattan to soak up the percolating postwar bebop
scene on 52d Street. His break came in 1949 when he met Bob Hope,
who told him his real name was too long for the marquee and said,
``We'll call you Tony Bennett.'' He was also blessed in his choice
of material with a string of mellow, swinging hits, from ``Because
of You'' and ``Stranger in Paradise'' to his signature ``I Left My
Heart in San Francisco.'' His ``Rags to Riches'' was dusted off
memorably in the movie ``Goodfellas,'' and with the revival of all
things lounge, his amiably crumpled visage and dulcet voice have
crossed over with the MTV generation as icons of suavity. ``The
Good Life'' is not a tell-all memoir -- Bennett has a kind word for
almost everybody except a former manager -- and he stood for all
the right things. Written with the music critic Will Friedwald, the
book's tone is as breezy as an evening listening to Bennett
himself. _ ERIC P. NASH

</P>
<P>
   In the South during the 1920s, Stella Suberman recalls in her
family memoir, every small town had a ``Jew store,'' which sold dry
goods and odds and ends. In Concordia, Tenn., this was Bronson's
Low-Priced Store, owned and operated by Suberman's father, whom she
calls Aaron Bronson. (An author's note informs us that all names in
the book, including the name of the town, were changed.) A Russian
immigrant with a young family and ambition to become a salesman,
Bronson made his way south, searching for opportunity. Ultimately,
he built a life for himself, his wife and his three children in a
place where they were the only Jews. There was a lot to contend
with: the local big-shot, Tom Dillon, who had no use for Jews; the
ever-present threat of the Ku Klux Klan; the nagging question of
what to do about a bar mitzvah for 13-year-old Joey. But there were
also the kindnesses of the spinster Miss Brookie Simmons, the
excitement of the wild auction held to save the town during the
Depression and, after years of hard work, success, as Bronson's
modest store became a town fixture. Like the store, which is
practically a character in its own right, the people in ``The Jew
Store'' linger in the mind. Only the narrator herself, born halfway
through the story, fails to emerge as a developed character. But
when, in the end, she reflects on her return to her native town as
an adult, the reader may share her wish that the golden letters of
Bronson's Low-Priced Store were still gleaming on First Street. _

   Among artists lithography was infra dig by the 1870's -- because
commercial illustrators had discovered it was a perfect printing
medium for glaring posters. So, naturally, Whistler, the
contrarian, turned to it. From 1887 to 1897, he made a large series
of subtle lithographs, most of which have fallen into obscurity
since then because they were so difficult to reproduce. For 10
years, seven curators and conservators assembled by the Art
Institute of Chicago have worked on a magnificent two-volume study,
the first a catalogue raisonne, the second containing Whistler's
correspondence and a number of technical studies. The recent
development of high-resolution digital photography allows brilliant
reproduction of all of Whistler's 179 lithographs -- including some
with color highlights suggesting he was thinking of pastels or
watercolors -- along with lithographic drawings never transferred
to stone. Several prints appear in various states, to let one see
the artist at work. This 992-page two-volume set also includes 173
letters between Whistler and his printer (a fine technical
archive); a chronology of exhibitions, printings and sales; a
complete survey of the papers he used and of their watermarks; a
concordance; essays on Whistler's methods; and more. There are 864
illustrations: color plates, halftones, duotones and tritones. The
accounts of the pictures, the introductions to other materials and
the essays are quite accessible, and the printing and production of
this formidable monument pay fitting tribute to the intellectual
labor it enshrines, as well as to Whistler. It is not too heavy to
lift, and, at 14 by 10 by 4 inches in its slipcase, it can be
carried home in any old shopping bag. _ D. J. R. BRUCKNER

   THE story of the Magi, the Wise Men who followed the star to
Bethlehem, is a timeless, treasured tale whose message is never out
of date. In ``The Stone: A Persian Legend of the Magi,'' we are
given a version of that story as Marco Polo said it was given to
him in Persia on his way to the court of Kublai Khan in the 13th
century. ``In the ancient town of Saveh stood a tower . . .
encrusted with turquoise tiles and filled with strange
instruments'': such language helps evoke the mystery and the power
of the long journey of the tower's three inhabitants. That journey
ends not with their gifts to the child, but with his to them;
disappointing at first, it soon appears to be, as the Magus
Balthasar announces, ``a gift that will bring justice and healing
and peace into the world.'' And sharing the child's gift, the Magi
and many others set out on another journey, bearing it ``to all the
faraway places of the earth,'' a journey that is not over to this
day.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson of ``The Stone'' is unmistakable and clear, and the
words of the author, Dianne Hofmeyr, a South African writer living
in London, lend themselves to reading aloud in cadences that are
more like music than preaching. The appealing illustrations by the
South African artist Jude Daly portray the people and the scenes
from a variety of perspectives and with a directness that is
consistent with the story's simple prose (but never so simple as to
detract from its essential spiritual quality and charm).

   ``The Fourth Wise Man'' is a retelling by Susan Summers, a
British writer, of Henry Van Dyke's once well-known 1896 book,
first written as a sermon and intended for an older audience, about
a Zoroastrian called Artaban. In this attractive version, with
lovely if predictable illustrations by Jackie Morris, the story
shifts focus; from a statement that emphasizes the power of virtue
and hope, it has become a more pragmatic tale about a man on a
quest. In this version Artaban lacks some of the nobility of
character that the original tale endowed him with. The story is
thus to some extent transformed from a parable for adults and young
adults that teaches the values of faith, hope, love and integrity
into one that substitutes an attitude that sometimes bows to
necessity.
</P>
<P>
   On the journey to see the child Jesus, the fourth wise man,
Artaban, is late to join the others, who have left without him. As
he travels he has several presumably life-transforming experiences,
which are diminished here by the lack of a philosophical base -- or
perhaps by the dreadful history of the 20th century, in which
faith, hope, love and integrity sometimes availed less than Van
Dyke might have expected. Artaban visits a young woman and her baby
as the soldiers of Herod are ransacking a village and murdering its
infants. When the soldiers come to the woman's cottage looking for
another child to kill, Artaban tells their captain that he is alone
in the house: ``I will give you this jewel if you will leave me in
peace.'' Then he shows a gift he had meant for the child Jesus, a
ruby, ``glistening in his palm like a great drop of blood.''
</P>
<P>
   The story continues: ``The captain's eyes widened with greed and
he grabbed the jewel. 'March on!' he cried. As the soldiers left,
Artaban quietly prayed: 'God of Truth, forgive my lie. I have said
the thing that is not, to save the life of a child.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In Van Dyke's book, the jewel is also offered and accepted but
only after Artaban ``stood in the doorway of the house. . . . His
face was as calm as though he were watching the stars, and in his
eyes there burned that steady radiance before which even the
half-tamed hunting leopard shrinks and the fierce bloodhound pauses
in his leap.'' It is his strength of character, not the jewel, that
saves the child.
</P>
<P>
   Of this new version, one might ask, ``Is it acceptable to lie in
certain circumstances?'' and ``What are those circumstances and
why?'' Such questions could be difficult to talk about with a young
child, and the picture-book presentation makes the book seem too
young for an older child who might find the questions
thought-provoking.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, this is a romantic and important story,
weaving the faith of those who followed Zoroaster with the story of
the birth of Jesus. Artaban was a scholar of the stars, as were the
other Wise Men, Caspar, Melchior and Balthazar. All four were men
of faith and hope. Their mission to follow the star to see Jesus is
an unforgettable statement of the power of faith and hope that
grows from wisdom and knowledge. From Artaban, the fourth Wise Man,
we learn that although his heart's desire was denied him, his
mission was accomplished through that denial.

BOOKS IN BRIEF: FOR CHILDREN
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a December evening President Theodore Roosevelt chases his
six children through an obstacle course of overturned chairs and
scattered pillows in the family quarters of the White House. After
the giggling dies down, someone asks when they will get their
Christmas tree. ``It's not good to cut down trees for mere
decoration. . . . We must save our trees for the future,'' the
President and conservationist explains.
</P>
<P>
   In this mostly true story, Roosevelt's two youngest boys, Archie
and Quentin, decide to smuggle in a small evergreen anyway. With
the help of an aunt who leaves the little tree outside, they hoist
it up to their bedroom, using some knotted sheets, and hide it in
their closet. Gary Hines, a former forest ranger and author of the
exciting ``Flying Firefighters,'' knows how to spin a tale for the
very young. A CHRISTMAS TREE IN THE WHITE HOUSE (Holt, $15.95; ages
5 to 9) has just the right amount of suspense as the story unfolds
and the tree is, of course, discovered. When Roosevelt marches the
boys over to the home of his chief forester, Gifford Pinchot, the
expert provides a plot twist -- and a happy ending -- with a lesson
on nature.
</P>
<P>
   Alexandra Wallner's illustrations seem static at first, with
figures as carefully arranged as the Victorian furniture, until you
notice such sweet details as little red hearts near the mouths of
the boys as they blow good-night kisses to their mother. This small
story shines up the image of the White House by portraying one of
its most popular occupants as the loving father and dedicated
leader that he was. In a note, Hines explains that the Christmas
tree really was hidden in the closet, and the children were sent to
see Pinchot, but he has contracted the events. He also reports that
Roosevelt was responsible for protecting millions of acres of
forested land. _ MARGARET MOORMAN

   These three books have more in common than their subtitles. Each
tells the story of a plucky white girl who, having been raised to
trek the moral high ground by abolitionist parents, risks her life,
reputation or standing in the community to help slaves escape to
freedom on the underground railroad. Nice idea. But since a search
for ``underground railroad'' in the children's section of
Amazon.com turns up more than 50 titles, why now? And why do all
three books have the same plot?
</P>
<P>
   A little detective work: If you know a school-age girl with
grandparents willing to spend $75 or so (and, trust me, that's just
the beginning) on a toy, you can probably find the answer by
opening that child's bedroom door and looking at her American Girl
doll. The brainchildren of Pleasant T. Rowland, the American Girl
dolls, which now number six, come in white, black or Hispanic,
colonial to modern. Each doll, representing her period of American
history, comes (for a price) with clothes, cunning accessories and
books. You can put on plays with your doll; you can make art
projects she might have made; you can read historically vetted and
hence parent-pleasing novels about her. And there's more, much
more.
</P>
<P>
   It's an industry, all based on the premise, as expressed on the
back of the books, that some things about growing up have changed,
while others, like families, friendships and feelings, haven't
changed at all. These are the important things that American girls
will always share. Also a nice idea. But seeing all of history as
an excuse to connect the experiences of girls over time is a
formula, even (in the case of the Pleasant Company) a business
plan. It's not a template for children's fiction, as these three
books, which seem to follow the Pleasant Company formula, might
suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Ayres's ``North by Night,'' while treacly, is the
standout in this crowd, largely because Ayres's heroine, conceived
more in the tradition of Jacqueline Susann than Louisa May Alcott,
has adventures (and the emotions that go with them) worthy of an
episode of ``Dawson's Creek.'' There's a baby named Hope born to a
dying slave girl; a boyfriend named Jeremiah Strong who, though a
Quaker, knows how to kiss; a neighbor widow who's only pretending
her husband is dead. What a page turner! It even made me snuffle
once or twice.
</P>
<P>
   No such guilty pleasures rescue ``Bright Freedom's Song,'' which
seems to have been inspired not by the desire to spin a narrative
but by the urge to make a point: Gloria Houston believes, though
she admits in a preface she can find no proof, that there was a
connection between antislavery activities in the southern
Appalachian Mountains and the previous indentureships of many of
the earliest settlers. And so our young girl's Pa, who had come
over from the auld country, the land of the Scots, as an indentured
servant, now helps others escape the brutality he knew too well.
What happens when Pa gets the fever? Guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Last Safe House'' is more a textbook and study guide than
a story. Its premise is that Canadians have not got their share of
underground railroad thanks. Well, O.K., I'm sorry. And I hope that
teachers putting together underground railroad curriculums will
refer to this book. But I don't think too many children are going
to be turning to it for pleasure reading.
</P>
<P>
   Learning about history from fiction can be thrilling --
successful examples are too numerous and obvious to mention -- but
only if the characters who inhabit the events are more than dolls.
That's where the fun comes in. And that's what's missing here. _

</P>
<P>
   Early one spring morning in Vermont an 8-year-old coughed
herself awake and ended up saving her family. Patty Trevorrow
awakened her mother, who realized that the house was on fire and
sprang into action, waking up all the relatives and boarders who
were vacationing at the farm in East Dover, which belonged to
Patty's uncle, Earl Yeaw. While the adults were able to save some
of their things and most of the animals, they could not save the
house. Fifty years later, Patty's daughter, the author Jessie Haas,
tells this true tale in ``Fire! My Parents' Story.'' ``We were
brought up on stories about the farm,'' Haas writes of herself and
her brother and sister. ``But the big story was the Fire.'' The
event is seen through Patty's eyes, which accounts for much of its
charm. The 1948 setting makes this a history book, yet it is the
relatively near past; in part because of the family photographs, it
will feel more real to most children than the faraway 1800's of the
``Little House'' series and ``Little Women.'' ``Fire!'' is a plain,
well-told tale by the author of more than a dozen children's books
(most of them about horses), who imaginatively captures the facts
and fears of being in a fire. ``Everything is terrible,'' she
notes, ``but not as terrible as it might be, and it's also a little
exciting.'' Romance came out of this particular fire as well:
Patty, who was carried out of the burning house by 18-year-old
Bobby Haas, a vacationer at the farm, was carried by him across the
threshold of their marital home, another farm, 10 years later.
Jessie Haas also reports that both her grandparents and her parents
became volunteer firefighters. The enduring truth is that life goes
on. ``What happens next? Does everything come to an end?'' Haas
writes. ``No.'' A lesson for us all. _ ANDREA HIGBIE

 &UR; STAGE BUSINESS
</P>
<P>
   BY PETER HAINSWORTH
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Paola Capriolo is one of the few Italian novelists whose
imagination looks north -- to landscapes and townscapes of mists
and gloom that are not quite real and to psychological and
philosophical mysteries that are always moving toward resolution
but never quite get there. All this is romantically Germanic -- in
some books overtly Kafkaesque, in others more like the early Thomas
Mann. At the same time Capriolo never lets us forget she is an
ironic post-modernist, which means she can keep up the deeply
rooted Italian tradition of holding unnamable menaces at a
distance. Her narratives proceed with calm, if perhaps a
neurotically preserved one. Her prose is as abstracted from realism
as it is from emotional violence, carefully and elegantly
constructing the surfaces that, it grants, could fracture at any
moment if this were anything but literature. At times the absurdity
of the whole project -- of crazed emotions, of philosophizing, of
reading and writing -- comes comically through, only for the humor
to vanish again.
</P>
<P>
   Capriolo has completed six novels since ``La Grande Eulalia,'' a
collection of stories published in 1988, when she was in her
mid-20's. They are surprisingly varied, though they tend to play
with similar ingredients. Over all the melange has steadily become
more and more refined, but it has not always turned out as
satisfyingly as it does in ``The Woman Watching.''
</P>
<P>
   The opening pages offer a deliberately unfocused version of the
real world. The setting is an unnamed provincial town, which just
might be in northern Italy; the time, one guesses, the 1920's or
thereabouts; the plot simple, or simply incredible. The principal
figures are brought into being before our eyes as fictional
versions of people who existed but may have been quite different in
reality -- Vulpius and Dora, two young actors in the municipal
theater company, he hyper-self-aware in a Pirandellian way and able
to transform himself into any character he is required to play, she
unreflectively and cheerfully herself and hence an indifferent
actress.
</P>
<P>
   What was apparently a happy love affair, at least for Dora,
begins to go wrong. In the course of a performance of a dramatic
version of ``Don Giovanni'' Vulpius notices a mysterious spectator,
the ``woman watching'' of the title. He never meets her, but after
a few exchanges of looks he begins to realize that the art of
acting is ultimately not for the audience or even for the actors,
but for itself.
</P>
<P>
   From this point on, normal performance and normal life gradually
become secondary. Vulpius gets Dora to perform at night to an empty
theater, in an eerily addictive ritual that is ultimately fatal.
Dora finds herself the unhappy plaything of forces outside her
control, not least the author, who disingenuously claims to be
obliged to kill her off. But Vulpius, egoist though he is, is also
the devotee of a sacred cult. He is made calmly to meet his end in
a final act of theater as funeral, quite alone apart from the
imagined gaze of the woman spectator who triggered the process in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Can Capriolo be serious? In 1996, shortly after this novel was
published, she wrote a study of the esthetic thought of the German
poet Gottfried Benn (``L'Assoluto Artificiale''), which was very
serious indeed about his particular version of art for art's sake.
It emphasized the way in which his theory reinstituted the timeless
and the sacred through dedicated artificial play and created the
only area of meaningfulness that was allowed to post-modern man. In
her fiction the clash between worn-out humanism or normality and
the austere demands of the Bennian creed takes on several meanings.
The journey to superior purity is an absurd journey to death, which
inevitably involves cruelty and pathos if it is really to be
undertaken.
</P>
<P>
   ALL the same, this is not an admonitory fable. The dangers of
art are part of what art is. Both as novelist and essayist Capriolo
has no doubt about the validity of fictional ironies and
artificialities. In this novel she achieves a new lucidity in her
juxtaposition of mirroring looks and in her playing of construction
and deconstruction against each other. As for the reader, he or she
is implicitly invited to join the author and her mysterious
watching woman, to take pleasure in the spectacle and to cast on it
the sort of glittering gaze that was cast by Yeats's Chinese sages
on all the tragic scene before them.
</P>
<P>
   Some Italian critics have judged Capriolo's style bookish. But
the bookishness is an integral part of her conception of
literature, and always carried lightly. It is probably impossible
to transfer that aware but easy elegance into English. Liz Heron's
version is highly readable, though her phrasing and intonation
often have an Italianate air. But perhaps that is an added pleasure
and, depending on which way you look at it, both natural and
unnatural. Capriolo should approve.

 FATHER INDIA

 &UR; PASSAGES IN INDIA
</P>
<P>
   BY ALEXANDRA LANGE
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If you wanted to be terrifically shallow, you could just read
Jeffery Paine's seemingly scholarly book for the sex. Or the lack
thereof. Never was there such an effusion of Protestant guilt and
sublimated libido. Gandhi sleeps with a beautiful 19-year-old just
to prove he has no more sexual interest in her than her mother did.
E. M. Forster turns a maharajah into his procurer. Christopher
Isherwood learns he can have a guru and faceless sexual encounters
too. There are pedophiles and couples in ``spiritual marriages,''
princes who like dirty jokes and writers who try not to touch
another Indian. It's a rogue's gallery of sexual dysfunction, and
Paine seems only too happy to dish.
</P>
<P>
   His premise is grand -- ``Father India'' proposes to be a
resolutely anti-imperialist history of how India influenced the
West, and a history not about wars and maps but about messy
emotion. Paine, a former literary editor of The Wilson Quarterly
and now a contributing editor, chooses Boswell as his guide: ``In
my mind, he was the first of a new kind of traveler, who voyaged
out not for profit or preaching but rather to spill his innards all
over the map.'' Charming, and very late-20th-century. Paine groups
his seven subjects into three loftily titled sections -- Society,
Self, Universe -- each pairing someone who left India with someone
who stayed. Viceroy Lord Curzon is matched with the theosophist
Annie Besant, Forster contrasted with V. S. Naipaul, Isherwood, in
a chapter called ``Spirituality's Back Door,'' compared with
Gandhi. Jung, Martin Luther King Jr. and the cross-cultural and the
apparently celibate couple Mirra Richard and Aurobindo make cameo
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Paine's hope is that we'll conflate these intellectuals'
reaction to India with the larger West's, and read the changes in
their work as transformative on a larger scale. Gandhi and King,
linked by their nonviolent philosophy, obviously had an effect. But
how much of it can be attributed to India, in King's case, and to
the perspective gained from a trip to England, in Gandhi's case,
remains undetermined.
</P>
<P>
   Paine's logical chains aren't strong enough to support his
subtitle: ``How Encounters With an Ancient Culture Transformed the
Modern West.'' He bounces about among psychology, literary
criticism and a creative retelling of biographical fact, coddling
the reader with brief digressions into Indian history. Partition,
the end of British rule, Gandhi's political campaigns -- all these
distract from the flow of each character's tale, without giving a
real sense of context.
</P>
<P>
   Paine also occasionally lapses into prose worthy of a romance
novel. ``On that hot August night in 1891 the world turned upside
down, and subsequently nothing would ever make any sense again,''
he writes, describing Besant's sudden conversion to mystical
theosophy. ``But trouble was in the air -- in the hot, idle,
unsublimated air of Dewas. . . . To grow sickly with desire, to
become wan or ill with it, was that to be his fate?'' This of
Forster, for whom, we learn, masturbation is no longer working.
</P>
<P>
   In the book's most vigorous (and amusing) chapter, Paine
gleefully details Forster's daily humiliations as he ineptly
propositions a palace servant, then enters into a sanctioned,
purely physical relationship with the maharajah's barber. ``During
the Gokul Ashtami festival, as the noisy chanting resounded
everywhere, he and Kanaya met in the secret palace suite. As the
festival approached its climax, Forster -- not to make a play on
words -- approached his.'' As Paine rightly points out, it's
awfully hard to imagine the man who wrote ``only connect'' with an
Indian concubine, male or female, but it's all true.
</P>
<P>
   Forster might never have written another novel, and certainly
not ``A Passage to India,'' if not for his daily ``grooming''
sessions. Paine has less to work with in other chapters, stretching
his intriguing material too thin. He hypes each revelation, padding
with prologues, introductions, flashbacks, flash-forwards, to try
to add drama. You keep thinking you've got to the bedchamber, then
realize you're still in the endless series of anterooms.
</P>
<P>
   Paine's publishers as well seem to have been confused as to what
he's up to, and it shows in the packaging. The book's cover is a
shocking pink with gold embroidery patterns, like the hem of a
polyester sari. Another romantic touch? A Diana Vreeland joke is
obviously called for (pink is the navy blue of India, she once
famously remarked); had the book been about the so-called modern
West's influence on the subcontinent the cover would, no doubt,
look like a blazer and a rep tie.
</P>
<P>
   After 300 pages of thwarted sexuality, thwarted spirituality,
thwarted imperialism, India seems more like a land of confusion
than a fatherly force. Even Jung, supposedly in India to get away
from Freud's oversimplification of the psyche, spends most of his
time in India in the hospital with dysentery. ``What exactly about
India could Jung not digest (besides the amoebas)?'' Paine asks,
reading far too much into a common traveler's problem. Western
civilization, whatever its faults, was not transformed by a piece
of unwashed fruit.

AIRLINE'S PREPARATIONS FOR SERVICE FROM DALLAS SEEM STALLED BY
SUITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAN REED and MAX B. BAKER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The long, costly legal battle over expanded
service at Dallas' Love Field is making it tough for Legend
Airlines to get its business off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Legend President Allan McArtor, who wants to offer long-haul
service from Love, says the company is not facing a cash crunch.
</P>
<P>
   But a Legend source who requested anonymity said the company has
been carefully conserving its cash since October, when a state
judge issued an initial ruling against the long-haul service from
Love.
</P>
<P>
   There has been little, if any, construction progress over the
past two months on the airline's private six-gate terminal at Love.
And plans to start training pilots in January have been put on
hold, according to a recruiting consultant and pilots who have
applied to the airline.
</P>
<P>
   In government filings, the airline has said that much of its
financing is contingent on clearing the legal hurdles and getting
final authorization to serve Love, neither of which is expected
soon.
</P>
<P>
   The airline denies reports that construction of its terminal and
parking garage has been halted. It said it no longer wants to talk
about pilot hiring or training schedules.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are where we choose to be in the terminal construction,''
McArtor said. ``We don't intend to be denied our authority to fly
out of Love Field. ... Everyone wants to pull us up by our roots to
see why we are not blooming now.''
</P>
<P>
   Legend originally wanted to launch service at Love Field in the
third quarter of 1997. But it has had to push back the start-up
date several times because of the political and legal wrangling.
</P>
<P>
   In documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the Transportation Department, Legend has said it expects to
raise at least $32 million in start-up investment.
</P>
<P>
   Legend has ``enough commitments for money, but most of that is
contingent on Legend getting all this cleared up and getting the
final certification to fly,'' the Legend source said.
</P>
<P>
   Without additional capital, the source estimated, the airline
has enough cash to last another year at the current rate of
spending, or perhaps longer if some staff members are dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   The legal fight began in October 1997, when Fort Worth sued
Legend, the city of Dallas and others to enforce its rights under
its 1968 contract with Dallas to build Dallas/Fort Worth Airport.
The 1968 deal precludes the kind of long-haul service from Love
Field that Legend proposes.
</P>
<P>
   The legal fight _ which has included trips into three federal
courts, the Texas appellate courts and the Texas Supreme Court,
plus several Transportation Department proceedings _ has been
costly to all the parties.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the Fort Worth City Council has authorized spending
$950,000 on legal fees. The Dallas City Council has approved
spending up to $1.5 million, and the D/FW board has authorized up
to $900,000.
</P>
<P>
   The legal expenses of the private parties in the case, including
Legend and American Airlines, are not known but are believed to be
equal to or greater than the cities' legal costs.
</P>
<P>
   And the legal wrangling is far from over.
</P>
<P>
   Legend is expected to appeal the October ruling by state
District Judge Bob McCoy of Fort Worth that blocked long-haul
service at Love Field.
</P>
<P>
   In court this week, McCoy agreed that a dispute over attorneys'
fees could be split into a separate lawsuit. He had previously
approved severing Fort Worth's original lawsuit from cross-claims
made by the D/FW Airport board against Continental, Continental
Express and American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   A federal case is also pending, and the Transportation
Department is expected to issue a ruling soon on the same issue. No
matter which side that ruling favors, the losing side can be
expected to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The wrangling has apparently stalled Legend's hiring. As
recently as late October, prospective pilots said they were being
told by Legend officials that the company expected to start its
training in January.
</P>
<P>
   But Air Inc., an Atlanta firm that helps pilots looking for
jobs, reports that Legend is telling candidates only that it hopes
to start a class sometime in the first quarter of next year.
</P>
<P>
   At the terminal, meanwhile, a foundation has been poured, as has
the concrete floor of what will be the passenger concourse, or
second floor. But little work has been done at the site since late
October.
</P>
<P>
   The Legend source estimated that between $3 million and $4
million has been spent on the terminal.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of spending the additional $8 million to $10 million
it will take to complete the terminal, money that Legend apparently
has on hand, Legend will probably use that money ``to keep the
legal fight going a year or more,'' the source said.

GIANTS NEED A GARGANTUAN BOOST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For interested bystanders who wish to send any tokens of
appreciation or esteem (hint, hint), the address is Giants Stadium,
East Rutherford, N.J., 07073.
</P>
<P>
   Cards from the 1972 Miami Dolphins would be nice.
</P>
<P>
   Cases of champagne would be nicer.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the New York Giants need any help to get on a good
buzz. Their shocking 20-16 victory against the Denver Broncos was
legally intoxicating. The 1998 highlight film will have game
footage after all. The Giants have a bounce in their walk, smiles
on their faces, songs in their hearts. They look in the mirror, and
they see handsome devils. They look around, and their significant
others are more ravishing than ever.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happens when a dead-end team gets the satisfaction
of dragging the high and mighty to its level. They can talk until
they're Big Blue in their face about how the only thing that truly
matters to them is defending their Super Bowl championship. They
lost their chance to stamp themselves as truly special Sunday when
the answer to John Elway's dial-a-prayer pass into the end zone on
the final play was no.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody's perfect. Nobody but the '72 Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this team will be remembered for this game,'' Giants
coach Jim Fassel said.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel's hurry to put an epitaph on his '98 team is
understandable. The sooner the season is buried, the better for the
Giants. They will be home after the holidays, unwelcome to attend
the playoffs. Though the Giants play in the National Football
League's equivalent of the 98-pound weakling division, the best
they can finish is 8-8.
</P>
<P>
   They went 10-5-1 last year. One interpretation is that they're
taking a couple steps backward before they go boldly into the next
millennium. Another interpretation is that they have no idea where
the hell they're going.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had something to prove,'' said Giants safety Percy
Ellworth, who batted down the pass in the end zone that sent the
Broncos thudding to 13-1. ``We think when we come to play, nobody
can march up and down the field against us.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, guess what? The Giants had something to prove all season.
They won the NFC East last season with the help of a schedule that
made a baby's bottom look like sandpaper. This was the Giants'
chance to see how they measure up against the class of the NFL.
Playing the sort of first-place schedule that separates the men
from the boys, the Giants quickly took on the look of a team that
needed its mommy.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants didn't define themselves by driving 84 yards for the
winning touchdown against Denver. The Giants defined themselves by
the body of work that made them 5-8 (1-5 outside the NFC East)
entering Sunday. Too often, their bodies were dead on arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Let's not forget the bookend 31-7 defeats against Dallas and San
Francisco in front of the Monday Night Football cameras. Or the
37-3 November thrashing by Green Bay in the Meadowlands. Or the
21-14 defeat against a dispirited Washington team that had lost its
first seven games. Or the eyesore of a 23-3 defeat against Tampa
Bay, which limited the Giants to 135 yards of total offense. Or the
dreary performances on both sides of the ball (233 yards gained,
414 allowed) in a 20-17 defeat at Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   If the Giants had played with the purpose and passion they
showed against Denver all season, they wouldn't be where they are
today. They sure wouldn't be looking up at Dallas and Arizona in
the food chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can always look back and say, `Gosh, if we had won this
game or that game,''' Fassel said. ``But you can kill yourself
looking back. You have to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly. The Giants need to move on, before they convince
themselves that one shining moment against a live, breathing team
truly makes a season. The harsh light of the standings reveals the
Giants to be closer to Philadelphia than Denver both in geography
and accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants are 28th out of 30 teams in total offense. They're
28th in passing, 27th in pass-efficiency rating, 27th in scoring.
The defense that masquerades as a source of pride is 20th in yards
allowed, 18th in points allowed. The Giants have allowed 51 points
more than they've scored. They've allowed 801 more yards than
they've gained. The season-ending knee injury of cornerback Jason
Sehorn didn't do that much damage. Worse for the Giants is that
they are no closer to finding a quarterback than they were the day
they pushed Phil Simms out the door. In 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Don't let the rush of seeing Kent Graham do an Elway imitation
impair the judgment. It was only an imitation. If the answer is
Kent Graham or Danny Kanell, rest assured that the question is not:
Who led the Giants to their third Super Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   Graham and Kanell are the sort of quarterbacks who are just good
enough to find work in the NFL _ as long as no heavy lifting of a
team is involved. And they aren't in the habit of bursting into
tears during games. At least, not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Graham is the current quarterback in favor because of three
victories in four starts. His passing rating: 65.4. Kanell's: 67.3.
Dave Brown had a 71.1 rating last year, and the Giants couldn't
wait to push him out the door.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Giants will have the good luck to have Syracuse's
Donovan McNabb fall to their spot in the next draft. Maybe the
Giants would have the good sense to take him at that point. Until
the blessed day when the Giants find a quarterback who is part of
the solution instead the problem, meaningful victories will be few
and far between.
</P>
<P>
   Still, cards would be nice. Champagne would be nicer. A victory
buzz can only last so long.

   CHIAT-OFFICES (Los Angeles) _ The advertising agency that urged

officing'' when their headquarters in Venice, Calif., proved too
small for a fast-expanding staff. Jay Chiat, the company's founder,
equipped everyone with a mobile phone, a laptop and a personal
locker, and turned a problem into a vaunted workplace experiment.
Now, just months shy of the third millennium, TBWA/Chiat/Day, as
the company is known, has traded virtual communication for the real
thing. It has just moved into a new space in the Playa del Rey
section of Los Angeles, where everyone has his own desk, and human

   TAKE-BOS  
 (a and s coding)  
 BOSTON: ... help, either.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I think the Boston press is more negative and critical than
any I've ever seen,'' said Gifford, a friend of Kraft's. But, he
conceded, ``We went too far with others before going to (Mayor
Menino and the community). There were great tactical mistakes made
on the part of people involved, including me.''
</P>
<P>
   One fact stands as a metaphor for just how badly the South
Boston stadium effort was bungled: Menino says he first learned of
the plan when he heard some business leaders had met with Kraft at
BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was taken aback by it,'' said Menino. ``I just don't think
he (Robert Kraft) was listening. I don't think he was flexible. And
he just didn't do his homework'' in the community.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Kraft said Weld had assured them he would take care of
all the political spadework necessary to sell the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Weld basically led us to believe Tom Menino, as an
elected official, was his responsibility,'' the younger Kraft
recalled. ``He said, `You guys work on putting a plan together. I
will deal with the mayor.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But that clearly didn't happen. Tocco says the administration
was still forming its plan when the word broke, catching everyone
off guard. The news helped galvanize neighborhood opposition. A
convention center, not a stadium, was Menino's priority. Moreover,
with South Boston as riled as it had been about anything since
busing, and his own reelection approaching, the mayor was hardly
eager to go to bat for Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   But there was another reason as well, according to several
well-placed sources. ``When Kraft didn't get everything he wanted
(from Menino) in five minutes, he goes around town saying that
`this guy's elevator doesn't go all the way to the top floor,' ''
one source said. ``That took about one minute to get back to
Menino. That, as much as any other thing, I believe was responsible
for Menino not lifting a finger in South Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Kraft strongly denies this, saying, ``I've only heard
my father speak about the mayor in respectful tones. But when it
came to the stadium situation it was always curious why he didn't
want a privately funded stadium in his city.''
</P>
<P>
   But Menino wasn't the only one growing exasperated with Kraft.
Inside the administration, some of Weld's top aides, who already
felt the governor was expending too much political capital trying
to help Kraft, were put off by the owner's demanding ways. When he
called, he expected Weld to take his calls. And when the governor
didn't, Kraft treated staffers brusquely.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought he should be dealing with the governor directly,
and he made that clear to people on the governor's staff,'' said
Ray Howell, Weld's former director of communications and a close
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Administration sources say several top officials had
confrontations with Jonathan Kraft, whom they considered accusatory
and overbearing.
</P>
<P>
   At one meeting, Jonathan accused Transportation Secretary James
Kerasiotes of not having done enough to help. Kerasiotes, who was
overseeing $40 million in infrastructure and transit improvements
designed to help make Foxboro Stadium workable, bluntly challenged
him on what hadn't been done.
</P>
<P>
   When Kraft whipped out a cellular phone to call Patriots
business manager Andy Wasynczuk, Kerasiotes replied: ``What's the
matter, Jonathan, you need Andy to come up and hold your hand?''
Kerasiotes then walked out of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Administration and Finance Secretary Charles Baker
had a similar blowup, warning the younger Kraft to stop badmouthing
Weld. Baker declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all under tremendous pressure from the governor to try
to accommodate the needs of the team, and when we were told over
and over again that we weren't doing that, and that the governor
and the administration weren't following through, it got a little
hard to take,'' said Kerasiotes.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the Krafts understand the careful preparation and
attention it takes to get things done with the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for Kraft it was a whole new arena he had never been
involved in before,'' said Flaherty. ``He didn't know the players,
and he couldn't understand why everybody wasn't laying out the red
carpet for him because he had `saved the team.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Joyce, a Beacon Hill lobbyist who worked for Kraft during
the Megaplex discussions and parted with the owner on strained
terms, said Kraft made a common mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in Robert's case, he tried to deal with political
leaders like they were members of his board of directors,'' Joyce
said, adding that Kraft would have been more successful if he
accepted political advice. ``Robert wouldn't leave the room until
he had a commitment. . . . I have never asked for a commitment from
a government official. I have asked for consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   Admitted Jonathan Kraft: ``We are politically naive. But from
our perspective, if you're going to spend hundreds of millions of
dollars of your own money, you'd think they'd cut you a little
slack.''
</P>
<P>
   While Robert Kraft did deal successfully with Governor Rowland
in Connecticut, he grew to annoy Weld, who prided himself on his
imperturbability. Several sources said that after one Weld
fund-raiser, Kraft, uninvited, hopped into the governor's car and
began to unroll a set of stadium plans to explain them to Weld.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was typical of Kraft,'' said one source. ``He thought he
should be able to deal with Weld whenever he wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   Weld thought otherwise. Irritated by what he considered an
inappropriate intrusion, the governor made it clear he didn't have
time for Kraft, sources say. Weld says he can't recall the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft was clearly bitter. In February 1997, when US Rep. Joseph
Moakley finally talked him into abandoning his South Boston stadium
hopes, Moakley suggested a press conference with Kraft, Menino,
Weld, and himself.
</P>
<P>
   Moakley still remembers his response: ``He said, `No, I have
dealt with with all of those people before. I was misled, and I
don't want any of them there when I make my statement.' . . . He
was very upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Some administration officials insist that above all else, it was
the Krafts' personal style that impeded their efforts with top
decision-makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very simple,'' said one top-level official. ``There are
two reasons why this didn't get done. Reason Number One is that Tom
Menino hates Bob Kraft. Reason Number Two is that Tom Finneran
hates Bob Kraft.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite being stymied in South Boston, Kraft wasn't ready to
give up. Thus, the stadium struggle entered its third and final
phase, where Kraft's requests for state help collided squarely with
Finneran's insistence that state funds not be used to pay for land
for private businesses.
</P>
<P>
   When Finneran said in February of 1997 that building a
71,000-seat stadium in Foxborough would be ``the easiest deal in
the world,'' the Krafts were once again hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   But when Weld resigned in July of that year, Kraft lost his
principal ally in state government.
</P>
<P>
   Although Acting Governor Paul Cellucci pushed a Patriots plan,
several sources say that Cellucci was less willing to push a bill
for infrastructure improvements in Foxborough when he needed
Finneran to help approve campaign-year tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   While Cellucci introduced his own $50 million plan for road and
other improvements along Route 1 _ issued around the time Rhode
Island officials were also wooing the team with offers to pay about
half of stadium construction costs _ he made no efforts remotely
comparable to Rowland's in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at times a Foxborough deal seemed tantalizingly close. In
February, Senate President Thomas Birmingham negotiated what in
retrospect looks like a very good deal: For a net state cost of
$2.3 million a year over 20 years, Kraft would have built a new
$200 million stadium, and the state would have spent $72 million on
land and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   One Democratic legislator says that package, costing only about
$100,000 more a year than the deal Finneran had offered calling for
$52 million in infrastructure spending, would have passed if put to
a secret ballot. But Finneran refused to budge. Meanwhile, his
references to Kraft as ``a whining multi-millionaire'' and a
``fat-assed millionaire'' _ a comment Finneran says was directed at
Baltimore Ravens owner Art Modell _ only underscored speculation
about a personal grudge. According to that theory, Finneran was
determined to thwart Kraft because the owner's wife, Myra, was an
ally of Richard Voke, whom Finneran defeated to become speaker.
</P>
<P>
   But while Finneran pleads guilty to being an inner-city
``street-corner kid'' who sometimes ``fires back with a wise
comment,'' he denies any personal animus against Kraft, noting that
he maintained the same posture toward other private concerns in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran also claims that he was willing to work a fair deal all
along, but he resolutely refuses to go along with the state
acquiring land for a private enterprise, saying the precedent is
just too dangerous _ even if it means losing Boston's professional
sports teams.
</P>
<P>
   Stripped down, the fundamentally different world views of
Finneran and the Krafts are best described this way: Finneran says
that the deal the House proposed was the most generous subsidy
package the state has ever offered a single private concern. But
Jonathan Kraft notes that the package was one of the least generous
offered any NFL owner during the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was that irreconcilable difference that made the
Krafts decide to look elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran said he has only two real regrets. One is making his
``whining multi-millionaire'' jibe. The other, he said, was in
believing Kraft really wanted to keep the team in Massachusetts in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is about nothing but money,'' said Finneran. ``Expressions
of loyalty to Massachusetts, affection for the fans . . . is
propaganda.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the basement of BankBoston, where Jonathan Kraft sits in
a stadium model that now mocks the family's failed hopes for a new
facility in Massachusetts, the perspective is very different:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm personally disappointed because I really wanted this to
happen for my dad _ in Massachusetts. I personally feel like I
failed and I didn't get it done. But I wonder what else we could
have done. I wonder . . .''

HOW THE KRAFTS' MASSACHUSETTS DREAM FIZZLED

 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Behind locked doors in the basement of BankBoston's
downtown headquarters, the suite of rooms sits like a secret vault
preserving dreams of what might have been.
</P>
<P>
   One enters over mahogany floors, walks along silk-hung walls,
and smells the faint hint of new leather club chairs. A sparkling
granite bar flanks one wall, a panel of large-screen TVs fills
another.
</P>
<P>
   But what draws the eye is this colorful sight: six rows of blue
stadium seats, ten per row, facing a huge blowup of a New England
Patriots game in which players are frozen in gridiron glory.
Overhead, stereo speakers pipe in the voice of Gil Santos doing
play-by-play as the crowd roars in the background.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Patriots owner Robert Kraft spent more than $1 million
to build this subterranean section to help sell clients on the club
seats for his proposed stadium in South Boston. During his doomed
quest, Kraft was host to a half-dozen community groups in the plush
suite, hoping he could bring opponents around to the advantages of
his stadium plan. Build it, and they will succumb, he seemed to
think.
</P>
<P>
   But with Tuesday's approval by the Connecticut General Assembly
of the deal to move the Patriots to Hartford, the mockup stands as
a mausoleum for Kraft's dream. Even now, with the South Boston plan
almost two years dead, the Krafts haven't quite been able to give
up on the fantasy. They still pay more than $100,000 a year to
maintain the BankBoston rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just one of the testaments to our work; this was our
vision,'' Kraft's son Jonathan said recently on a tour of the site.
``I just hope it comes across how much effort we put in. It wasn't
a fool's errand. We wanted to spend our own money and keep the team
here.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an effort that began with the state's grand plans for a
Boston Megaplex, which morphed to ever-more ambitious schemes for a
South Boston stadium, and then dwindled to shrunken hopes for a
renovated home in Foxborough or a new facility there before ending
in bitterness and recrimination on both sides with the announcement
last month that Kraft had signed a deal to move to Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, the Krafts and Beacon Hill policymakers viewed
each other warily across a cultural chasm separating two very
different worlds.
</P>
<P>
   The Krafts, seeing themselves as community heroes who had saved
the Patriots for Massachusetts, still can't understand why state
politicians never turned their rhetoric into reality.
</P>
<P>
   The family found that even more perplexing because Kraft was
willing to pay for a $200 million stadium himself, asking state
help only for infrastructure, while other National Football League
teams were receiving huge taxpayer funding for their facilities.
</P>
<P>
   They aren't the only ones perplexed by what often appears to be
the state's politically balkanized, can't-do climate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Massachusetts would never offer the kind of expensive deal
that Connecticut did to keep the team, but the point is, we didn't
have to,'' said US Rep. Martin T. Meehan. ``We had several
proposals for a privately financed stadium.'' Still, a particularly
Boston blend of problems would combine to doom the stadium plans _
and cost Massachusetts its NFL franchise, along with the associated
prestige and the millions of dollars in annual tax revenue it
generates.
</P>
<P>
   With the Patriots long ensconced outside of Boston, the capital
city's business and civic leaders felt no strong connection to the
franchise. Its political community was always divided about the
appropriate site for a stadium and about how much state aid to
contribute, while voters themselves were seemingly indifferent to
the fate of the team. Ironically, in a city and a region that has
long been seen as passionate about politics and sports, politics
was instrumental in killing a major sport.
</P>
<P>
   But if politicians and businessmen were ambivalent about a new
stadium for the Patriots, Kraft had high expectations when state
officials asked him to be part of the Megaplex and, later, when
former Gov. William F. Weld suggested he build a stand-alone
facility on state land in South Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been led to believe that if we bought the team, that it
would get done,'' said Jonathan Kraft, citing Weld's words.
</P>
<P>
   But no one should have taken that as an ironclad guarantee, said
House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can feel sympathy. But at the same time there's an
extraordinary naivete, which is a kind word for it _ an absence of
comprehension of the steps one should take,'' said Finneran.
``There's no one person who speaks for the government.''
</P>
<P>
   As Kraft became exasperated, he turned into his own worst enemy.
On Super Bowl Sunday in 1995, Patriots fans woke to disturbing
news. In a Globe interview, Kraft charged that commitments to help
him, made when he was contemplating purchashing the team, were
being reneged on. Saying he had lost $13 million in his first year
owning the Patriots, Kraft seemed to raise the specter of moving or
selling the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can last like this maybe two or three more years, but if I
don't see something happen in the next six months, I'll have to do
some planning,'' Kraft said.
</P>
<P>
   On Beacon Hill, even the once-supportive Weld administration
came to be annoyed by a team owner who never seemed satisfied with
the state's effort _ and whose demanding demeanor and sharp tongue
alienated many who tried to help him.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two days stand as stark bookends in the saga of the New England
Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   On the most recent date, Nov. 19, 1998, Kraft stood with
Connecticut Governor John Rowland and, flanked by legislative
leaders and businessmen, announced he would relocate his football
team to Hartford. Rapid reverse to Feb. 25, 1994. On that day,
Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino and Weld joined Kraft at Quincy
Market for an appreciation ceremony. Weld was delighted by Kraft's
decision to buy the team for $170 million and keep the franchise
here. Menino told the grateful crowd that within several years, the
team would be playing in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Between the two events would come three frustrating attempts to
find an in-state home for the team, an effort spread across two
changes of legislative leadership, a mayoral election during which
Menino did not want to squander votes in South Boston, and a US
Senate election that distracted Weld.
</P>
<P>
   But that day at Quincy Market, the award seemed appropriate.
Kraft appeared less the hard-bargaining NFL mogul than a local
white knight who had brushed aside bottom-line concerns to stop the
Patriots from moving to St. Louis, in the process sparing Boston
and the region a blow to their civic psyches.
</P>
<P>
   But the realities of operating in the NFL would soon hit home to
the Krafts. In a recent interview, Jonathan, who does much of the
public speaking for his family and who has spearheaded the stadium
projects for his father, said it quickly became apparent that to
afford top-flight players, the Patriots needed a stadium that would
let them tap revenues other NFL franchises enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   The first attempt to find a new home flowed from Weld's
invitation to the Patriots to be part of a proposed Boston
megaplex, consisting of a convention center and domed stadium. By
most accounts, the Krafts were initially skeptical, but later
agreed, thinking it was what policy-makers wanted.
</P>
<P>
   It was and it wasn't. If Weld had an edifice complex, there were
signals from the start that the Legislature was skeptical. Only a
year or so before, legislation needed to clear the way for a new
Boston Garden had gotten snagged on Beacon Hill, passing only after
a protracted struggle.
</P>
<P>
   During that battle, Finneran, then chairman of the House Ways
and Means Committee, had attracted headlines with a blunt challenge
to Garden owner Jeremy Jacobs: If he didn't like the deal the
Legislature was offering, ``I invite him to walk.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a portent of things to come.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Charles Flaherty seemed no more enthusiastic about
a megaplex; ironically, Kraft's purchase of the team _ reducing the
threat the Patriots would leave _ had lessened the urgency for it.
``There were just too many problems to it,'' Flaherty said in a
recent interview. ``The money didn't make any sense, the financing
didn't make any sense, and the site didn't make any sense.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next attempt _ a free-standing South Boston stadium _ would
fail in the face of community opposition. Policy-makers said Kraft
should pay for the $185 million stadium himself. He agreed.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1996, Weld and Stephen Tocco, then executive director of
the Massachusetts Port Authority, secretly guided Kraft to a mostly
vacant parcel on the Reserve Channel owned by the quasi-public
agency. Kraft, by then hooked on the vision of building a stadium
in Boston, had his architects design a state-of-the-art facility
and began work on the BankBoston showcase to sell the luxury
suites.
</P>
<P>
   Keep it quiet, was the word from Weld and Tocco. When they had a
concrete proposal, that would be the time to inform the community
and its leaders. But when news of the plan leaked in December of
1996, it took not only South Boston but also most of its
politicians by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was it the right tactic? It didn't work, so certainly there
was room for improvement,'' Tocco said. ``We wanted to make sure we
had a deal first.''
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston chairman Charles Gifford said press negativity did
not help, either.

AIRLINE'S PREPARATIONS FOR SERVICE FROM DALLAS SEEM STALLED BY
SUITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAN REED and MAX B. BAKER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The long, costly legal battle over expanded
service at Dallas' Love Field is making it tough for Legend
Airlines to get its business off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Legend President Allan McArtor, who wants to offer long-haul
service from Love, says the company is not facing a cash crunch.
</P>
<P>
   But a Legend source who requested anonymity said the company has
been carefully conserving its cash since October, when a state
judge issued an initial ruling against the long-haul service from
Love.
</P>
<P>
   There has been little, if any, construction progress over the
past two months on the airline's private six-gate terminal at Love.
And plans to start training pilots in January have been put on
hold, according to a recruiting consultant and pilots who have
applied to the airline.
</P>
<P>
   In government filings, the airline has said that much of its
financing is contingent on clearing the legal hurdles and getting
final authorization to serve Love, neither of which is expected
soon.
</P>
<P>
   The airline denies reports that construction of its terminal and
parking garage has been halted. It said it no longer wants to talk
about pilot hiring or training schedules.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are where we choose to be in the terminal construction,''
McArtor said. ``We don't intend to be denied our authority to fly
out of Love Field. ... Everyone wants to pull us up by our roots to
see why we are not blooming now.''
</P>
<P>
   Legend originally wanted to launch service at Love Field in the
third quarter of 1997. But it has had to push back the start-up
date several times because of the political and legal wrangling.
</P>
<P>
   In documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the Transportation Department, Legend has said it expects to
raise at least $32 million in start-up investment.
</P>
<P>
   Legend has ``enough commitments for money, but most of that is
contingent on Legend getting all this cleared up and getting the
final certification to fly,'' the Legend source said.
</P>
<P>
   Without additional capital, the source estimated, the airline
has enough cash to last another year at the current rate of
spending, or perhaps longer if some staff members are dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   The legal fight began in October 1997, when Fort Worth sued
Legend, the city of Dallas and others to enforce its rights under
its 1968 contract with Dallas to build Dallas/Fort Worth Airport.
The 1968 deal precludes the kind of long-haul service from Love
Field that Legend proposes.
</P>
<P>
   The legal fight _ which has included trips into three federal
courts, the Texas appellate courts and the Texas Supreme Court,
plus several Transportation Department proceedings _ has been
costly to all the parties.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the Fort Worth City Council has authorized spending
$950,000 on legal fees. The Dallas City Council has approved
spending up to $1.5 million, and the D/FW board has authorized up
to $900,000.
</P>
<P>
   The legal expenses of the private parties in the case, including
Legend and American Airlines, are not known but are believed to be
equal to or greater than the cities' legal costs.
</P>
<P>
   And the legal wrangling is far from over.
</P>
<P>
   Legend is expected to appeal the October ruling by state
District Judge Bob McCoy of Fort Worth that blocked long-haul
service at Love Field.
</P>
<P>
   In court this week, McCoy agreed that a dispute over attorneys'
fees could be split into a separate lawsuit. He had previously
approved severing Fort Worth's original lawsuit from cross-claims
made by the D/FW Airport board against Continental, Continental
Express and American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   A federal case is also pending, and the Transportation
Department is expected to issue a ruling soon on the same issue. No
matter which side that ruling favors, the losing side can be
expected to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The wrangling has apparently stalled Legend's hiring. As
recently as late October, prospective pilots said they were being
told by Legend officials that the company expected to start its
training in January.
</P>
<P>
   But Air Inc., an Atlanta firm that helps pilots looking for
jobs, reports that Legend is telling candidates only that it hopes
to start a class sometime in the first quarter of next year.
</P>
<P>
   At the terminal, meanwhile, a foundation has been poured, as has
the concrete floor of what will be the passenger concourse, or
second floor. But little work has been done at the site since late
October.
</P>
<P>
   The Legend source estimated that between $3 million and $4
million has been spent on the terminal.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of spending the additional $8 million to $10 million
it will take to complete the terminal, money that Legend apparently
has on hand, Legend will probably use that money ``to keep the
legal fight going a year or more,'' the source said.

LET YOUR VOICE BE HEARD IN D.C.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I keep hearing that the polls don't mean anything, that Gallup
and other polling organizations rig the results to create the
illusion of widespread support for their political agenda _
whatever that may be.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, the anti-polling comments have been focused on all those
polls estimating that opposition to the impeachment of President
Clinton has been hovering somewhere in the range of 65 to 70
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``No pollster ever calls to ask my opinion,'' the poll critics
say. ``They never call anybody I know.''
</P>
<P>
   I've never had much use for polls myself, but it does seem that
they're getting more accurate all the time. Besides, I know a lot
of people who oppose impeachment; the anti-impeachment numbers in
the polls make perfect sense to me.
</P>
<P>
   It also made sense that polls taken at the end of the House
Judiciary Committee's impeachment proceedings showed that support
for impeachment had increased. Those anti-impeachment numbers in
the upper 60s suddenly dropped to 60 or thereabouts, suggesting
that the steady drumbeat of pro-impeachment rhetoric had taken its
toll.
</P>
<P>
   It's only natural that when people hear something over and over
again, some will begin to believe it. The Judiciary Committee's 21
Republicans said it over and over, hour after hour, day after day:
President Clinton should be impeached and removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   Like those TV commercials that pound at our brain until we
finally rush to the store and buy a certain brand of breakfast
cereal, the ceaseless pitch for impeachment could be expected to
change some minds. The surprise might be that a solid 60 percent of
the American people still were opposed by the time the Judiciary
Committee approved the last of four articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   OK, I know what you're thinking. Do I intend to make a point
here, or just keep jabbering?
</P>
<P>
   The point is this: After Sunday's column in which I urged
readers to contact their representatives in Congress and register
their views on impeachment, I received a number of phone calls from
people wanting to know which representatives to contact and how to
reach them.
</P>
<P>
   Among callers who stated an opinion on impeachment, pro or con,
six out of ten opposed impeachment. In other words, my completely
serendipitous, totally unscientific survey produced the same result
as the latest national polls: 60 percent of respondents said
Clinton should not be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe those folks in Congress don't want to take the pollsters'
word for it, but they surely can't ignore my voice mail.
</P>
<P>
   Just kidding. I'm well aware that the folks in Congress couldn't
care less about my voice mail. In fact, I suspect that they
resolutely ignore their own voice mail if it tells them something
that they don't want to hear.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, the point of Sunday's column was to encourage
people who oppose impeachment to make their opinion known to
Congress in the wake of news reports last week indicating that the
people who will decide Clinton's fate in the House of
Representatives were hearing mostly from pro-impeachment
constituents.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't suggesting that citizens who favor impeachment
shouldn't be heard. It just seemed to me that one side was being
disproportionately vocal, perhaps creating a distorted sense of the
national mood when those elected to the people's House very much
need to know what the people were thinking.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't contacted your representative, you still have
time to do so before the House votes on the articles of impeachment
recommended by the Judiciary Committee. If a majority of House
members vote for impeachment, the future of Clinton's presidency
will be in the hands of the Senate, where a trial will be held and
a two-thirds vote for conviction would result in the president's
removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   This impeachment stuff is a big deal, folks. If you don't care
about it, you should.

 &HT;    
 By GLORIA STEINEM  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It is time to register outraged and principled opposition to the
impeachment charade now going on in Washington. Yet few protests
are receiving much media attention.
 &HT;    For example, on Sept. 24 in Washington, the leaders of major
women's groups such as the National Organization for Women and the
National Council of Negro Women _ plus social justice groups like
the United Farm Workers and the Asian-Pacific Legal Consortium _
came together in a historic coalition to oppose President Clinton's
resignation or impeachment.
 &HT;    As they explained, ``(Clinton's) misdeeds are not of the nature
of high crimes and misdemeanors. ... As feminist leaders, we will
not stand idly by while a Congress made up of nearly 90 percent men
attempts to remove the first president elected by women voters.''
They also noted that a 90 percent white Congress would be
impeaching a president supported by more than 90 percent of
African-American voters.
 &HT;    If you don't know about that press conference, I'm not
surprised. The press mostly ignored it. Instead, media pundits
repeated the right-wing line that feminists didn't support Paula
Jones _ though we always supported her access to the courts (and
she had plenty), despite the borderline nature of her case of
sexual harassment.
 &HT;    If you're on the Internet, however, perhaps you do know of such
continuing efforts as ``Censure and Move On,'' a group that has
generated more than 94,000 messages against impeachment. Still more
calls are being made possible by Working Assets and People for the
American Way. People are lined up to reach their Congress members.
 &HT;    Yet I recently listened to Chris Matthews on ``Hardball,''
saying that the anti-impeachment majority must not really care
about Clinton's plight _ because there were no protests.
 &HT;    The truth is that protest isn't visible unless the media makes
it visible.
 &HT;    What the media does report is every hypocritical word in the
unrepresentative House Judiciary Committee, plus opinions from
talking heads neatly divided into those FOR and AGAINST
impeachment. This is supposed to serve objectivity. In fact, it
only gives the false impression that public opinion is equally
divided.
 &HT;    We know it is not. The huge majority opposes Clinton's
impeachment. The press attributes even that irrefutable result of
public opinion polls to some notion of economic comfort, as if
Clinton were being supported only out of the selfishness created by
a good economy.
 &HT;    In fact, those who support Clinton the MOST are those who
benefit from this economy the LEAST.
 &HT;    Opposition to impeachment exists because people around the
country are smart enough to know that ``Impeach Clinton'' and even
``Impeach Hillary'' bumper stickers have been sported and sold by
many of the same right-wing groups ever since the Clintons entered
the White House.
 &HT;    People are smart enough to figure out that Congress members
voting for impeachment have a suspiciously high correlation to
those owned by such obsessed minority lobbies as the tobacco
industry, the American Rifle Association and anti-abortion
organizations _ all sworn enemies of Clinton and his majoritarian
policies.
 &HT;    Do I agree with all of Clinton's policies? Of course not. I'll
never forgive him for signing the welfare bill. I'm proud of NOW
and other women's groups for staging a hunger strike outside the
White House in the vain hope of dissuading him.
 &HT;    But I also know that he has stood for equal economic and human
rights far more than the so-called Republican opponents _ and I
know what interests that angers.
 &HT;    I also know that even if President Reagan or President Bush had
been guilty of the same sexual misjudgment _ and then tried to
conceal it _ I wouldn't have supported their impeachment either.
Indeed, when the right-wing congressman Bob Bauman (of Maryland)
was accused of a sexual episode with a young man, the only question
I and other feminists asked was: Was this welcome sex or not?
Because if it was welcome, then it wasn't sexual harassment. And it
wasn't our business.
 &HT;    My fear is that the right wing is distorting and defeating
sexual harassment law in much the same way that they have tried to
distort and defeat affirmative action law.
 &HT;    Remember, these are the same folks who opposed sexual harassment
law in the first place. Phyllis Schlafly testified in Congress
against it and insisted that if women just dressed and behaved like
ladies, they wouldn't have this problem.
 &HT;    But now, the right wing is trying to use its version of the law
to peacefully assassinate a president. In the process, they have
convinced more than 60 percent of Americans that sexual harassment
law has gone too far; that it forbids all sex in the workplace, all
sex between unequals, even all sex outside of marriage _ none of
which it does or should do.
 &HT;    In fact, sexual harassment law has nothing to do with welcome
sex. The use of the word ``welcome'' is an innovation of this law.
``Consent'' can be coerced. ``Welcomeness'' cannot. It's the
religious right wing that is the Ayatollah here, not the creators
and supporters of sexual harassment law.
 &HT;    Bill Clinton should not have had to testify about Monica
Lewinsky. The enjoyment of mutually welcome sex does not constitute
a ``pattern and practice'' of unwelcome sex. Unequal status may be
an index of suspicion, but it is not dispositive, as lawyers say.
We are not the sex police. Any idea that this law allows such
policing will only defeat a good and much-needed code.
 &HT;    We should also call for an end to the humiliation of Monica
Lewinsky. This young woman broke no law, yet found herself
surrounded by FBI agents and denied access to her own lawyer. She
has been forced to reveal the most intimate details of her private
life _ under threat of her own imprisonment, and even the
imprisonment of her mother.
 &HT;    We owe it to her and ourselves to protest against the jokes,
humiliation and ridicule she has suffered. She has the right to
privacy, sexual expression and legal protection _ and if she does
not, neither do we.
 &HT;    We should also admit that we may be projecting our own
experience. For example, I have two women friends who were sexually
abused by their fathers. They have a hard time believing that
Monica could have been there voluntarily. I know another woman who
was done in by a faithless husband. Clinton's example hits a
bruise, and she reacts with pain and anger. I've been lucky enough
to have neither experience, and so can believe that Monica was
there voluntarily.
 &HT;    I don't even believe that power is the ultimate aphrodisiac.
When I was Monica's age, Eisenhower was president. I wouldn't have
gone to bed with Eisenhower, would you? I rest my case.
 &HT;    It's clear that many men and some women in the media hate
Clinton for reasons of the culture wars, even though they agree
with him on issues more than I do. It drives them crazy that
Clinton has won the most powerful position in the world without the
proper ``masculine'' behavior.
 &HT;    For example, his origins were lower-class (the same guys seem to
feel differently about the philandering of President Kennedy or
President Bush); he loved and remained close to his mother; he
married a wife who was at least his equal; he refused to go to war;
and he actually listens.
 &HT;    In other words, Clinton refused to play the usual male game _
and won anyway.
 &HT;    But none of these personal reasons can justify impeachment.
Clinton's behavior _ self-defeating and reckless as it was _ does
not constitute ``treason or other high crimes and misdemeanors.''
 &HT;    If he is impeached, any partisan majority will be able to
impeach any president. Is that what we want?

 &HT;    
 By GLORIA STEINEM  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It is time to register outraged and principled opposition to the
impeachment charade now going on in Washington. Yet few protests
are receiving much media attention.
 &HT;    For example, on Sept. 24 in Washington, the leaders of major
women's groups such as the National Organization for Women and the
National Council of Negro Women _ plus social justice groups like
the United Farm Workers and the Asian-Pacific Legal Consortium _
came together in a historic coalition to oppose President Clinton's
resignation or impeachment.
 &HT;    As they explained, ``(Clinton's) misdeeds are not of the nature
of high crimes and misdemeanors. ... As feminist leaders, we will
not stand idly by while a Congress made up of nearly 90 percent men
attempts to remove the first president elected by women voters.''
They also noted that a 90 percent white Congress would be
impeaching a president supported by more than 90 percent of
African-American voters.
 &HT;    If you don't know about that press conference, I'm not
surprised. The press mostly ignored it. Instead, media pundits
repeated the right-wing line that feminists didn't support Paula
Jones _ though we always supported her access to the courts (and
she had plenty), despite the borderline nature of her case of
sexual harassment.
 &HT;    If you're on the Internet, however, perhaps you do know of such
continuing efforts as ``Censure and Move On,'' a group that has
generated more than 94,000 messages against impeachment. Still more
calls are being made possible by Working Assets and People for the
American Way. People are lined up to reach their Congress members.
 &HT;    Yet I recently listened to Chris Matthews on ``Hardball,''
saying that the anti-impeachment majority must not really care
about Clinton's plight _ because there were no protests.
 &HT;    The truth is that protest isn't visible unless the media makes
it visible.
 &HT;    What the media does report is every hypocritical word in the
unrepresentative House Judiciary Committee, plus opinions from
talking heads neatly divided into those FOR and AGAINST
impeachment. This is supposed to serve objectivity. In fact, it
only gives the false impression that public opinion is equally
divided.
 &HT;    We know it is not. The huge majority opposes Clinton's
impeachment. The press attributes even that irrefutable result of
public opinion polls to some notion of economic comfort, as if
Clinton were being supported only out of the selfishness created by
a good economy.
 &HT;    In fact, those who support Clinton the MOST are those who
benefit from this economy the LEAST.
 &HT;    Opposition to impeachment exists because people around the
country are smart enough to know that ``Impeach Clinton'' and even
``Impeach Hillary'' bumper stickers have been sported and sold by
many of the same right-wing groups ever since the Clintons entered
the White House.
 &HT;    People are smart enough to figure out that Congress members
voting for impeachment have a suspiciously high correlation to
those owned by such obsessed minority lobbies as the tobacco
industry, the American Rifle Association and anti-abortion
organizations _ all sworn enemies of Clinton and his majoritarian
policies.
 &HT;    Do I agree with all of Clinton's policies? Of course not. I'll
never forgive him for signing the welfare bill. I'm proud of NOW
and other women's groups for staging a hunger strike outside the
White House in the vain hope of dissuading him.
 &HT;    But I also know that he has stood for equal economic and human
rights far more than the so-called Republican opponents _ and I
know what interests that angers.
 &HT;    I also know that even if President Reagan or President Bush had
been guilty of the same sexual misjudgment _ and then tried to
conceal it _ I wouldn't have supported their impeachment either.
Indeed, when the right-wing congressman Bob Bauman (of Maryland)
was accused of a sexual episode with a young man, the only question
I and other feminists asked was: Was this welcome sex or not?
Because if it was welcome, then it wasn't sexual harassment. And it
wasn't our business.
 &HT;    My fear is that the right wing is distorting and defeating
sexual harassment law in much the same way that they have tried to
distort and defeat affirmative action law.
 &HT;    Remember, these are the same folks who opposed sexual harassment
law in the first place. Phyllis Schlafly testified in Congress
against it and insisted that if women just dressed and behaved like
ladies, they wouldn't have this problem.
 &HT;    But now, the right wing is trying to use its version of the law
to peacefully assassinate a president. In the process, they have
convinced more than 60 percent of Americans that sexual harassment
law has gone too far; that it forbids all sex in the workplace, all
sex between unequals, even all sex outside of marriage _ none of
which it does or should do.
 &HT;    In fact, sexual harassment law has nothing to do with welcome
sex. The use of the word ``welcome'' is an innovation of this law.
``Consent'' can be coerced. ``Welcomeness'' cannot. It's the
religious right wing that is the Ayatollah here, not the creators
and supporters of sexual harassment law.
 &HT;    Bill Clinton should not have had to testify about Monica
Lewinsky. The enjoyment of mutually welcome sex does not constitute
a ``pattern and practice'' of unwelcome sex. Unequal status may be
an index of suspicion, but it is not dispositive, as lawyers say.
We are not the sex police. Any idea that this law allows such
policing will only defeat a good and much-needed code.
 &HT;    We should also call for an end to the humiliation of Monica
Lewinsky. This young woman broke no law, yet found herself
surrounded by FBI agents and denied access to her own lawyer. She
has been forced to reveal the most intimate details of her private
life _ under threat of her own imprisonment, and even the
imprisonment of her mother.
 &HT;    We owe it to her and ourselves to protest against the jokes,
humiliation and ridicule she has suffered. She has the right to
privacy, sexual expression and legal protection _ and if she does
not, neither do we.
 &HT;    We should also admit that we may be projecting our own
experience. For example, I have two women friends who were sexually
abused by their fathers. They have a hard time believing that
Monica could have been there voluntarily. I know another woman who

to have neither experience, and so can believe that Monica was

 &HT;    I don't even believe that power is the ultimate aphrodisiac.

<P>
   Still stumped for a holiday gift idea for your favorite
technophile? Still alarmed that a well-meaning relative is going to
get you a gift that does not plug into a wall or run on batteries?
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few ideas. All prices are approximate. Most of these
items are available in computer stores. If you have an Internet
connection, shopping is easier on line and can be done round the
clock, and a few of the major online computer and software vendors
will accept orders until midnight Dec. 23 for delivery on the 24th.
</P>
<P>
   Truly last-minute shoppers can buy electronic gift certificates
on line and have them delivered to the recipient by e-mail on
Christmas Day.
</P>
<P>
   But do not bother asking Santa for a G3 Macintosh desktop
computer; Apple says it has sold its entire holiday inventory. It
promises that a new generation of faster G3 machines will be
available in January, along with details about a couple of new
portable Macs for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   One new site worth visiting on line: www.buy.com and its
specialty areas, like buycomp.com for computers and buysoft.com for
software. Time after time, comparison shopping via the Web led me
to this place, which opened last month and appears to have the most
consistently low prices. Caveat E-emptor: like many Web vendors,
Buy.com requires the customer to pay all shipping fees, even when
returning defective merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Under $10
</P>
<P>
   These are hardly high-tech products, but they are always useful
in high-tech environments: a miniature flashlight, perfect for
peering inside the nooks and crannies of a computer, for tucking
into a traveler's computer bag for those dark moments when one has
to manipulate a phone jack behind the hotel bedstead and for
reading menus in dimly lighted restaurants, and a can of compressed
air for blowing dust bunnies, lint and crumbs from the delicate
innards of electronic devices. Dust can build up and cause
overheating, which causes electronic parts to fail.
</P>
<P>
   UNDER $25 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Floppy disks are so boring. Imation now makes them in neon
colors. A box of 30 is $20.
</P>
<P>
   UNDER $50 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most popular software in all the land is the Windows 98
upgrade, but the elves in Microsoft's workshop forgot to make it
fun. That's why I highly recommend Gizmos 98 (about $50) from Play
Inc., a collection of nearly two dozen inspired Windows 98
accessories and utilities that offers more amusement per click than
any other disk around.
</P>
<P>
   Gizmos includes a variety of visually gorgeous card games,
puzzles, clocks, screen savers and desktop screens, and handy
utilities like a file shredder, an encryption tool, an audio CD
player and a presentation program that lets the user organize
digital pictures and make slide shows.
</P>
<P>
   A big trend next year will be burning your own CDs, both for
making custom audio CDs and for backing up and storing data on CD
disks. Doing so requires a device called a CD-R or CD-RW drive. But
how do you keep from confusing one shiny disk with another?
</P>
<P>
   A company called Neato makes a CD label maker, consisting of
software and hardware, that lets CD burners be as creative with
their disk labels as they are with the custom CDs they make. The
kit, with labels, is about $45.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Pilot users, a group that seems to include everyone in
Silicon Valley plus a million others, will appreciate a Cross Duo,
a stylish $35 pen that writes on paper but also acts as a
nonwriting stylus for the Pilot.
</P>
<P>
   UNDER $100 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The portable audio CD player is still cool, depending on what
your definition of ``is'' is. Yes, the future of recorded music is
most likely to be on the Internet, but for now, the audio CD still
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer Electronics has a new line of portable audio CD players
called Loopmasters (list price $99 to $119) that do not blaze any
new trails technically but come in an array of colors, from clear
plastic to psychedelic, all with transparent lids and remote
controls on the headphones.
</P>
<P>
   Given the choice between oxygen and music, my teen-ager would
crank up the volume until he turned blue, all the better to match
the Royal Metal hue of his Loopmaster.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   UNDER $250
</P>
<P>
   The Lego Mindstorm Robotics Invention System ($200) is one of
those presents that parents give their children and then hope the
kids will share. It consists of more than 700 Lego bricks and
pieces, plus a small programmable computer, some software (Windows
only) that helps children learn to program, some sensors, an
infrared transmitter and a couple of motors to bring the
constructions to life.
</P>
<P>
   It comes with a book for constructing some simple robots, but
the real joy comes from letting loose your imagination and
creativity. It is a wonderful introduction to robotics and
programming.
</P>
<P>
   In the Internet age, the speed of the computer's processor chip
is often less important than the speed of the Web connection. Most
computer owners are still connecting to the Web at speeds of 28.8
kilobits per second or slower, so it is no wonder they think
``www'' stands for World Wide Wait.
</P>
<P>
   The faster the modem, the more enjoyable it is to browse the
Net. Today, the fastest dial-up modems are the so-called v.90, 56K
models, and one of my favorites is the 3Com U.S. Robotics 56K V90
External Fax Modem (about $125 at Buycomp.com). External modems do
not require the user to open the computer case, so they are the
better choice for beginners.
</P>
<P>
   The National Geographic Society has released its entire 109-year
collection of articles, photographs and advertisements as a set on
either 4 DVD disks ($171.95 at Buysoft.com) or 31 CD-ROM disks
($174.95 for the Collector's Edition at Buysoft.com. This may be
the ideal way to persuade pack-rat spouses to finally get rid of
years (and tons) of accumulated yellow magazines.
</P>
<P>
   For iMac owners, Kingston Technologies (www.kingston.com) has a
special this month on a 64-megabyte RAM upgrade for $139.99.
</P>
<P>
   Today's desktop computers have the same creative power as
yesterday's $50,000 video-editing workstations. Still, many
would-be video directors keep their old home videos on tape instead
of in the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Dazzle Multimedia has a great $249 peripheral called the Dazzle
Digital Video Creator, which lets users capture videos from
camcorders, video cassettes or other sources and create moving
images for display on Web sites, televisions or computer screens.
</P>
<P>
   UNDER $500
</P>
<P>
   Just for fun, a pair of the new Motorola Talkabout 280 SLK
two-way radios. Motorola has shrunk the new versions of these
walkie-talkies so that even small children can hold them easily and
has added some chrome-finished plastic to jazz them up. Even at
$159.95 each (it takes two or more to communicate, obviously) they
are cheaper than outfitting a child with a cell phone. The range is
two miles, sufficient for keeping in touch on hikes, on the way to
and from school or at the mall. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Palm III organizer from the 3Com Corp. is the latest
available version of the popular handheld PC companion device. The
price ranges widely right now, from $250 to about $350.
</P>
<P>
   The company recently announced a new model, called the Palm VII
and set to cost a little under $800 when it becomes available next
year. It is a fancier, wireless communications system with a
built-in modem and other features. The price gap between the Palm
III and the forthcoming Palm VII, not to mention the gap in product
numbers, suggests that Palm has some other products in the
pipeline. A cautious consumer might want to wait until early next
year to see what 3Com has in mind.
</P>
<P>
   UNDER $1,000
</P>
<P>
   Digital cameras are getting better all the time, and while they
are not yet a major threat to conventional film cameras, they are
clearly heading in that direction. We have tried a bunch of them,
and the most solid choice so far is the Kodak DC-260 with 3X
optical and 2X digital zoom lens ($713.95 from Buycomp.com).
</P>
<P>
   It can capture images up to 1.6 megapixels, enough for printing
an impressive 5-by-7 photo. Its clunky styling will not win any
awards, but it is better to take marvelous pictures than to look
marvelous. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Flat-panel computer monitors are near the top of many wish lists
this year, but some models dipped below $1,000 only recently. My
top choice is the pricey Apple Studio Display, which works just as
well with Windows machines as with Macintoshes, but it costs about
$1,300. For about $900, consider the NEC Multisync LCD400
flat-panel display, a 14-inch model that will be welcomed by anyone
who is short on desk space. But remember, flat-panel prices are
coming down steadily, and better bargains are very likely after the
holidays.

 &HT;    COST OF A PRESIDENTIAL BID: $2,500 AN HOUR THROUGHOUT 1999
 &HT;    750&AMP;add. With CAMPAIGN-DATA. For release Saturday, Dec. 19.
 &HT;    Eds: This story remains good for use through the New Year's

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Any presidential candidate who wants to win a major
party's nomination in 2000 will have to raise at least $22 million
in 1999, campaign finance experts say.
</P>
<P>
   For the Republican or Democratic hopeful who starts New Year's
Day, that comes to more than $2,500 an hour, 24 hours a day, seven
days a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raising that much doesn't mean you're going to win, but it
means you have a chance,'' said political scientist Herbert
Alexander, who has published book-length studies of the financing
of each presidential election since 1960.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some scholars have come to regard fund-raising in the
pre-election year as the invisible primary,'' agreed John Green,
director of the University of Akron's Bliss School of Applied
Politics.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate who raised the most early money has captured his
party's nomination in every presidential election since 1976, when
reporting of pre-primary finances was first required.
</P>
<P>
   But the hard reality that will drive next year's quest for money
is that candidates will be so busy campaigning during the heart of
the 2000 primary season that they simply won't have much time to
raise funds.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 states may hold their caucuses or primaries on or
before March 11, 2000. If they do, candidates will have to appeal
to three-fourths of the nation's voters by that date.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike previous election years, candidates won't be able to
concentrate solely on the Iowa caucuses or the New Hampshire
primary for the first two months. They'll have to buy lots of ads
or make expensive campaign trips to attract news coverage in huge
states such as California, Florida and New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you do well in Iowa or New Hampshire, you'll have only
a week or two before New York and California,'' Alexander said.
``You can't possibly raise big bucks in that short a time, so
you'll need money in the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander set the realistic minimum to be raised in 1999 by ``a
serious contender'' at $25 million. The $22 million estimate came
from accountant Stan Huckaby, whose Virginia-based firm has kept
the books for hundreds of Republican campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Only one Democrat and two Republicans definitely could raise
that much in 1999, said political scientist Paul Herrnson(cq) of
the University of Maryland. The Democrat is Vice President Al Gore
of Tennessee. The Republicans are Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and
publisher Malcolm ``Steve'' Forbes of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly Al Gore has a national network of people he can call
on, and the same is true of George W. (Bush), who will inherit the
Bush dynasty'' from his father, former President George H.W. Bush,
Herrnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has spent the last two years honing his fund-raising
ability and is rich enough to use his own money if he comes up
short, Herrnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Several other hopefuls believe they would have a chance if they
raise at least $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can be viable with $15 million to $20 million,
(if) you husband your resources and don't spend them on straw polls
and other distractions in 1999,'' said Ed Gillespie, communications
director for the leadership PAC of Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio. ``If
John runs, we'd hope to have $12 million on hand on Jan. 1, 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans whose records indicate they might raise that
much include conservative activist Gary Bauer of Virginia, former
Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, former Vice President Dan Quayle
of Arizona, and Sens. John McCain of Arizona and John Ashcroft of
Missouri. All have raised at least $3 million for their own
campaigns or their personal political organizations in the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats with a solid national fund-raising reputation include
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri and Sen. John Kerry
of Massachusetts, who met the $3 million threshold in the past two
years, as well as two others who raised that much in the past. The
two are former Sens. Bill Bradley of New Jersey and Paul Wellstone
of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're outspent four to one, you're cooked,'' Wellstone's
campaign manager, Dan Lucas, said. ``But if you're only outspent
two to one, you're in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   All those calculations include only ``hard'' money, which under
federal rules can be raised from individuals giving no more than
$1,000 apiece, plus federal funds to match the first $250 from any
of those donors.
</P>
<P>
   Enforcement of campaign finance laws has become so lax and
haphazard that Green said he can't even guess at how much
unregulated ``soft'' money will be raised for indirect help to some
of the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing fast and loose with the rules will be easier than ever
in 2000,'' Green predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of financing their political travels during 1998 solely
through the small hard-money contributions raised by their
federally regulated committees, at least six hopefuls also formed
state committees or taxable corporations to help out. The federal
committees could accept only non-corporate gifts of $5,000 or less,
but the other organizations could accept soft money from any source
in any amount. Some may use these unregulated organizations to
finance activities in 1999 as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soft money's been useful before,'' Green said. Democrat
``Walter Mondale spent a lot early in 1984, but then Gary Hart came
out of nowhere in mid-spring when Mondale was almost out of money.
So labor unions (spending an estimated $5 million) bankrolled
Mondale delegates in various states.''
</P>
<P>
   Green said, ``I just see the creative use of soft money in 2000
as being like 1984 or 1996, but squared or cubed.''

VIRTUAL ASSISTANTS, WITH PERSONALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DEBORAH CLAYMON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. Chip Lee, an Episcopal priest from Oakland, Md.,
assures his parishioners that he can be reached by telephone 24
hours a day, 7 days a week, even though he juggles two rural
congregations (three in the summer) and puts more than 500 miles on
his Buick each week.
</P>
<P>
   Lee used to rely on a tangle of voice-mail systems, pagers and
cellular phones to watch over his flock. But since August, he has
combined everything into one electronic mailbox accessible through
a toll-free number.
</P>
<P>
   All his calls are answered by an angelic female voice that
quickly finds him wherever he roams. The voice goes by the name
Portico, and ``she'' is one of a handful of computer-generated
administrative assistants that use speech recognition to manage
telephone, e-mail and fax communications for busy people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a virtual assistant has completely changed my life,''
Lee said with a kind of reverence that nearly suggested divine
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who pays Portico about $90 a month for 750 minutes, is one
of the growing number of employers of virtual assistants. In
principle, the idea is wonderful _ this assistant never turns on
you when you fail to give a raise, never escapes on three-hour
bathroom breaks or calls in faking the flu to take a day off.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike an answering machine, the virtual assistants like
Portico, Wildfire and Webley _ the three that operate nationally _
have responsive voices that turn these services into humanlike
appliances, complete with personality.
</P>
<P>
   But there are tradeoffs. The largest is that the current limits
of speech recognition technology make interaction with virtual
assistants frustrating, especially for the person who's calling and
often also for the person who is being called. Although these
personalities are a huge leap beyond voice mail, they speak and
understand only preset phrases, and they can be maddeningly literal
and impenetrable.
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating the picture, say two professors who helped
create Portico's persona, is that on a fundamental psychological
level, humans do not distinguish between communicating with a live
person and with an electronic creation.
</P>
<P>
   People respond to the personalities of computers, televisions
and other media by the same rules they use for social interactions
with real people. This may suggest that the mistakes of the current
less-than-perfect virtual assistants are worse than those of
underperforming real assistants.
</P>
<P>
   Webley (which has the voice of a British butler), Portico and
Wildfire are the first generation of virtual assistants. At first
glance, they are remarkably similar. Just by talking into the
phone, users can make calls, hear voice mail and e-mail, and use
stored address books to return calls.
</P>
<P>
   These virtual assistants also manage incoming calls through call
screening and call routing, and they send faxes to your current
location. They even recognize frequent callers and respond
according to your wishes. (Take a message from Mom. Put Charles
Schwab through.)
</P>
<P>
   Although Wildfire Communications invented the idea of a
telephone-based personal assistant in 1992, Wildfire's product
hasn't actually spread like, well, you know. Its first version was
an expensive system sold to businesses to replace their internal
voice mail beginning in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Then Webley (owned by Vail Systems) began a competing service in
January, and Portico, from General Magic, started in July. (Not all
of these are available in all cities.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite their imperfections, all three are gaining subscribers,
particularly among those comfortable with technology. All have
major financial supporters and will certainly continue to improve.
AT&AMP;T Wireless, Intel and Microsoft invested in Wildfire, and
Microsoft is helping to finance Portico.
</P>
<P>
   But to lure many more people to seek salvation in electronic
voices, virtual assistants must evolve beyond their user-unfriendly
responses.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Black, a prominent art designer of publications and a
media consultant who has used Wildfire for three years, has 11
offices around the world and three homes. He has made Wildfire his
only phone number, but he acknowledges that relying on the voice
interface can be exasperating, especially when the service requires
you to keep repeating yourself or if the telephone connection is
bad.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he liked Wildfire's sense of humor about her own
shortcomings. ``One time I screamed an unprintable injunction and
she said, `I'm sorry, I cannot perform that function,' Black said.
``Wildfire also sighs when you call it in the middle of the night,
and if you tell it you are depressed, it responds: `Great. Now I'm
a therapist.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Just as with real people's personalities, maddening quirks and
inconsistencies in the automated assistants' responses can make the
difference between thinking of them as loyal companions or as
irritating pests.
</P>
<P>
   For a machine to portray a reliable and likable human being
requires the most natural interaction possible, say Clifford Nass
and Byron Reeves, Stanford University communications professors who
helped build the persona behind Portico.
</P>
<P>
   It is perfectly normal, the professors say, to argue with your
computer when it does not do what you want it to do. Because we
tend to treat machines like people, machine blunders set us off
just as human ones do. Nass and Reeves also helped devise the
personalities of Microsoft's Bob and the help characters called
Office Assistants in Microsoft Office 98.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Computer engineers once believed that only sophisticated
artificial intelligence software could accurately simulate a
person. (Remember, the computer Hal was ultimately smarter than the
astronauts in ``2001.'') In contrast, psychologists have asserted
that humans identify personality in seconds by responding to the
smallest, most trivial clues.
</P>
<P>
   Nass and Reeves figured that if the psychologists were right,
even the simplest text or poorly recorded computer voice would give
a machine instant personality.
</P>
<P>
   To prove it, they began a series of standard experiments in
human interaction in which one person was replaced by an electronic
box. What they found were the identical psychological results of
human-to-human studies, even though people denied reacting to the
machine in a social way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we may logically know we are interacting with a
machine, our reactions are fundamentally the same as when we
interact with a human,'' Nass said.
</P>
<P>
   Black said some of his male clients were charmed by Wildfire's
friendly and rather seductive voice. ``One person once told me that
they responded to Wildfire's statement `I'll see if I can find him'
with, `Take your time, sweetheart.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As advisers to General Magic on the creation of Portico, Nass
and Reeves conducted an audition of more than 100 actors to match
the right voice to the psychological profile invented for Portico.
Then they found Hollywood script writers to best link Portico's
language to its persona.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all this, speaking to Portico, Webley and Wildfire
quickly shows these assistants to be more virtual than real. Even
Nass says talking to Portico is like talking to a foreigner in
English.
</P>
<P>
   While callers may not like talking to computers masquerading as
people, some users _ including Paul Saffo, a technology business
consultant and loyal user of Wildfire _ take the responses by their
callers to Wildfire as a gauge of the callers' characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who complains registers as a jerk that I probably don't
want to talk to,'' Saffo said, adding that he was delighted with
the service.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Avrum Bluming, an oncologist and a clinical professor of
medicine at the University of Southern California, signed up for
Wildfire six months ago to answer the dozens of calls he receives
daily from patients on his car phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate wasting time,'' said Bluming, adding: ``Looking down at
the phone while driving raised certain health and safety issues.
Now I just tell Wildfire to dial.''
</P>
<P>
   He also uses Wildfire's toll-free number to make long distance
calls from the hospital, something that once meant a long wait for
a connection from the hospital's operator.
</P>
<P>
   But since his Wildfire service cannot send a page, Bluming has
not yet abandoned his beeper and his answering service for urgent
incoming calls.
</P>
<P>
   Many committed users, like Oliver Muoto, a software marketing
executive, agree that the services need significant improvements
before they catch on with most consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``For anyone impatient with technology, virtual assistants are
really still pretty inconvenient to use,'' said Muoto, who just
switched to Portico from Wildfire after a year because Portico lets
him use the Web to check his voice mail and reads him his e-mail
over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   But don't ask Muoto about all the times he has screamed into the
phone, trying to make himself understood by a virtual assistant on
a bad phone line.
</P>
<P>
   Or take the fact that a colleague recently sent him an e-mail
message instead of calling because, she wrote, ``I just had an
argument with your telephone secretary.'' Ask him instead about how
his virtual assistant found him via his cellular phone in time to
finalize the details on the contract for venture capital financing
of his start-up company.
</P>
<P>
   He said the services needed to become simpler to learn and
better at adapting to natural conversation and at recognizing and
managing a user's priorities. ``But,'' he added, ``for sales and
marketing people like me who feel the pain of being out of touch,
we're willing to live with a less-than-ideal solution that works 90
percent of the time.''

<P>
   MILLENNIUM-OVERVIEW _ Almost 2,000 years ago, a man named Jesus
was born and the world changed forever. The impact of Jesus echoes
through the millennia. It has profoundly changed the way people
view God, the world and each other. Over the next two weeks, and
the coming year, Cox Newspapers will take a look at Jesus, focusing
on the spread of Christianity, first in and around its homeland in
the Mideast, later through Europe and the Americas, and ultimatley
around the world. (White, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM-CHRISTIANS _ JERUSALEM _ Despite their urban settings
and the politics that engulfs them 2000 years later, the sites
where Christ was born, lived and died are still powerful ``faith
strengtheners'' for millions of Christians world wide. Visits to
the region by Christians _ and they constitute about 75 percent of
Israel's 2.3 million annual tourists _ remind them that Jesus was
human and the ideals he practiced can be practiced by others. The
physical sites still make Jesus' story real. Christian
denominations have picked their favorite spots. Catholics come to
Jerusalem's Old City, where they often rent wooden crosses and walk
the supposed path Jesus took with his cross. Traditional
Protestants gravitate toward the Church of the Nativity and
Evangelicals head for prayer nearby in the Shepherd's Fields.

   For Saturday, Jan. 2:
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM-FUTURE _ BETHLEHEM, West Bank _ There is a new trend
in this old city. For about a year, Christians have been putting
crosses, usually lit electrically, on their homes and shops. It is
largely seen as a sign of a population that is free, but is a
minority and feels insecure. Christians are a divided minority. In
Israel, Arab Christians benefit from a healthier economy and some
even serve in the Israeli army. In Palestinian areas, they face a
military occupation and a stagnant economy _ driving many to
emigrate to the United States. But, 2000 years after it was founded
here, it would be a mistake to predict Christianity's demise in the
Holy Land. (Kaplow, Cox News Service) 25. WITH PHOTOS.

   MILLENNIUM-SYRIAC _ JERUSALEM _ Two thousand years later, you
can still

lifestyle in the walled city of Jerusalem and still practice
religion in Aramaic, the language of Christ. (Kaplow, Cox News

</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM-AMERICA _ Two thousand years after Jesus's birth, the
relationship between his native people, the Jews, and his
followers, the Christians, is complex. Some evangelical Christians
are Zionists, believing that the Temple in Jerusalem must be
rebuilt so that Jesus can come again. But some of these same people
think they must proselytize the Jews. A look at American Christian
attitudes toward Israel and its people. (White, Atlanta

   MILLENNIUM-PALESTINIANS _ Some Palestinian Christians in the
United States are attempting to influence both governmental and
denominational policy toward Israel. Story includes interviews with
national and local Palestinian Christians about what their lives
were like in Palestine, why they came to the United States, what
they hear from friends and relatives about conditions today.

Clark on the TV, are you? This once-in-a-lifetime event demands a
once-in-a-lifetime celebration, whether it's frolicking with a

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The Year 2000 computer bug bit Bank One
Texas a little early.
</P>
<P>
   And it all happened because the bank was trying to make sure
that it would not have computer problems with the start of the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The bank confirmed this week that it accidentally mailed out
notices to 2,013 Texas customers saying they had bounced checks.
</P>
<P>
   The notices were generated because Bank One wanted to make sure
that its computers were Year 2000 compliant, meaning that they
could recognize the difference between 1900 and 2000. The notices
carried a post-2000 date.
</P>
<P>
   The test worked nicely. The little blue overdraft notices were
printed the way they were supposed to, and everything seemed in
order, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
   But along the way, somebody inside Bank One didn't get the word.
The notices, which were supposed to be dumped into the trash, were
mailed to depositors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was awful, receiving a notice like that just before
Christmas,'' said an Arlington woman whose 83-year-old mother
received a letter.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter, who asked that the family name not be used, said
the bank told the distraught woman of the mistake when she called.
The bank is also sending out apologies to account holders who
received the notices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The customers are being told that their accounts are still in
order, that they won't be charged for being overdrawn,'' said Joe
Bowles, a Bank One spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We send out 100,000 pieces of mail to customers each day in
Texas alone,'' Bowles added. ``This was purely a mistake that
shouldn't have happened.''

   LAS VEGAS, Nev. _ It had been a routine Sunday at the Palace
Station Hotel and Casino, a rambling Las Vegas institution more
popular among the locals than among the millions of tourists who
flock to the city's more extravagant hotel-and-casino resorts.
</P>
<P>
   But when a 67-year-old woman, a regular at the Palace, plunked
the last three silver dollars of about 300 she played that evening
into a rather ordinary-looking slot machine, what followed was
anything but routine.
</P>
<P>
   The woman struck the largest slot machine jackpot ever:
$27,582,539.48.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not she knew it, the gambler, who asked that her name
not be used, also came face to face on that November evening with
the highly sophisticated computer technology that drives the
deceptively traditional-looking Megabucks slot machine she played.
</P>
<P>
   Slot machines built around chips and then networked make such
hefty payoffs possible. And casino makers say that computers have
quietly revolutionized the multibillion-dollar slot machine
industry in much the same ways that computers in the last 20 years
have revolutionized, for better or worse, how millions of Americans
communicate, shop, learn, work and play.
</P>
<P>
   ``As computer technology has been enhanced, so have the games,''
said Ed Rogich, an executive director of International Game
Technology, a major gambling machine maker based in Nevada. The
slot machine, casino gambling's single most visible and profitable
(and loud) workhorse, has, at the dawn of the 21st century, gone
digital.
</P>
<P>
   Born as a 19th-century penny amusement, the typical slot machine
today in Las Vegas, Atlantic City, the Mississippi Gulf Coast or
anywhere in the world where they are found is very likely to be a
computer. While many of them still stand upright in brightly
colored cabinets and retain the familiar spinning reels bearing
symbols like cherries, bars and bells, the display is illusion.
</P>
<P>
   Once, spring-driven reels randomly stopped by slotted mechanisms
decided whether everything or anything came up roses or cherries _
now a chip decides. The one-armed bandit is not just suddenly
ambidextrous; it is a multitasking, multiple-games-in-one gambling
machine.
</P>
<P>
   The new technologies have changed the way people win and lose on
slot machines and have led to the networking that produces huge
jackpots, like the one won at the Palace Station. The most profound
change may be the eerie commingling of video games, entertainment
and gambling to keep people at the machines.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of incentive for importing computer innovation
to the casino floor, said Jason N. Ader, senior managing director
at Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co. in New York for equity research in its
gaming, lodging and leisure division. In a report he wrote this
year on casino gambling, Ader noted that slot machines in Nevada
and Atlantic City alone accounted for 65 percent of the casinos'
gambling revenues and took up 80 percent of the space dedicated to
gambling last year, a major swing away from the days when the big
money makers were tables with such low-tech games as roulette and
poker.
</P>
<P>
   All the advances are part of the march of gambling machine
technology from mechanical to electromechanical, then to computer
circuit boards and high-speed microprocessors (some even bearing
Pentium-class chips). At each step, the goal has been the same:
setting up a machine that pays out enough to keep people using it
but keeps enough to make money _ lots of money.
</P>
<P>
   In Nevada, where state gambling laws require slot machines to
pay out a minimum of 75 percent of the money that they take in,
competitive pressures have pushed casinos to set their slot
machines to pay out an average of 95 percent, said Keith Copher,
chief of enforcement for the Nevada Gaming Control Board, which
approves and inspects the state's more than 204,000 slot machines.
</P>
<P>
   But don't weep for the casino owners, Copher said, noting that 5
percent of the state's slot machines' take in the last fiscal year
amounted to more than $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Before the computer era, slot machines featured spinning reels,
usually three, seen through a window. A player would insert a coin,
pull the machine's handle to start the reels spinning and hope that
when they stopped, the symbols painted on the reels would line up
in a winning combination. If they did, the player received some or
all of the coins that had been placed into the machine.
</P>
<P>
   The odds of winning were determined by the number of reels in
the machine and the number of symbols on each reel, explained Verne
F. Holmes Jr., an inventor of electronic slot machine devices and
vice president of new product development at Station Casinos, which
owns the Palace Station.
</P>
<P>
   Now all that is done with a computer chip, usually an Eprom
(Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory) chip, that is programmed
to generate random numbers and then to translate those numbers into
the results the slot machine actually shows plyers: two single
bars and a bell, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Slot machine makers say the game's outcomes cannot be
predetermined by a master computer tucked away somewhere, and
gambling regulatory groups like Copher's are charged with making
certain that such a thing never becomes possible. To help make sure
that the chips, and, of course, the programming they contain, are
not rewritten or manipulated, some of them are covered with an
epoxy film and tamper-resistant tape (a duplicate chip with
duplicate programming is kept by independent inspectors for
periodic bit-by-bit comparisons).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all random,'' said Copher, of the Nevada Control Board.
``We check all of the slot machines.''
</P>
<P>
   The networked jackpots, one of the most significant changes in
slot machines, are based on machines built around computer chips.
The Megabucks slot machines, for example, are wired on closed
networks like private Internets (riverboat-based versions of the
game can use wireless network connections) so they can communicate
with other slot machines offering the same game. In Nevada, for
instance, Megabucks is played statewide on a network of about 700
linked slot machines in 133 locations.
</P>
<P>
   Every time a player in Nevada drops a dollar into a Megabucks
slot machine, about six cents of that dollar is added to a special
running jackpot figure posted simultaneously at the casinos where
slot machine players can see it. Much smaller jackpots are usually
independent of the network and are paid directly out of the machine
a gambler plays, Rogich said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   When the computer chip inside a machine comes up with a big
jackpot winner, the machine the player won on automatically locks,
waiting for technicians to arrive to check its integrity. But
gamblers on the other machines in the network continue to gamble
for a new jackpot, which starts at $5 million, said Rogich, of
International Game Technology. His company started the networked
game 11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even slot machines that do not have networked jackpots are
linked to networks that keep track of operations at particular
casinos, said Ken Geiger, assistant vice president for slot-machine
operations at the Las Vegas Hilton. Geiger manages his thousands of
clanging and flashing slot machines at the Hilton with a computer
network that gives him up-to-the-minute information on the status
of each machine, like how many coins have gone into a machine, how
many have been paid out and when the machine was last opened for
maintenance and refilling.
</P>
<P>
   This is increasingly useful in an age when casino managers worry
that each new computer advance will be challenged by hackers hoping
to turn it to their own ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of those slot machines reports to a mainframe
upstairs,'' Geiger said. ``If somebody right now opens up a slot
machine door and leaves it open, it will page the person who left
it open and a manager and say someone left the door open. The
technology has gone through the roof.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer technology can also be used to keep track of gamblers.
Many of even the most common slot machines are equipped with card
readers to handle the cards, resembling credit cards, that are
given free to players. Through the cards, players are rewarded with
points toward various prizes, based on how much they gamble. The
system is similar to an airline frequent-flier program.
</P>
<P>
   Players furnish personal information in signing up for tracking
cards, so the system gives casinos a wealth of information on
gamblers' habits and background, and that information is stored in
a casino database. When a player inserts a card, for instance, the
casino can learn by way of the slot machine network that it is the
player's birthday and dispatch a message to a casino waitress to
give the player a drink on the house.
</P>
<P>
   Computers have also turned the slot machine into an
entertainment center designed to help keep the player at the
machine. The machines often include video games and other flashy
displays with CD-quality sound and high-end graphics and offer such
amenities as optical coin and bill readers.
</P>
<P>
   An International Game Technology catalog says one of its new
machines comes ``cable ready'' so casino operators can let players
watch their favorite sporting events or soap operas on the slot
machines while they are hoping to hit the big one.
</P>
<P>
   The slot machines ``seem more like video games to me,'' Lenny
Bakken, 31, an occasional player from Rochester, Minn., said after
dropping a few quarters in a flashing, clanging electronic
contraption that merged elements of old slot machines with a
spinning Jeopardy wheel. ``It sure keeps your attention more,'' he
added. And that may be cause for increased caution on the part of
gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   Niraj Verma, an associate professor of planning and management
at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles who often
writes about technology's influence on society, worries about
applying so-called user-friendly technologies like those in
computers and video games to devices like slot machines, which,
judged by their rate of return, are inherently unfriendly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It lures us into a kind of sense of security,'' Verma said,
``a familiar territory of bells and whistles and gizmos and fun.
Our guard is down, and all of this contributes to taking away from
us our control of ourselves. That is, in my view, the bottom
line.''
</P>
<P>
   But casino executives like Geiger at the Las Vegas Hilton are
delighted rather than worried. They are banking on the appeal of
video-game-like slot machines as they cram their gaming floors with
high-tech slot machines with names like Wild Cherry Pie, Wheel of
Fortune and Reel 'Em In, which increasingly have more in common
with Nintendo than with the old-fashioned casino.
</P>
<P>
   ``The standard of standing in front of a slot machine with a
three-reel spinner and putting in your $20 and losing your $20 and
saying, `Wow, that went quick,' is phasing out,''' said Geiger, who
started in the casino business 20 years ago in Atlantic City. ``Now
it's, What can I put in front of the customer where he can sit down
and I can entertain him? If we can mold the next generation into
enjoying themselves while they're gambling, it's a home run.''

   &UR; A Standard For Modems &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I read an article that advised buyers of computer equipment
to make sure to buy a V.90 modem. What does V.90 mean?
</P>
<P>
   A. The term V.90 refers to the international standard for 56K
(56 kilobits per second) analog modem technology. When 56K modems
began to appear in stores in 1997, two different types were
available: X2, created by the 3Com Corp. (which owns the modem
maker U.S. Robotics) and K56flex, developed by Rockwell
Semiconductor Systems and Lucent Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The two modems used different _ and incompatible _ technology to
transmit data. Many consumers didn't know which kind to buy, and
many Internet service providers supported only one or the other. If
you tried to connect at top speed to an ISP that supported only the
other kind of 56K, you would connect at a slower rate.
</P>
<P>
   Last February, a technology for 56K modems called V.90 was
agreed upon by an international standards committee in Switzerland.
The V.90 standard is finally unifying the 56K modem market. ISP's
are beginning to support V.90, and if you own a 56K modem, you
should check with its manufacturer to see if you can upgrade it to
the V.90 standard. Detailed information on 56K modems is available
at the 56K Modem Info Center page (www.sirius.com/rmoss) and at the
V.90 Modem Standard page (www.v90.com).

COMPUTERS KEEP GAMBLERS, AND THE CASINOS, HAPPY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHEL MARRIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A slot machine is governed by the unyielding laws of
mathematics, regardless of whether it has a mechanical or
electronic brain. Odds, payoff rates, and sizes and frequencies of
jackpots all depend on the unforgiving laws (from the gambler's
point of view) that govern numbers anywhere in the universe.
</P>
<P>
   A classic slot machine might have three spinning reels with 20
symbols each. If only one symbol (say, a cherry) on each reel was a
winner, the odds of getting a winning combination _ three cherries
_ would be 203, or 1 in 8,000.
</P>
<P>
   Computer technology has made the spinning reels purely
decorative. They reflect the results from a computer chip that
serves as a random number generator. When a gambler pulls the
handle or pushes the spin button on a slot machine, the generator
spits out random numbers that signal the motor to stop spinning
reels at certain symbols or, in the case of video displays, to show
certain symbols on computer-like screens.
</P>
<P>
   The gambler anxiously watches the reels spin, even though the
end position of the reels is determined in a split second. The time
delay is strictly show.
</P>
<P>
   The computer allows a far greater range of possible combinations
and thus outcomes than traditional slot machines could manage. In
some slot machines, especially those playing high-stakes games like
Megabucks, the computer can segment the reels into more than 250
possible stops.
</P>
<P>
   That increasing the odds against hitting some winning
combinations _ for the largest jackpots _ while making many more
smaller jackpots possible.
</P>
<P>
   By law, Las Vegas slot machines must pay out 75 percent of the
money taken in. But because of competition, casino operators say,
many slot machines pay out 95 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   Complex mathematical formulas are used to program the slot
machines' computers to fix the the size and frequency of wins,
which controls the payout percentage. Casino makers say the
programs can be changed by casino operators under the guidance of
regulatory groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it allows us to do in the industry is to give away $27
million but have a lot of people still win an awful lot of money
for cherries, single bars, double bars, triple bars or whatever the
winning combinations are,'' said Verne F. Holmes Jr., an inventor
of slot machine devices who is based in Las Vegas.

DIVIDED ANEW, KINKS ON LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(jt) 
 By CHARLES BERMANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Kinks are the only major British Invasion group aside from
the Rolling Stones to continue to perform and record, and, like
many musicians, have developed a presence on the World Wide Web.
True to one of the band's lesser-known anthems _ ``I'm Not Like
Everybody Else'' _ they have done so in their own fashion.
</P>
<P>
   A large part of the Kinks' allure has always been the sibling
rivalry between two of the principals: Ray and Dave Davies, who are
brothers. Ray, 54, wrote and sang most of the band's hits, from
``You Really Got Me'' to ``Come Dancing.'' Dave, 51, is known for
his histrionic guitar playing and challenges to Ray's leadership.
So it is no surprise that the rivalry continues on line, with each
brother represented by separate sites _ but linked to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Both sites were set up last spring. They focus on the Davies'
solo careers, rather than on Kinks music. Mercifully, both are free
of the annoying practice, seen in many fan-run Web sites on the
Kinks, of substituting the letter ``k'' when a hard ``c'' begins a
word. Coincidentally, both sites are operated by Kinks fans living
in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Locke, a New Bedford Web site developer, was operating his
own Kinks fan site when Christian Davies, Dave Davies' 26-year-old
son, approached him with the idea of an official Dave Davies site.
Tony Raine, from the Cape Cod town of Chatham, was the one to
approach Ray Davies. ``None of these guys are overly computer
literate,'' Raine said. ``They are just learning.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dave Davies Web site (www.davedavies.com) contains the
requisite touring information and guitar shots, but Davies logs on
regularly to answer the most minutiae-soaked inquiries. Fans are
also able to listen to a complete concert. Davies also uses the
online forum to expound upon his Eastern-tinged spiritual beliefs
and to hawk a related album of ambient music, available only from
the Web site. And while turning to a pop star for spiritual
guidance may be somewhat misguided, the discourse here is more
substantial than the offerings of some other celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   A recent upgrade of Ray Davies' site (www.raydavies.com) is
quite an improvement over the initial effort, with flashier
graphics and fewer blatant misspellings (although its small
white-on-black type does not accommodate the eyesight of the
rapidly aging fan base).
</P>
<P>
   Like his brother, Ray Davies is using his site to promote his
literary leanings, offering samples that are, for the time being,
not available elsewhere. But unlike his brother, Ray Davies seems
to treat the Web as a peripheral activity, a 1990s version of a
1960s fan club.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole `Internet thing' just hasn't piqued Ray's interest
like it has Dave's,'' said Dave Emlen, a systems analyst for the
Rochester Institute of Technology who runs a Kinks fan page. ``But
if I had to choose between Ray spending his free time working on
his Web site or working on new recordings and projects, I'd choose
the latter.''

LANGUAGE LESSONS, OBJECT LESSONS
</HEADLINE>
  (af)  
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last time I traveled to Mexico, I was armed with only a
little English-to-Spanish phrase book to guide me through the
streets of Merida. On a street corner, my husband announced that we
had to find the city zoo because he had suddenly remembered from a
previous visit that the exhibition of hairless dogs ``had a
haunting quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Thumbing through the book in search of words to ask for
directions, the best I could find was a translation for ``Can you
direct me to a dentist? My teeth are bleeding.''
</P>
<P>
   We eventually found the hairless dogs, and for the record, they
were haunting. Keep in mind that this happy adventure occurred in
1987, before we had children. In those days we had hours and hours
to amble down unfamiliar streets, eating tacos we bought from a
vendor and speculating about the curious circumstances that led the
author of our Spanish phrase book to worry about spontaneous mouth
hemorrhages.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, wandering around Mexico without knowing the
language doesn't seem so funny. With plans to travel at the end of
the month to the Baja Peninsula with my three children, my husband
and my parents (none of whom speak Spanish), I realized last week
that I needed to brush up on the skills I have largely ignored
since college. Not that I expect anyone's teeth to bleed; I just
want to be able to ask about our suitcases if they get lost.
</P>
<P>
   With 11 years of Spanish classes lurking somewhere in my brain,
I supposed that a quick refresher in vocabulary and verb tenses
would do the trick. In search of instant gratification (as always),
I ended up on the Internet, where a number of sites offered free
instruction.
</P>
<P>
   My first stop was at Language Connect (www.languageconnect.com),
to take a simple and easily digestible daily vocabulary lesson.
Click on the language you want to learn, and the site serves up
four words, along with sentences to put each in context. For
instance, I learned that the Spanish phrase for ``runway'' was
``pista de aterrizaje,'' and read the sentence, ``There was a lot
of snow on the runway,'' a potentially useful excuse for lost
luggage.
</P>
<P>
   But the bite-size taste of Spanish wasn't enough, so I went
searching for a full-fledged online course. I found a free one at
www.learnplus.com, a new site still under construction. I had high
hopes for the beginner's Spanish class after exchanging e-mail with
the instructor, Monica Marra.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that learning on line can be one of the best ways to
learn because the Internet is `the' interactive media,'' Ms. Marra
wrote. She explained that I would be able to communicate directly
with her after I created a personal home page on the site. She
would post answers to my e-mail questions and corrected versions of
my quizzes on my home page.
</P>
<P>
   I started the first section of the course, which covered
valuable topics for people traveling with small children, like how
to say, ``Where is the hotel bar?'' Next to each item in a grammar
or vocabulary lesson sat a little icon; I could click as many times
as I wanted to hear the words spoken aloud. While that was no
different from the sort of feature available with self-instruction
foreign language software, it was a useful reinforcement of the
text-based lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, I was never able to use the interactive aspect of
the site, the home page feature. The first problem: the site
refused to recognize the password I chose. As a result, all the
answers I had typed to a 30-minute quiz were lost.
</P>
<P>
   Later, after Ms. Marra explained via e-mail that my password
contained a ``special character which can then interfere with the
processing of data,'' I chose another, special-character-free
password and took the quiz again. A few hours later, Ms. Marra
informed me that she had posted quiz corrections on my personal
home page. But this time, I was unable to gain access to my home
page at all.
</P>
<P>
   Deciding that I might be better off dealing with a
well-established purveyor of foreign language instruction, I went
to www.berlitz.com, where I found common phrases in 15 languages,
travel and culture tips for 30 countries but no online language
courses. That perplexed me; after all, Berlitz has been in the
business for more than a century and pioneered the use of
self-instruction tools in the pre-phonograph days, with language
lessons recorded on wax cylinders.
</P>
<P>
   I phoned Bernabe Feria, Berlitz's director of curriculum
development, to ask why the company was lagging when it came to the
Internet. ``The reason,'' he said, ``is that while the Internet is
fine for somebody like you, who is reviewing or trying to pick up a
handful of scattered languages, it still is not a useful enough
medium for teaching a language. The day is coming. But for now, the
Internet relies mainly on text-based teaching, which is not
interactive enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The most reliable way for novices to learn a foreign language,
confirmed Edward Scebold, executive director of the American
Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages, is to study with
another person, face to face. ``You can't recreate the spontaneity
of that kind of teaching on the Internet,'' Scebold said. ``Think
of the give-and-take of an immersion classroom, where everyone
speaks the language all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, any time you go on line, you enroll in an immersion
course. But the subject is always the same: How Technology Works _
Or Doesn't. Passwords get rejected. Quiz answers get lost. You get
distracted from Spanish verb tenses by a more immediate lesson
about computer crashes.
</P>
<P>
   As a last resort, I queried an English-to-Spanish dictionary at
www.dictionaries.travlang.com. The search engine responded
immediately with the translations for ``dentist'' and ``bleeding,''
but when I asked for ``teeth,'' its answer was ``no matching
entries found.'' Will I be out of luck on the Baja Peninsula? Not
if I need to report a dentist bleeding on a snowy runway outside
the hotel bar.

SUN IS DEADLY ENEMY FOR 10-YEAR-OLD ARIZONA BOY   
 (ADV: RETRANSMITTING FOR THE MILWAUKEE JOURNAL-SENTINEL) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GILBERT, Arizona _
</P>
<P>
   ``Between the dark and the daylight,
</P>
<P>
   When the night is beginning to lower,
</P>
<P>
   Comes a pause in the day's occupations,
</P>
<P>
   That is known as the children's hour.'' &QL; 
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When night falls, the Collin Cassinat hour begins.
</P>
<P>
   As other children take cover from the darkness, Collin's
playtime is just beginning. Under the moonlight, he races his bike,
catches frogs, hunts bugs and exhilarates in his freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine is no friend to Collin. Exposures of just minutes would
cause his skin to redden, burn and blister. An overdose would kill
him.
</P>
<P>
   Collin, 9, is a child of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Born with a genetic disorder called xeroderma pigmentosum, in
which the cells of the body lack the ability to repair DNA damage
from ultraviolet rays, Collin's best chance for survival is to
avoid all sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Windows in his family's Gilbert home near Phoenix are tinted and
covered with blinds. The family van is outfitted with blackout
curtains. When Collin goes outside during the day, he is swaddled
head to toe in long sleeves, long pants and a cap with a flap in
the back that makes him look like the youngest soldier in the
French Foreign Legion. He huddles under a blanket.
</P>
<P>
   His parents, Cindy and Tony Cassinat, estimate their son is
exposed to no more than five minutes of sunshine a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad'' is how Collin describes his sheltered life. Yet he's a
bright, chipper youngster with an impish personality and no lack of
friends. Two little girls have appointed themselves his escorts
between school buildings when he is wrapped so tightly against the
sun he can't see through his protective garb.
</P>
<P>
   At recess, classmates vie for the chance to stay indoors with
Collin and play field hockey in the halls.
</P>
<P>
   He admits there are advantages to having XP.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get spoiled,'' he said with a grin, ``by my teacher, then my
mama, then my dad, then my principal.''
</P>
<P>
   Collin was once invited to a sleep-over at the Phoenix Zoo. Last
summer he went to Camp Sundown in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., where young
campers with XP enjoyed indoor activities during the day and played
outside long into the night.
</P>
<P>
   But sitting alone in a darkened van parked where he can watch
his sister's soccer practice, his eyes get a bit teary as he counts
down the minutes until sunset when he can break out of the van and
run free.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:34 p.m., the Collin hour begins.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Cassinat first noticed something alarming about her third
son in February 1989. Six weeks old, Collin had been sitting
outside in his stroller, bundled against the chill. The next day he
appeared to have eczema on his cheeks _ crusty, scabby, oozing
patches.
</P>
<P>
   With a little research, Cindy learned that sunlight could help
dry up eczema, so she took Collin outside again. When the
``eczema'' spread to his arms, her pediatrician prescribed a
cortisone salve.
</P>
<P>
   Diagnosis: Fair Irish skin. Treatment: Keep that boy out of the
sun.
</P>
<P>
   Collin spent his toddler years covered in sunscreen, playing
indoors or in the shade. He wore hats and long-sleeved shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``His skin was always dry and cracky a little bit,'' Tony
Cassinat said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Cindy read a newspaper article about Julian Nieves
Armenta, a 4-year-old Mexican boy being treated for XP at Maricopa
Medical Center and introduced at a University of Arizona medical
symposium. Multiple skin cancers covered his head and dotted his
eyeballs.
</P>
<P>
   Julian's condition, minus the numerous malignancies, sounded
remarkably like Collin's, Cindy thought.
</P>
<P>
   A UA dermatologist confirmed her suspicions. In 20 years of
practice in pediatric dermatology, Dr. Ron Hansen had seen just two
cases of XP. Julian was one. Collin was the other. Most doctors
don't see any.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 130 cases exist in the country, with an estimated
1,000 worldwide. Collin's is the only known case in Arizona, the
Cassinats say.
</P>
<P>
   Extreme freckling and photophobia _ severe discomfort in the sun
_ are the earliest symptoms. Those signs should be detected by age
1 or 2; then protection can begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking a noturnal person,'' Hansen said. ``Even a
minute or two of sun is enough DNA damage to have skin cancers.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunscreen is a puny weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a diagnosis, the Cassinats devoted themselves to
shielding Collin and instilled in him a sense of self-protection.
If someone opens a window or raises a shade, he'll cry out,
``You're killing me!'' Cindy said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, his cries are all too true.
</P>
<P>
   Undiagnosed and unprotected, children with XP usually die by the
age of 10. Protected, they can enjoy a life expectancy of about 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to his parents, Collin should have nearly a normal life
span, Hansen said: ``Collin will do much better. They were very
careful.''
</P>
<P>
   `NOT ONE TO MOPE'
</P>
<P>
   At Greenfield Elementary School, third-grader Collin blends in
with the other pupils. Only his UV-protective jacket gives him
away.
</P>
<P>
   Classroom windows are shaded, doors to the outside kept shut.
Collin spends his day inside, except for a weekly dash to the
building next door where art classes are held. That's when Diana
Hancock and Amanda Schreck guide their friend across campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``They help me so I don't run into stuff,'' Collin said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he does run into stuff _ the school, a tree. Sometimes
he trips. But he picks himself up and forges on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heis not one to mope,'' said his teacher, Sue Villa. ``He
doesn't feel sorry for himself. . . . He's a great little kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Villa takes Collin's special needs in stride. When the school
had its fall festival, she arranged indoor events. When the class
was mandated to clean up school grounds for a lesson in ecology,
she sent them to the cafeteria to pick up trash. She creates indoor
science projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always other ways to do it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Collin's future in school is uncertain. When he graduates to
Greenfield Junior High School in three years, his parents will have
to evaluate the facility for safety. Are windows tinted? Will all
classes be in one building?
</P>
<P>
   The Cassinats pray the next school will be as accessible as this
one. Cindy pulls her van as close as possible to the front door at
Greenfield Elementary, and Collin races in. Once, when the driveway
was blocked by a van collision, she commandeered the delivery
entrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope we can continue in a normal school,'' Tony said.
``That's very important.''
</P>
<P>
   If the junior high proves unacceptable, the Cassinats won't
hesitate to ask for modifications to protect their son. If the
building can't meet their needs, they'll be forced to home school
him, further isolating a boy who already lives a life apart.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A CALCULATED SCHEDULE
</P>
<P>
   The odds that Collin would be born with XP are phenomenal. To
produce the condition, both parents must be carriers of an aberrant
recessive gene. The chances of one partner being a carrier are one
in 250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, fate determined that Cindy, who grew up in California,
and Tony, a native of Wyoming, should meet, marry and have four
children. And one of those children would inherit a pair of XP
genes.
</P>
<P>
   News of that genetic fluke came as a blow, Tony says.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look at you and say your son can not go outside any more.
The next day we told the kids. That was hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Tony insists Collin's needs don't control their lives,
they live on a calculated schedule.
</P>
<P>
   On any given day, Cindy knows exactly when the sun sets. Collin
heads outside 10 minutes later. In the summer, that can be as late
at 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   There have been just two family vacations _ to Lake Tahoe in
1996 and to Camp Sundown last year.
</P>
<P>
   While his two brothers, Chris, 16, and Craig, 12, and sister
Courtney, 8, are hooked on sports, Collin shines in the chess club.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting a restaurant before sunset means wrapping Collin ``like
a soft taco,'' Cindy said, and ignoring the stares of patrons. The
explanation, when asked for, is that the boy is allergic to the
sun.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Collin's diagnosis, the family moved from a
1,100-square foot house into a new 4,000-square-foot house,
quadrupling Collin's indoor world. With living room furniture kept
sparse, he was allowed to roller skate inside until the wheels
became too dirty. Tracks in the carpeting were a small price to pay
to let a boy burn off energy.
</P>
<P>
   But Collin still lives life upside down. When other children are
playing outside, he's peering at them from his front window. When
he's outside, his friends are already in for the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sunshine world out there,'' Tony said. ``People open
their windows and let the sun shine in. This goes against what
society is brought up with.''
</P>
<P>
   Because XP is so rare, little scientific research is being done.
For the time being, treatment means vigilence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word is `no sun.' We make judgment calls on what is
worthwhile,'' Tony said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cassinats are scrupulous about checking Collin's skin for
suspicious spots. So far, he's had more than 30 removed; 20 were
cancerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're used to it,'' Cindy said, ``but we wish they wouldn't
keep popping up.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Collin is lucky. Some children with XP suffer blindness,
hearing loss, neurological impairment and mental retardation,
although the connection is unclear. Despite some minor learning
disabilities, Collin is smart and healthy.
</P>
<P>
   For a boy whose enemy is the sun, Arizona would seem the evil
empire. In truth, the Valley of the Sun is Collin's best friend.
Phoenix has no more ultraviolet rays than cloudy Seattle. Clouds do
not block UV rays.
</P>
<P>
   And where else could a boy play outside after dark all year
round? Not Minnesota. Not North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SUPPORT GROUP OF 1
</P>
<P>
   Because Collin is the only child with XP in Arizona, there is no
one with whom to commiserate. He is a support group of one.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy said, ``You're looking at XP-AZ right here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet (www.xps.org/) is the Cassinats' link to XP parents
across the country. At Camp Sundown, they learned families cope as
best they can with the rare illness, keeping abreast of the few
developments in the field.
</P>
<P>
   A UV monitor, which detects ultraviolet rays, can alert parents
to dangerous levels of sunlight. But it is an expensive tool the
Cassinats can't afford.
</P>
<P>
   Another promising innovation is a pint-size space suit developed
by NASA. When perfected, it will shield children from UV light
outdoors. Although several models have been constructed, however,
the XP Society has not yet endorsed any design, believing current
suits offer only a false sense of security.
</P>
<P>
   Collin tries to be patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants one,'' Cindy said. ``He asks for one all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing outside during daylight hours is still only a dream for
Collin.
</P>
<P>
   The reality can break a mother's heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get down,'' Cindy said, ``but I can just start
thinking about him and start crying.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never ask, `Why us?' '' she said, with a smile she's been
practicing for a decade, sustained by the words of a friend who
told her, `` `He's here for a very important reason. He has this
disease for a very important reason.' ''
</P>
<P>
   After sunset, those reasons mean little to a boy at play. Collin
has captured a toad, and in his victory, the child of the night
comes alive. &QL;

STROLLING THROUGH GREAT BUILDINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like literature and art, architecture has a way of transporting
a modern observer back to the past, allowing you to see not only
what the creators were seeing, but also, in many cases, what they
were thinking as well.
</P>
<P>
   Tours of historic buildings are popular _ the Tower of London,
an ancient, infamous fortress dating back 1,000 years, is a top
draw for visitors to England.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of sites devoted to history and architecture on
the Web, but one of the most detailed and involving is Great
Buildings (www.greatbuildings.com), the online counterpart to the
Great Buildings Collection CD-ROM (published by Van Nostrand
Reinhold).
</P>
<P>
   The disk, a 650-megabyte repository of photos, video clips, 3-D
models and historical text devoted to more than 750 important
architectural structures, has been available for Macintosh
computers since 1994. A Windows version is under development.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Buildings Web site offers quite a bit to see and can
prove quite useful if you don't feel like fighting hordes of
tourists (or getting out of your pajamas) to catch a glimpse of the
Taj Mahal. The site might also prove useful as a research tool for
children, especially when little Benjamin suddenly remembers that
his report on the Parthenon is due the next day.
</P>
<P>
   The site is well organized, and you can search for specific
buildings by name, architect, country of location and architectural
style (neolithic to neovernacular). Each link to a particular
building reveals a page with basic information and pictures,
biographical information about the architect and commentary on why
the building is notable.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the building, some pages offer more detailed
observations about the structure, like dimensions and historical
trivia. (``In the late sixth century, the Parthenon was converted
to a Christian church.'') Each building's page contains a list of
sources for further reading, as well as a link to the online
bookseller Amazon.com if you want to go all the way.
</P>
<P>
   One of the great things about Great Buildings is that you can
also download free 3-D models of more than 65 of the buildings
listed on the site. A link to free software for viewing 3-D models
is also provided.
</P>
<P>
   Design Workshop Lite for both Windows and Macintosh, by Artifice
(www.artifice.com), is a stripped-down version of the popular
Design Workshop Classic and Design Workshop Pro software used by
architects, graphic designers and 3-D design professionals. The
free Lite version download is between 4 and 6 megabytes, which
could be time-consuming if you have a slow modem, but the program
can also be ordered on CD-ROM from the site for $20.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have the software, the site provides clear instructions
on how to download and view the 3-D models. The 3-D files are
fairly quick downloads themselves, averaging about 250 kilobytes,
and when you uncompress them on your hard drive, they expand to
about 1 megabyte each.
</P>
<P>
   Models of Chartres Cathedral in France, King's College Chapel in
Cambridge, England, and the Piazza di Spagna in Rome can be found
on the list, along with many others. Modern structures like the
Azuma House in Osaka, Japan, and the Vietnam War Memorial in
Washington are also rendered as 3-D models. Notable New York sites
include the Empire State Building, the Brooklyn Bridge and the
Chrysler Building.
</P>
<P>
   The building models are beautifully rendered in simple, textured
3-D images, and you can use your mouse to explore the buildings
from all angles, even from inside. A Wireframe option lets you
electronically remove the building's surface material for a peek at
the infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Design Workshop Lite provides a surprising number of features.
Users can adjust lighting and elevation and easily choose different
views of the building. Once within the model, you can move about as
if you were walking through the building, watching walls and doors
go by as you stroll along with your mouse.
</P>
<P>
   The model for the Globe Theater, Shakespeare's stage in
17th-century London, is particularly well done, allowing you to
move through the aisles to the stage floor itself. The original
theater had no official restrooms for its 3,000 patrons and burned
down in 1613 when a prop cannon blew up during a performance of
``Henry VIII.''
</P>
<P>
   This 3-D model might just be the next best thing to being there
_ and it is much safer than a visit to the original would have
been.

WOMEN SLIP BACK INTO '50S-ERA SLEEPWEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jammies and matching robes just like Kitten,
Princess and Shortcake wore.
</P>
<P>
   Saucy baby dolls like Rizzo had in ``Grease.''
</P>
<P>
   Peignoirs with movie-star glamour.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget those plaid Lanz nighties that Grandma always
gave us.
</P>
<P>
   Jeepers, it's the '50s all over again, and we're playing records
at a pajama party in ``Pleasantville.'' Only this is real life, not
Nick at Nite.
</P>
<P>
   Wait. Maybe all those black-and-white sitcoms like ``Leave It to
Beaver,'' ``Father Knows Best'' and ``I Love Lucy'' are affecting
our sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles fashion consultant and author Patty Fox says movies
and TV have always influenced what we wear, and right now we're
stuck in the '50s. ``Young women have been watching all these old
TV shows, and it's all new to them. We've already had the glasses
(cat's-eye frames), the twinsets ... now it's flannel pajamas and
its sexy sister, the marabou-trimmed baby doll,'' Fox explains.
</P>
<P>
   The baby doll (a short nightie with matching panties) is
starting to show up in numerous department stores, but its
headquarters is Frederick's of Hollywood. According to Frederick's
spokeswoman Ellen Appel, the flirty baby doll in sheer nylon,
trimmed with fluffy marabou feathers, lace or sequins were inspired
by the comedy ``Austin Powers.''
</P>
<P>
   And the 20th anniversary of ``Grease'' helped fuel the fire.
</P>
<P>
   But TV's ``Ally McBeal'' got women of all ages to rethink
old-fashioned pajamas. Says Fox: ``Ally McBeal is a great
character. She's vulnerable yet appealing, and her look is fresh.
She's the Audrey Hepburn of the '90s. And as Audrey once said,
she's not as innocent as her doe eyes suggested.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, lingerie sales are up as high as 20 percent from last
year, reports Women's Wear Daily. And the NPD Group American
Shoppers Panel report for retailers also notes gains, suggesting
that women have tired of the athletic-inspired sleepwear and
oversized T-shirts they've worn for so long.
</P>
<P>
   At Robinsons-May stores, sales are consistent with national
trends. Says company spokeswoman Milinda Martin: ``Playful novelty
print pajamas are doing exceptionally well with Generation ``I was
at our holiday party and silent auction last week and was amazed at
how many grown women were bidding on a pair of those new `Ally
McBeal' pajamas from Bloomingdale's.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they know Santa won't be bringing them. ``Men tend to buy
overtly sexy lingerie, not flannel,'' Martin says.

FOR BACK-SEAT POTATOES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 BY KARRIE JACOBS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Given how screen-saturated our world has become, it
shouldn't be a surprise that the family car now comes with a video
monitor so that back-seat passengers don't have to rely on the
passing landscape _ plain old reality _ for entertainment. The
recent commercial for an Oldsmobile minivan, the first car with
factory-installed video entertainment, was just an affirmation of
the inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Made by the Leo Burnett advertising agency in Chicago, the
commercial for the Oldsmobile Silhouette Premiere is a Spielbergian
appeal to the emotions. The spot begins with a string of title
shots from beloved movies: ``Gone With the Wind,'' ``Casablanca''
and ``National Velvet.'' Then the edge of a remote control slips
into the frame. The view shifts, and we see a toy dinosaur and a
robot resting on a carpeted floor between two diminutive pairs of
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as we watch a close-up of a freckle-faced boy and girl
laughing with delight, followed by a shot of little hands digging
into a sack of popcorn, the announcer declares, ``Movies take us
places beyond our imagination.'' Slowly, the camera pulls back to
reveal that the movie screen is actually mounted on the ceiling of
a minivan. The Hollywood scene of horses cantering through grassy
meadows is superimposed on a spectacular Western landscape viewed
through the windshield. ``Now, you can take those movies to places
you never thought possible,'' the announcer proclaims.
</P>
<P>
   While television sets have long been featured in custom vans and
limousines, they may soon become a routine component of family
cars. ``What we've been trying to do with Silhouette is meet the
needs of the individual passengers in the car,'' said Marcus
Helman, assistant brand manager for the Oldsmobile minivans. ``We
wanted to provide all passengers with something to do on the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   Thin LCD screens, like the ones mounted on the backs of airliner
seats, are becoming more affordable, and car makers are desperately
looking for ways to distinguish their minivan from all the other
Caravans, Odysseys and Windstars on the market. Nissan, for
instance, is now offering to throw in a $995 floor-mounted video
console free with the purchase of a Quest minivan.
</P>
<P>
   Audiovox, the Long Island concern that manufactures the Nissan
console, also sells a $2,000 Mobile Video Flipdown Pod, much like
the one shown in the Oldsmobile commercial, that can be installed
in almost any car. Tom Malone, the group vice president for
Audiovox's mobile electronics division, insists that ``rear-seat
entertainment is the hottest category we have by a long shot.'' If
you believe Malone, it won't be long before we see cars parked on
New York City streets with hand-lettered signs taped on the windows
that say, ``No TV.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No question,'' Malone said. ``Now that these vehicles are so
comfortable, the only luxury missing is in-vehicle entertainment.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dennis Troy, a salesman for Movin On Sounds and Security, a
dealer of Audiovox products, arrived at my door in a Lincoln
Navigator, a sport utility vehicle so large that it could swallow a
Honda Civic whole. ``It's my showroom,'' he informed me. Troy
demonstrated how a thin screen was secreted in an oval ceiling
panel, where another car might have a dome light. The video deck
was tucked away under an armrest between the front seats. And the
Nintendo system was stashed behind the back-seat armrest.
</P>
<P>
   I hopped in the back and, parked on a noisy Manhattan avenue,
sank into the Lincoln's plush Leatherette seat and played
Nintendo's Chopper Attack, while Troy cranked up the sub-woofer so
that the game's sound effects made the whole car rumble. Sealed
inside this big car, nestled in the virtual world, I was as
oblivious to my surroundings as one of those freckle-faced kids in
the Oldsmobile advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, what's intriguing about the Silhouette Premiere
commercial is that it tries to have it both ways. Late in the
60-second spot, Mom, seated in the front seat, swivels around and
mouths ``look'' to her spellbound children. The sister and brother
remove their headphones, peer out the window and gape in
astonishment at horsemen galloping alongside the minivan. The
message, apparently, is that watching a movie has enriched the
children's appreciation of the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, this could be the very first time these
particular children have ever bothered to look out a window. They
may be mistaking the real world for a video they've never seen
before.

`FANTASTIC MR. FOX': GREAT CHILDREN'S BOOK, MEDIOCRE OPERA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The world is littered with great children's books
that failed to make the transition into great operas. Now Roald
Dahl's ``Fantastic Mr. Fox'' is joining the list, thanks to a work
commissioned from the composer Tobias Picker and presented by the
Los Angeles Opera. I just hope all those fifth graders in Tuesday
night's audience will accept a reassurance. Opera can be thrilling
and terrifying. You can hear things you never thought possible.
It's not always a matter of being vaguely polite (or not) to the
adults who took you along.
</P>
<P>
   The original story is strong, and it works. Like much of Dahl's
writing, it has an engaging coarseness: it reeks of greasy chicken
dishes and freshly dug soil. These smells do not go forward into
Picker's score, which is thoroughly nondescript. He rises
reasonably to the occasion for the ditty that the four fox cubs
sing about the three farmers who are the fox family's enemies, but
every other ball he drops. In an opera whose main characters are
nocturnal animals, and whose action unfolds after dark, the night
sounds are disappointingly tame. Worse, foxes, hedgehogs, rats and
humans all sound much the same. The music is woefully
undercharacterized.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, there is not much help from the libretto, by Donald
Sturrock, who is also responsible for the lame direction. The text
is wordy and sentimental. It misses all the opportunities it
creates. The mechanical digger with the soul of an artist, for
instance, could have been a funny and real operatic character, but
here she just brings one smile in the middle of the pervasive
embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Picker gives her tuba and trombones, with more than a suggestion
of Wagner's Fafner, but otherwise his music deals in small change.
A couple of times it provides atmospheric, if rhythmically flaccid,
writing for a children's chorus of tree spirits. There is, rather
oddly, a good bit of showy if ungainly counterpoint. Nothing seizes
the imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the animal costumes, after designs by Gerald Scarfe, are
delightful, especially those for the mole, badger and porcupine.
Philip Hill gives the fox cubs neat animal movements. There are
also some wastefully good performances, notably from Gerald Finley
in the title role and from Jamie Offenbach as Farmer Bean. Apart
from anything else, these two are the only members of the cast who
get the words across; they are also both lusty singers, and
Finley's lyrical baritone is good to hear even in indifferent
music.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Ash conducts. The run ends on Tuesday.

ART CRITIC SEES THE LIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Being an art critic is a lot easier than being a mommy, I'm
thinking as I drive the boys around to look at Christmas
decorations. Trickier still, I'm presently blending both roles,
trying to entertain the boys while applying professional criteria
to light displays.
</P>
<P>
   What I quickly discover is that their appreciation of holiday
lights depends on what they manage to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow, look at those red lights over there, guys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Which lights, Mommy?''
</P>
<P>
   Or:
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were some interesting lights, Mommy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh. I didn't notice them.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the boys like things they see _ and I see things
I like. Which is kind of the way it is when I look at art.
</P>
<P>
   But, this being the holiday season, I'm perhaps even more
willing than usual to stretch my definition of art (and good art,
at that) to include any number of Christmas decorations _ as
site-specific installations or folk art or whatever. About the only
things I won't accept are decorations that make homes look like
upscale boutiques, or installations that include those ``chasing''
lights (which make me dizzy).
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, eclecticism is the rule.
</P>
<P>
   There's a plain colonial-style house _ dark red brick,
white-painted trim, little if any shrubbery _ that looks as lovely
during the daytime as it does after dark. This is because it
doesn't rely extensively on lights. The residents have used boughs
and wreaths of greenery, in addition to lighting so simple that
it's almost stark. The green boughs interact beautifully with the
crisp geometry of the house. At night, the lights add to, but don't
overpower, the general effect. If the Puritans did much decorating
for Christmas, it would have been like this.
</P>
<P>
   Cynics might sniff and say this house is in excessively good
taste. But I don't think that's the issue. The owners' choice of
house and perfectly suited decoration reflect personal aesthetic
integrity.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for an informally designed, vaguely ranch-style
house with an informal but well-informed display of lights. There
are precisely placed miniature lights along the eaves, as well as
lights wrapped around the trunks of several trees. With one
exception, the trees are wrapped in single colors. The exceptional
tree is wrapped in multicolored lights, recapitulating each of the
other color themes.
</P>
<P>
   There is just enough contrast between the fine, straight lines
of light along the roof and the thick, organic sculptural forms
created by the wrapped trees. Just enough to let us know that,
informal as the arrangement is, it doesn't lack thought.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's a big, white house with neo-classical overtones but
no real architectural integrity. Still, it's obviously comfortable
being what it is.
</P>
<P>
   And so are the lights and lighting fixtures decorating it. You
cannot beat this house for robust exuberance. It has conical
``trees'' made entirely of lights. Santa and his sleigh (with eight
tiny, wire reindeer) about to take off from the side yard. Live
oaks wrapped with lights. Lights everywhere. If that austere
colonial house is the Vermeer of holiday decoration, this is the
Leroy Neiman. Another example of aesthetic integrity, of choice of
decoration mirroring choice of house.
</P>
<P>
   But there are countless examples of totally incongruous holiday
decorations _ and that's where critical objectivity falters.
Because these are houses where the decorations are so piled on that
they take over the house, where the fantasy element of lights and
statues eclipses the reality of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Those are displays where heartfelt, personal enthusiasm rushes
in.
</P>
<P>
   While looking at lights in north Fort Worth the other night, I
see a house with lights along the eaves, lights draped from the
fence, with a blue-lighted star at the apex of the roof and a
rotund plastic Santa (illuminated from within) on the tiny roof.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of blocks farther, I see a house with a few strands of
lights, randomly draped, and the word ``Jesus'' spelled out in
miniature white lights carefully affixed to the chain-link fence.
``Bravo,'' I think to myself.
</P>
<P>
   From a critical standpoint, I suppose I'm choosing content over
form. This is a nearly artless arrangement, and here I am homing in
on the message.
</P>
<P>
   But the next day, when I return to locate the house, I realize
what a seamless fusion of form and content this truly is. That's
because, in daylight, I can barely make out the word on the fence.
How fitting, I think, that the Light of the World is visible only
in the darkness.
</P>
<P>
   I drive a little farther, and that's when I find the decorations
that I still can't understand, critically or personally.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny house has seen better days. But its yard is filled with
brightly painted decorations as well as everyday household stuff,
mud and what looks like rubbish. There is so much going on I don't
even see the Nativity display at first. Each of the figures looks
as though it has been hand-cut from plywood, then given a coat of
white paint. The details of each, including facial features, were
drawn on by hand.
</P>
<P>
   What would it look like by night, I wonder. So I go back with
the boys. If I hadn't rather carefully figured out the location by
daylight, though, I never would have found it. There are no lights,
just the ghostly Nativity and glimmers of candy canes placed in
neat rows.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, if it weren't for a couple of wooden trusses stacked
out front, I'd overlook it entirely. But I see it and don't know
what to think. So I stop the truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is it, Mommy?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure, Jack. It's sort of like decorations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, I think, maybe it's sort of like art.

TRAVEL BOOKS HELP FILL HOLIDAY WISH LISTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
and SYD KEARNEY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Looking for that last-minute holiday gift for the traveler on
your shopping list?
</P>
<P>
   Give them the world: an atlas.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Eartha World Travelog'' (DeLoreme, $19.95) is especially
appealing. This large-format atlas showcases 192 countries and uses
satellite imaging to convey geographical features as well as cities
and borders. The maps are augmented with clever and well-researched
charts that offer historical and insightful information.
</P>
<P>
   Once the traveler has chosen a vacation destination, he or she
will want to know when to go. And whether to take an umbrella or
overcoat. Fodor's ``World Weather Guide'' (Random House, $17.95),
compiled by E. A. Pearce and C. G. Smith, offers charts with
climate breakdowns for major cities in more than 200 countries
organized in an A to Z format. A glossary of weather-related terms
is included. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Here are some other new or updated titles worth considering:
</P>
<P>
   Near the beginning of Bill Bryson's wonderful ``A Walk in the
Woods'' (Broadway Books, $25), the author is reunited with old
buddy Stephen Katz, now seriously out-of-shape, and you realize
than their quest to hike the 2,100-mile Appalachian Trail will be
anything but routine. ``He (Katz) indicated his bag on the carousel
_ a green army surplus duffel _ and let me pick it up,'' writes
Bryson. ``It weighed at least 75 pounds. He saw my look of wonder.
`Snickers,''' he explained. ``Lots and lots of Snickers.'' Laughs
abound throughout this 276-page book, but Bryson also captures the
beauty and wonder of the region's forests and mountains. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; _ Paris's cafes and bistros are at the heart of that romantic
city's personality and appeal. New York Daily News restaurant
critic Daniel Young focuses on ``rendezvous and recipes'' in ``The
Paris Cafe Cookbook'' (William Morrow, $24). Young infuses both
insight and wit into essays on 50 ``people-percolating
properties.'' Among dozens of recipes, he tells how to re-create
the Clown Bar's mussels and zucchini soup, Cafe Very's salmon with
coconut milk, Le Cafe Marly's tomato and goat cheese cake and Cafe
Cannibal's bricks (paper-thin sheets of pastry) with raisins,
cucumbers and onions. This hard-cover volume is a keeper. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; _ At the time of his death on July 4, 1997, longtime CBS ``On
the Road'' correspondent Charles Kuralt was working on a series of
vignettes collectively called ``An American Moment.'' They have now
been edited and organized by Peter Freundlich, Kuralt's friend and
collaborator, to make up ``Charles Kuralt's American Moments''
(Simon &AMP; Schuster, $22). Kuralt had a knack for introducing us to
one-of-a-kind people and places, and here we meet hex sign painter
Johnny Claypoole, broom maker Bob Funke, doll restorer Irving Chais
and 10-year old ``Trombone Shorty.'' Kuralt covers American
dreamers, shrines, heirlooms and much more; it's not heavy reading,
but spend just five minutes with this book and chances are you'll
be touched. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   _  &LR; A city has never been more thoughtfully photographed than in
``Timeless New York'' (Universe, $19.95). Paul Coughlin's
sepia-toned images offer a sentimental perspective on such
well-known landmarks as Trinity Church, Chinatown and Central Park.
The intimacy and the romance of the country's largest city is
captured in photographs such as one of lovers kissing in Greenwich
Village. Complementing the photos are the author's concise but
illuminative text and a thoughtful selection of quotes by some of
the city's most famous admirers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Karen Foulk of Sugar Land, a surburb of Houston, has written
two guides geared to families: ``147 Fun Things to do in Houston''
($12.95) and ``101 Fun Things to do on the Texas Coast'' ($13.95).
Both are published by Into Fun Company Publications. The guides
offer helpful information such as opening hours, fees and contact
numbers for scores of appealing attractions.
</P>
<P>
   _ For a not-so-subtle nudge toward an idyllic escape for two,
consider ``Bed &AMP; Champagne: World's Top Romantic Holidays'' (Boru
Publishing, $14.95), Bradley S. O'Leary's newly updated edition of
his 1997 volume. O'Leary assesses such diverse gems as Madewood
Plantation, a Greek Revival Mansion overlooking Bayou Lafourche
halfway between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, La.; Poppies Samui's
two-dozen beachside cottages in Koh Samui, Thailand; and the
elegant Turnberry Hotel in Scotland. Included are 201 destinations
from 40 states, the District of Columbia and 38 foreign countries.
You won't find photographs in this soft-cover publication, but each
destination report is preceded by verses of romantic poetry.
</P>
<P>
   _ We're enchanted with Abrams Publishers' ``Art of the State''
series. Its four new titles _ Vermont, Arizona, New York and
Louisiana _ are filled with tasty cultural tidbits such as images
of people, architecture and folk art. The tiny tomes ($12.95 each)
pay tribute to the state's history, literature and musical
traditions. Also, each guide is well served with lists of native
sons and daughters, attractions and events.
</P>
<P>
   _ Golfing continues to grow as a popular vacation activity, and
several books point to the best resorts and public courses. Among
them: the second edition of ``Golf Resorts: Where to Play in the
USA, Canada, Mexico, Costa Rica and the Caribbean'' (Hunter Travel
Guides, $16.95) by Jim and Barbara Nicol; and the ``Econoguide Golf
Resorts and Courses USA `98-'99'' (Contemporary Publishing, $16.95)
by Corey Sandler. Sandler's volume is accompanied by more than
$1,000 worth of discount coupons. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Bookshelves are crammed with consumer-tip books, and many
offer helpful advice that may apply to your individual needs. Among
comprehensive guides, it's hard to go wrong with the new second
edition of ``Insider Travel Secrets You're Not Supposed to Know''
(Best Fares, $19.95). Tom Parsons, editor of Best Fares Discount
Magazine, covers almost all aspects of the travel industry in this
447-page volume. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   _  &LR; For the coffee table: Celebrating a quarter-century of
publishing, Lonely Planet has produced its first large-format
illustrated book, ``Chasing Rickshaws'' (Lonely Planet
Publications, $24.95). Text is by Tony Wheeler, the well-respected
firm's founder, with 238 color photographs by Richard I'Anson. The
two men journey throughout Asia to explore the fascinating
development and variety of the rickshaw, born in Japan in the 1880s
and still utilized _ along with the cycle-rickshaw _ as an
important form of transportation. Emphasis is not only on distinct
designs but on fascinating people _ rickshaw pullers, riders,
manufacturers, artists _ whose roles are beautifully captured in
words and photos.
</P>
<P>
   _ Photojournalist Bill Bachman spent more than two years
exploring the Australian Outback, and his 256-page hard-cover
``Australian Colors'' (Amphoto Art, $35), with additional text by
Tim Winton, provides extraordinary images of the people and
landscape that make that continent's interior so distinct. The text
is no mere afterthought; it blends history, culture and humor in
helping readers gain insight into life in the Outback.
</P>
<P>
   _ Treasured artworks, gourmet cuisine and one of the world's
most fascinating regions share the focus in ``Matisse: A Way of
Life in the South of France'' (Rizzoli International Publications,
$40), another deluxe hard-cover volume. Gilles Plazy's text and
Jean-Bernard Naudin`s photographs help readers understand why life
along the French Riviera captivated and inspired artist Henri
Matisse early in this century. Matisse's paintings are juxtaposed
with the actual settings depicted in them. Matisse also was greatly
influenced by the region's foods, and Coco Jobard contributes 60
recipes _ among them eggplant caviar, pastilla with almonds and
pigeons and roasted pineapple with cinnamon _ that reflect the
Provencal and Russian specialties popular when the artist lived in
the region.
</P>
<P>
   _ Small but significant: If you need a stocking-stuffer for your
world traveler, go for the Berlitz pocket guides. These full-color
guides pack a lot of information into a tiny package. In addition
to attractions and history, the books offer detailed maps, helpful
translations and tips on shopping and dining. The series covers
more than 100 destinations; the two newest titles are Munich,
Germany, and Edinburgh, Scotland. Both are priced at $8.95.
</P>
<P>
   _ Show a loved one how much you care with the terrific ``Safety
and Security for Women Who Travel'' (Travelers' Tales, $12.95).
Authors Sheila Swan and Peter Laufer share what they call the
triple-A's of travel safety: attitude, awareness and attention. The
book covers topics ranging from how to spot a scam artist to coping
with your fears in a foreign place. Its anecdotes remind us of the
Jewish proverb: No matter what happens, travel gives you a story to
tell.
</P>
<P>
   _ No kid stuff here: In ``The Grown Up's Guide to Running Away
from Home'' (Ten Speed Press, $11.95), Roseanne Knorr suggests ways
to turn the dream of living abroad into a reality. The emphasis is
on practical tips: how to choose a destination, handle finances,
obtain health information, find house-sitters and pack and dress
for months away from home. Knorr encourages the hesitant: ``As you
hoist your backpack (well, OK, roll-on luggage), just tell the kids
who look on enviously that, after all these years, it's your turn
for adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   _ For the history buff on your gift list, look at
``Archaeological Mexico'' (Moon, $19.95). Author Andrew Coe has
written this first-edition guide that encourages archaeological
adventures to some of Mexico's more obscure and inaccessible ruins.
Comprehensive historical and archaeological information is
supplemented with practical travel tips. Coe also is anxious to
separate fact from the folklore that has surrounded Mayan culture.
</P>
<P>
   _ Another new Moon title is ``Colonial Mexico'' ($18.95) by
Chicki and Oz Mallan. It's subtitle says it all: ``A Traveler's
Guide to Distinctive Lodging, Dining and Shopping in Historic
Districts and Artisans' Communities Throughout Mexico.'' Whew.
</P>
<P>
   _ An oldie but goodie is Rick Steves' ``Mona Winks'' (John Muir,
$19.95) and an updated fourth edition is just hitting bookshelves.
Written by Steves and Gene Openshaw, the irreverent, fun-to-read
guide steers visitors through Europe's top museums, including the
British Museum and the Prado. Intimated by the Louvre? You won't be
after reading ``Mona Winks.'' The 1999 edition of Steves' ``Europe
Through the Back Door'' (John Muir, $19.95), invaluable for
independent travelers, is also new on bookshelves.
</P>
<P>
   _ Author Lynn Cline has taken the guesswork out of planning a
tete-a-tete in Santa Fe. ``Romantic Days and Nights in Santa Fe''
(Globe Pequot, $15.95) offers 36 enticing and detailed itineraries.
Each getaway is themed. Among the options are ``A Spiritual
Soujourn,'' ``A Hiker's Paradise,'' and ``A Southwestern
Honeymoon.'' Travelers will appreciate Cline's inclusion of
practical information such as prices, Web sites and directions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also in Globe Pequot's ``Romantic Days and Nights'' series:
Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, New Orleans,
San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C.

HUMAN NATURE: WHERE HOLLIES ARE IN VOGUE ALL YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By ANNE RAVER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SWARTHMORE, Pa. _ It was my search for beautiful hollies that
led me to Swarthmore College, where I found hundreds of them
marching down a hill, like some jolly medieval procession heading
for the meadow. I followed along, looking for the best berries, the
bluest leaf and the secrets of how they grow.
</P>
<P>
   Swarthmore was founded by Quakers in 1864, and the 400-acre
campus includes 200 acres of native forest, a meandering stream
called Crum Creek, and the magnificent trees and plant collections
of the Scott Arboretum, founded in 1929 by Arthur Scott, class of
1895, and heir to the Scott Paper Co.
</P>
<P>
   If Scott felt a little guilty about all those trees that died
for toilet paper, more industrialists should do such penance.
Imagine spending four years studying your Shakespeare under a bur
oak planted in 1876, or seeing your first Sophocles in an
amphitheater terraced into a hilly woods with native poplars rising
like a great cathedral overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``They built the amphitheater around the trees, not the other
way around,'' said Andrew Bunting, the curator of the Scott
Arboretum, leading the way through the woods to the James Frorer
Holly Collection.
</P>
<P>
   Frorer, class of 1915, was an avid holly collector, and in 1974,
he offered the college $100,000 to adopt and move hundreds of
mature hollies from his home in Wilmington, Del.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took $64,000 just to move them, all balled and burlapped,
on flatbed trailers,'' Bunting said as he surveyed the collection,
which now includes about 1,000 shrubs and trees _ more than 300
kinds of hollies. ``Some had 10-foot rootballs.'' They were planted
on the south-facing slope, interspersed with dogwoods, whose white
blossoms set off the dark evergreens in spring.
</P>
<P>
   When you are intrigued by a plant, it's a good idea to visit an
arboretum or public garden with a good collection to compare the
color and shape of leaves and fruit, and the habits of the plants,
which in the case of hollies can sprawl along the ground or grow to
the regal height of 50 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the old American and English hollies here are 50 feet
tall and 20 feet across, and their lustrous evergreen leaves are
set off to perfection against the hardwood forest at the top of the
ridge, which protects them from the north wind. Picture those dark
greens against golden hickories in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Deciduous hollies, which are native to swamps, thrive in the
flood plain at the bottom of the hill. These are the hollies that
lose their leaves and parade their berries all winter on bare
branches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had storms where the water is 6 feet deep, and these do
quite well,'' Bunting said, standing in a grove of winterberry, or
Ilex verticillata Winter Red, whose gray branches were loaded with
bright red berries. Some varieties will grow as high as 12 feet,
but for small spaces, there's a cute five-footer called Red Sprite.
Deciduous hollies are quite stoloniferous, meaning they send out
shoots from underground, and if you have the space (or can't kill
them with an ax), let them expand into a natural grove. They hold
on to their berries straight through the winter, and the birds
don't eat them unless they get desperate.
</P>
<P>
   Sparkleberry is another good deciduous holly, reaching the
height of a small tree, with branches loaded with fiery red
berries. Tiasquam has bigger, orange-red berries growing more
sparsely along the stems. And Winter Gold has big, bright yellow
berries that look like sticks full of M&AMP;M's.
</P>
<P>
   The holly that really caught my eye was Ilex x koehneana San
Jose, which has a tall, conical habit with a dark green spiny leaf
similar to English holly, only much flatter and bigger, with
berries densely clustered along the stem. San Jose is hardy to Zone
6, which includes New York City, but this big holly can't be
crammed into a little bitty backyard.
</P>
<P>
   I also loved Ilex pedunculosa, or longstalk holly, with soft
leaves (no spines!) and berries dangling like little earrings from
inch-long stems. If hollies smoked cigarettes, this one would. It
looks great, Bunting says, espaliered against a wall.
</P>
<P>
   English holly, Ilex aquifolium, has dark, glossy leaves, with
spined, wavy edges and dark red berries. American holly, Ilex
opaca, has a more opaque leaf and orange-red berries. It's also
hardy to about minus 20 degrees, while English holly can take only
about minus 10 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Most hollies are dioecious, which means that plants have either
male or female flowers, and the female plants won't bear fruit
unless you have a male plant somewhere in the vicinity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't need the same species, but you need to make sure
they are blooming at the same time,'' Bunting said, so that bees
can carry the male pollen to the female flowers.
</P>
<P>
   The male plant can, in typical fashion, pollinate many females,
so you need only one, and it can be within a city block of its
harem.
</P>
<P>
   Deciduous hollies have three different bloom times, so
hybridizers have developed certain male pollinators that bloom at
the same time as the female plants. Southern Gentleman, for
instance, is supposed to pollinate Winter Red, and Rhett Butler was
designed for _ let me guess _ Scarlett O'Hara.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Rhett will also pollinate Sparkleberry,'' Bunting said as
we stared at a stand of bright red berries in the meadow.
Sparkleberry's other mate is Apollo. Who says botanists never have
any fun?
</P>
<P>
   The male plants can do fine in light shade, but if you want your
hollies to fruit, put them in the sun and give them rich,
well-draining, slightly acid soil (a pH of 6 to 6.5).
</P>
<P>
   Like most broad-leafed evergreens, hollies should be planted in
the spring to let roots get established before hot weather makes
the leaves transpire. If you plant in the fall, and then get a hot
spell, the undeveloped roots won't be able to compensate for water
lost through the leaves.
</P>
<P>
   The blue hollies (Ilex x meserveae), developed on Long Island by
Kathleen Meserve, are cold-hardy to minus 15 degrees. They have
spiny, lustrous blue-green leaves and shiny red fruits. But don't
count on a lovely habit or shape. The plants look as if they'd been
tortured. Better just to make wreaths. Try Blue Princess, which
grows to about 8 feet, if conditions are right, and Blue Prince,
her mate.
</P>
<P>
   There are far too many hollies to describe here, but the
Brooklyn Botanic Garden has a good $7.95 handbook on the family
(718-622-4433, ext. 274), with propagation techniques, information
on the Holly Society of America and source lists.
</P>
<P>
   Two mail-order nurseries with good holly varieties are
Fairweather Gardens, in Greenwich, N.J. (609-451-6261), and
Windrose Nursery, Pen Argyl, Pa. (610-588-1037). Both take cuttings
from the Scott Arboretum, so if you see one at the college that you
like, ask the nursery to propagate it.

<P>
   For the very busy, a virtual assistant can be helpful, even if
the three most widely available are all a little tricky to use.
Choosing among them depends on how much you are willing to pay,
what features make sense to you and, for now, where you live.
</P>
<P>
   Webley and Portico operate nationally with toll-free numbers;
long-distance phone charges are included in their prices.
</P>
<P>
   The cost depends mostly on how _ and how much _ you use them.
Webley's basic service fee is $9.95 a month, plus 15 cents for each
minute of use. Portico has a setup fee of $50, and its packages
range from $19.95 a month for 60 minutes of use to $149.95 for
1,300 minutes. Portico charges 15 to 20 cents for each additional
minute.
</P>
<P>
   That's a good deal for cellular phone users who would otherwise
pay additional charges for calls outside their service area.
</P>
<P>
   Wildfire Tries New Tactic
</P>
<P>
   Wildfire, once available only through office systems or for
individuals at $150 a month, is fighting its new competition by
trying to sell Network Wildfire through telecommunications
carriers. Pacific Bell Wireless is the only United States carrier
so far to test-market Network Wildfire, just beginning this month
in Los Angeles. (Network Wildfire is also available in Canada
through Bell Mobility, just in the Toronto area.)
</P>
<P>
   For customers who sign up for a cellular phone service plan for
$49 monthly or more, Pac Bell offers Wildfire for $20 more. That
includes four basic features (voice-activated dialing,
voice-controlled voice mail, call routing and address book) and 300
weekday minutes and 1,000 weekend minutes of both cellular and
Wildfire use.
</P>
<P>
   (All three services offer demonstrations and free trials: see
www.wildfire.com, www.portico.net and www.webley.com.)
</P>
<P>
   Not So Easy as It Sounds
</P>
<P>
   Do not expect to simply dial in and start talking. The services
recognize only a standard glossary of words and short, imperative
sentences like ``open my mailbox.''
</P>
<P>
   Even at that, all three regularly misunderstand callers who are
trying to track down a user. Callers can resort to touch-tone
options, but how many misunderstandings does it take before an
important caller gives up? And since Webley and Portico charge
subscribers by the minute, confusion between the caller and the
system makes for a much higher bill. The longer your Irish cousin
spends on the line trying to make Webley respond to his brogue, the
more it costs.
</P>
<P>
   May I Interrupt?
</P>
<P>
   Portico and Webley offer the most realistic experience of human
conversation, primarily because they allow you to interrupt the
computer at any time. By contrast, Wildfire still feels a lot like
voice mail. ``She'' forces users to wait for a beep signaling their
turn to talk and constantly repeats the user's response options.
</P>
<P>
   (You may want to strangle her after hearing Wildfire repeat
``What's it say, throw it away, next item,'' for the 17th time when
checking a long list of voice mail messages).
</P>
<P>
   Still, the voices are what turn all three into services instead
of mere machines. Wildfire and Portico use a friendly but assertive
female voice, giving the impression of an executive secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Webley's persona of a butler quickly conveys customer service,
but the fake British accent may wear out its welcome quickly.
Webley plans to remedy that early next year by allowing the option
of an American male or female voice.
</P>
<P>
   Portico will likewise introduce six more voice variations by the
end of 1999.

`VIRTUAL OFFICING' COMES IN FROM THE COLD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (js) 
 By FRANCES ANDERTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The advertising agency that urged Apple Computer
buyers to ``Think different'' has managed to be on the cusp once
again of an evolution in workplace design.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Chiat/Day led the charge into the brave new
world of ``virtual officing'' when its headquarters in Venice,
Calif., proved too small for a fast-expanding staff.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Chiat, the company's founder, equipped everyone with a
mobile phone, a laptop and a personal locker, and turned a problem
into a much vaunted workplace experiment. Now, just months shy of
the third millennium, TBWA/Chiat/Day, as the company is known, has
traded virtual communication for the real thing. It has just moved
into a new space in the Playa del Rey section of Los Angeles, where
everyone has his own desk and human interaction is key, in a plan
that draws from a model as ancient as telecommuting is new: the
city.
</P>
<P>
   The offices, in a vast warehouse designed for 500 employees by
Clive Wilkinson Architects, are a microcosmic ``Chiat town'' of
private and group work spaces and public ``streets'' and meeting
places that provide for every kind of company activity. Staff
members enjoy kaffeeklatsches in a ``Central Park,'' mingle on a
``main street'' and have a work space they can call home in
surrounding ``neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   This turnabout by the progressive company reflects a
``phenomenal shift in people's thinking'' about the state of the
art of the workplace, said Despina Katsikakis, director of DEGW, a
London-based international consultancy on workplace design. While
virtual officing is by no means dead _ TBWA/Chiat/Day staff members
still carry mobile phones and beepers, and connect by computer _
the latest experiment in breaking free from designs based on the
old hierarchical pecking order is what Ms. Katsikakis called
``community-based planning.'' It locates staff members in teams
(rather than on status-implied floors), offers private spaces and
includes clubby meeting areas.
</P>
<P>
   This approach is now being tried at corporations like Andersen
Consulting, in its offices around the world, and at Sun
Microsystems in Palo Alto, albeit in a more conservative style than
at TBWA/Chiat/Day.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has always experimented with architecture and the
workplace, starting with its move, in 1979, to the venerable
Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles. (``Jay didn't want the firm
to lose touch with the consumer,'' said Laurie Coots, the chief
marketing officer for the company.) That was followed, in the
mid-'80s, by a move to the bohemian Venice, first to a temporary
warehouse space and then to its own building, both landmark designs
by Frank Gehry.
</P>
<P>
   Chiat also had two of Gehry's fellow superstar architects, Rem
Koolhaas and Gaetano Pesce, create, respectively, London and New
York offices. In each space, the aim of the architecture was to
keep people stimulated and feeling part of a family, albeit one
with a steely drive and a yen for knowing self-promotion. In 1976,
the company ran an advertisement in Adweek declaring its pain at
losing a Honda account. Now, it is cheerfully revising its thinking
about what makes a workplace work.
</P>
<P>
   The virtual office ``sounded good in theory, but ultimately
violated human tenets,'' said Lee Clow, the company's chairman. He
added, ``People need a sense of place and belonging.'' The idea
behind the virtual office was that telecommuting would allow people
to work anywhere, anytime, and that they would use the outgrown
building only for teamwork. As it turned out, most staff members
needed or wanted to work under the same roof.
</P>
<P>
   Current and former employees paint a picture of harried workers
fighting over too-few desks, defiantly displaying family photos and
trying to stake out personal space in a place planned like a club.
``People felt like they were working in a cocktail party,'' Ms.
Coots said. The new place blends what the company sees as the best
of the previous environments. Yes, TBWA/Chiat/Day staff members
still share the airwaves. But now, Ms. Coots said, ``we share the
same air.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   From a vivid yellow exterior gatehouse, visitors enter a large
busy industrial-style space _ a playful version of Fritz Lang's
Metropolis. Youthful employees buzz about: up and down the mesh
stairs and balconies; along the wide ``main street'' of stacked
``cliff dwellings,'' Hollywood Squares-style, that are home to
pairs of art directors and copywriters who work as creative teams;
in Central Park, a ficus-lined internal plaza, and on the hallowed
basketball court, a symbol of the zest and competitiveness of the
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered around this town center are neighborhoods of project
dens: groups of desks enclosed by diaphanous spandex tent
structures for privacy and open-plan work areas with freestanding
aluminum work stations called Nests (for New Environment for
Strategic Tasking), one-legged desks with screens for acoustic and
visual privacy. (They are now manufactured by the agency in a
co-production with the office furniture giant Steelcase.) The cute
name refers to the very nesting instincts that virtual officing had
rejected and that are now being increasingly factored into office
planning nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   TBWA/Chiat/Day has rebounded from a bumpy patch in the mid-'90s,
during which it was sold to a holding company, the Omnicom Group,
was merged with TBWA and saw the departure of Jay Chiat, whose
demanding, inventive spirit, company members say, lives on in the
space and in the work.
</P>
<P>
   It was unanimously picked as agency of the year for 1997 by the
advertising trade magazines, and this year, it scored an Emmy for
its Apple Computer campaign, which features arresting images of
great achievers, stamped with the slogan ``Think different.''
</P>
<P>
   But how innovative is the new office? The design merges the
high-tech style popular in Europe, typified by Richard Rodgers' and
Renzo Piano's Pompidou Center, with the robust warehouse office
projects of Gehry and the late Frank Israel.
</P>
<P>
   While it may be striking and lively, with its jazzy cliff
dwellings, billowing tent structures, flying balconies, exposed
plywood partitions and touches of whimsy (like a bar made of
surfboards), it doesn't quite break the old pecking order. In
following the principles of good town planning, the company has, in
fact, introduced hierarchy, albeit of a more accessible kind than
the mahogany-paneled corner office of traditional corporate
America. Two company principals who once had spaces equal to
everyone else's now each have impressive suites overlooking Central
Park, and while creative pairs get prominent, private ``cliff
dwellings,'' most of the rest nest in the open-plan areas.
</P>
<P>
   And as for staying in touch with the consumer, the new
TBWA/Chiat/Day is an interior world. Viewless, located at the end
of a road of industrial buildings and bungalows (near where
Dreamworks is due to start construction), the office is currently
nowhere near cafes, shoe repairs, stores or pedestrians _ namely,
the stuff and stimuli of daily life.
</P>
<P>
   A former staff member, Rebecca Epstein, now a doctoral student
at the school of film and television at the University of
California at Los Angeles, said that she found it a somewhat
isolating experience. ``Because the light is the same all day long,
and you have no sense of time,'' she said, ``it's a little like a
casino.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the new artwork is self-reflective: a fish tank from
TBWA/Chiat/Day's Energizer bunny campaign, agency commercials
broadcast nonstop on a large screen over the basketball court,
sofas upholstered in Levi denim (Levi's jeans is a new client), and
a billboard featuring Picasso, one of the Apple ``Think different''
personalities.
</P>
<P>
   The all-seeing, all-knowing nature of the space, with its
mezzanines, walkways and glass-fronted cubicles, reminded one
visitor of the slightly totalitarian feel of a penitentiary. But an
employee who refused to be identified said the new offices are
``like a big playground.'' And she likes the fact that they are all
on one floor, which, she said, ``invites more interaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Bob Kuperman, the company's president, said that
some of the agency's best work was produced in its last space _
cocktail party or not. He cited the ``Think different'' campaign, a
provocative series of ads extolling television for ABC and the Taco
Bell talking chihuahua. ``There's something to be said for the fact
that the overcrowding did cause a high level of energy and creative
output,'' he said. A self-declared advocate of ``friction and
upset,'' Kuperman added that ``the company is right on the edge''
with its new quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in New York, the virtual office designed by Gaetano
Pesce, however gorgeous, sent some staff members over the edge.
Wilkinson says the agency has moved out of its overcrowded and
confusing space into new offices that he is designing. And where is
that new workplace? In the former bastion of the advertising elite,
the epitome of everything the old Chiat/Day repudiated: Madison
Avenue. Think different indeed.

SHADOWY SNAPSHOTS OF A NIGHTMARE DREAMSCAPE 
</HEADLINE>
   EDS: Publication note at end of review.  
(dal) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the title story of Ethan Coen's often funny, sometimes
disturbing collection, ``Gates of Eden,'' the protagonist, Joe
Gendreau, seems to have entered paradise of a sort. A weights and
measures inspector for the State of California whose job it is to
see that gas pumps are correctly calibrated and that Happy Burger's
Seven-Ounce Bun-Buster does in fact weigh 7 ounces, Joe gets a
complaint from a Miss O'Hara, who leaves her Brentwood address in
the message.
</P>
<P>
   When Joe shows up at the house, he is greeted by an attractive
Japanese woman in native dress whose name turns out to be Ohara.
She asks Joe in (``Come in a talk''), plies him with food and saki
(``Fussa we eat'') and invites him out to her garden for a swim and
some lovemaking. Joe reflects: ``We could be man and woman, in the
garden, without words, without shame. We could abide in beauty and
be one.''
</P>
<P>
   But later Joe wakes up hung over and covered with bee stings and
finds that he has been victimized by a blackmail scheme. The garden
turns out to be hell, costing him his job.
</P>
<P>
   Such wacky extremes pervade Coen's 14 stories, just as they do
the films he makes with his brother, Joel, among the better of
which are ``Blood Simple,'' ``Miller's Crossing,'' ``The Great
Lebowski'' and the superlative ``Fargo,'' which won the Academy
Award in 1997 for best original screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   At one end in the stories is the violence so familiar in the
films. In ``Fever in the Blood,'' a private eye, Victor Strang, has
one of his ears bitten off in an encounter with a thug. In ``Red
Wing,'' a husband details how his wife drove him to decapitate her.
In ``Have You Ever Been in Electric Ladyland,'' a slick-talking
record company executive describes all the people he knows who had
motives to break into his house and mutilate his dog.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these stories are chillingly grim. Others are pushed to
outrageous parody. In ``Cosa Minapolidan,'' a minor mafioso sets up
shop in Minneapolis, thinking the name of the city is Chippewa for
``New Naples.'' (``He missed his native Napoli.'') But he fails to
catch the attention of the citizens, whose ``stolid Northern stock
seemed immune to the great miseries and grand passions upon which
crime traditionally feeds.'' In ``Johnnie Ga-Botz,'' a rub-out goes
awry when the mindless assassin calls his boss for further
instructions on a wiretapped phone.
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme are several sensitive stories about growing
up Jewish in the Minneapolis area, where the author is from. These
tend to be more detailed and atmospheric, and although well written
and effective, they lack the manic punch of the crime stories and
parodies. Because of their relative artlessness, one can't help
suspecting them of being at least grounded in autobiography. Which
prompts a question raised also by the films: Why the Coens'
fascination with violence? Or to put it more cliched terms: How
come a couple of nice Jewish boys are so obsessed with organized
crime?
</P>
<P>
   Several of the stories in the collection offer clues. In ``The
Old Country,'' the narrator describes how a classmate created
anarchy at Hebrew school with his irreverent behavior until he was
sent home for punishment by his parents. The story doesn't spell
out what was done to tame the rebel so effectively. But the
narrator describes the fear his classmate's change inspired in him,
and he associates it with the void of Genesis. The story ends:
``Some forget that darkness, and the silence, and the chaos inside.
But despite what Scripture says, it will never be banished, for
without it there would be no horror, no misery, and no childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   In the collection's opening story, ``Destiny,'' the narrator,
Joe Carmody, begins by describing a terrible beating he takes in a
boxing match. Still eager to make it in the world of violence, he
accepts the job of photographing a mobster's unfaithful wife in the
act. Failing at this and facing a beating by the wife's lover, Joe
explains why he should be exempt: when he graduated from college,
he hoped to make it in a different world from the one he was headed
for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not here because of socioeconomic pressures, sir,'' he
explains. ``So accordingly I'm not really subject to the laws of,
uh, the socio _ uh, I don't know how to say this, sir. I'm _ I'm on
a safari. This is a safari, sir. I'm not one of the actual, er ...
animals, as it were.''
</P>
<P>
   His assailant responds, ``You speak from a core of confusion.''
He continues: ``You express yourself marvelously. However. It does
not hide your inner core. Which is confusion.'' And so Joe will be
beaten, he says, ``which is my last word.''
</P>
<P>
   The void is dangerous, and exploring it can get you hurt.
</P>
<P>
   In ``I Killed Phil Shapiro,'' the narrator ends his memoir of a
childhood in Minneapolis with a dream of meeting his father in the
desert:
</P>
<P>
   ``A figure staggers toward me, arms limply dangling, linked
footprints stretching back across the dunes. His white shirt glares
in the noonday sun and his glasses are dusted with flour-fine sand.
It is Phil _ or given the fluid identity which dreams neglect to
fix, it may be myself. I watch his approach and think about the
proud Hebrew with dark skin and hook nose who once gazed out upon
the many tents of his household. What connects me to him? Is the
figure I now see the rear guard of a parade of ghosts, successive
yet simultaneous, each generation melting into the next? What was
passed down from father to son, even to the generation of Phil
Shapiro, even unto our own day? What mysteries have been preserved,
what lost, and what transformed in our migrations from Canaan to
Eastern Europe to New York City and finally this far-flung garden
suburb?''
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, his ancestors could brave the void. But now
his people are lost and searching blindly. In ``Gates of Eden,''
Coen has sounded the jagged dissonance of the American experience.
As the descendant of wanderers, he tallies up the costs of a
journey that has yet to achieve the promised land.

RETIRING TEXAS DEMOCRAT CONDEMNS IMPEACHMENT MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A veteran House Democrat who called for the ouster
of two Republican presidents said Wednesday he was saddened that
the last act of his 37-year career in Congress will be voting on
the impeachment of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez of San Antonio said impeachment should
not be used by Congress to ``coerce private moral standards.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we start impeaching presidents for moral acts, it just
becomes a bottomless hole,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, 82, will be one of 40 House lawmakers leaving office
when the 105th Congress adjourns at the end of this year. First
elected in 1961, he is retiring due to health problems.
</P>
<P>
   He vowed in August to defend Clinton from impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider this one of the most important votes ever,''
Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is at stake here is the coequality of the branches of
government and the stability that that has given us through
history. Once that is gone, there is no end to the possible
reoccurrences and imbalance of government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gonzalez name has been synonymous with impeachment. He
called for President Ronald Reagan's ouster twice, when U.S. forces
carried out a rescue invasion in Grenada and when the Iran-contra
scandal came to light.
</P>
<P>
   President George Bush's military strike against Iraq in the Gulf
War also drew Gonzalez's ire and an impeachment resolution that
lacked support from the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were actually distorting the constitutional process in
the War Powers Act. In other words, my contention was that only
Congress could declare war, and unless the president receives
congressional approval, he would be declaring an unconstitutional
war,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton, Gonzalez accused the Republican leadership in the
House of engaging in a partisan ploy to overturn the president's
election in 1992 and re-election in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The motivation is to get control of the executive branch. The
people haven't given them that. They haven't been elected to that,
and they want that by hook or by crook,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   When the House convenes, it will debate impeachment charges that
Clinton committed perjury, obstruction of justice and abuse of
power in connection with the cover-up of his affair with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have a 228-207 majority in the House where a
majority vote in favor of one or more articles of impeachment would
trigger a Senate trial. If convicted by a two-thirds majority in
the Senate, Clinton would automatically be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   The dean of the Texas congressional delegation, Gonzalez called
the impeachment vote unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   ``It saddens me very much to return for this,'' Gonzalez added.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me the Congress is acting beyond its
constitutional authority. As much as I defend against executive
encroachment, I'm also sensitive about legislative branch excess,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we go into that swamp, there is no getting out.''

<ANNOTATION>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez will cast his ballots alongside the other 29 House
members from Texas in what was expected to be an all-but-party-line
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Only Democratic Rep. Ralph Hall has announced his intention to
join Republicans and vote to impeach.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Stenholm, a conservative Democrat who often votes
with the Republicans on social issues, was still undecided
Wednesday.

BOEHLERT SAYS HE WILL VOTE TO IMPEACH CLINTON FOR PERJURY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Sherwood Boehlert announced Wednesday that he
will vote to impeach President Clinton on at least charge _ perjury
before a federal grand jury _ but will wait until hearing the House
debate before making up his mind on three other accusations against
the president.
</P>
<P>
   Boehlert, a moderate New York Republican, said he believes
Clinton gave perjured testimony before the federal grand jury on
Aug. 17 about his sexual relationship with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he did not tell the truth and this is about truth and
law,'' Boehlert told a news conference, adding: ``It's something I
have arrived at after thoughtful deliberation.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the charge of perjury before a federal grand
jury, the president also is accused of perjury in the Paula Jones
civil lawsuit, obstruction of justice and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   Boehlert said Clinton has tried ``repeatedly to game the
judicial system.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the origins of this case, whatever the motives of his
questioners, the president had an obligation _ a legal and
constitutional obligation _ to tell the truth under oath,''
Boehlert said.
</P>
<P>
   Boehlert said deciding whether to vote for impeachment is the
most difficult decision he has made in his 16 years in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the past 10 days I have had sleepless nights,'' he said in
an interview. ``My wife reports that my sense of humor is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Boehlert compared Clinton to former President Richard Nixon who
resigned in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal as the House was
about to impeach him in August 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a rare moment of personal insight, Richard Nixon concluded
that he had destroyed himself by hating his enemies back,'' he
said. ``I am afraid that President Clinton fell into the same, all
too human, trap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blinded by his contempt for people who he thought were out to
get him, the president forgot his larger obligations to his office,
the Constitution and to the American people. He let his personal
feelings interfere with fulfilling his Constitutional
obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   Boehlert said none of the members of the Republican
congressional leadership have tried to sway his decision, which he
made after consulting judges and academics.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, he was elected to a ninth term in his upstate New
York district by winning 80 percent of the vote. Two years earlier,
Clinton won only 46 percent of the vote in the district.
</P>
<P>
   Boehlert said he has received over 2,500 calls since Friday,
with the callers evenly split on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Boehlert insisted impeachment ``is not a partisan issue. It is a
serious, sober, heart-rending debate on the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a vote of conscience _ my conscience is
nonnegotiable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Boehlert said the House had very few options _ to vote yes or no
on impeachment, but the Senate has ``different options and a broad
array of possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I am doing is sending this matter to the Senate, which
has a lot more flexibility than we do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Boehlert said he ``was enamored of'' a proposal by former
Massachusetts Gov. William F. Weld, a Republican support of the
president. Weld has proposed that Clinton be reprimanded and pay a
fine.
</P>
<P>
   Weld's proposal ``deserves the most careful consideration''
Boehlert said.

 &HT;    AOL voice plays Cupid in big-screen Net romance
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You've got Elwood.
</P>
<P>
   Right there, on the other end of the phone line: the voice that
launched thousands of chat room forays and uttered the unnaturally
upbeat phrase that comforts the lonely and annoys the already
overworked.
</P>
<P>
   The voice you hear whenever you log onto America Online. The one
so omnipresent, so chirpily there, it has to be computer-generated.
Right?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think I'm not real,'' Elwood Edwards, 49,
confirmed by phone from his Ohio home last week.
</P>
<P>
   Please. As if anyone could make this up. Nine years ago, Edwards
spoke three little words into a tape recorder at the small company
where his wife then worked. Now that same phrase is the title of a
big budget holiday movie, and Edwards, who has a speaking part (and
nothing else) in the film, got to schmooze with stars Tom Hanks and
Meg Ryan at last Thursday's glittering New York City premiere.
</P>
<P>
   In ``You've Got Mail,'' opening Friday in Atlanta, Hanks and
Ryan play business competitors who unwittingly fall in love online.
Logging onto their AOL software-loaded laptops at various times,
each is thrilled to hear Edwards' recorded voice trill, ``You've
got mail!,'' signaling another enchanting e-mail received from an
admirer they know only by a screen name.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? After all, true love doesn't come around too often.
Not so Edwards' voice, which AOL estimates is heard 27 million
times a day by its 14 million subscribers. That's about 13,950,000
more subscribers than the nascent AOL had in 1989, when employee
Karen Edwards suggested that her husband's friendly voice greet
users logging on.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran of the broadcasting industry who got his first radio
job while still in high school in New Bern, N.C., Edwards needed
only a few takes to record four phrases that remain as much a part
of AOL today as modems and secret passwords. (He's also heard
saying ``Welcome'' and ``Goodbye'' in the movie; only ``File's
done'' didn't make the cut.)
</P>
<P>
   But it's the irresistibly imitable ``You've got mail!'' that has
become embedded in our collective '90s subconscious, so much so
that when writer/director Nora Ephron wanted to update the 1940
film ``The Shop Around the Corner,'' she turned to AOL and its
ripe-with-symbolic-possibilities catch phrase.
</P>
<P>
   The giant online company won't disclose the terms of its
agreement with the filmmakers, who prominently display AOL's logo
on Hanks' and Ryan's laptops; nor will it say how it compensates
Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Even the voice himself is somewhat mute on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will go so far as to say I have a great relationship with
AOL,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   What he does like to talk about is how he and Karen met, online,
back in 1987. Given the story line of ``You've Got Mail,'' it all
sounds a bit too perfect, too manufactured.
</P>
<P>
   Too much like that voice pouring out of cyberspace 27 million
times a day?
</P>
<P>
   But the couple really did ``meet'' in 1987 in a Christian chat
room on AOL precursor Q-Link, exchanging messages for about three
months before meeting and finally marrying in 1988. And anyway,
Edwards says, his ``You've got mail!'' message definitely isn't
perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had people tell me it's grammatically incorrect, but I
think perhaps that has added some of the charm and humanity to
it,'' said Edwards, who recently left his job as general manager of
a Houston TV station to open his own voice-over business. ``I think
sometimes people are a little wary of perfection.''

   `BAD SOFTWARE'
</P>
<P>
   By Cem Kaner and David Pels (Wiley Computer Publishing, $29.99).
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows what it's like to spend $199 on a piece of
software that promises to change your life and delivers nothing but
headaches. ``Bad Software'' by Cem Kaner and David Pels is a
combative, encyclopedic rundown of the many ways in which
commercial software can waste our time, raise our stress levels and
generally wreck our spirits.
</P>
<P>
   But the book is less emboldening than it might seem. ``You Don't
Have to Put Up With This'' is the title of the book's first
section. Unfortunately, when it comes to bad software, you do. As
the authors concede, software might be difficult to install, and
still more difficult to use, but if it performs its job as
advertised, a consumer has little recourse.
</P>
<P>
   The authors merely reinforce this point by noting the high
volume of computer-related complaints received each year by the
Better Business Bureau. As anyone who has complained to the bureau
can tell you, lodging a complaint there is more often than not a
futile exercise motivated by desperation.
</P>
<P>
   The most interesting chapter in ``Bad Software'' is the one on
consumers' legal rights. Kaner is a practicing lawyer and an expert
in legal issues surrounding software. It's fascinating, for
instance, to learn the difference between implied warranties and
express ones. But the information seems academic. ``If you have
been cheated, the law is on your side,'' the authors wrote. But
software makers seldom actually cheat their customers so much as
frustrate them.
</P>
<P>
   As the authors point out, refunds are difficult to get, and the
quest for one can require hours of testy telephone exchanges with
salespeople and their supervisors. Eventually, the authors boil
their message down to this: If you hate a program you are not
legally entitled to a refund if the program does what the publisher
said it would do.
</P>
<P>
   There is always small claims court, the authors tell us. But
trying to get a small claims court judge to understand the fine
points of software could turn into an experience that makes the
shouting matches with salespeople seem appealing.
</P>
<P>
   It's nice to know that someone is out there standing up for the
consumer. Still, $29.99 seems a lot to pay for a topic that could
be covered in a five-page pamphlet instead of a 365-page book. The
authors' Web site (www.badsoftware.com) goes a long way toward
offering just such succinct advice. It's a welcome addition to the
Web, where most software guides are written from the perspective of
the companies, who seldom put themselves in the consumer's shoes,
perhaps because they don't have the time. They're too busy cranking
out bad software.

<P>
   `MY TINY LIFE: CRIME AND PASSION IN A VIRTUAL WORLD'
</P>
<P>
   By Julian Dibbell (Henry Holt and Co., due out in January,
$14.95).
</P>
<P>
   You can understand how things got so confusing for Julian
Dibbell, author of ``My Tiny Life.'' In real life, he was living
with his flesh-and-blood girlfriend in his New York flat. In
virtual reality, he _ actually, his online persona, Dr. Bombay _
had the serious hots for a fellow cybercitizen, and the pair were
having a passionate online affair that he calls tinysex. In the
end, of course, Dibbell was forced to make a choice. ``Two lives
was more than I could handle at the time,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   Dibbell's story takes place in Lambda Moo, a virtual community
known as Multiple-User Dimension, Object Oriented. This virtual
world, called Moo for short, is rich with landscapes, meeting
places and fantastic images, with one crucial catch: There are no
graphics, just vivid textual descriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The residents of Lamda Moo, thousands from around the world,
interact by typing conversations to one another. They create
personas, as Dibbell created Dr. Bombay, describing him as ``a
walking optical illusion, oscillating randomly between the sitcom's
plump pseudo-scholarly fop and the image of a lean old streetwise
back-alley medic.''
</P>
<P>
   The author's online tryst is just a piece of the story. A good
portion of Dibbell's book is devoted to exploring the nascent
social and political structure of Lamda Moo. The debates therein
harks back to the formation of any society struggling to be
democratic and create a rule of law. Who is in charge? What
constitutes harassment of another person? What authority determines
who can ``build'' new architecture?
</P>
<P>
   It may sound absurd that the author was able to become so
immersed in a world decorated only by text and populated by
inhabitants scattered around the world he would never actually see
or touch. But become immersed he did. The 324-page exploration of
Lamda Moo seems self-indulgent at first, but it eventually draws
the reader to the characters, their world and the worthy questions
the book provokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can anybody spend such time and energy in such a place and not
be in the throes of a miserable, soul-wasting addiction?'' Dibbell
asks. His own answer falls somewhere between no and perhaps.

   Outsmarting Ourselves: How Computers Can Fail Children
</P>
<P>
   `FAILURE TO CONNECT: HOW COMPUTERS AFFECT OUR CHILDREN'S MINDS _
FOR BETTER AND WORSE'
</P>
<P>
   By Jane Healy, Ph.D. (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25).
</P>
<P>
   When you see a child in front of a computer monitor, engaged in
the fun or the challenge of a math game or a drawing program, there
is much more going on than meets the eye. For this book, Jane
Healy, an educational psychologist and educator for more than 35
years, spent two years and hundreds of hours talking to and
observing kids, their parents, teachers and school administrators.
She concluded that what you don't see is dangerous to children.
</P>
<P>
   With a federal initiative to wire all schools for computers by
2000 and the increasingly loud public debate over the allocation of
educational funds, this book provides an excellent look at what is
happening already in schools _ from well-endowed private academies
to poorer urban schools.
</P>
<P>
   The book is broad-ranging in its consideration, from a
discussion of surveys on the educational benefits of computer
access to an analysis of the various critical stages of early
childhood development and a prognosis of what children will need to
succeed in the technological future.
</P>
<P>
   The author has a knack for knowing when to pull back from
clinical psychological terminology to keep the book accessible to
the general reader. For parents of computer-using children of any
age, there are various lists of guidelines scattered throughout.
They include advice for Internet use and choosing and using
so-called educational software aimed at children (most of which,
Healy says, is designed by people who have little if any knowledge
of child development or educational philosophy).
</P>
<P>
   The discussion of the damage that computer use can have on young
learners _ especially preschoolers, the latest target of a software
marketing explosion _ is especially interesting. ``Starting
children on computers too early,'' Healy says, ``is far worse than
starting them too late.'' Her anecdotes, drawn from hours spent
with ``cybertots'' and ``digi-kids'' in school and at home,
illustrate the dangers.
</P>
<P>
   Witness the 4-year-old girl who spends up to four hours a day on
a home computer, to the delight of her parents. (``Wait till you
see how she handles these programs!'' her mother said). She plays
with some ``interactive problem-solving'' software in a game
format, racing a car around an animated landscape and picking up
items along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did you pick up the rope?'' the author asked her. ``'Cause
you're s'posed to,'' was the response. The child had learned only
the tricks of someone else's invention. At early ages, Healy says,
problem-solving skills and lessons in cause and effect come from
play with toys like blocks and puzzles. In these activities, she
writes, ``the child is laying the groundwork to be either an
internally motivated or a weak learner.''
</P>
<P>
   In another example, eight third-graders were writing and
illustrating their own stories on a software program. They moved
around graphics and icons, fooled around with music, typed in
different sizes and fonts but did virtually no writing. ``Isn't it
wonderful what this technology can do!'' the teacher said. Not only
were the students not learning much useful, but their attention
spans were surely not being aided by all the multimedia
distractions.
</P>
<P>
   Healy concludes, among other things, that the number of
computers a school has matters less than how well the school has
incorporated computers into the curriculum. Healy warns against
letting the new wave of school-based technology coordinators have
the upper hand over more experienced educators with less
technological expertise.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when more bombastic critics of the computerization of
education are making themselves widely heard, ``Failure to
Connect,'' by a self-described ``techno-pusher turned critic,'' is
a revealing study with useful practical applications.

   `THE DE-VOICING OF SOCIETY: WHY WE DON'T TALK TO EACH OTHER
ANYMORE'
</P>
<P>
   By John L. Locke (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25).
</P>
<P>
   With billions of e-mail messages being sent every day, millions
of words spilling across the Web, instant messaging, pagers,
beepers and, of course, television and radio, it's hard to imagine
that anything worth saying is being left unsaid.
</P>
<P>
   But in a new book, John L. Locke, a linguist at the University
of Sheffield, argues that modern technology is robbing people of
the inclination to speak meaningfully to one another: ``Our social
voices are slipping away, leaving people in social isolation.''
</P>
<P>
   Humans, Locke writes, began speaking tens of thousands of years
ago, but vocal expression among our ancestors began hundreds of
thousands of years earlier, in the form of the facial displays and
chattering that accompanied social rituals like grooming.
</P>
<P>
   Locke argues that language is still broadly dualistic,
comprising its form (the structure and content of what we say) and
its function, that is, the way that talking, through inflections,
gestures and eye movements, creates social relationships. He calls
that ``the fundamentally nonlinguistic nature of talking'' or
``intimate talking.'' Village gossip and a baby's cooing are
examples. Neither offers much information, but both establish
important relationships with neighbors or parents.
</P>
<P>
   Locke argues that new technologies like e-mail and telephone
answering machines have increased the amount of functional
information we encounter in a day but lack the capacity for
intimate talking. The result, he says, is that we now live in an
``autistic society'' that is at home with computers but
uncomfortable with human intimacy.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of what Locke writes about social disconnection will be
familiar to readers of Robert Putnam, and it will make emotional
sense to anyone exhausted after a day of pages, phone calls, e-mail
messages and talk radio. But his book trips on a couple of
assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   The first is that new forms of communication always displace
earlier ones, rather than creating new opportunities for
conversation. But even Locke provides examples that undercut his
own argument. A Finnish student he quotes on the popularity of
mobile phones in Scandinavia says: ``We've never been much good at
talking to each other face to face. All that's happened is we've
found our ideal way of communication _ at arm's length.''
</P>
<P>
   Locke also assumes that a lack of intimacy is always a bad
thing. Take e-mail, which Locke calls an ``emotionally parched''
form of communication. He's right, of course: E-mail does strip
away the intimacy of face-to-face conversation. But it also strips
away some of the fear, guilt, anger and self-consciousness, which
is one reason that e-mail has become so successful. Co-workers who
otherwise loathe one another can still be productive through
e-mail. Children can carry on (relatively) guilt-free relationships
with parents. Narrowing the emotional range of conversation can
sometimes increase the value of what is being said.
</P>
<P>
   And besides, some social relationships _ the kind supported by
intimate talking _ aren't worth maintaining. Fifty years ago, my
father's working-class London accent would have all but precluded
him from attending Oxford or Cambridge. Today, as a university
administrator, he now regularly exchanges e-mail with his
counterparts at those institutions. I know which world he'd rather
be living in.

   A Road Map for the Future

<P>
   `TIPS FOR TIME TRAVELERS: VISIONARY INSIGHTS INTO NEW
TECHNOLOGY, LIFE, AND THE FUTURE ON THE EDGE OF TECHNOLOGY'
</P>
<P>
   By Peter Cochrane (McGraw-Hill, $20).
</P>
<P>
   The future, especially one likely to be strongly shaped by
higher and more baffling technologies, gives rise to apprehension
for many and, for some, downright terror. Yet everyone is, in
effect, a time traveler, plunging into the unknown one day at a
time, moving seamlessly from today to tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Cochrane, a futurist, clearly understands that. Since we
are all embarked on the journey anyway, Cochrane offers in his new
book an easy-to-read map for roads that are beginning to be paved
by current technologies and ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Anything but stuffy, ``Tips for Time Travelers'' is a collection
of 108 pithy, well-reasoned and often entertaining essays. None are
longer than two pages. And the quotations, from Walt Disney to
Oscar Wilde, that open each essay are priceless.
</P>
<P>
   Cochrane, who is in charge of research for British
Telecommunications, writes with charm and bite that with all the
high technology available today, he still finds himself stuck in
sluggish lines when he wants to get services or make purchases. The
problem, he says, is the bottleneck created by the dozens of
identification cards we are all saddled with. Wouldn't it be much
better if all that information was stored on a sliver of silicon
and slipped beneath the skin? Unflinchingly, Cochrane says yes.
</P>
<P>
   Cochrane, who began his lifelong fascination with technology
when he was bedridden with a childhood illness at the age of 11,
often reveals his insights coiled in arguments that seem to lean
toward the counterintuitive.
</P>
<P>
   He dismisses high-definition television as nothing more than a
sharper picture. He dreams of a new way to evoke and interact with
images and sounds in a manner as superior to today's televisions
and personal computers as television was to the telegraph.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, he says improved telecommunications is not going to
stop people from needing and wanting to travel, as some predict.
</P>
<P>
   But his enthusiasm for high technology does not blind him to
some of its disturbing implications. He notes, for instance, that
advancements in telecommunications have melted the traditional
barriers between work and play. ``Work never stops,'' he writes.
``Home life is no longer sacrosanct.''

CAMELOT: THE REALM ON LINE
</HEADLINE>
  EDS: Internet addresses at bottom of article.  
(dal) 
 By MICHAEL POLLAK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   King Arthur, in legend the greatest king of Britain's Dark Ages,
has had a lot heaped on his Round Table. However thinly supported
by fact, his story is a wellspring of British pride, a medieval
justification of the monarchy and an epic of Christian symbolism.
It is also an inspiration for just about every video and computer
pastime featuring swords and sorcery.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the world of Arthur on the Internet can
resemble a battle royal, with a whole castleful of serious sites
bravely trying to organize 1,500 years of logic, literature and
popular culture while under siege by cultists, hoaxers, gamesters
and the Monty Pythonized.
</P>
<P>
   If ye be worthy, it would be well to make the Camelot Project of
the University of Rochester your first stop. It has an index for
each lord and lady of Arthur's realm and such symbols as the Siege
Perilous and Excalibur. It is a doorway to huge chunks of
literature _ Middle English to pre-Raphaelite and modern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I often tell my students that Arthur is everywhere,'' Alan
Lupack, who teaches the Arthurian tradition at the university and
is curator of the Robbins Library of medieval studies there, wrote
via e-mail. He and his wife, Barbara Tepa Lupack, designed the
Camelot Project as a database of Arthurian texts, images,
bibliographies and basics.
</P>
<P>
   He said that what a publisher would find too costly _ say,
``Historia Brittonum'' by Nennius, the eighth-century Welsh scribe
who set down an account of Arthur's battles 300 years earlier _
occupies only a tiny amount of disk space. The site has hundreds of
texts from scores of authors, from Anonymous to Yeats.
</P>
<P>
   A different main site, the Quest, is maintained by Caliburn, the
University of Idaho's Arthurian Legend Society. It is gorgeously
illustrated, both in its Arthurian Art Gallery and in the texts,
many of which are presented like illuminated manuscripts.
</P>
<P>
   Arthurian Resources, a site by Thomas Green of Exeter College at
Oxford, focuses on Welsh literature and is a vast compendium of
Arthur scholarship. It includes his own essays and recent research,
including a current archeology project at Tintagel Castle in
Cornwall.
</P>
<P>
   Although so much is murky in Arthur's realm, John J. Doherty,
compiler of the site Arthurian Resources on the Internet, said
there was no question which Arthurian character is the most
popular: Merlin. ``For some reason, the enchanter actually seems to
engender more interest than Arthur,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   You can subscribe to the online or print version of Arthuriana,
the quarterly journal of the International Arthurian Society's
North American branch. Arthuriana maintains a discussion group of
about 1,100 subscribers. ``A recurrent subject is the nature of the
Arthurian women, especially Guenevere and Morgan,'' Professor
Bonnie Wheeler of Southern Methodist University, the editor of
Arthuriana, wrote via e-mail. ``Are they related to fertility
cults, to Celtic goddesses (or gods)? How does their sexual nature
in the Arthurian stories function in the society of Camelot?''
</P>
<P>
   And her opinion about Arthur's existence? ``It is a question to
which there is no definitive answer (except that a sixth-century
British warrior would not have lived in a stone castle),'' she
wrote, ``but people from all walks of life care intensely about the
answer. I've never heard anyone worry about whether Alexander the
Great and Charlemagne were real (who cares?), but a lot of people
want or need a `real' King Arthur.''

   Uh, Dad, Can I Borrow The Key to the Modem?
</P>
<P>
   While parents continue to buy filtering software for their home
computers, a Dallas entrepreneur has invented a decidedly
lower-tech solution for parents to restrict their children's
surfing. His Netprotector is a lock designed to shut off access to
the modem with the turn of a key.
</P>
<P>
   The lock is connected to a wire that is attached to the modem
card. When the parent turns the key, the rest of the computer
works, but the modem goes mute, said the entrepreneur, Douglas
Horn, president of Dallas-based EZ Solve
(www.companylisting.com/us/national/netprotector), based in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Horn said he was all in favor of parental supervision of
Internet use, but the trouble was that parents had to leave the
house sometimes. ``When parents aren't home, they don't want kids
looking at dirty pictures or wasting time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company promotes the $14.95 lock-and-key device as well
suited to the low-tech skills of many parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``NetProtector is not a software product that computer-savvy
kids can `hack' or that requires users to remember passwords,'' a
company release states.

   Rumor Mill Churns Overtime About New Apple Portable
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer has been officially tight-lipped about rumors it
will soon release a new portable computer along the lines of its
translucent bluegreen iMac.
</P>
<P>
   While the company has said it plans one, Steve Jobs, Apple's
interim chief executive, said pointedly last week that no such
portable would be unveiled in January at the MacWorld trade show in
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Unofficially, the story is something else entirely. Internet
sites devoted to following Apple _ and there are some that do so
passionately _ are filled with veritable spec sheets on the new
computer.
</P>
<P>
   It is widely thought that the new machine will be out in the
first quarter of next year, also will have a translucent shell
(perhaps green or even orange), a 300 megahertz or faster
processor, cost less than $1,500, and, like the iMac itself, have
limited expansion capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Among hot topics of debate in the rumor mill is whether the new
computer will qualify as a full-fledged laptop or be more of a
personal digital assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's been leaked is that it's more of a cross between a
laptop and a Palm Pilot or Newton,'' said Stan Flack, publisher of
the MacCentral site, www.maccentral.com.
</P>
<P>
   An Apple spokeswoman, Natalie Welch, said the company had little
to say about any new ``consumer portable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of people looking at iMac thinking we'll mimic
the industrial design,'' she said. ``At this point, that is just
rumor and speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's the source of all the unofficial information? The
keepers of several sites that follow Apple say company sources tend
to loosen their lips when they want to start a consumer buzz for a
new product.
</P>
<P>
   Pumping Up A Palm Pilot By Adding a Real Keyboard
</P>
<P>
   The latest accessory for the handheld Palm Pilot will require
more than one palm to use, and carry.
</P>
<P>
   The accessory is a full-sized keyboard, which includes a docking
station in the center into which the Palm can be plugged. Once the
Palm is plugged in, users of the Go Type! keyboardcan type away on
the Palm as if sitting at an actual laptop, PC or other computer of
self-respecting size.
</P>
<P>
   Made by LandWare, Inc. in Oradell, N.J., the $79.95 keyboard
began shipping to Comp USA and other retailers this week, said
Larry Reich, vice president for marketing for LandWare. Reich said
the keyboard required no batteries or cables, and runs off of the
Palm's own battery supply. &QL;

<P>
   Furby or Just a Facsimile? Some On-Line Goods Are Bad &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On-line buyers beware: a new survey concludes that many Web
sites are hawking counterfeit luxury wares like imitation Gucci
handbags, facsimiles of Furbie, and virtually real Rolexes.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, compiled by Cyveillance, a New York company that
tracks corporate counterfeiters on the Net, found that 10 percent
to 20 percent of sites selling Gucci, Coach, Rolex Beanie Babies
and other big-name stuff, were not selling the real product
advertised. Cyveillance's chairman and chief executive, Brandy
Thomas, compared the problem to buying a watch from a street corner
in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is, you see someone selling something in front
of Macy's, you suspect something may be wrong,'' he said. ``On the
Internet, you look at a site, you may not be able to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   He said consumers should look for sites to betray fraudulent
products by including words like ``replica,'' or that suggest
something is in the ``style'' or ``like'' a well-known product. He
said if a deal seems too good to be true, than it's probably time
to move on to a new URL. &QL;

and frequently caused players to bemoan the names of forgotten
state capitals, curse categories like ``Arts &AMP; Entertainment'' and
``People &AMP; Places,'' and sometimes to yank out their own hair
trying to remember some detail from high school science.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that game known as Trivial Pursuit is coming to the Web.
Sony Online Entertainment said it had reached an agreement with
Hasbro Interactive to next year publish an online version on the
Sony game page.
</P>
<P>
   The game's appearance on the Sony site begs a different
question, namely, what is Sony, a movie house/entertainment
company/consumer electronics maker, doing in the online game
business? In an effort to promote its brand name, the Sony site,
www.station.sony.com, offers numerous free games, including online
Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune.

 By JULIE V. IOVINE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The modernist interior, conceived in midcentury to
exalt the everyday, the mass-produced and the fuss-free, has in
1998 become merely au courant. Plywood stacking chairs and tubular
steel chairs, designed for utility, now peer from the pages of
glossy magazines like so many blase models with nothing to do but
pose.
</P>
<P>
   The high-style status of modernism is putting the once proudly
democratic design movement at odds with young people who just want
to live with it. Lucas Michael, 33, and Roman Vinoly, 28, are
brothers who grew up with modernism. They cut their baby teeth on
the nubby boucle of a Florence Knoll sofa and learned to walk in a
home that was the first in Buenos Aires to bring exposed concrete
indoors, built by their father, Rafael Vinoly, a committed
modernist architect whose career, though begun in Argentina, took
off in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   How to live unpretentiously with vintage objects that are
suddenly objets hit home for the brothers when they started to
renovate their own apartments in downtown Manhattan. What to do?
Hire the designer of one of the modern restaurants du jour? Yes, if
she also happens to be your mother.
</P>
<P>
   Diana Vinoly has been working professionally as an interior
designer for only a few years, but the distinctive look that she
gave Lot 61, a lofty, clubby nightspot and tapas bar in Chelsea,
has brought her to the fore among designers working the industrial
look. Her approach might best be described as tossed-off chic. At
Lot 61, the muscular red rubber armchairs, the restaurant's
signature, were reclaimed by Ms. Vinoly from a mental institution.
</P>
<P>
   For the apartments belonging to two of her sons (there's a
third, but his girlfriend is an architect, so, as Ms. Vinoly said,
``that one I couldn't touch''), the designer drew on the classic
silhouettes of some modern furniture designs _ a testament to
beauty in brevity _ and revived an old standby: the built-in wall
unit. Ms. Vinoly, 59, whose open, pixieish grin belies the
austerity of her downtown-black outfits, managed to reinvigorate
this sturdy motif and show its moods, from avant-garde to placid
but always ready to serve.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a way that challenges today's curatorial approach, she
helped her sons fill the rooms with the cozy ephemera of daily
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned from my mom that there was nothing wrong with being
different,'' said Michael, a son from her first marriage. In his
East Village apartment, the wall unit is industrial metal, right
out of a hardware storeroom; the perforated-steel-sheet cabinet
doors look as fashionable as his photography monographs. (Similar
wall units show up in the private dining room at Lot 61.) But at
the Gramercy Park home of Vinoly, the shelves are classical _ maple
veneer over plywood. ``It's not really like storage,'' he said.
``It's a piece of furniture I plug into.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael, a photographer, prides himself on having inherited his
mother's eye and her modern tastes. Still, he wasn't interested in
a home awaiting its magazine close-up. ``He's always been way ahead
of the times,'' she said. She noted that he wore clothes with
artistic tears ``way before the Japanese style was in.'' She added,
``I'd say to him, `How can you come in here looking like that?' and
two years later, I'd be buying the same thing at Issey Miyake.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Ms. Vinoly's idea to renovate his apartment. ``I couldn't
stand the way his place looked, like he was still living in a
college dorm,'' she said. ``Besides, I wanted to try out something
tough and modern but not really minimal.'' Maternal instinct
struggled with professional drive. ``He was the perfect guinea
pig.''
</P>
<P>
   In Michael's 700-square-foot pre-World War II apartment with
East Village views of some of the city's earliest public housing,
nothing is minimal except the size. A small living room with an
adjacent galley kitchen leads to a smaller bedroom overlooking the
street. The metal storage unit that hugs the wall between the
living room and the bedroom establishes a steel-gray backdrop
against which Michael's furnishings are arranged. There is some
jostling among the smoky plastic 1956 Eero Saarinen tulip chair,
the Plexiglas side table, the low, Italian-leather sofa and the
1928 tubular-steel armchair by Le Corbusier, Pierre Jeanneret and
Charlotte Perriand, which Ms. Vinoly found at a flea market.
</P>
<P>
   The crowding is welcome, even artful, with orange construction
lamps slung by extension cords on the shelves _ a touch that
Michael suggested and that his mother at first disliked but later
declared to be in sync with her son's more baroque taste. ``We're a
family that really cares about the way things look,'' Ms. Vinoly
said. ``But I do not believe in doing things for visual effect.
Houses should feel like an extension of a personality.''
</P>
<P>
   In a startling confession from a modernist, Ms. Vinoly said that
she still owns an inlaid vase she bought when she was 12. She did
not, however, urge her son to display his own creepy keepsake, a
monk's skull from Tibet. Daily life still leaves its mark on the
design, framed by a small pass-through between the kitchen and the
living room. When piled with the colorful 1940s and '50s bowls and
platters that Michael has collected, a Florence Knoll dining table
takes on the saturated intensity of a Flemish still life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept of untidiness, of things accumulated, is what
makes a house,'' Ms. Vinoly said. ``Otherwise it has no feeling, no
sense of history. So many American houses look like chain hotels.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For the bedroom, Ms. Vinoly, who consulted her son on purchases
(he said: ``My budget was tight _ if I said no, she bought it for
me herself''), surprised him with a '60s Goodform orange metal
filing credenza and tossed a purple fur coverlet lined in a
Burberry plaid on the bed.
</P>
<P>
   Roman Vinoly's one-bedroom place on Gramercy Park is, at 550
square feet, even smaller than his brother's apartment. Ms. Vinoly
said that Roman, her youngest son, wanted something more
traditional. As a youngster, his favorite book was Jack Finney's
``Time and Again,'' a 1970 novel about a man who travels back to
Victorian-era New York and lives in a Gramercy Park rooming house.
The trick, then, was to convey period coziness with midcentury
furnishings. ``I knew my mother would make it serene,'' said
Vinoly, 28, a recent graduate of film school. ``Her homes have
always been safe havens. Probably she learned how to make things
feel permanent because we moved around a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   His renovation was more a construction project than a decorating
job. The built-ins were not just esthetic, but to contain Vinoly's
film-editing equipment, CD player and piano _ ``so I don't have to
deal with my mother saying no one should have to look at this
mess,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vinoly approached the apartment as if it were a boat. (Dad,
the architect, weighed in and suggested that the ceiling be lowered
to just over eight feet to enhance the slightly cloistered
feeling.) In a combined living-dining room and open kitchen, a
small dining table unfolds to seat 10 people. Monumental-size
furniture, Ms. Vinoly contends, actually helps make a room feel
larger.
</P>
<P>
   An open kitchen area is just barely demarcated by a
stainless-steel-top bar. Across from it is a 24-foot wall of
slab-thick wood shelves that appear to radiate from the corner
where Vinoly has his desk. ``Now I can just sit at my desk with the
remotes and control everything,'' Vinoly said. ``The room's a
perfect little ergonomic gem.''
</P>
<P>
   It was selecting a desk chair that went to the heart of their
esthetic differences. She chose a '30s dentist chair on castors
that could have starred in Fritz Lang's ``Metropolis.'' ``It was
fun _ it was everything,'' she said. He wanted something that
worked.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to the bathroom, between the living room and the
bedroom, Ms. Vinoly more fully indulged the romantic side of
modern. She swept all the plumbing to one side and hid it behind
shoji-like sliding doors, creating a hallway between the two rooms.
The walls are lined with inexpensive ceramic tiles that look like
stone. ``I thought they looked kind of cheesy in the samples,''
Vinoly said. Mother won that round, and her son still can't believe
how good they look.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a family that believes in being a little original,''
Ms. Vinoly said. ``My children get ahead of me, but somehow I catch
up, maybe a little faster than most mothers.''

THE UFFIZI BENEFITS AS ITALY UPDATES 
</HEADLINE>

 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLORENCE, Italy _ Visitors have long found the entrance hall of
the Uffizi Gallery to be about as warm and welcoming as Lenin's
Tomb. People lined up outside for hours, and for the last 10 years
vast rooms on the ground floor were closed off and used for
storage. After a 1993 bombing attributed to the Mafia killed five
people and damaged dozens of artworks, the ground floor was also
crammed with rubble from the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Italy unveiled what it calls the New Uffizi, a major
renovation that in addition to repairing damaged rooms added more
than 20,000 square feet of museum space, including a new annex for
a collection of 144 artworks that have never been shown before. It
is the most recent and stunning example of how Italy is seeking to
renovate its 760 state museums and monuments and introduce
contemporary forms of merchandising at the most important ones.
</P>
<P>
   The ground floor of an entire wing of the Uffizi has been
reclaimed for visitors: the museum now boasts a bookshop, a coat
room, an elegant cafe, a multimedia information center and an
electronic ticketing service for advance reservations, promising to
reduce the legendarily long lines outside the museum. (Lines could
still be long inside.)
</P>
<P>
   The Uffizi Gallery, built for the Medicis in the 16th century by
Giorgio Vasari, has some of the most famous artworks in Europe,
including Botticelli's ``Birth of Venus'' and Leonardo da Vinci's
``Annunciation.'' It has long been one of the most eagerly visited
museums in Italy. But until this week, tourists who tried to check
their coats, buy a postcard or grab a sandwich did so in cramped,
dingy places more reminiscent of a Greyhound bus station than one
of the world's most important museums. Until 1994, the museum
closed at 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I waited forever,'' Daniel Berger said, recalling his first
visit to the Uffizi in 1956. ``All I remember is the line. I don't
remember a single painting.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger, who is in charge of merchandising at the Metropolitan
Museum of Art in New York, was hired as a consultant by the Italian
Ministry of Culture in 1993 to help bring modern marketing
techniques to the country's art-rich and service-poor museums.
``When you go to a museum, you want it to be clean and well-lit,
you want a bookstore with postcards, clean bathrooms and a place to
sit down and snack,'' Berger explained. ``That's what everybody
wants.''
</P>
<P>
   The opening of the New Uffizi, which cost the government $15
million (a third of which was raised through the national lottery),
is the first step in a plan to triple the museum's exhibition space
by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to capitalize on Italy's extraordinary assemblage of
museums is growing. This year, for example, the Palazzo Massimo in
Rome, a collection of ancient Roman art, was created _ with a
glitzy museum shop _ from the reorganization of the national Roman
museum. After closing for a year for repairs, the late-19th-century
wing of Rome's National Modern Art Gallery reopened last week. Last
year, the modern art museum also unveiled a restored wing devoted
to early-19th-century art as well as a chic restaurant with terrace
dining overlooking the Villa Borghese.
</P>
<P>
   Palazzo Barberini, a national gallery known for its collection
of Renaissance and Baroque art, was once famously neglected. This
year it opened a bookstore, a new entrance and beautifully
renovated exhibition rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from killing five people, the 1993 bombing in Florence
destroyed two priceless paintings. But it also uncovered hidden
treasures, 18th-century frescoes that were long painted over. This
week, a building attached to the Uffizi that was badly damaged by
the bomb was unveiled as a new wing containing the Contini
Bonacossi collection of 144 artworks, including a painting by
Giovanni Bellini and a sculpture by Gian Lorenzo Bernini.
</P>
<P>
   The collection was donated to the Uffizi in the late 1950s, but
the gallery had no room to show it, so the paintings were stored in
the nearby Pitti Palace, where scholars could view them only on
special request.
</P>
<P>
   Until the bombing, that part of the Uffizi had been divided into
private apartments and rented out by the state. The government
reclaimed the apartments after the bombing, and workers discovered
and restored the frescoes. ``The paintings we lost we will never
recover, but we refound the apartments,'' said Mario Lolli Ghetti,
superintendant for architecture and environment in Florence. ``The
bomb gave us back apartments we would never otherwise have
gotten.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The improvements were long awaited. ``It should have happened a
lot sooner,'' Antonio Paolucci, the city's superintendent of fine
arts and a former minister of culture, said rather grumpily as he
led a tour around the newly restored 60,000-volume art book library
on the second floor, which had also served as a warehouse. ``Italy
has finally realized that its art is a formidable instrument for
economic and social progress.'' He added, ``Lets face it, Italy is
not first in anything anymore except its artistic heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year Walter Veltroni, then the minister of culture, ordered
some major museums to stay open until 11:30 p.m. on summer
weekends. This year the number was doubled to 69. Close to 30
museums, including the Uffizi, now stay open until 10 p.m every
working day from April to October, In the last two years, Italy has
added 30 bookshops and six museum cafes.
</P>
<P>
   Veltroni was replaced in October when the government of Romano
Prodi was ousted. But his successor, Giovanna Melandri, is keen on
keeping his experiment going. Veltroni's plan to hire 1,000
students and college graduates as guides in 44 principal museums on
weekends is expected to start next month, after a 1999 budget is
passed.
</P>
<P>
   But Italy's transition to the modern museum age is not
uncontested. Museum workers are union members, and they have long
viewed the ministry's efforts to lengthen museum hours and reduce
full-time personnel with suspicion. In Italy it is almost
impossible to dismiss state employees, but the ministry has reduced
the numbers by not replacing museum workers who retire.
</P>
<P>
   Unions initially supported the changes, hoping that the
renovations and increased spending would create more museum jobs.
Now, however, they complain that the government wants more work
done by fewer workers. ``There's a big problem with the New
Uffizi,'' said Enzo Feliciani, a union representative in Florence.
``The bookstore, the ticketing booth all seem great, but they risk
being closed down right after they open because there won't be
enough employees to staff them.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the country's efforts to display its heritage better
have paid off. This year sales from museum cafes, bookstores and
gift shops reached $15.6 million. Such revenue became possible only
in 1994, when Italy passed a law permitting state museums to
subcontract museum services to private companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the profit motive,'' said Berger of the Met. ``It kind of
works.''

CHILDREN' BOOKS: WHERE'S PETER RABBIT? '
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   They left out Peter Rabbit! In arguably the most stylish
children's book of this season of books for the young, ``The 20th
Century Children's Book Treasury,'' an anthology of ``celebrated
picture books and stories to read aloud,'' there's no ``Tale of
Peter Rabbit.'' Which is rather like not having a Faulkner novel on
the list of the 20th century's best books in English.
</P>
<P>
   While others are stuffing stockings, book publishers use
Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa to cram young heads with what they
hope will become the reading habit. Unlike an adult book, a
children's book's success is measured not only by first sales but
by how often the child returns to it; the more tattered the pages,
the better. Is it a book to be enjoyed by a child while sitting on
a lap? A terrific lap book is a measure in children's publishing.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat surprisingly, this has been a luminous season for
children's books, most of which haven't been selling too well
recently. So this omission of the great bunny may be the only tiny,
shadowy blip on an otherwise blissful season. There are now three
children's books on The New York Times' hardcover fiction
best-seller list. ``The Treasury'' collection of 44 of the
century's most memorable examples is dawdling just beneath the
list, with about 400,000 copies in print and most of those shipped.
</P>
<P>
   Selling children's books is as much about grandparents and aunts
and uncles (they are the most likely buyers of the higher-priced
books) and teachers as about parents; at least that's the
inferential evidence that publishers work on. Nancy Pines, who is
the publisher of two young-readers divisions for Pocket Books, says
the upturn in sales for children's books means ``the baby boomers
are having babies, and the grandparents are giving stuff to their
grandkids that the parents are reluctant to pay for.''
</P>
<P>
   Grandparents are important in literacy in yet another way, as
sort of a metaphorical bindery between then and now. Kristina
Peterson, president of the Random House Children's Media Group,
said the ideal was to publish books ``that grandparents loved as
children and gave to their children, who in turn loved them and
gave to their children.''
</P>
<P>
   The publisher of the treasury, Alfred A. Knopf, tried to bag
this ideal in one book, and Janet Schulman, who made the selections
and edited them, said she was ``very torn'' about keeping the
renowned rabbit out of the garden, so to speak, but the tale
``would have taken up too many pages'' of the 308-page book, of
which only two of the selections were slightly abridged, she said,
``even if we condensed the size of the illustrations.'' Anyhow, she
added, ``I'm not worried about Peter Rabbit not being around in the
21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, if Beatrix Potter's 1902 classic didn't make it into this
exquisite book, which the publisher hopes will become a collector's
item, the treasury does chronicle the doings of another bunny as
well those of cats, dogs, cows, elephants, bears, toads, ducklings
and about a million fish. And, oh, yes, it includes ``The Story of
Ferdinand'' by Munro Leaf, illustrated by Robert Lawson.
</P>
<P>
   Priced at $40 _ though it's often discounted, as are most
popular books _ it might still be too steep for even the most
doting grandparents. But this was an expensive book to produce
because Knopf had to pay other publishers for the right to reprint
most of the stories and illustrations.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Katz, president and publisher of HarperCollins Children's
Books, said that when buying a children's manuscript, ``you are
always thinking about: `Is there a message? One that kids will
really like. Is it fresh, how many times will the kid ask to have
the book read again?''' Having said that, Ms. Katz published this
season's most popular piece of children's literature so far, Jamie
Lee Curtis' ``Today I Feel Silly and Other Moods That Make My
Day,'' a book that many critics said had a title so precisely
accurate that it would not make many school libraries. The other
books on the fiction best-seller list are ``The Night Before
Christmas'' (Putnam) by Clement Moore and ``Harry Potter and the
Sorcerer's Stone'' (Scholastic) by J.K. Rowling, certainly closer
to belles lettres than Ms. Curtis' work.
</P>
<P>
   HarperCollins also published the successful and library-popular
``If You Give a Pig a Pancake'' in April as part of what one could
call its ``feed an animal'' series, having previously produced ``If
You Give a Moose a Muffin'' and ``If You Give a Mouse a Cookie,''
an extraordinarily successful sequence written by Laura Numeroff
and illustrated by Felicia Bond.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, some children's books that not only get
beyond animals and feeling silly but also give some edge to the
learning process. The author of one such book is Elizabeth Levy,
who has written about 70 books and has three publishers:
HarperCollins, Scholastic and Hyperion.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Ms. Levy's ``My Life as a Fifth-Grade Comedian'' was
published by HarperCollins to critical acclaim, and this year
Harper Trophy published the paperback version, which is in the
stores for the season. The book is about a boy who is having
trouble in school because he has a sarcastic father and is
therefore sarcastic himself, and so is not too popular and has to
learn the hard way what's truly funny and what's not. ``I love my
connection with children,'' Ms. Levy said. ``I speak to kids a lot,
and I want them to learn something from my books.'' Generally they
do, the critics agree.

<P>
   In a school office cubicle, beneath walls plastered with
hot-line lists, philosophical poems and a poster of a sunflower,
two people sit on hard plastic chairs, a slight 14-year-old girl
shyly pouring out her innermost demons to an earnest young man
she's only just met.
</P>
<P>
   The girl fingers a delicate crucifix around her neck and jiggles
a foot shod in a platform shoe beneath bell-bottom jeans. Her
bashfulness, her bad dreams, her thoughts of suicide _ all are duly
recorded, her small voice barely audible as the interviewer, Jason
Greenburg, methodically asks about anxiety, fears, depression and
phobias.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a third presence here in the basement of Christopher
Columbus High School in the Bronx that commands much of her
attention: the real director of this interview, Greenburg's sleek
laptop computer. Offering only an occasional beep and blink of its
screen, the laptop serves up question after question. Each is based
on information the girl provides as the interview proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   Greenburg, a doctoral candidate in psychology, reads the
questions aloud as they pop onto the screen, then records the
girl's yes or no answers.
</P>
<P>
   The interview is part of an exercise designed to prevent suicide
among teen-agers. The girl and some 200 other students at the
school, all of whose names are kept confidential, are undergoing a
computer analysis of their mental health.
</P>
<P>
   The computer program, a project of researchers at Columbia
University College of Physicians and Surgeons, is designed to sniff
out deep-rooted psychiatric troubles that might otherwise go
unnoticed in teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``To all intents and purposes, it seems to do it just as well as
a psychiatrist,'' said Dr. David Shaffer, director of child and
adolescent psychiatry at Columbia and a principal developer of the
computerized interview.
</P>
<P>
   Shaffer contends that the computer-guided interview is so
specific it can pick up psychiatric problems that psychologists and
counselors might miss.
</P>
<P>
   Other mental health professionals, however, express some
reservations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can compare a computer to an individual
trying to do a diagnosis,'' said Dr. James Masterson, who heads the
Masterson Institute for Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy in Manhattan.
``It's not just the symptoms, it's the patients' affect when
they're talking about it, which I don't think a computer can pick
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Loaded with 3,000 standardized questions and follow-up
questions, the program offers diagnoses not just for suicidal
tendencies but for more than 30 other psychiatric ailments,
including mood and anxiety disorders, substance abuse problems,
schizophrenia and eating disorders.
</P>
<P>
   If a person says he has considered suicide, the
computer-administered test finds out when and by what method. If
the person answers negatively, the questions proceed to other
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Touted by Shaffer's team as a time-saver for clinicians _ a
trained layperson can administer it, and a new, self-administered
version using headphones has also been developed _ the disk with
the questions has spread to clinic and school settings as far away
as South Africa and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Some 70 groups are using the program worldwide, Shaffer said.
The Justice Department plans to implement it at some juvenile
facilities. Wall Street magnates are providing philanthropic
backing. And institutions like Boys Town have made it a routine
part of their services.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about the way the disk is constructed that
yields better information from kids than other formats,'' said
Patrick Friman, director of clinical services and research at Boys
Town.
</P>
<P>
   The computer interview, administered upon admission to Boys
Town, a 550-student center in Nebraska, has been good at picking up
cases involving two or more conditions, common in Boys Town youth
but difficult to diagnose, Friman said.
</P>
<P>
   The most widely anticipated version of the test is the audio
version, which uses headphones to bypass literacy demands or the
need for a person to read the questions, said Dr. Chris Lucas, a
member of Shaffer's team. It will make its debut at two schools in
New York early next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbia program is rooted in research showing that suicidal
proclivities increase as teen-agers move into young adulthood,
Lucas said. Though rare, suicide is the second most common cause of
death among teen-agers, after auto accidents. Nationally, some
2,000 youths between the ages of 15 and 19 take their lives each
year. Seventeen did so in New York City in 1996, the most recent
year for which the city has data.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years alone, 110 public high school juniors and
seniors in New York attempted suicide on school property, according
to school board data.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``What you really want to screen for are clusters of risk which
kids may carry,'' said Eve Moscicki, a suicide expert at the
preventive interventions unit of the National Institute for Mental
Health. ``Suicide doesn't just strike people out of the blue. It's
always embedded in deep troubles. It can be very profound
depression that's accompanied by hopelessness.''
</P>
<P>
   At Columbus High on this fall day, the printer spits out
diagnoses one after another as students go through their
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The monotonous questions ricochet around the cubicles. Do you
get stomach aches in the morning before school? Have you had
uncontrollable attacks of feeling afraid or strange? Do thoughts
come to your mind that you can't get rid of? In the last year, was
there a time when you thought seriously about killing yourself?
</P>
<P>
   The teen-agers say they hear voices. They're withdrawn. They've
wanted to die. Some have tried to kill themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Those flagged by the computer then talk to a psychologist, who
makes a diagnosis. Out of the first five dozen interviewed,
identified by a preliminary questionnaire as being the most
troubled, the psychologist referred half for professional help.
Their parents were offered clinical help through Columbia, a
service financed by a foundation grant.
</P>
<P>
   One petite girl who said she had previously attempted suicide
emerged from her interview in tears. She wanted help but didn't
want her parents to know about her depression. Kathleen Cigich, the
screening coordinator, calmed her down, agreed not to divulge her
suicide attempt and, with a Spanish-speaking interpreter, later won
the parents' support for therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbia team will visit three other Bronx high schools by
the end of the school year, screening about 200 students at each.
</P>
<P>
   The principal of Columbus High, Gerald Garfin, who has a student
body of 3,500, said he had jumped at the chance when the
coordinator of the screening program, Leslie Craft, had offered its
services to Bronx principals. ``If this helps one kid see himself
or herself through a crisis, that's all I care about,'' Garfin
said.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is receptive. The parents of one Columbus High
student found to be at high risk refused to enroll her in therapy.
The girl, apparently under pressure from her parents, recanted the
responses that had concerned the Columbia team. ``Is she OK?''
Garfin said. ``I'll never know.''
</P>
<P>
   The computer screening is based on the Diagnostic Interview
Schedule for Children, which began as a lengthy, standardized
questionnaire on paper and was financed by a federal mental health
grant 18 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Can the computer replace the psychiatrist? ``At the moment, we
really don't want to say that this can replace the clinician,''
Lucas said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mina Dulcan, head of child psychiatry for Children's
Memorial Hospital in Chicago, said that whatever its limitations,
the computer test could identify teen-agers in need of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the computer may sometimes be too prone to suspect a
problem, as in the case of Greenburg's 14-year-old subject. She was
tagged as agoraphobic, but a psychologist who then spoke with her
found that she did not need professional help. On the other hand,
research has found that the computer rarely gives a clean bill of
health to anyone who is severely troubled.
</P>
<P>
   William Ruane, an investment adviser who heads the Sequoia Fund,
has become an important benefactor of the diagnostic project. He
has donated some $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Still to come is a telephone version of the interview. And
despite the cautionary views of some clinicians, Shaffer hopes to
see the interactive interview go on line one day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you can train people to find out what's wrong with
themselves in a sophisticated way, the better off you are,'' he
said.

REP. GILMAN, UNCOMMITTED ON IMPEACHMENT, LISTENS TO CONSTITUENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., who is uncommitted on
whether to impeach President Clinton, did what he often does before
momentous votes: He sounded out the constituents of his district,
which stretches from Westchester County to the Catskill Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman, 76, a Republican moderate who is chairs the House
International Relations Committee, started early Wednesday from his
home in Greenville, N.Y. and hit diners and a bus station packed
with New York City-bound commuters to hear how he should vote.
</P>
<P>
   He is a self-styled ``Rockefeller'' Republican in the tradition
of Nelson Rockefeller, New York governor from 1959 to 1973 and U.S.
vice president from 1974 to 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Those who know Gilman say the 25-year House veteran ultimately
will vote his conscience. ``Ben is a very independent-minded person
and he may not make up his mind until the last minute,'' said John
Hicks, GOP chairman in Orange County, N.Y. ``He's not premature in
his judgment in most cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks and other local Republican leaders are counseling a
pro-impeachment vote. But Gilman is also getting opposing advice. A
bus of 50 or more local anti-impeachment Democrats and some
Republicans is scheduled to descend on Washington Thursday to lobby
the congressman in his Capitol Hill office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our message to Ben Gilman is: You're in Congress for 25 years.
You don't have to be bullied by the (Republican) leadership,'' said
Paul Adler, Democratic chairman in Rockland County, who is
organizing the bus trip.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment vote is shaping up at a dicey time, now that
U.S. warplanes have launched air strikes on Iraq over its refusal
to grant U.N. inspectors full access to suspected
weapons-production sites.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman is sensitive to the impact of impeachment on America's
image and interests overseas and to the perception among some
Republican House leaders that reality might be imitating the recent
movie ``Wag the Dog,'' a farce in which image-meisters conjure up a
war to deflect public attention from a White House sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   But neither consideration will have any bearing on Gilman's
impeachment vote, said a senior aide, who asked not to be
identified.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman's Washington office has logged 2,000 impeachment-related
calls since Monday, according to his press secretary, Andrew
Zarutskie. The callers have been split about 50-50 on impeachment,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman followed the tally Wednesday by stopping at his district
offices in Middletown and Monsey, N.Y. to talk on the phone with
his Washington staffers and review what constituents have told
them.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman's 20th congressional district runs from Westchester
through Rockland and Orange Counties into Sullivan County, home of
a dwindling number of Catskill Mountain ``borscht belt'' resorts as
well as the site of the legendary 1969 Woodstock music festival.
</P>
<P>
   It is a region in transition from hamlets of farm homes and
summer cottages to bedroom communities sprawling outward from New
York City. Many newcomers are Democrats who are altering the
politics of the traditionally Republican-leaning district. Voter
registration is now 2-1 Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Reda, GOP chairman in Rockland County, said he assumes
Gilman is ``getting pressure from Democrats.'' Reda said that last
week the county Republican organization's executive committee
approved a resolution supporting impeachment and forwarded it to
Gilman.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, Gilman has not returned his phone calls, Reda said.
``I'd like to think he'd come around'' to favoring impeachment,
Reda said.

HOME REPAIR COLUMN: MAKING THE RIGHT CHOICES WHEN BUYING LUMBER

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Homeowners who do their own home repairs need to buy lumber at
the local lumber yard. Do-it-yourselfers, however, are often
confused by the terms used to classify wood and they are unsure
what to look for when picking out boards.
</P>
<P>
   For example, they know that a common wall stud is called a two
by four _ meaning it is two inches thick by four inches wide _ but
careful measurement shows that it is not that wide nor that thick.
Actually the stud is cut to a full two inches by four inches at the
saw mill, but then it is dressed (planed) and dried. This reduces
the thickness and width by 1/2 inch. The 2 by 4 specification is
the nominal size, that is the size by name only. The actual size is
the final dimension of the dressed piece.
</P>
<P>
   Wood sold in nominal sizes is called dimensional lumber. Most
lumber yards stock dimensional lumber in seven standard sizes: 2 by
2, 2 by 4, 2 by 6, 2 by 8, 2 by 10, 2 by 12, 4 by 4. The
accompanying diagram shows how the actual size differs from the
nominal size. It is important to keep in mind that the length of
the board is always actual size. If, for example, you buy a 2 by 4
that is 10 feet long, it will actually be 10 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have determined the size of the lumber that you need,
you can proceed to pick out the best boards. Obviously, you want
pieces that are relatively flawless, but almost all the boards will
have some imperfections. The trick then is to choose boards with
defects that you can work around so they will not affect your
project.
</P>
<P>
   With dimensional lumber there are two categories of flaws: those
that distort the shape of the board, and those that compromise the
strength of the wood.
</P>
<P>
   Crooks, bows, cupping and twists are defects that affect the
shape, and therefore the straightness, of the board. Before buying
any board, sight down the edge to see how straight it is. Boards
with crooks, bows, or twists are still usable provided the
deformity is not too extreme. Do not, however, use them in corners
or around door or window openings.
</P>
<P>
   A crook is a curve along the edge of the board. You can use
pieces with a slight crook for framing, provided the bow on all the
boards faces out the same way. A bow is a longitudinal curve along
the face of the board. Studs with a bow of less than a 1/2 inch are
acceptable for walls because you can usually push them straight
when you install the wallboard.
</P>
<P>
   Cupping, or ``warp,'' is a dished effect created by the edges
curving up from the center. Avoid using cupped boards for decking
because they create an uneven surface. If you must use a cupped
piece as a floor or deck board, position it with the rounded center
up and the curved edges down.
</P>
<P>
   A twist is spiral distortion along the length of the board with
the ends no longer in line. Boards with a slight twist, less than
20 degrees, can be used in framing because the twist can be
straightened and then held in place with nails.
</P>
<P>
   Knots, splits, shakes and wanes are defects in the wood fibers
and they can compromise the strength of the board. Knots are the
circular plugs that result from a branch growing off the trunk.
Small, tight knots in the center of a board are tolerable, but
large, loose knots near the edges can weaken the board.
</P>
<P>
   Splits are cracks that run through the length of the board.
Short splits usually develop near the end of the board as the wood
dries out. If the board is long enough, you can cut these away.
Avoid using any board for framing if it has long splits extending
into the center area.
</P>
<P>
   Shakes look like cracks, but they are actually hollows between
the growth rings. A few short shakes here and there are not a
problem, but avoid using any board for joists or rafters if it has
shakes running more than half its length.
</P>
<P>
   A wane is a length of bark that adheres to the edge of the
board. Wanes are more like surface blemishes rather that structural
defects so they are generally not a problem. They do, however,
reduce the nailing surface on the edge of the board. This can be a
problem if you need to attach wallboard to the stud.
</P>
<P>
   If you are able to buy boards that are reasonably straight, it
doesn't mean that they will remain that way. They can warp or twist
if stored improperly. Stack the boards in an unheated environment,
like a garage or shed, but not out of doors. &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The weather pattern across North America will continue to shift
Thursday as an enlarging area of frigid air over Alaska and western
Canada begins to effect more of the continent. While dry conditions
will prevail, colder air crossing the Great Lakes will finally
induce more widespread snow showers and squalls.
</P>
<P>
   The snow drought across the interior Northeast will end as low
pressure developing in southern New England spreads light to
moderate snow from the northern Catskills to the White Mountains.
Patches of rain will dampen southeast New England. A strengthening
flow from the northwest will contribute to numerous snow showers
from Michigan to central New York. Some sections will receive their
first measurable snow of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Middle Atlantic and Southeast States will stay dry, but turn
brisk and cooler. A large high pressure system crested over the
central Rockies will influence the weather over much of the West
and Plains. Gusty winds from the west will descend the east slopes
of the Rockies causing the air to become much warmer. Record
maximums are expected from eastern Montana to Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   An intensifying disturbance near Regina in southern Canada will
push the milder air in the western Plains over a very cold air mass
in the Middle West. The result will be light snow, mainly around
the Red River of the North. An extremely cold air mass will be
poised along the border with Canada, but it should not surge
southward until Friday. The Southwest will notice more high clouds,
but it will remain warm.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Unnatural Snow
</P>
<P>
   Early Tuesday, an unnatural snow dusted the ground in an
industrial valley south of Charleston, W.Va. It had been a clear,
calm December night. The ground cooled rapidly below freezing as
radiation was lost to space, but at 3,000 feet aloft the
temperature held nearly steady. The layer of warmth above the
chilling ground acted as a lid that trapped tiny particles and
moisture which was belching from smokestacks in the valley. The
pollution particles acted as sites that collected moisture and ice
crystals began to grow in the air. Eventually, a fine snow fell
forcing crews to salt the roads.

<P>
   Lost for 320 years and rediscovered in Britain in 1995, Nicolas
Poussin's 1626 masterpiece, ``The Destruction and Sack of the
Temple of Jerusalem,'' is headed for a new home: the Israel Museum
in Jerusalem. The museum announced the acquisition Wednesday,
saying it was made possible by a grant from Yad Hanadiv, the
Rothschild Foundation in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The painting will be at the Palazzo delle Esposizioni in Rome
through March before going to the National Gallery in London.
Commissioned in 1625 by Cardinal Francesco Barberini, the painting
eventually vanished, before emerging in 1995 from the estate of
Ernest Onians, a British collector. It will be installed in the
Israel Museum in May.
</P>
<P>
   Calendar Check
</P>
<P>
   For those who dream of summer at the advent of winter, here is
news of coming events at Tanglewood in Lenox, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 season of the Tanglewood Music Center, Tanglewood's
training academy, will feature a residency, from July 27 through
Aug. 8, by Claudio Abbado and the Gustav Mahler Youth Orchestra. At
the Leonard Bernstein Memorial Concert on July 27, the Mahler
Orchestra and Seiji Ozawa's Boston Symphony Orchestra will join in
a performance of Bartok's ``Miraculous Mandarin'' and Strauss'
``Don Quixote,'' with the cellist Yo-Yo Ma and the violist Yuri
Bashmet as guest soloists.
</P>
<P>
   The Music Center's season will also include a fully staged
production of Puccini's ``Gianni Schicchi,'' led by Robert Spano in
his first summer in charge of the center's conducting program. The
composer and conductor Tan Dun will direct the center's 1999
Festival of Contemporary Music.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas Quiz
</P>
<P>
   What are the top holiday season songs? According to Marilyn
Bergman, president and chairman of ASCAP, the American Society of
Composers, Authors and Publishers, the most performed songs are led
by ``White Christmas,'' by Irving Berlin. Next in order are ``Santa
Claus Is Comin' to Town,'' by J. Fred Coots and Haven Gillespie;
``The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire),'' by Mel
Torme and Robert Wells; ``Winter Wonderland,'' by Felix Bernard and
Richard Smith, and ``Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,'' by Johnny
Marks.
</P>
<P>
   Among the top 25, ``Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town'' and ``Winter
Wonderland'' are the oldest, dating from 1934. The most recorded
song is ``White Christmas,'' with more than 500 versions in dozens
of languages.

DAVID L. BABSON, 87; `REAL PIONEER IN EQUITY INVESTING' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   David L. Babson, an influential investment counselor once
described in Forbes magazine as ``a prophet with honor. . . and
profits,'' died Monday in his home in Lyndeborough, N.H. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Babson was the founder of David L. Babson &AMP; Co., an
investment counseling firm that was handling about $3 billion in
private investments when he retired in 1978. He was known for his
yankee work ethic as well as his remarkable record of
prognostications.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, when President Kennedy banned any rise in steel prices,
and glamour stocks such as IBM and Xerox lost value in the market,
Mr. Babson told his followers they were in the middle of a major
buying opportunity. . . and he was right. In February 1968, in the
midst of a conglomerate craze, he put out a warning that the end of
the bull market was in sight. . . and he was right. When the market
bottomed out in May 1970, he saw a historic chance to purchase
quality stocks at rock-bottom prices. . . and he was right again.

   Wednesday, Brad Perry, who succeeded Mr. Babson as president of
David L. Babson &AMP; Co., described him as a ``real pioneer in equity
investing who really developed the modern concept of growth stock
investing.'' He explained that prior to Mr. Babson's innovations,
most people invested in stocks for their dividends and were
primarily concerned with the preservation of capital, not with
growth.
</P>
<P>
   The Jan. 1, 1974, issue of Forbes magazine decribed Mr. Babson
as a ``prophet with honor. . . and profits.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of Gloucester, Mass., he grew up on the family dairy
farm and delivered milk as a boy. In a profile published in the
September 1973 issue of Money magazine, he recalled hurrying home
from Harvard College one summer elated over some particularly good
grades. Spotting his father digging in the vegetable garden, he
trotted out to him and reported the good news. His father, a
veterinarian as well as a dairyman, listened with approval, then he
said, ``That's fine, son, but you've been home 10 minutes now, and
you still don't have your overalls on.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Harvard in 1932, he went to work for his
cousin, Roger W. Babson, at Babson Reports, where he became a vice
president and director when he was 26 years old. He founded David
L. Babson &AMP; Co. in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Babson worked in the radiation laboratory at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology during World War II while operating his
investment firm on nights and weekends.
</P>
<P>
   A practical, unassuming man, he was known to wear khakis and
hunting boots to the office, and commuted to work in an
unpretentious Chevy.
</P>
<P>
   Perry said, ``He had all the good characteristics of a Yankee.
He was sensible, hard working, forthright, and frugal.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a town meeting member in Wellesley, Mass. for more than
40 years and the chairman of the town's veterans housing authority
and its board of public works. He was a member of the finance
committees of the New Hampshire Charitable trust and Monadnock
Hospital in Peterborough, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves a son, David L. Jr. of Ossipee, N.H.; two daughters,
Susan Babson Young of Sheffield, Mass. and Katherine L. Jr. of
Wellesley; six grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.

A OP CURATOR IS LEAVING THE WHITNEY FOR SOHO POST
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lisa Phillips, the curator of contemporary art at the
Whitney Museum of American Art, is leaving the institution after 23
years to become director of the New Museum of Contemporary Art in
SoHo.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Phillips is the fourth top curator to resign from the
Whitney since Maxwell L. Anderson took over the museum as director
in September. The museum's associate director for public programs,
Constance Wolf, announced her departure from the Whitney earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the curators resigned after their positions were
diminished in a staff reorganization, but Anderson said Ms.
Phillips' move took him by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspected that at some point Lisa would find a new challenge
irresistible,'' he said. ``It made my decision to put her at the
helm of contemporary art justified. My first question was could her
mind be changed, and she said no, that this has been something she
had hoped for for some time.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of unfilled curators' jobs ``gives me an amazing
amount of latitude to think about the future of the Whitney,''
Anderson added.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Phillips will succeed Marcia Tucker, the New Museum's
founding director. During her years at the Whitney, Ms. Phillips
organized such broad thematic exhibitions as ``Beat Culture and the
New America: 1950-1965'' and ``Image World: Art and Media
Culture.'' She also was involved in every Biennial exhibition from
1985 to 1993. In 1997 she was the Biennial's curator.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great opportunity,'' said Ms. Phillips. ``The New
Museum has tremendous integrity in its commitment to contemporary
art, which is something I want to explore and expand on.
Contemporary art and culture is my principal love.'' She said she
had begun her discussions with the New Museum months before
Anderson's arrival, and described the new job as ``a perfect fit.''
</P>
<P>
   With her appointment, a bit of New York museum history comes
full circle. Before Ms. Tucker founded the new museum in 1977, she
worked at the Whitney as curator of contemporary art, resigning
shortly after the arrival of Thomas N. Armstrong 3d.
</P>
<P>
   At the time she said she left partly because she found the
museum too focused on the mainstream and unresponsive to new
developments in contemporary art. The mainstream has tended to be
Ms. Phillips' specialty with the organization of survey shows of
mid-career artists like Cindy Sherman, Richard Prince and Terry
Winters.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the New Museum has moved closer to the mainstream.
What began as a tiny institution in an office on Hudson Street
founded to promote innovative, cutting edge art has grown
significantly. In the process it has moved several times, from
Hudson Street to space at the Graduate Center of the New School for
Social Research to its current site on Broadway in SoHo in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   In March it unveiled a renovated and expanded building that is
now 33,000 square feet with more than double the previous program
space and a new bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   Saul Dennison, president of the New Museum's board, said of Ms.
Phillips, ``She really has a feeling for contemporary art, likes
artists, knows artists.''

   US-AIRSTRIKES _ WASHINGTON _ President Clinton ordered
airstrikes against Saddam Hussein Wednesday. The strikes were
expected to target the weapons stockpiles, strategic military
facilities and the communications systems through which Baghdad
controls the country. Coming on the eve of a Congressional
impeachment vote against Clinton, the precarious timing of the
attack was not lost on Congressional critics _ damaging chances for
bipartisan support. However, observers noted that the situation
follows months of conflict between Clinton and Saddam. White House
officials said the attack would likely continue on Thursday and
perhaps longer. Developing. (Deans, Cox News Service).

   US-IRAQ _ WASHINGTON _ The question: Is this wagging the dog? An
attack late Wednesday on Iraq caps off a year of living dangerously
for President Clinton and Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, who have
been locked for the past 12 months in a perilous game of
brinkmanship that has framed one of Clinton's most enduring foreign
policy dilemmas. The high stakes drama is being played out against
the background of an unseemly sex and deception scandal at the
White House, prompting Republican Congressional critics to charge
Clinton with trumping up a military strike to divert public
attention from his personal travails. ANALYSIS. (Deans, Cox News

the White House has steadfastly continued to rule out. (Monroe, Cox
News Service).

   IMPEACH-SCENE _ WASHINGTON _ The mood on Capitol Hill turned
from somber to ugly Wednesday as expectations grew of an imminent
air strike against Iraq. House Rules Committee Chairman and other
members accused President Clinton of endangering American lives in
a politically motivated bid to delay impeachment, a charge that was
angrily disputed by Democrats. The bitter exchanges highlighted the
aura of mistrust that has grown in Congress as impeachment moves
have gained momentum. (Dart, Cox News Service).

BOY'S DEATH OPENS KANSAS AGENCY TO CRITICISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DONALD BRADLEY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COUNCIL GROVE, Kan. _ When Timmy Post's grandmother saw marks of
a beating on the toddler this fall, she called the Kansas
Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services.
</P>
<P>
   Social workers examined Timmy on Sept. 23 and photographed his
bruises. They concluded that Scotty Adam, 24, the boyfriend of
Timmy's mother, had physically abused the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Social and Rehabilitation Services officials say Adam cried and
showed remorse when they showed him the photographs, and he
promised to stop the abuse. Social workers then had Adam sign a
pledge that he would never harm the boy again.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-nine days later, Timmy was dead. Adam is accused of
killing him.
</P>
<P>
   Timmy's death has unleashed a torrent of criticism against the
state welfare agency over its methods of determining when children
stay in homes, its communications with law-enforcement officials _
even its processes for checking the backgrounds of its social
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials say child welfare workers did their best to
protect Timmy, but the state will re-examine a policy that aims to
keep children and parents together whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors who treated Timmy at Wesley Medical Center in Wichita
said the 16-month-old had been shaken so hard that his brain had
swelled and his retinas had hemorrhaged. He had also been beaten.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys say Adam is not guilty in Timmy's death. On
Dec. 2, a Morris County judge ruled that there was sufficient
evidence to try Adam on charges of felony first-degree murder and
child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking back, we shouldn't have believed Mr. Adam,'' said
Roberta Sue McKenna, an attorney with the agency's legal
department.
</P>
<P>
   State officials generally don't discuss details of child welfare
investigations. But because of criticism from legislators and child
advocates, McKenna agreed to discuss the case.
</P>
<P>
   The ``family safety plan'' Adam signed is designed to keep
families intact and children in their homes, she said. But the
department will soon explore whether that policy is flawed and
needs to be changed.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say social workers, based on the earlier abuse, should
have removed either Adam _ or Timmy and his two sisters _ from the
house where they all lived with the children's mother in Council
Grove.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Sept. 23 abuse, Frederick Ramirez, the social
worker assigned to Timmy's family, had written a letter to the
Morris County attorney, asking that a ``child in need of care''
petition be filed to give the local court jurisdiction over the
children.
</P>
<P>
   That Sept. 3 letter, a copy of which was obtained by /{The
Kansas City Star/}, cited an apparent ``alcohol problem'' in the
home and said Adam was recovering from an alcohol-related car
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez wrote that Timmy's mother, Jessica McAuley Post, was
spending so much time helping Adam recover that she was putting her
children's needs second. He also wrote that Timmy's mother had not
cooperated with his suggestion that Adam reside elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although there have been no reports of abuse or neglect
received at this office, the alcohol//drug behavior does concern
me,'' Ramirez wrote in the letter.
</P>
<P>
   With others at the agency, Ramirez later investigated the Sept.
23 abuse. He was the one who confronted Adam with the photos and
told him to sign the family safety plan.
</P>
<P>
   Agency spokesman John Garlinger said it was Ramirez's
recommendation to resolve the abuse investigation that way, but
other people in the agency were consulted. Investigators at the
agency, he said, never make such decisions on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez left the state agency after Timmy died and could not be
reached for comment. His Topeka phone number has been disconnected.
</P>
<P>
   Post and everyone else who testified at the preliminary hearing
are under a gag order not to discuss the case.  &LR; brk:Past conviction
 &LR; tx:Critics say that in trying to protect Timmy, social workers
should have looked deeper into Adam's background. Then they might
have learned that Adam had been convicted in the stabbing death of
a Kansas State University student and had spent three years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should not have been an effort to keep this family
together,'' said Rene Netherton, a Topeka lawyer and frequent
critic of the state agency.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities allege that Timmy suffered fatal injuries Oct. 21,
after his mother went out to mow yards and left the children in
Adam's care.
</P>
<P>
   Timmy died the next day in the Wichita hospital.
</P>
<P>
   At a preliminary hearing earlier this month, Adam's attorneys
tried to show that Timmy's death could have been caused by falls
that took place several days earlier. But doctors said the injuries
occurred that day, probably within hours of Timmy's arrival at the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A KBI investigator testified that Adam told him he had treated
Timmy roughly that day and and had thrown him like a ``sack of
potatoes'' into a crib.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Phyllis Gilmore of Johnson County said Timmy's death
exposed flaws in the Social and Rehabilitation Services system.
</P>
<P>
   If an abused child is put back in the home, ``social workers
need to be held accountable for that decision,'' said Gilmore, who
has taken an interest in the child-welfare system. ``As long as we
allow them to hide within the `system,' the tragedies will
continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Arnold, executive director of Best Interest of the Child
Inc., an Overland Park-based advocacy group seeking reform of
Social and Rehabilitation Services, said statistics show that in 50
percent of fatal abuse cases, the child had been removed from the
home and returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making someone sign a promise they won't beat a child is not
enough,'' Arnold said. ``We can't put these kids back in there
based on a written promise and say, `Gee, I hope this works.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But Gary Brunk, executive director of Kansas Action for
Children, said tragedies such as Timmy's sometimes lead advocates
to jump to conclusions that there are deep flaws in the
child-welfare system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing what I know about the case, I'm not sure I wouldn't
have done the same thing as the social worker at that time,'' Brunk
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Brunk acknowledges that the state agency could be faulted
for not doing more to protect Timmy.
</P>
<P>
   Adam was convicted in 1993 of second-degree murder in the
K-State student's stabbing death. The conviction was later
overturned on a technicality, and a jury convicted him of the
lesser charge of involuntary manslaughter in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   An agency spokesman said child-welfare investigators do not
routinely look at the criminal record of everyone involved with the
child when investigating abuse cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't do a KBI (Kansas Bureau of Investigation) check on
every boyfriend who lives in a house,'' said Garlinger.
</P>
<P>
   And whenever possible, he said, children are kept in homes with
their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assuming that children are safe _ and that is job one for this
agency _ there is no doubt in our minds that a child's home is the
best place for a child to be,'' Garlinger said. ``The state is a
poor parent. ''  &LR; brk:Calls usually correct  &LR; tx:Social workers make
judgment calls every day about what is in the best interest of a
child, Garlinger said. Those decisions are often criticized _ they
took the child too quickly...they left the the child in the home
too long.
</P>
<P>
   But the correct call is made most of the time, Garlinger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of that means anything right now because Timmy Post is
dead,'' Garlinger said.
</P>
<P>
   But Timmy is dead, he said, because he was abused _ not because
of lack of effort by social workers.
</P>
<P>
   The agency initially tried to deflect some of the criticism by
pointing out that Morris County Attorney Matt Oleen had declined to
file the ``child in need of care'' petition, which could have
removed Timmy from the home.
</P>
<P>
   Oleen said he had declined because the Sept. 3 letter said there
had been no reports of abuse or neglect.
</P>
<P>
   McKenna said that a follow-up report was sent to Oleen after the
confirmed abuse on Sept. 23 and that a copy of the report is in the
case file. That report, obtained by /{The Star/}, says Adam
admitted the abuse. It made no recommendation that the children be
removed.
</P>
<P>
   But Garlinger said Tuesday that the agency could not confirm
that the report was received by Oleen's office in Council Grove.
Oleen said he never received the report, and voiced frustration
that he was not made aware of the additional information.
</P>
<P>
   Social and Rehabilitation Services officials now have backed off
from any criticism of Oleen.
</P>
<P>
   Netherton thinks the agency is making excuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once SRS gets involved in a child-abuse case, they have the
obligation to see that that child is protected,'' Netherton said.
``If those social workers had learned the facts about Mr. Adam,
they should have removed those children from that home.''
</P>
<P>
   Netherton is also highly critical of the agency for having had
Ramirez working as a social worker.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez was convicted in May of domestic battery in an incident
involving his wife. A judge sentenced him to six months in jail but
suspended the sentence and placed Ramirez on 12 months' probation
and ordered him to attend anger-control counseling sessions.
</P>
<P>
   He was also found guilty in 1997 of assaulting a law enforcement
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez had been with the agency four years when he left. Agency
officials said he was an excellent employee and was not fired.
</P>
<P>
   Garlinger at first said it was against agency policy for a
social worker with such a background to remain with the agency. He
said later, however, that Ramirez had informed supervisors about
his troubles and that the disclosure enabled him to keep his job.

CLINTON'S SURVIVAL SKILLS FACE EXTREMELY HARSH TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Apologies haven't worked, legal arguments haven't
worked, managing diplomacy on the global stage hasn't worked.
</P>
<P>
   His bottomless pool of personal charisma might as well be empty,
and his high-flying public approval ratings are proving to be cold
comfort.
</P>
<P>
   For Bill Clinton, the political walls are closing in. By the
weekend, short of a dramatic and successful political Hail Mary, he
will be only the second president in more than 200 years to face an
impeachment vote in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Why has a president who has constantly rewritten the book on
political survival been unable to save himself when it matters
most?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in a terrible bind,'' said Will Marshall, an official
with the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, a longtime Clinton
supporter. ``He wants to express contrition, but he can't simply
admit to a felony that then gives everybody a reason to vote for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got him over this barrel, and they are exploiting that
to the fullest. He can't give them what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael McCurry, Clinton's former press secretary and spokesman
throughout much of this year's scandal, agreed that the constraints
of his legal situation have tripped up his usual surefootedness.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the president has been able to charm votes from
reluctant congressmen and turn Republican strengths into Democratic
advantages.
</P>
<P>
   But this scandal ``is not conducive to that type of political
smooze,'' McCurry said. ``It is a world of fine lines and tortured
phrases. It sort of negates his ability to find a common
vocabulary. It is frustrating. In his mind, he has always separated
the personal from the performance of his official duties. In this
matter, all of that has been woven together.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself is a complex patchwork. He went from a rural
backwater to the halls of Yale and Oxford, from the statehouse of a
small Southern state to the White House. With his ``aw shucks''
over-the-fence-manner, he has an ability to make everyone in a
crowd feel as if he is speaking directly to them. Wrapped in his
slight Arkansas twang, words disarm and ingratiate, and set people
at ease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at the bean fields and the river bottoms, and when I
came into town, I felt like I was home,'' he told an outdoor rally
in Cairo, Ill. one evening during the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, he was discussing the intricacies of welfare
reform with a receptive roomful of corporate titans and Wall Street
investment bankers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for someone whose verbal gifts and political acumen is
praised by friends and enemies alike, Clinton has seemed
``peculiarly tone-deaf'' in this scandal, according to former aide
George Stephanopoulos.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always seems to say exactly the wrong thing,''
Stephanopoulos said on ABC Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   It began last January. With the scandal less than 2 weeks old,
when he had chance to take his hits early and move on, he
completely denied his affair with Monica Lewinsky. His face red,
his finger wagging, the president said in a news clip that will
forever haunt him, ``I want you to listen to me. I'm going to say
this again. I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss
Lewinsky. These allegations are false.''
</P>
<P>
   But his nationally televised apology in August, seven months
later, following several hours of grand jury testimony, didn't
satisfy his critics. He sounded petulant, they said. Neither did a
second, more expansive speech a few weeks later while he was on
vacation, nor a third attempt at the annual White House prayer
breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   His latest effort came last Friday just minutes before the House
Judiciary Committee approved its first article of impeachment
against him for allegedly lying before the grand jury about his
relationship with the former White House intern. Looking chastened
and weary, the president said, ``I am profoundly sorry for all that
I have done wrong in words and deed. I should never have misled the
country, the Congress, my friends or my family. Quite simply, I
gave in to my shame.''
</P>
<P>
   In a city where words are dissected and scrutinized like a
laboratory rat, that didn't measure up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like when you were a kid chasing a flashlight,'' said
Kiki Moore, a Democratic consultant and former Clinton campaign
aide. ``You don't have any control and there's no rationale to
predict where it's going to go next. The man said he said he was
sorry. What's he supposed to do?''
</P>
<P>
   But for all of his apologies, opponents question his sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fundamentally, he really is not sorry for anything that he
did,'' said former Republican congressman Robert Walker, a close
adviser to outgoing House Speaker Newt Gingrich. ``It can be said
he's sorry for getting caught. The fact is he doesn't believe what
most of the rest of the political establishment on Capitol Hill has
come to believe: that he lied and committed perjury. Until the Hill
hears something where he acknowledges the wrong that he's done,
until he does have some remorse, the situation is going to be very
difficult to come up with a message that works.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker hit the core of Clinton's dilemma. Though he's satisfied
the public _ one White House aide even argued that the president's
rhetorical and political skills were as strong as ever, evidenced
by the public's decision long ago to side with him _ he never
struck the proper chord with the audience that truly counted, the
capital's political class. Indeed, events over the past week have
borne that out.
</P>
<P>
   Polls continue to show that the public opposes impeachment and
supports censure. But the Judiciary Committee approved articles of
impeachment anyway _ on a partisan basis _ and the House Republican
leadership so far is refusing to allow censure as an option when
the issue comes to the House floor Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton now faces a dwindling pool of Republicans in Congress
who might buck their leadership's strong behind-the-scenes efforts
to encourage them to vote according to party dictates. Few
Republicans, and not a lot of Democrats either, trust the White
House because of past instances where they felt they were
politically burned or betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   And long-time friends and supporters also feel a sense of
frustration at the president's _ and their own _ inability to make
a breakthrough because, in the end, his predicament is of his own
making.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic National Committee member Gary LaPaille, a supporter
since 1990 who named his second son after the president, said, ``At
the beginning, we kind of felt, `God, why did you do something like
this? Your record was great, the economy was great, you were
charismatic. Why did you let your guard down?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Now they're left to hope that Bill Clinton's strong imperative
toward political survival, which has trumped any number of personal
and philosophical roadblocks, will somehow, even at this late date,
triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president should follow his own instincts and his own
conscience,'' Democratic Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, a
longtime ally, said Tuesday outside the White House. ``This is an
unprecedented moment. But this president been through an awful lot
in his life and he seems to always find reserves of strength. So he
is going to be tested in the next few days. This is a serious
moment, and potentially a destructive moment.''

CLINTON ORDERS ATTACK ON IRAQ ON EVE OF IMPEACHMENT VOTE  
 URGENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Will be updated with Clinton speech, House GOP plans)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton ordered U.S. missiles and
warplanes to strike Iraq Wednesday, triggering Republican
suspicions that the timing of the attack was designed to force the
House to postpone a vote on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Live televised coverage from Baghdad showed anti-aircraft
batteries firing into the night sky over the Iraqi capital at 12:29
a.m. Iraqi time _ 4:49 p.m. EST.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said Clinton launched Operation Desert Fox
in response to a report from chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard
Butler that Iraq had resumed cat-and-mouse efforts to hide
components of chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to
deliver them against U.S. allies such as Israel and oil-rich Arab
nations in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. offensive was the third attack on Iraq during the
Clinton presidency. A total of 24,100 U.S. military personnel were
in the region as well as the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise and 22
other U.S. warships. Eight of the vessels are armed with 300
Tomahawk cruise missiles capable of delivering 1,000-pound warheads
against targets with pinpoint accuracy. A second aircraft carrier,
the USS Carl Vinson, is due to arrive Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said more than 200 combat aircraft also were
available, including 15 Cold War-era B-52 bombers capable of firing
air-launched cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Rubin said that a pattern of
Iraqi defiance dating back to the end of the 43-day Persian Gulf
War in 1991 triggered U.S. military operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout these many long years, Iraq has managed to block,
impede, delay, and frustrate efforts to implement that resolution,
right down to today,'' Rubin said. ``There is no end in sight for
this pattern of obfuscation, obstruction and outright violation.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials insisted that U.S. military
action was not related to the president's impeachment struggle with
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The House had planned to vote Thursday on four articles of
impeachment and, though predictions on the outcome were scarce,
many uncommitted Republican House members were announcing plans to
vote for impeachment. House Republicans met late Wednesday to
determine the schedule for the impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing here is generated by Iraq's failure to comply,''
Rubin insisted to reporters at the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart also rejected
suggestions that Clinton was using military action to distract
attention from the impeachment fight. ``The president of the United
States makes national security decisions based on the best
interests of the United States of America,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., questioned the
timing of the strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both the timing and the policy are subject to question,'' Lott
said. ``While I have been assured by administration officials that
there is no connection with the impeachment process in the House of
Representatives, I cannot support this military action in the
Persian Gulf at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   House Rules Committee Chairman Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., accused
Clinton of ordering the attack to delay or even thwart impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``For him to do this at this time is just outrageous,'' Solomon
said. ``He should have delayed this. It would not have been
political the way it is today.''
</P>
<P>
   Solomon said he supported a House leadership decision to delay
an impeachment vote amid combat operations. ``We should not be
handling the impeachment while the bombing is going on _ and that's
exactly the reason (Clinton is) doing it.'' Solomon said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tillie Fowler, R-Fla., said she too feared that Clinton
might be ordering military action to stall impeachment. As Fowler
put it: ``I think this president is shameless in what he would do
to stay in office. He will use our military and he will use our
foreign policy to remain president.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee and a former Navy combat pilot during the Vietnam War,
said decisive action by Clinton would rally public support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there will be those who will question his motives
and timing,'' McCain said, adding: ``I think he will receive
significant support because it's pretty obvious that Saddam Hussein
is neither complying nor cooperating.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clinton continued efforts to urge Republican
moderates in the House to censure him rather than vote impeachment
for his cover-up of a sexual dalliance with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met privately at the White House with Rep. Amo Houghton,
R-N.Y., author of a White House-backed resolution of censure that
included a $500,000 fine. Clinton postponed a planned private
meeting with Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., another moderate
Republican who had told his constituents at a town meeting in
Norwalk, Conn., on Tuesday evening that Clinton's conduct fell
short of impeachable offenses. However, the Shays meeting was
postponed.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said the president remained ``committed to finding some
bipartisan compromise that allows us to put this issue behind us
short of impeachment,'' adding: ``We continue to try to reach out
across party lines to find a bipartisan solution or compromise to
put this behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Michael Castle, R-Del., an ally of Clinton's from their
days as governors, worked to persuade the House GOP leadership to
permit House consideration of his proposal to censure and impose a
$2 million fine on Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even at this late date, there are compelling reasons to pursue
a different course with a better solution for our nation,'' Castle
said.

</P>
<P>
   While Clinton worked behind the scenes, he left public lobbying
on his behalf to Vice President Gore, who still enjoys strong ties
with lawmakers on Capitol Hill after representing Tennessee in the
House and Senate for 16 years before joining Clinton on the
Democratic ticket in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and other Clinton administration officials have been
pressing the Republican House leadership to permit House
consideration of a resolution of censure. The vice president told a
group of business leaders at the White House that there was ``still
time for Democrats and Republicans to come together and embrace a
bipartisan compromise to seek a resolution that is both quick and
fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing unspecified dangers from ``excessive partisanship,'' Gore
said the best outcome to the impeachment quandary would be a deal
that ``transcends partisanship and puts in the top priority-place
what's best for the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a member of the House Judiciary
Committee who voted for three of the four articles of impeachment,
said that it was ``too late'' for Clinton to reverse expected
impeachment by the House.

   Keeping up is Job 1 for a columnist whose work is
issue-oriented. Keeping up means lots of reading. The reward of
lots of reading is finding nuggets of thought worth pondering.
</P>
<P>
   It occurred some years back that the best of these are worth
sharing, and the holiday season is a good time to do so. Harried
readers not only need light fare, but many also find themselves in
a reflective mood at this time of year. So, for your reading and
thinking pleasure, here are my candidates for the best quotes of
1998:
</P>
<P>
   Once you start thinking about retirement, you've already
retired. (Charles J. Carlsen, president, Johnson County, Kan.,
Community College)
</P>
<P>
   The new basic resource, information, differs radically from all
other commodities in that it does not stand under the scarcity
theorem, (but) under the abundance theorem. If I sell a thing...I
no longer have (it). If I impart information I still have it and
can sell it again and again...This will force us (to) radically
revise basic economic theory. (Management guru Peter Drucker)
</P>
<P>
   Income inequality is not a problem, but a natural consequence of
a free society. Nevertheless, judging capitalism by the standards
of communism is a favorite pastime of economists. The process
allows them to denigrate capitalism for not doing what (communism)
was supposed to do, but didn't. (Paul Craig Roberts)
</P>
<P>
   As Asia tries to grow out of its depression, it must encourage
consumer spending...Henry Ford paid his workers more so they could
buy his tin lizzies; if Indonesia wants a car industry, it will
have to do the same thing. (Walter Russell Mead)
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of day care often say it is essential for women's
equality in the work force...(However,) it is fathers who are
(often) the biggest fans of day care: They like the extra income
their wives can bring in...It is mothers who usually feel the sting
of guilt. (Andrew Peyton Thomas, lawyer and author)
</P>
<P>
   Cal Ripken was not immortal. He was just the best of ourselves.
(Joe Posnanski, /{Kansas City Star/} sports columnist)
</P>
<P>
   People keep telling me I could have made $8 million or $10
million a year as a free agent, but I make more money than I will
ever need. (Curt Schilling, Philadelphia Phillies pitching ace)
</P>
<P>
   It's not the money. (Various overpaid professional athletes)
</P>
<P>
   In choosing this path, I fear that the president has undercut
the efforts of millions of American parents who are naturally
trying to instill in our children the value of honesty. (Sen.
Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut)
</P>
<P>
   There are no German and American companies. There are only
successful and unsuccessful companies. (Thomas Middelhoff, chairman
of Germany's Bertelsmann AG, which this year acquired Random House
Inc.)
</P>
<P>
   Ribbons are getting to be as popular as the corporate logos that
adorn everything from automobiles to underwear. In a world of empty
gestures, it is one more way to make the wearers feel good or feel
connected or feel they are doing something useful, when they
probably are not. (Nicholas von Hoffman, /{New York Observer/}
columnist)
</P>
<P>
   I don't think many people really save a lot of time by moving
faster from one point to the next...You have to take advantage of
time, not speed. (Chuck Yeager, first pilot to fly faster than the
speed of sound)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Stephen Petronio Company took dancegoers on a
fascinating trip to hell on Tuesday night at the Joyce Theater. But
it should have provided a road map for the journey.
</P>
<P>
   The expedition, which lasted about an hour, was part of the New
York premiere of Stephen Petronio's ``Not Garden.'' It soon became
evident that if anything about this work was meant to refer to a
garden, that garden was not Eden. If pronounced aloud, the title
sounds especially appropriate for Petronio's knotted choreography.
</P>
<P>
   A program note explained that a slide projection showing Hebrew
letters was an inscription referring to immortality derived from
cabala. That proved good to know. Audiences might have found
another piece of information even more helpful.
</P>
<P>
   News releases stated that Petronio was inspired in part by
Dante's ``Inferno.'' Yet there was no reference to this in the
Playbill. ``Not Garden'' does not interpret Dante's poem literally.
Nevertheless, it is tied to it just closely enough as to warrant a
program note.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the ``Inferno,'' Dante says that in the
middle of his life he found himself lost in a dark wood. Petronio,
42, opened ``Not Garden'' with a solo in which he became a
modern-day Dante fumbling about the stage in a puzzled manner. The
accompaniment was a recording of the ``Ave Maria'' Gounod composed
on a theme by Bach, performed by the soprano Diamanda Galas and the
organist David Jett.
</P>
<P>
   The aria gave way to restless percussion music by David Linton
and the tortures of the infernal realms were evoked in choreography
for Kristen Borg, Steven Fetherhuff, Ori Flomin, Philip Gardner,
Ashleigh Leite, Jessica Meeker, Jenifer Weaver, Todd Williams and
Petronio. The dance was plotless. Yet, like Dante, Petronio
assigned specific people to hell, in this case by means of slide
projections naming famous 20th-century figures. It was an odd
assortment of villains, ranging from Hitler and Saddam Hussein to
Freud, Calvin Klein and Madonna. And when a slide listed ``Every
President'' among them, one wondered if Petronio might be guilty of
excessive spleen.
</P>
<P>
   It was more stimulating to forget the slides in this production
designed by Tal Yarden and Patricia Fox and to focus on the
choreography. Dancers turned relentlessly or rushed to and fro,
repeating movements over and over. No matter what they did, they
seemed fated. Just as Dante's doomed souls are eternally locked in
torment, so the dancers suggested that they were condemned to
perform their actions forever.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the second half of the two-part work Linton's score was
replaced by meditative music by Sheila Chandra. The choreographic
tone also changed. Petronio danced a calm duet with Ms. Borg, who
has been a member of his company for 15 years and who will leave it
at the end of this season. Standing side by side, they performed
unhurried steps in unison. Although they did not touch, they gave
the impression that a mystical bond united them. Other dancers
bounded joyously, perhaps as a reminder that Dante created more
than an ``Inferno.'' He also wrote a ``Purgatorio'' and a
``Paradiso.'' And the serene way in which ``Not Garden'' concluded
implied that Petronio thinks that paradise may not be hopelessly
lost.
</P>
<P>
   His production continues through Sunday night at the Joyce
Theater, 175 Eighth Ave.

DEAL COLLAPSES FOR A HOME ON BROADWAY FOR RANDOM HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Plans to move Random House to a new office tower in
Times Square died on Monday after last-minute efforts to revive
negotiations with a Broadway landlord failed to bring about a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Random House and its parent company, Bertelsmann AG, are now
looking for sites on the Avenue of the Americas and on the West
Side of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the project in Times Square is a setback for
Thomas Middlehoff, the new chairman of Bertelsmann, who had hoped
to plant the German media company's latest acquisition amid the
neon bustle on Broadway. The development site is across the street
from Bertelsmann's 44-story North American headquarters, on the
east side of Broadway between 45th and 46th Streets.
</P>
<P>
   Middlehoff had flown to New York for a meeting last Friday with
the landlord, Charles B. Moss Jr., to try to revive talks that had
gone on for more than six months. Afterward, Bertelsmann executives
were optimistic. But on Monday, Moss told them it it was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's finished,'' Robert Sorrentino, president of Bertelsmann,
said yesterday. ``Our discussions have ceased.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss, who lives in Aspen, Colo., did not return calls requesting
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsmann joins a line of unsuccessful suitors for the
property on Broadway, between 44th and 45th Street. Two developers
had wanted to build office towers there during the 1980s, but
failed to come to terms with Moss.
</P>
<P>
   Moss bought the property in 1977 for $4 million. His roots in
the building go back to the 1930s, when his father and grandfather
opened a movie theater there. Brokers say his blocklong stretch of
Broadway is among the most valuable parcels in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Moss began negotiations with Random House and
Bertelsmann. Under the terms of their tentative deal, Bertelsmann
would have paid Moss about $92 million to build a 35-story tower on
a platform over his existing building on Broadway. The deal would
have allowed Moss to keep the valuable retail space on the first
and second floors, as well as the billboards and neon signs that
festoon the building.
</P>
<P>
   With the negotiations seemingly headed toward a final agreement
in November, Bertelsmann hired a construction manager and an
architect for the project. City officials and most real estate
executives considered it a done deal that made sense for both
sides.
</P>
<P>
   But shortly before Thanksgiving, Moss balked, fearing that the
support columns needed for the platform would block out too much of
his retail space. People involved in the negotiations said Moss
demanded more money or fewer columns. Each side accused the other
of suddenly changing the terms of the deal. Moss has said that he
can get more than $12 million in net income from the space and
signs in today's market.
</P>
<P>
   Moss, who had issued eviction notices to his tenants, which
included the Roundabout Theater, has resumed talks with potential
tenants, including the Rainforest Cafe, real estate executives say.
</P>
<P>
   C. Bradley Mendelson, a broker with Insignia/ESG representing
Moss, said he had already received calls from possible tenants.

 &HT;    BLUES
 &HT;    Taj Mahal set a box of many vibes
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now a seasoned, walking compendium of blues styles, the man who
calls himself Taj Mahal once was a young acolyte in the church of
the holy jelly roll. He's part of a generation of performers who
came of age in the 1960s, sponging up the influence and folkwise
wiles of blues legends and unknowns enjoying a latter-day
spotlight. The singer and guitarist is a torchbearer whose surplus
of personality and exceptionally canny taste has made him an
entertainer with a personal stamp of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't play to please elitists,'' he declares in the notes
accompanying this 3-CD, career-spanning box set. ``I had my
father's bebop attitude.'' Which simply means the guitarist and
vocalist has never been concerned with passing fashion. His work,
handsomely collected, comes across as that of a one-man diaspora,
equally at home raising hell in the Texas Panhandle, catching the
breeze in the West Indies, reworking classic reggae tunes with
distinctive guitar picking, strutting with a tuba choir, going up
to country or slopping around the Chicago Southside.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of recent releases

<TEXT>
<P>
   R&AMP;B
</P>
<P>
   ``Bethlehem''
</P>
<P>
   Brian McKnight. Motown. 11 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   This probably would have been fine if it were just Brian
McKnight oozing his way over the expected Christmas songs. What
makes it exceptional is the company he keeps. Which proves that a
honeyed way with a verse must be in the genes, as the McKnight
Family Choir opens with a stirring ``Hail Mary,'' followed by pop
quartet Boyz II Men's more sensual reworking of the tune McKnight
penned for them, ``Let It Snow.'' Even beyond the vocals, simply
having a guest appearance from Mrs. Nat ``King'' Cole, who talks
about her 15 Christmases with her late, legendary husband, does as
much to set the emotional tone of this record as the many well-done
originals McKnight also offers.
</P>
<P>
   JAZZ
</P>
<P>
   ``Shades of Bey''
</P>
<P>
   Andy Bey. Evidence. 10 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Longtime jazz pianist and vocalist Andy Bey refuses to be pinned
down musically. And ``Shades of Bey,'' his second solo date, might
be the sleeper holiday gift for the jazz aficionado in your life as
a result. Bey, who's logged time behind the microphone with drum
wizard Max Roach and Count Basie bandleader Frank Foster,
seamlessly floats from a heart-stopping ballad like ``Pretty Girl''
to the uptempo improvisations of Thelonious Monk's ``Straight, No
Chaser.'' Strings and an acoustic guitar, meanwhile, add lushness
to the proceedings on ``River Man.'' Bey's voice is reminiscent of
Joe Williams, with maybe a touch more elasticity. Seek this one
out.

<P>
   SHOW TUNES
</P>
<P>
   ``Way Back to Paradise''
</P>
<P>
   Audra McDonald.
</P>
<P>
   Nonesuch. 14 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Few adjectives can aptly describe the instrument that is Audra
McDonald's voice. It soars, condemns, caresses, cajoles, all with
such honesty that you absolutely must listen. McDonald, a Broadway
star at age 28, follows her heart on this debut album. Instead of
reinterpreting standards as convention might dictate, she takes on
the songs of young composers. Her ``Way Back to Paradise,'' written
for an update of ``Medea,'' is a gumbo of opera, spirituals and the
syncopation native to New Orleans, where the new show is set. ``You
Don't Know This Man,'' from Alfred Uhry's ``Parade,'' is an
impassioned wife's angry defense of her jailed husband. There may
or may not be a Stephen Sondheim in this bunch of composers, but
one thing is certain: Their songs will never sound better.

 &HT;    Rhymes hits new heights on ``Extinction''
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Extinction Level Event'' arrives with a maelstrom of hits.
Finally, Busta Rhymes' musical accompaniment not only matches his
vibrancy of as hip-hop's most animated rapper, but seems to
challenge him to do more than see how fast he can get to the end of
each line. With an eye to the Y2K, and his teeth clenched as
always, Rhymes eases forcefully through attacks on his
short-sighted peers (``Against All Odds'') and the material
pursuits of some women (``Just Give It To Me Raw''). Then he hits
hyperspeed: verbally, with the equally-as-kinetic rapper Mystikal
on ``Iz They Wildin Wit Us &AMP; Gettin Rowdy Wit Us?''; and
figuratively, on a sweaty team-up with a cooing Janet Jackson
(``What's It Gonna Be?!''). Listeners only have a few uneventful
tracks at the start of the album to secure themselves, and prepare
for the explosion to come.

 &HT;    U.S. MILITARY FORCES WERE ALREADY DEPLOYED
 &HT;    With US-AIRSTRIKES-1217.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In contrast to the U.S.-Iraqi standoff six weeks
ago, the current crisis over United Nations weapons inspections
found U.S. military forces already in place.
</P>
<P>
   The troops, planes and ships sent to the Persian Gulf region in
mid-November were still deployed Wednesday morning (EST), when
President Clinton says he decided to order an attack on Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon spokesman described the forces deployed against Iraq
as:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  24,100 armed troops from all four branches of the U.S.
military.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  22 ships, of which 15 are combatant vessels and seven are
support ships. The combatant ships include the U.S.S. Enterprise, a
nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, and eight smaller ships, which
were armed with Tomahawk cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  201 aircraft, including land-based planes, 50 strike aircraft
on the Enterprise and an undisclosed number of helicopters on the
Marine Corps' helicopter assault ship, the U.S.S. Belleau Wood,
which was deployed to the Gulf from its base in Sasebo, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft also include 15 B-52 bombers based in the Indian
Ocean island of Diego Garcia. The B-52s carry air-launch cruise
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the Pentagon said aircraft poised to strike Iraq
included 24 Air Force F-16s and 12 F-15s and 12 F-117 Stealth
fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The more than 24,000 U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf represented
a slightly larger contingent than the 21,500 troops deployed in
November.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon had said the November breakdown of troops was Navy,
12,000; Army, 4,900; Air Force 2,400 and Marine Corps, 2,200. It
was not clear before the air strikes Wednesday evening which
services provided the additional 2,600 troops now in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The Enterprise had been scheduled to replace the U.S.S.
Eisenhower as part of a normal rotation of U.S. carriers
permanently cruising the Persian Gulf. U.S. Defense Department
officials had said last month that the Eisenhower might remain in
the Gulf, along with the Enterprise for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   However, it was not clear earlier Wednesday whether the
Eisenhower had been withdrawn _ or if it had, where it is now.

`FREEDOMLAND': IN A FAMILY THIS SKEWED, THOSE IDS RUN AMOK

  EDS: Production notes are at the end of review.

   NEW YORK _ Imagine, for a moment, that Sam Shepard has a midlife
crisis and decides that what he really wants to be is a television
comedy writer. He goes to the Fox Network with the proposition of
turning the Pulitzer Prize-winning ``Buried Child,'' his demented,
Gothic variation on the American family drama, into a series.
``Sure,'' the producers tell him, eager to be associated with the
prestige of Shepard's name. ``But could you possibly make it a
little more like `Family Ties'?''
</P>
<P>
   The pilot for such a show might be something like
``Freedomland,'' the lively, messy comedy by Amy Freed that opened
last night at Playwrights Horizons. Like ``Buried Child,'' it is a
tale of returning to the bile and chaos of the old family
homestead. Unlike ``Buried Child,'' it is an alarmingly perky play,
brimming with whimsy and topical allusions as it considers the now
classic breed of dysfunctional family produced by the wild and
crazy parents of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The results are as jagged as anything in a New York theater.
Staged by Howard Shalwitz of the Woolly Mammoth Theater Company in
Washington, the evening hits peaks of go-for-broke humor. But it
progresses in fits and starts, and it is pervaded with a feeling of
trying to be cute, outrageous and socially significant all at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the cast members, talented actors all, have difficulty
in presenting characters that are more than an assemblage of spiky
eccentricities. ``Freedomland'' provides a trove of moments that
will make you laugh whenever you remember them, but it doesn't
achieve the organic flow to carry you through its exceedingly wordy
duration without checking your watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freedomland,'' commissioned and first produced by the fertile
South Coast Repertory Co. in Costa Mesa, Calif. (the starting place
for the excellent ``Wit'' and ``Three Days of Rain''), depicts a
donnybrook of an unplanned family reunion. It takes place at a
rambling upstate New York house, designed with perspective-blurring
verve by Loy Arcenas. It's the home of Noah Underfinger (Dakin
Matthews), a retired, spacey professor. His first wife walked out
on him and the children to become a rail-riding hobo, and he now
lives with a 50ish, sexually swinging therapist named Claude (Robin
Strasser).
</P>
<P>
   Noah's wool-gathering life is interrupted when he finds ``my
offspring springing back at me like the jaw of a loaded wolf
trap.'' And quite a brood they are, all having spent their lives
trying to compensate for their unmoored childhood in radically
different ways.
</P>
<P>
   There's the tightly wound, judgmental Sig (Veanne Cox), a
successful painter of sad-eyed circus clowns; the terminally unsure
Polly (Carrie Preston), a floundering academic who is still
struggling to complete her doctoral thesis on the women of the
``Iliad,'' and the ferociously virile Seth (Jeffrey Donovan), a
back-to-nature boy with a penchant for blowing up institutional
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   In tow are Seth's companion, Lori (the charming Heather
Goldenhersh, who brings to mind Meg Tilly in ``The Big Chill''),
heavily pregnant with a baby by her abusive first husband, and
Titus (Jeff Whitty), a young and influential art critic writing an
article about Sig. The members of this dangerously assorted company
ride their respective hobby horses as furiously as possible in a
competition of quirks, recriminations and cries for attention.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these confrontations are very funny, savage, skewed
cartoons of familiar family frictions. Noah and Seth face off in
blustery exchanges of threats that switch abruptly into convulsive
laughter, something Noah identifies as ``the theater of men.'' The
sisters bait each other with id-stabbing taunts. (In one of the
better running jokes, Polly finds the twisted subtext in Sig's
sentimental paintings.) And Claude keeps trying to open Titus'
``damage package'' in ways that involve an antique set of stocks
and Oedipal role playing. The earth child Lori just can't get
anyone to listen to her.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cox, Ms. Preston and Donovan are at their best in their
high-adrenaline moments. They are far less confident in their
quieter scenes, just as the play sags when it settles down into
more lyrical reflections on damaged souls. The work's concluding
description of a family visit to the amusement park of the title
packs none of the emotional wallop it has to. Ms. Freed is clearly
more at home with sound and fury than coherence and contemplation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Strasser and Whitty are indeed amusing in their respective
incarnations of sexual predator and naive victim. And Matthews is
excellent as a restlessly aging man with scrambled synapses. You
feel that Noah's eccentricities have not been thrust upon him but
are the organic result of the particular life he has lived. The
same cannot be said of the other lost souls in ``Freedomland.''

`SWAN LAKE': ALL FIRE AND ICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON _ The Stanislavsky Nemirovich-Danchenko Ballet from
Moscow came into its own on Tuesday night with its splendid
signature piece, Vladimir Bourmeister's 1953 revisionist staging of
``Swan Lake.''
</P>
<P>
   With a smartly rehearsed corps led by a soulful and glamorous
Lilya Musavarova as Odette-Odile and Georgi Smilevsky as an
all-too-human prince overwhelmed by fate, the company was visibly
more at home here than in ``The Nutcracker,'' which opened its
season last week at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   This is not your conventional ``Swan Lake.'' As a vibrant
theatrical spectacle, it is all fire and ice. Bourmeister's
choreography for a fiercely dramatic ballroom act has a devilish
red glow. The evil magician Rothbart turns the usual floor show
into a stunning entertainment intended to confuse the prince. It
isn't just Odette, the Swan Queen who is a maiden by night, who
appears in a vision to reproach Prince Siegfried for his betrayal
of their love. Even her malicious double, Odile, initially appears
and disappears as a seductive mirage amid an array of menacing
character dancers.
</P>
<P>
   It is a dazzling scene heightened by its contrast to the
ice-blue images of the lakeside acts, in which Siegfried encounters
the swan maidens.
</P>
<P>
   That Odette was, so to speak, once a full-time maiden is at the
narrative core of this production. One of Bourmeister's prime
innovations was to add a prologue and epilogue. Before Act I
begins, Odette is a human, picking flowers for a bouquet. When she
climbs onto a ledge on a huge rock, she is caught in the oversized
wings of the owl-like Rothbart, who rises up as a shadowy shape
above her.
</P>
<P>
   The epilogue reverses the action. Odette and Siegfried, through
true love, break Rothbart's spell. They throw themselves into a
simulated flood that Tchaikovsky had in mind in his original score
for ``Swan Lake.'' Thanks to a blackout, the tutu-clad Swan Queen
raised by Siegfried is transformed into the original princess, now
in a pink dress, as the rock and presumably Rothbart crumble behind
them.
</P>
<P>
   So many of Bourmeister's ideas have seeped into other Russian
and Western productions of ``Swan Lake'' that it is difficult to
imagine the initial impact of his rethinking of this 19th-century
classic, now usually seen in the 1895 version choreographed by Lev
Ivanov and Marius Petipa.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Bourmeister went back to Tchaikovsky's score for
the first version of ``Swan Lake,'' choreographed by Julius
Reisinger in 1877 for the Bolshoi Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Bourmeister found in archival sources the supposedly lost music
for Act III, the ballroom scene, that George Balanchine used in his
1960 ``Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Black Swan'' pas de deux in Bourmeister's version is thus
danced to the music for the adagio and male solo in the Balanchine
showpiece. Odile's solo is danced to music often used in Russian
productions, and the coda music was used by Frederick Ashton in a
Royal Ballet production.
</P>
<P>
   Bourmeister restored the flood that the 1895 version discarded
for a happy apotheosis. But the uplift of Soviet esthetic policy
did not allow for Tchaikovsky's tragic ending, and Bourmeister
reunited the hapless regal lovers in his epilogue.
</P>
<P>
   In Bourmeister's ``Swan Lake,'' which the company claims to have
faithfully preserved, it is clear that he hoped to modernize a
19th-century classic by restoring its characters' psychological
motivations.
</P>
<P>
   He rechoreographed the entire ballet, except for Act II, where
he retained Ivanov's choreography for the swan maidens, as staged
by Pyotr Gusev. Act I is reoriented dramatically to show the prince
and his knights dancing with peasant girls in the waltz. The
peasants are modest, with eyes cast down, and they hide when the
Queen Mother enters with her retinue. The prince is clearly not
interested in the brides that the Queen suggests he choose.
</P>
<P>
   The jester of Soviet productions is interwoven into the
choreography. Vitaly Breusenko was first-rate in the intelligent
bravura of this part. The usual pas de trois is danced by two
couples with some input from the prince, who dances to the music
usually heard in the ``Black Swan'' adagio.
</P>
<P>
   As a classical company, the Stanislavsky dancers may lose some
purity of style at times. But the female corps was flawless in Act
II, where Ms. Musavarova's unfolding and beautiful line carved the
requisite shapes in space with consistent lyricism.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov knew best. But Bourmeister's third act may actually
improve on Petipa's character dances, all rechoreographed to
vibrant effects with Kadria Amirova leading four men with twirling
red capes. The new duet for the Black Swan had some awkward
moments, although Smilevsky was exemplary in his acting and
technique, and Ms. Musavarova offered some perfect fouettes.
Vladimir Arefiyev designed the 1993 sets, including the imposing
ballroom decor. Georgi Zhemchuzhin conducted, accenting the lyrical
without bombast.  &QL;

`MESSIAH': A MODERNIST `MESSIAH' CALLS ON THE SAINTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK &UR;  &LR; _ Hearing Handel's ``Messiah'' at St. Thomas Church on
Tuesday evening, sung with a combination of devotional serenity and
fervor by a red-robed choir of men and boys arrayed before a vast
wall of carved saints, a listener could easily mistake the work for
an official part of the Episcopal Christmas liturgy. Its libretto,
fashioned from biblical excerpts, begins with prophecy from Isaiah,
traces the sweep of Jesus' life, and ends with doctrinal thoughts
on redemption. And parts of the music _ the choruses ``Since by Man
Came Death'' and ``Worthy Is the Lamb,'' for example _ show the
degree to which Handel, transplanted to England from Germany, had
absorbed the accents and cadences of the Anglican church music that
Purcell wrote a generation earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But of course, ``Messiah'' was composed as a sacred work for
secular use, to be performed in theaters rather than churches. And
although Handel composed it in the heat of the summer, over three
weeks in August and September 1741, he intended the work for
performances around Easter, not Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Still, fair is fair: given the number of masses, requiems and
other truly liturgical works that have migrated to the concert
hall, who could begrudge St. Thomas _ or the dozens of other
churches that present ``Messiah'' performances over the next few
weeks _ the right to poach this magnificent, picturesque oratorio
from the concert repertory?
</P>
<P>
   St. Thomas' annual presentation, at any rate, has in recent
years come to be the ``Messiah'' to hear, if you're going to hear
only one. It has a rightness that, for this listener, eludes most
concert readings. Part of that is a sense of dignity that the
setting imposes. It's not that Carnegie Hall or Avery Fisher Hall,
which both offer ``Messiah'' performances this week, are
undignified, but there, ``Messiah'' is just another concert, part
of the commerce in entertainment. At St. Thomas, the atmosphere is
that of a sacred service, and Handel's intentions notwithstanding,
that atmosphere elevates the music.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the question of style. ``Messiah'' is no more
immune to changes of musical fashion than any other work, yet with
this work, older fashions don't fade away; they become part of a
spectrum that includes everything from grandly scaled Victorian
readings accompanied by huge modern orchestras, to gospel-funk
rescorings. St. Thomas' ``Messiah,'' which is conducted gracefully
by Gerre Hancock, the church's organist and choirmaster, offers a
streamlined, modernist view of Handelian antiquity. The sound of
boy trebles and altos distinguishes its well-trained choir. Concert
Royal provides bracing period instrument textures, including John
Thiessen's brilliant solo playing on a valveless trumpet. And the
vocal soloists ornament their lines in deference to the Baroque
penchant for improvisatory embellishment.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Hancock's pacing and approach to dynamics and
balances seemed dictated more by the sentiments of the text and the
pictorialism of Handel's score than by dogmatic notions of Baroque
style, let alone the received tradition rooted in favorite
recordings. So the chorus ``Let Us Break Their Bonds Asunder'' was
delivered at a breakneck pace, and the final ``Amen'' was given an
unusually spacious tempo.
</P>
<P>
   There was also something appealingly egoless in most of the solo
singing. Jeffrey Thomas brought a light timbre to the tenor lines.
Jennifer Lane, the mezzo-soprano, had some awkward moments when the
music reached toward the bottom of her range, and in the fast
``Refiner's Fire'' figuration, but her contributions elsewhere were
lovely. Amanda Balestrieri's soprano lines had clarity and
shapeliness. And if Curtis Streetman's bass solos were sometimes
slightly mannered, his rich timbre made his lapses forgivable.
</P>
<P>
   There is a second performance Thursday at St. Thomas, on Fifth
Avenue at 53rd Street.

 &HT;    Thriller takes novelist Kay in a new direction
 &HT;    By Don O' Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One thing readers of Terry Kay have come to expect is
the unexpected. Kay, a former Atlantan who lives in Athens(Ga.),
never covers the same literary territory twice. When publishers
urged him to cash in on the success of ``To Dance With the White
Dog'' with a similar Southern family novel, Kay abandoned the South
altogether to write about a midlife romance in New York's Catskills
in ``Shadow Song.'' After that, he tackled the intricacies of race
relations in Georgia's pre-civil rights era in ``The Runaway.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I get bored writing in the same voice,'' Kay says. ``If I
could find a genre I really like, I might stick with it.''
</P>
<P>
   With his new book, ``The Kidnapping of Aaron Greene'' (Morrow,
$25), Kay veers off into the adventure-thriller field. Set in
Atlanta, the story focuses on a young bank mail clerk who is
kidnapped and held for an $11 million ransom. All tape-recorded
messages from the kidnappers are delivered to Atlanta Journal
reporter Cody Yates. And, inexplicably, the voice on the tapes is
his.
</P>
<P>
   The key point of the novel, Kay says, is that the kidnap victim
is an ordinary person.
</P>

   ``At one time or another, everyone has felt like nobody,'' Kay
says. ``Suddenly there's a nobody who gets into the news and all
the other nobodies respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Kay began writing the story when he worked as a film and theater
critic for The Atlanta Journal nearly 30 years ago. ``It started as
a concept for a screenplay, but I never did anything with it. I did
have a great experience with the actor Richard Harris, though. He
was in town one night and I told him about the story and he said it
was a great idea. A couple of years later, I saw him when he came
back to Atlanta and he introduced me to his new wife and, without
any prompting from me, told her about my story. To me, that was a
fine compliment.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kay is working on three other novels and waiting for
final word on Hallmark Hall of Fame's plans for ``The Runaway,''
which is tentatively scheduled for filming next summer.

   NOT ENOUGH CHARM: If you can't get picked for Oprah's Book Club,
winning the National Book Award apparently is the next best thing.
Since garnering the top fiction award Nov. 18, Alice McDermott's
``Charming Billy'' (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $22) has been flying
off the shelves. The novel about a group of Irish-Americans who
gather after Billy Lynch's funeral to recall his wrecked life has
sold more than 80,000 copies in hardcover, and many stores are out.
``It's been selling like crazy,'' says Bonnie Welch of Wordsworth
Booksellers in Decatur, ``but we could sell a lot more if we could
get copies. We've had it on back order for two weeks.'' For readers
who can wait, the paperback edition is to be published in January.

   AUTHOR FAVORITES: If you wonder what books some famous authors
loved this year, check out Amazon.com's Web site. Eighteen authors,
including Alice Hoffman, Elmore Leonard and Sara Paretsky, talk
about the books they most admired in 1998. Leonard raves about
Andre Dubus' collection of essays, ``Meditations From a Movable
Chair,'' and Barbara Kingsolver's ``The Poisonwood Bible.'' He also
recommends ``Into Thin Air'' by Jon Krakauer and ``The Perfect
Storm'' by Sebastian Junger. Hoffman, author of ``Practical
Magic,'' praises ``Final Vinyl Days,'' Jill McCorkle's book of
short stories. And mystery writer Paretsky says she loved Rose
Tremain's ``The Way I Found Her,'' Arthur Golden's ``Memoirs of a
Geisha'' and McDermott's ``Charming Billy.'' But, she says, ``The
book that stands out most vividly for me is Joseph Skibell's `A
Blessing on the Moon.' I read it three times.''

   GREEN PASTURES: Better late than never. Effie Leland Wilder was
85 years old when Peachtree Publishers released her first book,
``Out to Pasture, But Not Over the Hill'' (Peachtree Publishers,
$14.95). The novel about adventures in a nursing home is now in its
eighth printing, and two other Wilder novels, ``Over What Hill''
(Peachtree, $14.95) and ``Older But Wilder'' (Peachtree, $14.95)
have gone into multiple printings, for a total of 320,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Quinlin, president of Peachtree Publishers, is
overwhelmed by the response. ``Of course we loved the stories and
believed that a significant portion of the reading population _ the
over-60 set _ would enjoy these novels. But, to be honest, even we
would never have predicted just how popular her books would be.''
Now 89, Wilder spends her time writing and answering fan mail at
the Presbyterian Home in Summerville, S.C.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As a young girl in Trinidad, Cynthia Leveine used to
peek from her windows to catch a glimpse of the steel bands,
defying her parents, who forbade her to listen to the popular
street music that was tapped out on refurbished 55-gallon metal
drums.
</P>
<P>
   ``You dared not ask about it,'' said Ms. Leveine, who is now in
her 50s and lives in East Flatbush, Brooklyn. ``It was the music
for the people who lived on the other side of the tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Leveine, who immigrated to New York 30 years ago, vowed
that her children would not only listen to the soothing sound; they
would also learn to play the steel drum, or pan, as it is commonly
called. And to her joy, Ms. Leveine's 22-year-old daughter,
Jacquii, a music major at City College, has been playing the steel
drum for nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The drumming of Jacquii Leveine is part of a rising sound of the
pan in those New York City neighborhoods transformed by the large
influx of Caribbean immigrants. Reflecting a growing appreciation
for steel drums in the Caribbean and around the world, the drum has
even taken a place next to the trumpet and clarinet as a musical
option for students at some city schools. Its popularity has been
increased immeasurably by the annual West Indian American Day
Carnival, the sprawling pageant that showcases the artistry of the
steel drum.
</P>
<P>
   This is all a bit of a passage for the pan, which was once
burdened by its image as an instrument of rabble-rousers _ an image
promoted earlier this century by Trinidad's British rulers, who saw
the music as a magnet for subversive gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way the world turns,'' said the elder Ms. Leveine.
``Parents are realizing the value of the instrument. Music is music
no matter how and who plays it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx, many public schools now offer
steel drum classes as part of their music education programs, and
professional pan players who migrated from Trinidad and other
islands are offering private lessons. Many bands that take part in
the Carnival celebration are also conducting classes for
teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   The instruments, which were once fashioned crudely out of used
oil drums, are now custom-made at several storefronts in Brooklyn
where entrepreneurs make a living carving, tuning and painting
drums for sale. They sell for about $500 to $900, said William
Jones, a steel drum aficionado from Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers, who now form the core of many steel bands in
Brooklyn, hold jam sessions in so-called pan yards, a term borrowed
from the outdoor sites where steel drums are played in the
Caribbean. They are drawn to the pan yards by camaraderie and by
the sound of the drums.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it's like another language,'' said Horace Moore, 17, of
East Flatbush, who was at a steel drum jam session on a recent
night at the St. Francis of Assisi Church on the edge of Crown
Heights in Brooklyn. ``At its highest, the steel drum has a crisp,
straight sound with no aftereffect.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicole McCarthy, 17, who was playing a double drum set nearby,
chimed in: ``It's really soothing. It's like you're in this groove
and you're making a sound unlike anything we're used to here.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCarthy's friend Sandra Thompson, 17, pointed to Ms.
McCarthy and said: ``I started playing because of her. I used to go
to her house, and her father and her played it and it sounded good.
So now I'm into it.''
</P>
<P>
   The steel drum is trimmed with chisels and tuned with sledge
hammers. It produces muted, bell-like tones. As a solo instrument,
the steel drum does not compare well with some other instruments
like the guitar. But in an orchestra, it produces a full, melodic
sound. A typical steel band ranges in size from about 10 to 140
members, each playing drum in tenor, soprano, baritone and bass.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The origin of the steel drum as an instrument is credited to
Winston Simon, a popular Trinidadian musician who recognized in the
1930s that a dented section of a barrel head produced a tone. The
instrument was assailed by the British colonials, who ruled
Trinidad from 1797 to 1962, as a tool for popular uprising and
banned its playing. The British view of steel drums took hold in
the upper reaches of Trinidad's society.
</P>
<P>
   By 1967, however, the drum's stigma had begun to lift. Now the
steel drum, which carries the full chromatic range of notes and
produces just about any type of music from classical to calypso,
has become as much an icon of the region as a swaying palm.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 200 professional steel bands throughout
Trinidad, and steel drum is taught side by side with mathematics
and science in most schools. Nearly every school has a steel band.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steel pan is a natural art form,'' said William Jones, founder
and executive director of the Caribbean American Sports and
Cultural Youth Movement, which runs one of the largest steel bands
in New York, a perennial winner of the Carnival's band contest.
``It comes out of the black poor of the island. It is spontaneous
and at the same time formal.''
</P>
<P>
   The excitement of the instrument is also drawing non-Caribbean,
particularly black American, youngsters looking for a different
music than the blues, jazz or hip-hop that dominate their musical
environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never explored this sound before,'' said William
Johnson, 19, a psychology major at Medgar Evers College in Crown
Heights, who is not of Caribbean ancestry. ``I wanted to try it.
It's a delicate instrument; you have to hit the notes just right.''
</P>
<P>
   Steel drum has gained momentum in the city's public schools,
which received $25 million last September from the administration
of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to restore arts and music programs that
were cut several years ago. Schools like George W. Wingate High
School in Brooklyn have used some of the money to buy more steel
drums and to expand steel drum classes.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Morgano, the school board's director of arts education for
Brooklyn, said that having steel drum classes helps ease the
transition for newly arrived Caribbean students.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it opens American-born students to something
different. ``I see it growing,'' Morgano said of steel drum classes
in the public schools. ``I think you will see that instrument
introduced in a more avant-garde sort of way by blending it with
other instruments.''

MEGGETT, PARCELLS TEAM UP _ AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ They had stayed in touch throughout the
season. Bill Parcells never forgot his favorite kick returner, and
Dave Meggett never forgot his favorite coach. They are friends.
They chatted a lot. Now, again, they also are boss and employee.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells-Meggett, Part III, was unveiled Wednesday when the
former Giant and Patriot showed up and donned the green of the New
York Jets. Meggett has not played a down this season while
recovering from foot surgery, but he told Parcells he thought he
could help. That was enough for the Jets coach, who needed exactly
what Meggett provides after returner Leon Johnson went down for the
season with a serious rib injury.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was sealed Sunday night in a phone call, which went
thusly, according to both men.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells: ``Tell me where you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Meggett: ``I can help you right now if you need me.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells: ``That's all I need to know.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets worked out Meggett, 32, Tuesday and signed him for the
rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched him for about two minutes and I knew he was OK,''
Parcells said. ``I think David will be a quality replacement. He
can do all the things that Leon can do. And he knows our system.''
</P>
<P>
   He also knows about half the team. Pepper Johnson and Jumbo
Elliott were teammates when the Giants won Super Bowl XXV on Jan.
27, 1991. His locker is adjacent to former New England teammate
Curtis Martin, who praised Meggett for his ``versatility and
leadership. He's a great guy, and I'm glad he's here.'' Keith
Byars, also a former Patriot teammate, sits on the other side of
Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to have Dave,'' Byars said. ``He knows what it's all
about.''
</P>
<P>
   No one expressed concern about Meggett's off-field activities.
In February, he was charged with assault and robbery stemming from
an incident with a prostitute in Toronto. The assault charge was
dismissed. He also has been taken to court on several paternity
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Toronto situation, Parcells said, ``I talked to
him the day after, and he told me it was a setup. David has always
been up front and truthful with me. He's never lied to me. I've
never had a single problem with him over discipline. He's never
late. He never missed a practice. He's tough as nails.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto incident did, however, help prompt the Patriots to
release Meggett in May. At the time, he was recovering from surgery
on his left foot, which he injured in the Patriots' playoff loss to
the Steelers. While working out this fall, he was taking five
classes at Towson State University, his alma mater, and had a final
exam in sports management scheduled Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take an incomplete,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meggett said he basically relaxed this past season, waiting for
his foot to heal. He cracked, ``I feel kind of good. I didn't have
to do the work to get us here. But I enjoy the pressure of a
playoff atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about leaving New England, Meggett was vague.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happened,'' he said. ``I never questioned
it. I think it was a business decision. I don't understand what
kind of personal situation it might have been. Those people didn't
know me. But I'm not going to cry about it or make a big stink.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither is Parcells, who does know Meggett. The Jets coach is
looking at a huge game Saturday in Buffalo and thinks Meggett will
be able to play. Then there is the season finale against the
Patriots, followed by the playoffs. Meggett Time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be presumptuous,'' Parcells said, ``but this
guy is a money player. When the money is on the line, this guy
shows up. Always has.''

 &HT;    CONGRESSMAN: CLINTON PONDERED 'WAG THE DOG' PERCEPTION
 &HT;    With US-AIRSTRIKES-1217.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As President Clinton flew back from the Middle East
Tuesday night, he agonized over the political implications of
bombing Iraq in the face of an impeachment debate in the U.S. House
of Representatives, according to a participant in the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Alcee Hastings, D-Fla., who flew back on Air Force One with
Clinton, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and a
congressional delegation, said Clinton discussed the matter after
it was raised by Rep. Rick Lazio, D-N.Y. Lazio could not be reached
Wednesday for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one used the term 'Wag the Dog' ... (but) there was obvious
concern,'' that military action in the face of a possible
impeachment would be viewed as a cynical effort to dodge
impeachment, Hastings said. The movie ``Wag the Dog'' earlier this
year was about a fictitious president who launched a bogus war to
divert attention from a sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings said he told Clinton: ``You have to do what you have to
do as if there were no impeachment. He said he felt that is what he
must do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastings said he was confident Clinton did not order the
military strike to delay impeachment. If anything, he said the
threat of impeachment forced Clinton to prove he could act to
protect the United States' interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many things have to be taken into account,'' Hastings
said. ``The Joint Chiefs of Staff are not crazy. If it were not
absolutely necessary to do this, they would have told him. The CIA
is not crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastings said he was convinced the strike was the result of
military and national security advice that had nothing to do with
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impeachment can wait, it ain't going nowhere.''

DAVID L. BABSON, 87; `REAL PIONEER IN EQUITY INVESTING' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   David L. Babson, an influential investment counselor once
described in Forbes magazine as ``a prophet with honor. . . and
profits,'' died Monday in his home in Lyndeborough, N.H. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Babson was the founder of David L. Babson &AMP; Co., an
investment counseling firm that was handling about $3 billion in
private investments when he retired in 1978. He was known for his
yankee work ethic as well as his remarkable record of
prognostications.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, when President Kennedy banned any rise in steel prices,
and glamour stocks such as IBM and Xerox lost value in the market,
Mr. Babson told his followers they were in the middle of a major
buying opportunity. . . and he was right. In February 1968, in the
midst of a conglomerate craze, he put out a warning that the end of
the bull market was in sight. . . and he was right. When the market
bottomed out in May 1970, he saw a historic chance to purchase
quality stocks at rock-bottom prices. . . and he was right again.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Brad Perry, who succeeded Mr. Babson as president of
David L. Babson &AMP; Co., described him as a ``real pioneer in equity
investing who really developed the modern concept of growth stock
investing.'' He explained that prior to Mr. Babson's innovations,
most people invested in stocks for their dividends and were
primarily concerned with the preservation of capital, not with
growth.
</P>
<P>
   The Jan. 1, 1974, issue of Forbes magazine decribed Mr. Babson
as a ``prophet with honor. . . and profits.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of Gloucester, Mass., he grew up on the family dairy
farm and delivered milk as a boy. In a profile published in the
September 1973 issue of Money magazine, he recalled hurrying home
from Harvard College one summer elated over some particularly good
grades. Spotting his father digging in the vegetable garden, he
trotted out to him and reported the good news. His father, a
veterinarian as well as a dairyman, listened with approval, then he
said, ``That's fine, son, but you've been home 10 minutes now, and
you still don't have your overalls on.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Harvard in 1932, he went to work for his
cousin, Roger W. Babson, at Babson Reports, where he became a vice
president and director when he was 26 years old. He founded David
L. Babson &AMP; Co. in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Babson worked in the radiation laboratory at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology during World War II while operating his
investment firm on nights and weekends.
</P>
<P>
   A practical, unassuming man, he was known to wear khakis and
hunting boots to the office, and commuted to work in an
unpretentious Chevy.
</P>
<P>
   Perry said, ``He had all the good characteristics of a Yankee.
He was sensible, hard working, forthright, and frugal.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a town meeting member in Wellesley, Mass. for more than
40 years and the chairman of the town's veterans housing authority
and its board of public works. He was a member of the finance
committees of the New Hampshire Charitable trust and Monadnock
Hospital in Peterborough, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves a son, David L. Jr. of Ossipee, N.H.; two daughters,
Susan Babson Young of Sheffield, Mass. and Katherine L. Jr. of
Wellesley; six grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.

IN KIEFER'S GERMANY, THE PALETTE IS THE MYTHICAL FORCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By JOHN RUSSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Works on paper'' in the context of art can cover
the whole gamut of human experience. Rembrandt and Rubens, Watteau
and Goya, Ingres and Cezanne _ all made works on paper that can
change us for ever.
</P>
<P>
   But ``works on paper'' can also mean nice little pictures that
never puzzle or disconcert. The German painter Anselm Kiefer has
never made images like that, and it is clear from his new
exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum that he's not going to begin
doing it now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anselm Kiefer: Works on Paper in the Metropolitan Museum of
Art'' fills several large galleries and has 54 items, most done
between 1969 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a loan show that will sit there for a few weeks and
then slip out the back door. Everything in it belongs (or has been
promised) to the Met. Faith and confidence in any one artist could
hardly go further, and all the more so because Kiefer has always
tapped into a vein of latent Europhobia when shown in this country.
</P>
<P>
   As he was born in March 1945 and has always treated the Nazis
with irony, ridicule and contempt, he cannot be called (in one of
today's favorite adjectives) ``Nazi-tainted.'' But quite often he
goes back and back in his imagination to the distant past of
Germany, to which so much in the way of myth and legend can be
traced. What are these myths and these legends, he asks, and what
have people made of them?
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, for instance, he constructed a model of a deep mountain
cave in Thuringia. In that cave, the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa
was believed to have been waiting since the 12th century for the
moment at which he would emerge to restore the greatness of
Germany. But when Kiefer deals with that legend in the present
show, it is not the bearded Emperor who sits at the bottom of that
cave. It is a palette that stood for ``the unknown painter'' who
will one day redeem his country. Over and over again, in this show,
the palette reappears as a force for good.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most striking instance of this is the ``St.
Eustace'' of 1974. One of the wonders of older German art is the
engraving by Albrecht Durer in which the future St. Eustace
suddenly comes upon a stag that has a crucifix between its horns.
Using a Polaroid photograph of a reindeer that he had taken in
Norway, Kiefer worked it up in his own way and substituted a golden
palette for the crucifix. Rough and ready as it may be, by
comparison with Durer, the image has an ungainly force that is all
his own.
</P>
<P>
   But Kiefer is not only Euro-centered in the sources of his
inspiration. In 1971, he made a relatively straightforward
watercolor in which a man lies on the ground, naked, with a
complicated branch of a tree sprouting from his abdomen. The
curator of the show, Nan Rosenthal, tells us in her catalog that
this image relates to 15th- and 16th-century painted books from
Mesoamerica, ``where it was believed that a family originated as if
born from a tree.'' As Kiefer was first married in 1971, this
notion may well have caught his fancy at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the images in the new show were inspired by travels not
in Germany but in Israel, in Yugoslavia or in northernmost Norway.
These travels were not a matter of superior tourism. They allowed
him to make unexpected leaps in time and place and thereby to renew
the element of surprise in tales too often standardized.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rosenthal points out, for instance, that in painting ``The
Miracle of the Serpents'' from the Book of Exodus, Kiefer managed
to make a vital point in the story by including an Art Deco light
fixture from the 30th Street train station in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every image in the show uses three or more modes of
expression. They might look cranky or perverse, but they don't,
even when they include torn and pasted photographs and also draw
upon gouache, acrylic, watercolor, shellac or ballpoint pen. If
these elements do not ``harmonize'' in traditional ways, it is
because they aren't meant to. There are no norms in Kiefer's
methods of work.
</P>
<P>
   The works on view in the Met are installed in such a way that we
simply can't hurry along. We have to stop and look at every one. It
was a bold idea to give them the kind of space that is normally
reserved for Old Master paintings, but the compulsory breather pays
off.
</P>
<P>
   It takes time, for instance, to work it out that the image
called ``Heinrich von Fallersleben: The Belt'' gives a completely
new twist to the song that is all too familiar to us as
``Deutschland, Deutschland Uber Alles.'' The third verse of that
song, now the German national anthem, is a plea for ``unity, law
and liberty,'' and Kiefer based his image on a photograph of the
winding waterway that now provides a peaceful passage through Kiel
Bay and on to Denmark and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the show, there is a startling change of scale.
The historical rationale for this is provided by the gigantic
``Triumphal Arch'' commissioned by the Emperor Maximilian from
Durer and others and lent by the National Gallery of Art in
Washington for this show.
</P>
<P>
   Measuring 135 by 114 inches, it is hefty competition, both in
scale and in quality. But in 1977-78 Kiefer made a number of
composite woodcuts. One of them measured 125 by 151 inches, and the
others were not much smaller. Huge, up-front and full-bodied, they
are reprises, one after another, of Kiefer's major German
obsessions.
</P>
<P>
   There is a concise dictionary of national biography in which
great men, bad men and monsters in human shape all figure. There is
Brunnhilde's horse, Grane, with the last scene of
``Gotterdammerung'' already well under way. And there is ``Untitled
(the Rhine)'' in which Hitler's ``Soldiers' Hall'' (planned
1938-41, but never built) is parked, like a stately encumbrance, on
the banks of the Rhine, quite some way from Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Works likes these call for long looking and close thinking. It
is very much to the credit of the 20th-century department of the
Met that it has assembled what is apparently the largest single
Kiefer collection to be found in any museum anywhere.  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The last impeachment trial of a president _ Andrew Johnson _
took 74 days. But back then there were fewer TV soap operas to
interrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton says we must do more for our farmers. Yes, but in
this holiday season we're already eating as much as we can.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can build a future on hope,'' Mr. Clinton told Israel on
his Middle East trip, ``that is different from the past.'' However,
it's unclear whether he can do that for himself in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a holiday TV special we bet would get a lot of viewers:
``A Very Monica Hanukkah.''
</P>
<P>
   At last count three House Democrats have said they'll vote for
impeachment. Or, as they may be known in the White House,
Damnocrats.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say how the impeachment vote will go in the House.
But you have to wonder why there's been no similar push to impeach
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been condemned by my accusers with harsh words,'' Mr.
Clinton says. And by himself with weaselly words.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better to be hated for what you are,'' says Al Gore,
``than to be loved for what you are not.'' Right, but here's our
corollary: It's even better to be hated only by nincompoops.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Kerrey of Nebraska has decided not to run for president
in 2000. So have we, but it didn't make the wires.
</P>
<P>
   Crime rates continue to fall in the country. Maybe more and more
potential criminals are waiting until they get elected to office.
</P>

   The courtroom was packed as testimony began in the sentencing
hearing of a woman convicted of murdering her husband of 20 years
by poisoning his coffee.
</P>
<P>
   The defense attorney knew he had his work cut out for him in
order to make his client appear more sympathetic to the Judge,
since she had been so `matter-of-fact` about the whole thing all
during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   `Mrs. Roth,` he began, `was there any point that morning where
you felt pity for your husband ?`
</P>
<P>
   `Well... yeah... I guess...` she replied.
</P>
<P>
   `And when was that?` pressed the attorney.
</P>
<P>
   `Well... when he asked for his third cup.` she said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HEAVEN AND HELL &LR;
</P>
<P>
   When we were looking to buy property I had this overzealous
realtor show us what can only be described as a totally worn-out
old farm. I mean the land had just been worked to death. The weeds
were hardly even growing.
</P>
<P>
   The smiling supersalesman said, `Now really, all this land needs
is a little water, a nice cool breeze and some good people.`
</P>
<P>
   I replied, `Yeah, I agree, but couldn't the same be said of
Hell?`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IDIOTS ARE EVERYWHERE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Police in Radnor, Pa., interrogated a suspect by placing a metal
colander on his head and connecting it with wires to a photocopy
machine. The message `He's lying` was placed in the copier, and
police pressed the copy button each time they thought the suspect
wasn't telling the truth. Believing the `lie detector` was working,
the suspect confessed.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ATTENTION SKIERS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Ski season is here. The following is a list of exercises to help
you
</P>
<P>
   prepare:
</P>
<P>
   Soak your gloves and store them in the freezer after every use.
</P>
<P>
   Fasten a small, wide rubber band around the top half of your
head before you go to bed each night.
</P>
<P>
   If you wear glasses, begin wearing them with glue smeared on the
lenses.
</P>
<P>
   Throw away a hundred dollar bill - now.
</P>
<P>
   Find the nearest ice rink and walk across the ice 20 times in
your ski boots carrying two pairs of skis, accessory bag and poles.
Pretend you are looking for your car. Sporadically drop things.
</P>
<P>
   Place a small but angular pebble in your shoes, line them with
crushed ice, and then tighten a C-clamp around your toes.
</P>
<P>
   Buy a new pair of gloves and immediately throw one away.
</P>
<P>
   Secure one of your ankles to a bedpost and ask a friend to run
into you at high speed.
</P>
<P>
   Go to McDonald's and insist on paying $8.50 for a hamburger. Be
sure you are in the longest line.
</P>
<P>
   Clip a lift ticket to the zipper of your jacket and ride a
motorcycle fast enough to make the ticket lacerate your face.
</P>
<P>
   Drive slowly for five hours - anywhere - as long as it's in a
snowstorm and you're following an 18 wheeler.
</P>
<P>
   Fill a blender with ice, hit the pulse button and let the spray
blast your face. Leave the ice on your face until it melts. Let it
drip into your clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Dress up in as many clothes as you can and then proceed to take
them off because you have to go to the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Slam your thumb in a car door. Don't go see a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Repeat all of the above every Saturday and Sunday until it's
time for the
</P>
<P>
   real thing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NOT SURE IF I USED THIS ONE .... &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A rabbit one day managed to break free from the laboratory where
he had been born and brought up. As he scurried away from the
fencing of the compound, he felt grass under his little feet and
saw the dawn breaking for the first time in his life.
</P>
<P>
   `Wow, this is great,` he thought. It wasn't long before he came
to a hedge and after squeezing under it he saw a wonderful sight -
lots of other bunny rabbits, all free and nibbling at the lush
grass.
</P>
<P>
   `Hey,` he called. `I'm a rabbit from the laboratory and I've
just escaped. Are you wild rabbits?`
</P>
<P>
   `Yes. Come and join us,` they cried. Our friend hopped over to
them and started eating the grass. It tasted so good. `What else do
you wild rabbits do?` he asked.
</P>
<P>
   `Well,` one of them said. `You see that field there? It's got
carrots growing in it. We dig them up and eat them.` This, he
couldn't resist and he spent the next hour eating the most
succulent carrots. They were wonderful. Later, he asked them again,
`What else do you do?`
</P>
<P>
   `You see that field there? It's got lettuce growing in it. We
eat that as well.` The lettuce tasted just as good and he returned
a while later completely full.
</P>
<P>
   `It's fantastic out here in the world!` he told them.
</P>
<P>
   `So, are you going to live with us then?` one of them asked.
`I'm sorry, I had a great time but I can't.` The wild rabbits all
stared at him, a bit surprised. `Why? We thought you liked it
here.`
</P>
<P>
   `I do,` our friend replied. `But I must get back to the lab. I'm
dying for a cigarette.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OLD COOT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   An elderly gentleman had serious hearing problems for a number
of years. He went to the doctor and the doctor was able to have him
fitted for a set of hearing aids that allowed the gentleman to hear
100%.
</P>
<P>
   The elderly gentleman went back in a month to the doctor and the
doctor said, `Your hearing is perfect. Your family must be really
pleased that you can hear again.`
</P>
<P>
   The gentleman replied, `Oh, I haven't told my family yet. I just
sit around and listen to the conversations. I've changed my will
three times!`

   Police in Radnor, Pa., interrogated a suspect by placing a metal
colander on his head and connecting it with wires to a photocopy
machine. The message `He's lying` was placed in the copier, and
police pressed the copy button each time they thought the suspect
wasn't telling the truth. Believing the `lie detector` was working,
the suspect confessed.

   Ski season is here. The following is a list of exercises to help
you
</P>
<P>
   prepare:
</P>
<P>
   Soak your gloves and store them in the freezer after every use.
</P>
<P>
   Fasten a small, wide rubber band around the top half of your
head before you go to bed each night.
</P>
<P>
   If you wear glasses, begin wearing them with glue smeared on the
lenses.
</P>
<P>
   Throw away a hundred dollar bill - now.
</P>
<P>
   Find the nearest ice rink and walk across the ice 20 times in
your ski boots carrying two pairs of skis, accessory bag and poles.
Pretend you are looking for your car. Sporadically drop things.
</P>
<P>
   Place a small but angular pebble in your shoes, line them with
crushed ice, and then tighten a C-clamp around your toes.
</P>
<P>
   Buy a new pair of gloves and immediately throw one away.
</P>
<P>
   Secure one of your ankles to a bedpost and ask a friend to run
into you at high speed.
</P>
<P>
   Go to McDonald's and insist on paying $8.50 for a hamburger. Be
sure you are in the longest line.
</P>
<P>
   Clip a lift ticket to the zipper of your jacket and ride a
motorcycle fast enough to make the ticket lacerate your face.
</P>
<P>
   Drive slowly for five hours - anywhere - as long as it's in a
snowstorm and you're following an 18 wheeler.
</P>
<P>
   Fill a blender with ice, hit the pulse button and let the spray
blast your face. Leave the ice on your face until it melts. Let it
drip into your clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Dress up in as many clothes as you can and then proceed to take
them off because you have to go to the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Slam your thumb in a car door. Don't go see a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Repeat all of the above every Saturday and Sunday until it's
time for the

   A rabbit one day managed to break free from the laboratory where
he had been born and brought up. As he scurried away from the
fencing of the compound, he felt grass under his little feet and
saw the dawn breaking for the first time in his life.
</P>
<P>
   `Wow, this is great,` he thought. It wasn't long before he came
to a hedge and after squeezing under it he saw a wonderful sight -
lots of other bunny rabbits, all free and nibbling at the lush
grass.
</P>
<P>
   `Hey,` he called. `I'm a rabbit from the laboratory and I've
just escaped. Are you wild rabbits?`
</P>
<P>
   `Yes. Come and join us,` they cried. Our friend hopped over to
them and started eating the grass. It tasted so good. `What else do
you wild rabbits do?` he asked.
</P>
<P>
   `Well,` one of them said. `You see that field there? It's got
carrots growing in it. We dig them up and eat them.` This, he
couldn't resist and he spent the next hour eating the most
succulent carrots. They were wonderful. Later, he asked them again,
`What else do you do?`
</P>
<P>
   `You see that field there? It's got lettuce growing in it. We
eat that as well.` The lettuce tasted just as good and he returned
a while later completely full.
</P>
<P>
   `It's fantastic out here in the world!` he told them.
</P>
<P>
   `So, are you going to live with us then?` one of them asked.
`I'm sorry, I had a great time but I can't.` The wild rabbits all
stared at him, a bit surprised. `Why? We thought you liked it
here.`
</P>
<P>
   `I do,` our friend replied. `But I must get back to the lab. I'm
dying for a cigarette.`

   An elderly gentleman had serious hearing problems for a number
of years. He went to the doctor and the doctor was able to have him
fitted for a set of hearing aids that allowed the gentleman to hear
100%.
</P>
<P>
   The elderly gentleman went back in a month to the doctor and the
doctor said, `Your hearing is perfect. Your family must be really
pleased that you can hear again.`
</P>
<P>
   The gentleman replied, `Oh, I haven't told my family yet. I just
sit around and listen to the conversations. I've changed my will
three times!`

</P>
<P>
   The last impeachment trial of a president _ Andrew Johnson _
took 74 days. But back then there were fewer TV soap operas to
interrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton says we must do more for our farmers. Yes, but in
this holiday season we're already eating as much as we can.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can build a future on hope,'' Mr. Clinton told Israel on
his Middle East trip, ``that is different from the past.'' However,
it's unclear whether he can do that for himself in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a holiday TV special we bet would get a lot of viewers:
``A Very Monica Hanukkah.''
</P>
<P>
   At last count three House Democrats have said they'll vote for
impeachment. Or, as they may be known in the White House,
Damnocrats.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say how the impeachment vote will go in the House.
But you have to wonder why there's been no similar push to impeach
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been condemned by my accusers with harsh words,'' Mr.
Clinton says. And by himself with weaselly words.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better to be hated for what you are,'' says Al Gore,
``than to be loved for what you are not.'' Right, but here's our
corollary: It's even better to be hated only by nincompoops.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Kerrey of Nebraska has decided not to run for president
in 2000. So have we, but it didn't make the wires.
</P>
<P>
   Crime rates continue to fall in the country. Maybe more and more
potential criminals are waiting until they get elected to office.

   The courtroom was packed as testimony began in the sentencing
hearing of a woman convicted of murdering her husband of 20 years
by poisoning his coffee.
</P>
<P>
   The defense attorney knew he had his work cut out for him in
order to make his client appear more sympathetic to the Judge,
since she had been so `matter-of-fact` about the whole thing all
during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   `Mrs. Roth,` he began, `was there any point that morning where
you felt pity for your husband ?`
</P>
<P>
   `Well... yeah... I guess...` she replied.
</P>
<P>
   `And when was that?` pressed the attorney.
</P>
<P>
   `Well... when he asked for his third cup.` she said.

   When we were looking to buy property I had this overzealous
realtor show us what can only be described as a totally worn-out
old farm. I mean the land had just been worked to death. The weeds
were hardly even growing.
</P>
<P>
   The smiling supersalesman said, `Now really, all this land needs
is a little water, a nice cool breeze and some good people.`
</P>

   I replied, `Yeah, I agree, but couldn't the same be said of
Hell?`

THE POP LIFE: THE INDUSTRY VS. WEB PIRATES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill, Mass., Wis.)  (dal) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Chief executives at the major labels, heads of
technology companies and the Recording Industry Association of
America met to announce their Secure Digital Music Initiative on
Tuesday in Manhattan. They said that in the next year they hoped to
agree on a standard to deliver music to consumers on the Internet
through a system that would prevent piracy and insure that music
copyright holders were paid.
</P>
<P>
   The conference was, in some ways, a public relations move for
the music industry to look technology-friendly after a series of
lawsuits intended to stop pirate music activity on the Internet,
announcements criticizing manufacturers of CD players capable of
recording music and attempts to block the sale of the Diamond Rio,
a tiny portable stereo that plays some types of Internet music
files.
</P>
<P>
   The significance of the announcement is that the tiny sliver of
music fans buying songs and albums to download on their computer
seems likely to grow significantly once record labels support a
uniform, easy-to-use Internet standard and make more music
available.
</P>
<P>
   But in the record labels' slowness to adopt a standard and in
their debilitating worries about how to protect copyright holders
from Internet piracy and keep downloaded songs from being heard by
anyone except the user who paid for them, there are a few
fundamental fallacies at work in their logic.
</P>
<P>
   The industry fears that Internet digital song-compression
formats like the widely used MP3, which has no built-in security
system, combined with CD players with the capability of recording
music turn potential consumers into audio pirates. While there may
be some truth to their worries, it is likely that even without
protective devices, the music market won't be significantly hurt.
The fear is predicated on the belief that the majority of consumers
care so much about having music in a digital format that an analog
copy won't suffice.
</P>
<P>
   At present, all a music fan has to do to copy any CD or song on
the Internet is to attach a cassette deck to his computer and hit
the record button. Even before music was digital, the ability of
cassette decks (and reel-to-reel recorders before them) to make
unlimited copies of vinyl albums and tapes didn't seem to hurt the
business.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there's a funny little quirk to the new Philips
dual-tray CD recorder, the compact disk equivalent of a
tape-to-tape cassette deck for copying recordings. Like all such
digital music recording technology, it is equipped with the
mandatory Serial Copy Management System, which prevents consumers
from making digital recordings of any copied disks. But when users
try to copy such a disk, a message appears asking the user if he
would like to make an analog copy. For most music fans, the
analog-digital distinction is moot as long as they can hear the
music in some way.
</P>
<P>
   The second assumption is that free access to music for consumers
is going to cut into the profits of artists and record labels. The
industry fears the music fan who is able to make unlimited digital
copies. But what the industry does not take into account is that
the music fan is a fan, and free music on the Internet may well
send him into record stores to buy more music as he discovers new
acts or buy the actual CDs of songs he has downloaded. I receive
thousands of free CDs in the mail _ more than any Internet addict
has time to download _ and I still spend thousands of dollars in
record stores each year. Free music hasn't kept me out of stores;
it has made me more eager to explore newer acts, fringe genres and
the historical precedents of the music I like.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of the record business in the first years of the CDs
popularity because of consumers replacing their vinyl records
should have proved to record labels that people will buy the same
albums again and that they like to have the official version in the
popular format. If albums can be bought digitally as well, they may
even have fans paying all over again for a favorite CD or
collection of songs. At the news conference, no speaker was able to
provide concrete proof that Internet piracy was affecting sales. In
the meantime, a technological research company, Forrester in
Cambridge, Mass., has already determined that the number of disks
now being digitally downloaded on the Internet is not financially
meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   The other mistake the industry seems to be on the verge of
making is that representatives at the conference said they wanted
to sell downloadable albums for the same price as those bought in
stores, despite the fact that they will be saving money in raw
materials and shipping. After all, this is an industry that would
still like to see the cost of CD's rise to more than $20, more
comparable to prices in England and Japan. Cheap music on the
Internet, they say, will stabilize or even lower CD prices. But
even if record labels gave the music away, they could still make
more money. The Internet will allow them to find new sources of
revenue in inserting advertisements into downloadable music,
selling their databases of customers who have bought certain albums
and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we are still far from a digital distribution
takeover. Consumers don't have the room on their hard drives to
download enough CDs, and Web sites aren't built to handle the
volume of downloads that could occur the day a major hit goes on
sale. Instead of focusing on security and taking preventive
measures, the music business should be stimulating the market by
looking into improving (instead of limiting) technology, teaching
consumers how to use the Internet to download music and offering a
bigger and better selection of available music. There will always
be a way around any anti-piracy solution, just as there will always
be a way to steal CDs from record stores that have security
systems.
</P>
<P>
   LOOSE NOTES
</P>
<P>
   When he released his album ``Imagination'' last spring, the
reclusive former Beach Boy BRIAN WILSON did not think he would be
able to perform the music. A trial concert, filmed for a PBS
special with a limited audience last May in his hometown, Lake
Charles, Ill., found him tense and nervous. But by the end of the
concert, he was in top form and soon decided to embark on his first
solo tour. It begins on Feb. 14 in Milwaukee and ends on March 10
in Chicago, stopping at the Beacon Theater in Manhattan on Feb. 24
and 25. Wilson is to be supported by Joe Thomas, who produced the
album, and possibly by the Wondermints, an up-and-coming band of
Los Angeles retro-pop savants.
</P>
<P>
   The movie action hero STEVEN SEAGAL has signed a five-album,
seven-year recording contract with Outwest, a multimedia recording
company based in Los Angeles. His first album is due in 1999,
followed by a tour. Though the names of his films may sound like
Metallica albums _ ``Out for Justice,'' ``Above the Law,'' ``Fire
Down Below'' _ his music, a spokesman for Outwest said, will be
Southern rock.

DISNEY'S REVISED TOMORROWLAND IS AT ITS BEST WHEN TECHNOLOGY RUNS
AMOK 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Dec. 20.) 
(JT) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The good news for a visitor to Disneyland
these days boils down to this: Tomorrow doesn't work all that well.
And that dysfunction turns out to be the source of a lot of fun.
</P>
<P>
   Tomorrowland was one of the more important components of
Disneyland when it opened in Anaheim, Calif., 43 years ago. Walt
Disney thought of himself as a social visionary, and for him
Disneyland was only partly for fun. He deliberately included
Tomorrowland to educate as well as to entertain, to let the crowds
know why the future was going to be grand. It was a sort of
mini-world's fair with pavilions (underwritten by corporations)
displaying the technologies that, it was firmly believed, would
make the future effortless and bright.
</P>
<P>
   Tomorrowland, Disney optimistically intoned at the park's
dedication in 1955, offered ``a vista into a world of wondrous
ideas, signifying man's achievements.''
</P>
<P>
   Things did not work quite as planned.
</P>
<P>
   The atomic age, which Disney had praised as filled with promise,
turned out to be filled with dread. Technology, as we all know, has
created plenty of problems even while solving others. And
Tomorrowland's vision went a bit awry. Its nearly all-plastic House
of the Future, along with other oddities like the Bathroom of
Tomorrow and the Aluminum Hall of Fame, closed after a few years.
</P>
<P>
   The area, which takes up roughly 17 of Disneyland's 85 acres,
was updated piecemeal over the years, but by the late 1980s it had
become one of the less popular of the eight themed areas of
Disneyland and was deemed to need an overhaul. After several years
of planning (and a sort of trial refurbishment of the Tomorrowland
exhibition at Disney World in Florida in 1995), the new
Tomorrowland here opened in May. One of its more ambitious
attractions, Innoventions, just opened in November. Tomorrowland
(which is on the east side of Disneyland) is a mixed bag that
stands out from some of the more straightforward areas of the park,
like Adventureland and Fantasyland, and it has some real bright
spots.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more engaging attractions are those that have a sense
of humor about technology running amok, including the ``Honey, I
Shrunk the Audience'' 3-D movie and the Star Tours simulation ride.
In other words, the rewarding parts of ``tomorrow'' are the parts
that are all too human and flawed. By contrast, Innoventions, built
where the old Carousel of Progress had been, has an earnestness
that is off-putting, and in fact the technology on display is
hardly visionary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honey, I Shrunk the Audience,'' which is new, is set up as the
occasion when the movie's fictitious Prof. Wayne Szalinski is to
receive an award from the Imagination Institute. His invention, of
course, malfunctions during the ceremony, shrinking the audience to
the size of a shoebox, and great adventures ensue. In Star Tours, a
refurbished version of a longtime attraction based on the ``Star
Wars'' films, an inexperienced robot pilot takes the audience
careening around the universe in a spaceship, into and out of
trouble, with a great sense of levity.
</P>
<P>
   Not least, and on a more practical note, these are relatively
lengthy experiences, roughly 20 minutes, so the occasionally long
waits are rewarded with a sustained entertainment. That is a rarity
at Disneyland, where a family can easily spend twice as long in
lines as in the attractions. These Tomorrowland attractions are
also air-conditioned, something anyone who has visited Disneyland
with small children in the summer can appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   Innoventions is from the old school, though. It, too, is
air-conditioned, and a family can spend a fair amount of time
exploring its many offerings. Like some of the old attractions,
Innoventions is underwritten by corporations _ including Compaq
computers, General Motors, Honeywell home technologies and the
Kaiser Permanente health maintenance organization. It doubles as an
advertising platform, allowing them to show off their whiz-bang
future technologies _ near future, that is, so the items seem
familiar. Some portions are engaging, but it mostly consists of
computer monitors on which children can play various games, not the
sort of thing most are likely to have in mind for a trip to
Disneyland.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Disney Co. is a corporate leviathan, with revenues of more
than $20 billion a year. But the Disneyland experience has not
changed enormously over the years. Construction has begun in the
former front parking lot on what will be a $1.4 billion expansion,
which will include a Downtown Disney restaurant, shopping and
entertainment area and a new theme park to be called Disney's
California Adventure. But for now the park remains a somewhat
nostalgic form of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors enter onto Main Street, U.S.A., a sanitized vision of
19th- century America but with 1990s prices. There are lots of
shops selling Disney merchandise and the sort of overly sweet or
fatty foods most doctors have been discouraging parents from giving
their children for years. But it is a nice entree for children,
with lots of stimulation, from horse-drawn trams to old-fashioned
buses rumbling slowly down the street.
</P>
<P>
   This all makes a curious introduction to Tomorrowland. At the
end of the nostalgia of Main Street is a sunny circle, the Central
Plaza, with a bronze statue of Walt and Mickey in the middle. Look
left and you see the fortlike entrance to Frontierland, a version
of the Old West. Look right and you see the future, sort of.
</P>
<P>
   The new entrance to Tomorrowland underscores the highly
ambiguous attitude toward the future that Disneyland now embraces.
If there is such a thing as an old-fashioned future, this is it. It
could have been designed by Jules Verne.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The gateway is formed as though huge, bronze-hued crystals had
pushed up from the earth, opening to a ride called the Astro
Orbiter. This is a 90-second spin around a central axis on a huge
contraption designed to look like something Leonardo da Vinci
invented. It is decidedly retro, by design.
</P>
<P>
   Straight ahead you go from the Renaissance to Buck Rogers.
Disneyland has brought back the Moonliner, a 1950s, comic book
version of a rocketship. In this new incarnation, it dispenses
Coke.
</P>
<P>
   To the right is the Star Tours attraction, which is nearly
always crowded. A visitor enters what looks like the waiting lounge
at an airport, eventually snakes around to where some familiar
characters from the movies, R2D2 and C3PO, are working on repairing
a star fighter. It is a vivid revelation for a child who knows the
``Star Wars'' movies but has never actually visited a star port
before. The simulation ride's robot pilot bumps into everything in
the takeoff, nearly crashes repeatedly and finds himself under
attack before escaping unharmed. A good time is had and 20 to 30
minutes have passed.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Honey, I Shrunk the Audience'' attraction similarly uses
technology to create a realistic experience. Visitors wear 3-D
goggles and, after being shrunk, confront a herd of giant white
mice, are jarred by giant tennis shoes and sprinkled with a hail of
breaking glass, a stunning effect in the 23-minute 3-D film. Oh,
and watch out when the giant dog barks.
</P>
<P>
   Retained from the old Tomorrowland is the Space Mountain roller
coaster. The Saint-Saens music that accompanies the swirls and
twirls is performed by Dick Dale, famous for his guitar-slinging
surf music. Space Mountain is also usually crowded.
</P>
<P>
   Another throwback is the old Autopia attraction, a fancy name
for a ride in which little children can drive small, gas-powered
cars around a small course. This hails back to a time when driving
seemed futuristic rather than a nuisance. An old stalwart that has
recently been closed is the Submarine Voyage, an underwater
adventure that is being replaced.
</P>
<P>
   One newcomer is the Rocket Rods ride, which replaces the old
people-mover. The Rocket Rods cars zoom around overhead on the old,
elevated people-mover platforms. Disneyland has tried to give the
attraction a futuristic feel by describing it as a transit system
for tomorrow, and by having visitors first watch films on the
history of transportation. But the real entertainment is the ride,
which lasts only three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   To give Tomorrowland a focus, Disneyland has conjured up the
Observatron. This is what looks to be a cluster of transmission
dishes pointing into space. Every 15 minutes it comes to life,
putting on a show with music and swirling arms, pretending to
transmit a message into space. Watching this odd contraption rev
up, one wonders what kind of message it might be sending.
</P>
<P>
   One of the odder pretensions of the new Tomorrowland is that the
future is basically comforting and unthreatening, in sharp
opposition to the sort of images one usually sees in the movies. To
underscore this message, the area has been landscaped almost
entirely with edible plants. There are orange and persimmon trees
and everything from carrots to corn and lettuce.
</P>
<P>
   Though the local ducks often sneak over for a nibble on the
plants, the public is supposed to keep hands off. Not to worry. The
new restaurant in Tomorrowland is called Redd Rockett's Pizza Port.
It is standard Disneyland fare, in this case lots of pizza and
pasta, but this vision of ``tomorrow'' is drawn straight from the
1950s. It seems mankind, even in the future, will find some things
too good to leave behind.

ECONOMIC SCENE: AETNA'S SIZE COULD HELP PATIENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aetna Inc.'s proposed purchase of the health care business of
Prudential Insurance Co. of America has touched off concern among
doctors and consumers, but Aetna's size and market power could
ultimately benefit patients.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition would create the nation's largest health
insurer, serving one in every 10 Americans and writing contracts
with about half of the nation's physicians. Doctors fear the
behemoth will harden Aetna's already aggressive assault on tests
and procedures it deems excessive, and some consumer advocates
worry that an enlarged Aetna will bully patients. Rival insurance
companies recoil at the prospect of competing against a company
with the market power to negotiate steep discounts with hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   But the critics overlook a powerful reason in favor of the
takeover. If insurance companies spent most of the last decade
belligerently cutting costs, they will probably spend the next
decade evaluating the quality of patient care. Here, large plans
will have a decisive advantage. Tight oversight of patient care
requires hugely expensive computer systems that only large
insurance companies can afford.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna is creating such systems. So too is New York state's
largest insurer, Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield. In a rapidly
evolving business, size becomes the patient's friend.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Huber, president of Aetna, said as much when he
announced the deal for Prudential Health Care. He predicted that
``the wave of company-led cost-cutting is nearly complete. The next
big push will be quality.'' The large size of Huber's company does
not guarantee success. But without large size, it might well fail.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna's new heft will give it only 10 percent of the national
market and up to 30 percent of some regional markets. Those are not
formidable numbers. Besides, there are ample remedies if the
antitrust authorities find local pockets of excessive
concentration.
</P>
<P>
   Size will also help insurance firms create computerized data
systems that track diagnoses, treatments and prescriptions. The
idea is to flag errant care before it does harm. The huge
development costs for these computer systems can only be absorbed
if the insurer can spread the expense over many patients.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna has been developing clinical information systems for
almost a decade. Every time one of its 16 million customers files a
claim for a procedure, test or drug, the transaction enters Aetna's
computer files. Aetna distributes reports to each of its physicians
once or twice a year, telling them how their treatment of several
prominent medical problems compares with that of their peers.
</P>
<P>
   The physicians learn, for example, how many of their diabetes
patients, compared with diabetics nationwide, received an annual
eye exam. Aetna reports how many of the doctors' patients filled
their drug prescriptions and how many of their asthma patients
suffered attacks severe enough to send them to a hospital emergency
room. The company contends that doctors are responding to its
reports by slowly bringing their treatment practices in line with
recommendations by the major medical societies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Empire has created a sophisticated oversight system that so far
covers about 100,000 enrollees, including employees of Merrill
Lynch &AMP; Co. and Circuit City Stores Inc. The important feature of
Empire's system, says its president, Michael Stocker, is instant
feedback.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, Empire runs data on each of the 100,000 enrollees
through its computer to search for ``triggers'' _ events, like
admission to a hospital or prescription for a new drug _ that
justify subjecting the patient's medical record to careful
scrutiny. Empire says it pulls about 60 files a day for close
examination. It then turns the files over to a company that
examines the patient's labs tests, prescriptions and medical
procedures for evidence of mistaken diagnoses or inappropriate
treatment. The records are referred to academic specialists for
independent review.
</P>
<P>
   If the review turns up a problem, Empire's doctors call the
patient's physicians to suggest corrections. Empire says it makes
one or two such calls a day. Jamie Court, a prominent consumer
advocate in California, supports the use of computer systems ``when
their purpose is to root out errors rather than to deny care for
the purpose of cutting costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Empire points to cases where errant care was corrected before it
did harm. In the case of a patient admitted to a hospital for knee
surgery, it was found that he had been taking an unnecessarily
dangerous drug to combat colitis. Another patient was found to be
taking a blood thinner she did not need but not taking
anticholesterol drugs she did need. And, her records indicated, she
had not been properly examined for peptic ulcer disease.
</P>
<P>
   A third patient was found to be taking duplicate drugs both to
lower her cholesterol and to lower her blood pressure. Empire's
system provides daily checks, rather than the quarterly and annual
reports of many other clinical-data systems.
</P>
<P>
   Health maintenance organizations argue that, by putting a single
physician _ called a gatekeeper _ in charge of a patient's care,
they eliminate inconsistent therapies. Otherwise patients are prone
to visit multiple doctors who know little, if anything, about one
another. The intriguing feature of clinical-data systems is that
they harness computers to perform some of the error checking that
gatekeepers perform. There remains the important task of persuading
patients and physicians to adopt wise counsel, a difficult problem
that may turn out to be managed care's true advantage.

BUSINESS GROUP SEES GROWING BUDGET WOES IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES M. ODATO  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A fiscal watchdog group warned Wednesday that New
York's next few budgets will be short by billions of dollars unless
the governor eases the debt burden and cuts state jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the governor should take bold action because it
will help New York not only next year but long into the future,''
said Andrew Rein, a budget analyst with The Citizens Budget
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In its third annual budget preview, the commission emphasized
that Gov. George Pataki's spending and tax-cut commitments will
reduce revenue by billions of dollars. Pataki, a Republican, is now
putting together a 1999-2000 budget due by Feb. 1. The governor's
current budget plan predicted a budget gap approaching $2 billion
in the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Rein expects the gap to be closer to $2.5 billion and perhaps
twice that size in the following year.
</P>
<P>
   The warning of budget shortfalls from the commission concurs
with concerns raised repeatedly by state Comptroller H. Carl
McCall. The Democrat envisions a budget gap for the next fiscal
year of at least $1.8 billion, growing to $5.5 billion for the
fiscal year that begins on April 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Pataki administration will have at least $1.3 billion in
surplus left over from the current budget. But the Legislature will
want to spend much of that, Rein said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that money should be used to reduce the state's more
than $34 billion in taxpayer-supported debt. Payments on the
borrowing will cost $126 million next year.
</P>
<P>
   The surplus also should go toward early retirement initiatives
aimed at reducing the size of the state work force while avoiding
layoffs, Rein said. He recommended using some of the money on
retraining programs that could equip a state employee to take a
position in a different agency where they are more needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spending control is the way to reduce the budget gap,'' Rein
said. He said reducing debt would take pressure off state budget
makers in future years as would trimming the work force and making
it more productive.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Robert King, Pataki's budget director, said the
state is always looking for ways to pare costs but it is premature
to discuss staffing projections.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, King said the group's call for fiscal restraint
is in line with Pataki's views.
</P>
<P>
   The state has a good chance this year to find ways to enhance
productivity when it negotiates new multiyear contracts with its
labor unions, Rein said. He suggests the state promise pay raises
in exchange for leaner staffs and greater efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend $8 billion in work force and if there's a 10 percent
savings, that's $800 million,'' Rein said.
</P>
<P>
   State labor groups took a dim view on Rein's recommendations,
saying the work force is already too lean to perform services. Yet
Pataki has said he would like to further reduce the work force he
began trimming after taking office in 1995. There are 190,000 state
workers.
</P>

   Public Employees Federation President Roger Benson said any cuts
would come from the skeleton left after previous reductions.
However, he said, unions would be delighted to see an early
retirement incentive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen the state work force shrink by 20,000,'' Benson
said. ``It is not a more productive work force, but a work force
that can't do the job because there isn't enough staff to deliver
the services.''
</P>
<P>
   The Budget Commission, chiefly funded by businesses, said that
the cost of Pataki's STAR program, which reimburses school
districts for property tax cuts, will add $682 million to the
spending demands in the new budget year. That's on top of the $704
million in STAR costs this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Budget Commission estimated state receipts of $37.4 billion
and costs of $39.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has scoffed at critics who point to the gap and debt as
serious fiscal problems. He has said that the gap is based on
conservative revenue projections and that he has demonstrated his
ability to close multibillion dollar shortfalls inherited from Gov.
Mario Cuomo.

UNDER SAIL THROUGH THE GRENADINES 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Dec. 20.) 
(JT) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   This was supposed to be a homage to catatonia. This was going to
be a description of how one can do nothing so intensively in the
southeastern Caribbean that vacations there work like juice
concentrate; a week in the Grenadine Islands can have the
recharging effect of, say, two weeks in Florida. I had expected a
primitive poultice for burnout, one that I could recommend to all
my brethren who feel pressed when they wake up, stressed as they
eat, pushed to produce faster and more, faster and more. I thought
the remedy was simply stopping.
</P>
<P>
   And it was, of course, in part. But what I learned on a week's
excursion in territory considered some of the last of the
pre-Hilton Caribbean is that the point is not sloth. It is, if you
will, something like harmony.
</P>
<P>
   There was harmony on the island of Bequia (pronounced BEK-way)
where descendants of Scots and Africans and Caribs mingle on an
enclave of 5,000 so sheltered it only got cable TV in the last
year.
</P>
<P>
   There was harmony in the way Simeon Nero, our Bequia-based
skipper, calmly piloted our chartered yacht through waves and wind
that seasoned sailors call vigorous and I would call big momma
waves. There was harmony even in the warmth of the water, part of
an overall environment that presents itself as supremely
threat-free, happy to receive you, there for you.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I promise not to get any loopier, but just consider this:
On our first night on the yacht, I lay back and looked up at the
star-spangled sky. It was a rare treat, to be somewhere warm, with
no bugs, with no distractions, able to soak in the constellations
for hours.
</P>
<P>
   But along with joy I felt anxiety. I was so small. The universe
was indifferent. I was going to die. There wasn't nearly enough
time to do all I wanted to do. I wanted more control, more say,
more life.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the trip, I could look up at the universe and say:
``Uh-huh. I'm part of this show.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, how did my equally frayed companion and I get from point A,
anxiety, to point B, beatitude?
</P>
<P>
   It began badly. Our plane was delayed in New York, which meant
we missed the only flight out of San Juan that day to St. Vincent,
the capital of that little sprinkle of 32 map-specks called St.
Vincent and the Grenadines, which is a bona fide country with a
population of 107,000, even if it does sound like a top-40
Gregorian chant group.
</P>
<P>
   The moral is: Flying to more obscure parts of the Caribbean that
require such infrequent connections means that you risk losing a
day if your connection fails. But it is worth it. And there are
other routes to Bequia, including one through Barbados rather than
San Juan, which at least puts you farther into the Caribbean if you
get stuck.
</P>
<P>
   The ferry from St. Vincent to Bequia was not an antiseptic
tourist ferry; it was a Real Ferry, and the feet of the local man
who insisted on taking our bags could not have been confined by
shoes for year and years, if ever. It was nightfall, and the entire
flank of Bequia, as we approached, was dark, as if the whole
seven-mile-square island, the largest of the Grenadines, were
uninhabited. We wondered if there had been a blackout _ the island
only got electricity in 1968; maybe it was still patchy.
</P>
<P>
   But no, it was simply that the whole northwestern side of Bequia
is nothing but scrubbily forested slopes. As we rounded the corner,
we could see the little lights of Port Elizabeth on Admiralty Bay,
the island's harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what Sydney Clark, the venerable travel book author,
wrote 30 years ago: ``The Grenadines are among the last lost worlds
of the Caribbean and there is an ever-present danger of their
getting less lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Happily, wondrously, Bequia and the rest of the Grenadines are
still a little lost. At Spring on Bequia, an inland hotel, a
200-year-old plantation and still a working farm, we got a
Flintstonesque, fieldstone-and-wood room with a drop-dead view of
hill and sky and sea for $200 a night. You could look around and
see virtually nothing that you wouldn't have seen a century ago.
The white curtains flapped aggressively into the room with the
strong breeze; there was no air-conditioning but none was needed,
and there was no phone or television, but that was just as well,
no?
</P>
<P>
   Of the hotels on Bequia, only one out of the half-dozen we
visited, the Plantation House, had such amenities. And later, when
we visited other Grenadine islands, it was much the same; island
resorts that charged $415 a couple per night, including board, were
offering isolation and peace, not CNN and T-1 lines.
</P>
<P>
   But the lack of technology fostered the required slowing of
pace. Nothing beeped. Nothing hummed. Nothing brought spurts of
adrenaline.
</P>
<P>
   And the smallness of Bequia produced a similar comforting
atavism: The logical thing to do was to poke around, to hunt and
gather experiences, to set out and see where we ended up, which
could be far enough to get tired, but not to get lost. (Little did
we know that compared with what would come later, this was a very
big island.)
</P>
<P>
   Along one winding dirt road, we came across a Hawksbill turtle
sanctuary that is the quixotic project of a local Bequian, Orton
King. In Port Elizabeth's harborside strip of hotels and stores _
especially appealing because it ran only along the beach, not along
a road _ there was astonishing homemade ice cream at Maranne's Ice
Cream, and lobster pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Two full days on Bequia would have been much better; but the
next morning, it was already time to _ here comes a phrase I have
never used before in my life _ be picked up by our yacht.
</P>
<P>
   There she was in Bequia's busy little harbor: The Pleiades, a
graceful, race-winning 43-footer _ ours, with crew, for four days.
She was manned by Simeon, who has 30 years of sailing experience
and a couple decades more of life experience, which he shares only
if you ask (Ask _ you'll learn something); his wife, Zelma, who
cooked a mean Caribbean country-style meal, including more kinds of
tubers than I ever knew existed; and his 18-year-old son, Quincy,
who was learning the ropes. Simeon teaches sailing and navigation
upon request, but I was incapable of taking in information more
complex than the names of the islands we visited.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It was a tribute to fine design that the boat did not feel
crowded even with a crew of three plus two guests _ though it did
feel a little uncomfortably colonial for my companion and I to each
have our own cabin, one fore and one aft, while the Nero family
slept on converted couches in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Now, probably every novice's yacht tale on the Grenadines' high
seas has to begin with a little dip. A little dip and sway and dip.
A little up and down and up and ... Uh-oh. As we steamed out of
Bequia, we were chatting happily. As we hit the real waves, serious
swells of five or six feet that would gladden the hearts of true
recreational sailors, silence descended on us _ silence that, every
skipper knows, means the guests are feeling green-gilled and
wondering if they have made a horrible mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Some say it's better to stay on deck, but I favor undergoing
misery in solitude, and descended to my berth. I'm happy to report
that things never reached the point of an event. And after that
first afternoon, the seasickness never reappeared, even though we
ventured into higher seas. By nightfall, we had reached the Tobago
Cays, site of an excellent snorkeling reef and a scattering of
mainly uninhabited little islands.
</P>
<P>
   You might think that a place that it takes hours of flying and
hours of sailing from any major population center to reach would be
pretty empty. But no _ shockingly to my neophyte eyes, the shallow
waters in the keys were a maritime parking lot of yachts, scores of
them, so many that insistent local vendors seemed to make a nice
living by ferrying out high-priced drinking water and perishables.
Remoteness is all relative, of course, but I don't think I've ever
seen so many people in so obscure a place.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the truly wonderful thing about chartering a yacht,
though. The next morning, after a good snorkel through colorful
brain coral and among flitting schools of rainbow-colored fish, we
could say to Simeon, ``Let's go.'' And we did.
</P>
<P>
   For three more days, we island-hopped, and there was a deep,
Viking-like pleasure in it: To approach an unknown chunk of land
(with a guide who knew it perfectly); to scan and scope it; to swim
or be rowed ashore and explore it; then, having conquered it, to
get back on a boat and leave.
</P>
<P>
   On a one-square-block-sized island in the Tobago Cays, we simply
climbed the only hill, looked around, Yertle the Turtle style, came
down and left. On Union, the most developed island we visited,
there was five minutes' worth of shopping at the T-shirt-postcard
stores in the harborside town.
</P>
<P>
   Some beaches were utterly deserted; one or two had a dozen or so
people on them _ which came to seem like a stadium crowd after a
while.
</P>
<P>
   The little islands varied. The two with the most character were
Mayreau, which had a drop-dead-charming open-doored little church,
The Immaculate Conception Mayreau Catholic Church, at its highest
point; and Union, whose character struck us as a little seedy, a
little hostile, spooky. A walk on its main road took us to houses
that seemed poor in an unhappy, un-Caribbean way, arguing voices
audible from within, and in the harbor town, strung-out-looking
vagrants haunted the front of an open-air tavern.
</P>
<P>
   The most striking islands, though, were those that were nothing
but resorts; that is, so small that they contained a resort or two
and that was it. Palm Island was like that, such a little dot of
sand that it might not merit a spot on a map if not for the
$400-a-night Palm Island Beach Club; and so was Canouan, with its
plush Tamarind Beach Hotel and Yacht Club ($250 a night).
</P>
<P>
   We didn't stop at Petit St. Vincent, a private hideaway with 22
cottages. Didn't want to intrude. We did, however, anchor our last
night off Young Island, a small private island near bustling St.
Vincent. Its ads say it has 30 cottages on 35 acres, but it looked
even smaller.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, I can imagine sitting in a Manhattan office and
thinking, ``All I want right now is to be on a desert island.'' And
certainly, these were desert islands, replete with a
best-of-both-worlds supply of full bars and showers and fresh
grilled fish.
</P>
<P>
   But after stopping on a handful of them, I remained dubious
about whether they could provide the peace and serenity I sought.
Because the problem is, there you are, trapped on that desert
island with a few score other vacationers, possibly obnoxious ones,
and a few score staff members, possibly exploited ones, and maybe,
on some nights, even a very loud steel band. And you have no easy
way off. The No Exit claustrophobia made me imagine a special
guidebook: The Sartrean Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   No, the boat, for all that it was smaller than any island,
seemed best. Though we anchored each night near some shore or
other, and though its small space was shared, the overwhelming
sensation was of a growing friendship between me and the sea, just
it and me.
</P>
<P>
   The Caribbean Sea, like the starry cosmos, was big and dark. But
as I came to accept by the end of the week, when a long night swim
in the inky bath seemed not a bit daunting, they were friendly.
Friendly. The sea, and the cosmos, both.

 &HT;    Japan Airlines to Atlanta: Sayanora in March
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Japan Airlines is ditching Atlanta-Tokyo flights in
March, leaving hometown giant Delta Air Lines with a lock on
nonstop service to Asia's top destination.
</P>
<P>
   JAL, which has flown the route for 13 years, cited Asia's
economic troubles and Delta's addition of daily nonstop flights
last June, more than doubling seat capacity on the route.
</P>
<P>
   ``Declining traffic demand and the competitive situation at
Atlanta have had a negative impact on the gateway's profitability,
and JAL has made the decision to utilize its resources elsewhere,''
JAL said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time it ends Atlanta service, JAL on March 15 will
add service between Tokyo and Dallas-Fort Worth. The new route will
enable JAL to offer domestic connections on Dallas-based American
Airlines, with which it has a new marketing alliance.
</P>
<P>
   JAL's moves are not a surprise. When Delta started its nonstop
Tokyo flights, JAL officials conceded they would probably face a
decision on whether to continue the service.
</P>
<P>
   The American alliance also made it likely JAL would reconfigure
routes to capitalize on ties between the two, which include joint
seat sales and operational cost-savings at each other's hubs.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Evilsizor, a JAL marketing official in Atlanta, said the
carrier's average Atlanta-Tokyo load factors have dropped to 58
percent, down from about 78 percent last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt in June we might lose 10 (percent) to 12 percent when
Delta started, but as the Asia situation dragged on we saw the
numbers go lower,'' Evilsizor said.
</P>
<P>
   JAL's Atlanta service helped foster a spurt of Japanese
investment in Georgia and the Southeast when it began in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't foresee a big impact from this, but JAL's service was
always a selling point to Japanese companies, so we'll see,'' said
Yoko Kagawa, executive director of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce
in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of convenience, there's no effect because Delta's
there,'' she said. ``Psychologically, it's a little bit of a
blow.''
</P>
<P>
   Evilsizor said JAL hopes to retain many customers in the
Southeast with special deals for those who fly to Dallas or Chicago
to board its nonstops. Evilsizor also noted that JAL will offer
five weekly cargo flights in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Delta previously flew to Tokyo via Portland, Ore., but added
nonstop service from Atlanta in the wake of a liberalized
U.S.-Japan air treaty. Delta spokesman Bill Berry said the flights
are selling well but added the carrier has no plans to add more in
light of the uncertain economic outlook.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers seeking more alternatives also can fly American,
United or Northwest airlines via their U.S. hubs.

RAZOR THIN, BUT LARGER THAN LIFE  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 20)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By KAREN DURBIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The CBS sitcom ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' now regularly beats
Fox's ``Ally McBeal'' in the Monday night Nielsens. Recently, an
executive producer of ``Raymond,'' Philip Rosenthal, expressed his
delight to Entertainment Weekly with a notable shortage of grace,
semantic and otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he accounted for the superior ratings, Rosenthal said,
``Everyone on our show has no problem eating.'' Sore winners are
bad enough; boorish ones should guffaw to themselves in private.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal wasn't even being original; he's just the latest to
jump on the Ally-bashing bandwagon, a vehicle that rolls with some
regularity over the slender bones of the show's lawyer heroine and
Calista Flockhart, the gifted young stage actress who plays her.
</P>
<P>
   The hysteria over Ms. Flockhart's putative anorexia reached such
a pitch of meanness a couple of months ago that the actress took to
eating large meals in public as self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Flockhart is hardly the only young woman on television these
days who looks like a line drawing. In the print ads for HBO's
``Sex and the City,'' Sarah Jessica Parker's hips are no wider than
the laptop she's typing on. According to my laptop, that's 11.5
inches, and she's sitting down. But nobody's rushing to stitch an
``A'' for anorexia on the skimpy little dresses Ms. Parker wears in
the show. Nor, for that matter, has she been attacked for wearing
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex and the City,'' like the autobiographical sketches by
Candace Bushnell that the show is based on, is a
not-quite-tongue-in-cheek portrait of the educated young urban
woman as a man-hungry gold digger. Nevertheless, when the editors
of Time magazine felt moved last summer to ask the question ``Is
Feminism Dead?'' they didn't make Ms. Parker or Ms. Bushnell the
punch line of what must surely be the silliest cover of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, their hilarious array of disembodied female heads
floating in a funereal black sea proceeded from Susan B. Anthony
through Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem to _ who else? _ Ally
McBeal.
</P>
<P>
   The death of feminism tends to be greatly exaggerated, but
journalists have been writing its obituary since 1975, when Harpers
magazine did its own cover article, ``Requiem for the Women's
Movement,'' just in time to ride the antifeminist backlash while
criticizing the movement for not being radical enough.
</P>
<P>
   Time does something similar, only the movement's problem now is
that it's not serious enough. Ally is the antithesis of true
feminism because (1) she gets upset when the supermarket doesn't
have enough of her favorite snack, (2) her skirts are too short,
and (3) she's a ditz who (4) thinks too much about her lousy love
life.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a confirmed ``Ally McBeal'' fan who first took to the
streets with knees knocking and feminist fist upraised not quite 30
years ago, when my dress size was considerably smaller than it is
now, and what dresses I owned seldom extended more than 12 inches
down from the waist. I've never thought that her skirt length or
eating habits were a threat to my political health. On the
contrary, I identify. As for points (3) and (4), I come from a
family of opinionated motormouths, but when I feel rattled or shy,
heredity deserts me and my brain shifts into park.
</P>
<P>
   So when Ally gets that slightly wild deer-in-the-headlights look
in her eye (it generally has to do with sex) and blurts something
embarrassing, I identify with that too. It's a comfort to know that
there's another woman out there, even an imaginary one, for whom
the dance of desire begins with a foot in the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   None of that would matter if Ally were just an airhead, but she
isn't. She wins her cases with ingenious, sometimes inspired
arguments that have less to do with the law than with an attempt to
discern some rules to live by in the blur of a rapidly changing
world.
</P>
<P>
   At its uneven best, ``Ally McBeal'' is neither yuppie sitcom nor
courtroom drama but an absurdist morality play that gives off
sparks of screwball comedy. Its heroine is basically smart and
thoughtful, with a prissy streak that's the downside of her
penchant for worrying about what is right.
</P>
<P>
   If she's also confused and conflicted, that's because she exists
in a state of uncomfortable dissent from the world around her. With
her somewhat nutty integrity, Ally McBeal has always struck me as
the weird little sister of Mary Richards, although she's not nearly
so nice. Alone among her newsroom colleagues on ``The Mary Tyler
Moore Show,'' Mary submissively called her boss Mr. Grant.
</P>
<P>
   When a judge tells Ally he will bar her from his courtroom
unless she wears longer skirts, she calls him a pig. This is David
E. Kelley, the show's creator, talking back to his critics, but it
works within the terms of the character. It's not one of Ally's
better moves, but to her own self she's certainly being true (not
that she seems to have a choice).
</P>
<P>
   And like most eccentrics, she harbors a fugitive longing to be
normal. How else to explain her attachment to her terminally bland
ex-boyfriend? Handsome Billy and his pretty wife, Georgia, are the
show's only true yupsters, a totally conventional couple who resent
and make a perfect foil for Ally's stubborn singularity.
</P>
<P>
   They gripe at her for making waves, for getting out of line, for
being larger than life, for, in other words, not knowing her place.
She's that quintessential feminist emblem, the inconvenient woman.
</P>
<P>
   The Time magazine article lumped ``Ally McBeal'' together with
``Bridget Jones' Diary.'' But the heroine of Helen Fielding's comic
British novel is consumed with the search for Mr. Right, while Ally
spends much of her time turning eligible men away. (A little too
much time, it seems to me; will she ever get to have sex again or
was that cute nude model it?)
</P>
<P>
   ``Bridget Jones'' reads like something from a 50s time capsule.
Candace Bushnell's money-grubbing hardbodies are more believable
(so that's how Donald Trump keeps getting dates), but they don't
represent much besides themselves.
</P>
<P>
   What rings both timely and true is Ally's mix of doubt,
assertiveness and self-mocking humor, the last best expressed in
her dissing contests with her roommate, Renee. If Ally is kin to
Mary Richards, then Renee descends from Murphy Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Pugnacious and competitive, Renee copes with her vulnerability
by putting on a tough front. Ally does it by putting on no front at
all. Maybe that's why she creates such a disturbance both on and
off the show. Her short skirts are a metaphor; she's all but
walking naked through the world.
</P>
<P>
   My passion for ``Ally McBeal'' is not boundless. Most of the new
episodes lack the emotional heft that gives the show its real
payoff. Without that, the absurdism seems unfocused (the whole
subplot involving a colleague's pet frog) or worse, unfunny.
</P>
<P>
   I've always thought the pristine unisex bathroom was one of the
show's more resonant absurdities, another metaphor for that rude
and ridiculous place where men and women eventually meet and things
happen that nobody can control.
</P>
<P>
   But the missing frog pops out of the toilet where Ally is
sitting so that she can go eek? Somebody leaves the toilet seat up
so that she can fall in? If this is what Ally gets instead of a
lover or even a fling, maybe Kelley should take his subconscious in
for a tuneup, before he becomes the worst Ally-basher of all.

REP. SOLOMON SAYS CLINTON TIMED ATTACK TO DELAY IMPEACHMENT VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG and JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Gerald B. H. Solomon, R-N.Y., on Wednesday
called President Clinton's decision to attack Iraq ``outrageous''
and accused him of launching air strikes on that nation in order to
delay an impeachment vote in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon, who is retiring at the end of the year, is chairman of
the House Rules Committee and an outspoken critic of Clinton. He
said White House officials were ``doing everything they can to
postpone this vote on impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For him to do this at this unbelievable time is just
outrageous,'' Solomon said, asserting there was no pressing
military need to attack Iraq on the eve of the scheduled start of
House debate on impeachment. Aides to Republican House leaders said
a postponement of the debate was likely.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon reflected Republican skepticism over the timing of the
air strikes and Clinton's motives for ordering them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never underestimate a desperate president,'' he said. ``This
time he means business. What option is left for getting impeachment
off the front page and maybe even postponed? And how else to
explain the sudden appearance of a backbone that has been invisible
up to now?''
</P>
<P>
   Solomon added, ``If he (had) delayed this until Monday or
Tuesday, it would still be outrageous but would not be as political
as it is today.''
</P>
<P>
   When Iraqi President Saddam Hussein surrendered after the 1991
Persian Gulf War, he agreed to relinquish nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons to U.N. inspectors. But the inspectors have
repeatedly cited the Iraqi regime for failure to reveal the extent
of its illegal weapons programs and for stockpiling weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ordered the attack a day after Richard Butler, the
U.N.'s chief weapons inspector, reported that Iraq was not
cooperating with his team.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon said Clinton could have ordered attacks against Iraq
many times since February after confrontations with the regime over
weapons violations, but chose not to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why now?'' Solomon asked.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., also raised
questions Wednesday about the strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both the timing and the policy are subject to question,'' Lott
said. ``While I have been assured by administration officials that
there is no connection with the impeachment process in the House of
Representatives, I cannot support this military action in the
Persian Gulf at this time,'' Lott added.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tillie Fowler, R-Fla., a member of the House National
Security Committee, said, ``I think this president is shameless in
what he would do to stay in office.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spokesman Joe Lockhart, responding to the criticism,
said, ``The president of the United States makes national security
decisions based on the recommendations of his national security
advisers and on the best interests of the people of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., called Solomon's comments
``outrageous,'' and added that the New York congressman ``has spent
a career making outrageous comments.'' Gejdenson said the attack on
Iraq was justified and that ``as an ex-Marine, Solomon should know
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all Republicans challenged the timing of the attack on Iraq.
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
said, ``Saddam Hussein has left the United States with no choice
but to strike Iraq, and I believe most Americans will support the
decision by our defense leaders.''

CLINICAL TRIALS COMPANY QUINTILES TO BUY ENVOY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Tenn.)  (dal) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In its third acquisition to be announced this week,
Quintiles Transnational Corp., the nation's largest provider of
clinical drug trials, said Wednesday it would buy Envoy Corp. for
$1.7 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Quintiles, based in Research Triangle Park, N.C., has made
several acquisitions this year to broaden its range of
pharmaceutical services. Aside from conducting clinical trials, the
company has become a leading industry provider of sales support and
marketing information.
</P>
<P>
   By acquiring Envoy, a health-claims processing company in
Nashville, Quintiles will be able to expand its marketing base for
prescription drugs. Envoy is expected to process 1.2 billion claims
this year from doctors, pharmacies, hospitals and health
maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This purchase gives us a lot of information,'' said Dennis
Gillings, the chief executive of Quintiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't compete now with IMS Health,'' a company that
measures pharmaceutical sales trends, he added. ``But this purchase
will enable us to deliver more real-time data than they do
currently.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts considered the deal fairly priced. Quintiles will
exchange 1.166 of its shares for each envoy share, valuing Envoy
stock at $65.51 a share, a 55 percent premium based on Tuesday's
closing prices.
</P>
<P>
   The deal may be terminated, though, if shares of Quintiles trade
beyond a range of $40 to $71.50.
</P>
<P>
   Investors had mixed reactions to the deal. Shares of Envoy rose
18.9 percent, or $8, to $50.25. Quintiles' shares fell 18.4
percent, or $10.3125, to $45.875. The selloff in Quintiles' stock
surprised Gillings and some analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors may have walked because that was Quintiles' third
deal in a week,'' said Kenneth Miller, an analyst with Hambrecht &AMP;
Quist. ``They believe the company has bitten off more than it can
chew. People may also assume that the deal means there is a problem
in the company's core business.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Quintiles said it would acquire a drug-development
center in Missouri from Hoechst A.G. for $93 million in cash. On
Tuesday, the company said it would buy Pharmaceutical Marketing
Services, including its Scott-Levin drug-marketing unit, for $197
million in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and investors were also concerned that Quintiles might
not meet earnings projections for next year. Quintiles is expected
to earn $1.37 to $1.40 a share next year, according to Zacks
Investment Research. Though company executives said Wednesday that
earnings would meet expectations, analysts had thought the company
would easily surpass them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some investors may not have known what to make of this deal,''
Gillings said. ``In one sense, it may have looked like Envoy and
Quintiles didn't know much about each other. That may have forced
these people to spend the day scratching their heads trying to
figure it out.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Quintiles expansion plan is aggressive _ the company
has made more than a dozen acquisitions this year _ analysts have
generally applauded it.
</P>
<P>
   Gillings has moved into contract sales _ renting the services of
Quintiles salespeople to sell products for other companies _ and
marketing information, a crucial commodity as more drug companies
advertise directly to consumers.

FATHER OF JAILED CHINESE DISSIDENT TO SEEK DELAY IN SUBVERSION
TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING &UR;  &LR; _ Protesting the lack of a defense lawyer, the father
of a prominent dissident is to seek a delay in his son's subversion
trial, scheduled to start on Thursday in the central city of Wuhan.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant is Qin Yongmin, 45, a democracy advocate who has
spent 10 years in prison and labor camps and has recently promoted
an alternative, non-Communist political party.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Wednesday evening, his father, Qin
Qinguo, 76, said that before the trial begins, he plans to hand the
court a written plea for postponement. If the plea is ignored, he
said he will walk out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be able to stand it,'' the father, a retired
steelworker, said, citing his frail health and high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Under China's code of criminal procedure, a defendant has the
right to a defense lawyer. But in this case, the elder Qin said,
some lawyers he approached declined to take the case, while others
were warned by security officials not to get involved.
</P>
<P>
   The father said he did not agree with his son's political
tactics but now he felt he had no choice but to protest his
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Qin Yongmin was arrested on Nov. 30, only hours after his mother
died of a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't even allowed to attend the funeral,'' Qin Qinguo
said. ``And now he's not allowed to find a lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, a few hundred miles to the east in the city
of Hangzhou, Wang Youcai, 33, is to go on trial on similar charges
of inciting subversion. He, too, has no defense lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Wang was a leader of student demonstrations in Tiananmen Square
in 1989 and served two years in prison after they were put down by
military force.
</P>
<P>
   As the founder of the suppressed new political party, the China
Democracy Party, he publicly announced its charter in June during
President Clinton's visit to China.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of people around the country began to champion the new
party, hopeful that closer ties between China and the United
States, and China's signing of the international covenant on
political and civil rights, would mean a looser political climate.
</P>
<P>
   But the party was soon declared illegal and many adherents were
detained, at least temporarily. Wang now faces charges that could
land him in prison for five years or more.
</P>
<P>
   A third veteran dissident and promoter of the new party, Xu
Wenli, has been detained for weeks in Beijing and is expected to
face similar subversion charges.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two days, at least 10 Democracy Party members or
supporters in the Hangzhou area have been detained by the police
and others have had their phone lines cut, reported the Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China, based in
Hong Kong.

CHASE SAYS QUARTERLY EARNINGS BETTER THAN EXPECTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Remove Chase Manhattan Corp. from Wall Street's hit
list.
</P>
<P>
   A flurry of disappointing earnings announcements or forecasts
from several of the country's biggest financial services firms have
raised concerns about how easily some companies may rebound from
this year's financial turmoil, but Chase said Wednesday that it
expects to soundly beat analysts' earnings estimates for the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Chase said, it is within striking distance of posting
record profits this quarter, notable in a year when the best and
brightest of Wall Street have been battered by financial upheaval
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our competitive position has been enhanced by all of the
events of the last few months,'' said Marc Shapiro, Chase's vice
chairman in charge of finance and risk management. ``We think we
have created a very different institution than we've had
historically and from what other institutions have today.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro said that Chase, the country's third largest bank,
expects to surpass analysts' consensus estimates of $1.07 a share
in the fourth quarter and thinks the bank may reap record profits
of more than about $1.21 a share in the quarter, or slightly more
than $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is clearly significant because a majority of companies
have been preannouncing disappointing results and here you have a
major company saying, `We're going to beat estimates by a wide
margin,' '' said Charles Hill, research director for the First Call
Corp., a company that tracks earnings estimates for publicly traded
firms.
</P>
<P>
   In trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, Chase's
shares rose $2.75, or 4.53 percent, to $63.50.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last week, Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. and J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co.,
two large financial services firms, announced or forecasted
disappointing earnings as both companies fell victim to the soured
trading environment that emerged after Russia devalued its currency
and declared a debt moratorium in August. Analysts have also been
revising earnings downward for Citigroup and the BankAmerica Corp.,
while earnings forecasts for Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. are mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Chase, however, has separated itself from that pack. Shapiro
attributed the performance to several factors, among them the
bank's emphasis on ``stress testing'' its trading and loan
portfolios to analyze how well those portfolios would perform in
unforeseen market downturns. While many financial firms espouse
devotion to risk management _ claims that were undermined by the
market swings of the last year _ Chase's performance suggests that
the bank has actually succeeded.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Shapiro also said that Chase's corporate businesses, like
syndicated lending and investment-grade debt underwriting, and
consumer businesses, like credit card, mortgages, and auto finance,
performed well. Of note was Chase's currency trading operation,
which normally provides about half of the company's overall trading
revenue, and which Shapiro said did especially well in an uncertain
market.
</P>
<P>
   Chase has a well-known hole in its corporate business _ the
absence of stock underwriting capabilities _ but this may have been
a good time to do without it. Financial turmoil ground stock
underwriting almost to a halt in recent months and large companies
looked to loans and other forms of debt to raise money, all of
which benefited Chase.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say Chase has not been pummeled by unforeseen
trading or lending losses over the last year, particularly in such
rocky markets as Russia and Indonesia. But the bank said those
problems only underscored how well-positioned Chase is financially.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have less commercial credit risk than we had in this
institution 10 years ago and more than twice the capital,'' said
Shapiro. ``That means we are able to absorb events like Russia and
Indonesia.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase, the creation of the 1996 acquisition of the old Chase by
Chemical Banking Corp., has had difficulty convincing analysts that
it could be nimble and highly profitable. Analysts said this year's
performance should not only allay such concerns, but also offer
proof that one of the banking industry's biggest mergers is now one
of the most successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``For whatever reasons, investors have not been comfortable with
Chase,'' said David Berry, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods
Inc. ``But it's now clear what kind of power exists in this
franchise.''

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Scott Ritter knows Iraq pretty well by now. A veteran
arms inspector for the U.N. Special Commission charged with
tracking Iraq's arsenal of weapons of mass destruction, Ritter, who
recently resigned his post, was intimately involved in the U.N.
effort to keep Saddam Hussein honest.
</P>
<P>
   Over an extended period, Ritter and other inspectors worked to
break the code Saddam was using to issue instructions involving the
movement of weapons Iraq wanted to keep hidden from inspectors.
Well into this year, the cat-and-mouse game being played in Iraq
made regular headlines around the world.
</P>
<P>
   What few know is that the U.N. inspectors, with Israeli help,
eventually broke the Iraqi code and were on the verge of a major
breakthrough in uncovering concealed weaponry. Then this summer the
inspections were halted. That's when Ritter quit his job _ out of
pure frustration, he says.
</P>
<P>
   In this conversation with David Makovsky, correspondent for
Ha'aretz, Ritter reveals how weapons were being moved around in
Iraq.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DAVID MAKOVSKY: How did Iraq conceal weapons from UNSCOM?
</P>
<P>
   SCOTT RITTER: In April 1991, Saddam Hussein issued a
presidential directive ordering that Iraq lie to the Special
Commission (UNSCOM) and to the IAEA (International Atomic Energy
Agency), (and that Iraq) would keep (its mass destruction)
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1991, the materials that were kept were turned over under
instruction of the president to the Special Security Organization
(SSO) and Special Republican Guard (SRG). These are presidential
security forces.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How big is this special organization?
</P>
<P>
   A: The SSO is one of the most secretive organizations in Iraq.
It probably numbers around 5,000 people. The SRG is the military
arm that had four brigades, around 15 battalions, and is about the
size of a division _ maybe 20,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was the special organization set up for this purpose of
concealment?
</P>
<P>
   A: The special organization was set up to protect the president
of Iraq. Back in the 1980s this special security organization also
had a responsibility for protecting Iraq's weapons. ... So they
have been linked from the very beginning with these weapons, but
today they have the responsibility of hiding them from the Special
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is their job basically to conduct one big shell game?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's right, it's a shell game. Now what you're getting to
is the problem I faced. We were beating our heads against the wall
going after the shell game. We're playing their game. I said to
(then) chairman (of UNSCOM, Rolf Ekeus, that) rather than going
after the shells, let's go after the man moving the shells.
</P>
<P>
   One reason why I went to Israel and started working with the
Israelis is because I believe that the methodologies that Israel
uses to hunt down terrorists are the same methodologies we needed
to use to go after the weapons of mass destruction. So I asked
Israel to help the commission formulate analytical models,
analytical techniques and to advise on operational issues.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When was that?
</P>
<P>
   A: I first approached (Israel) in 1994. We started working in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was it helpful?
</P>
<P>
   A: I can honestly say that if it weren't for Israel, the Special
Commission would not have been able to carry out the
anti-concealment effort.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was Israel's unique contribution?
</P>
<P>
   A: I can just say Israel had a good reputation of being
innovative, of being capable, of being good. And we approached
Israel due to all those factors. It's Tel Aviv that can be hit by
these missiles, not New York City, and we were actually, frankly
speaking, a little dismayed with the lack of intensity, the lack of
enthusiasm, that emanated from Washington on this issue. The U.S.
treated it more as an academic exercise and I thought Israel
treated it as it is _ a matter of life and death. So we came to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Were your trips and cooperation with Israel authorized by the
head of UNSCOM? Was it also approved by the U.S.?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ekeus started this, yes. It was all authorized by Ekeus. It
was a totally authorized thing and it was approved by the U.S.
government. Every aspect was approved by the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who ran the Iraqi concealment program?
</P>
<P>
   A: Abed Hamed Mahmoud, the presidential secretary. He is
probably the most powerful man in Iraq after the president. He is
Saddam's bodyguard, confidant, right-hand man. Qusay Hussein
(Saddam's son) cannot go to the president without going through
Abed Hamed Mahmoud. He is the gatekeeper. He is the man responsible
for coordinating the national security policy of Iraq. He's the
secret power in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   He runs what's called the joint committee, (which) coordinates
all the national security. ... He's the one who brings people in
and gives them concealment tasks. He's the one who (manages) the
concealment operation center that monitors all the stuff that is
moved around Iraq. Abed uses the special security organization
[SSO] as the tool for concealment.
</P>
<P>
   I can name officers within the special security organization who
did concealment, and I can tell (the UNSCOM) chairman, how, when,
where and why specific acts of concealment took place. That's how
good we got. I can't say how we did it. But I can say how good we
got. So we started with nothing and in the end we were down to
where we knew when, where, how, why, who and what was happening.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How does the concealment work?
</P>
<P>
   A: It basically works like a mafia organization. ... you have
cells. And ... the cells can rely on a larger infrastructure, the
Special Security Organization, the Special Republican Guard. These
elite organizations are populated by people loyal to Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Now they don't have a mission per se of concealment, but if you
need a truck, you can go to that Special Republican Guard and
vehicle resources. If you need 15-man working party, you can go to
that Special Republican Guard unit and get 15 soldiers to do
something for you.
</P>
<P>
   So you have the resources of the SSO and SRG at your disposal if
you want to hide these weapons. You're given vehicles, you're given
money, you're given a safe house. You're given the responsibility
to go out and find a location to hide this stuff. ... You go to
your uncle who has a farm in Samara, and you say on that farm, 'I
need to use that shed. I can't tell you what for, it's a family
business.'
</P>
<P>
   Thirty days later, they leave and he has a soldier on his team.
He asks: 'Do you have a relative near here?' They go to the cousin
and say, 'We need to use your farm and hide stuff on your farm.'
And that's how they move stuff around.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many people do you think are involved?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think we are talking about hundreds of people involved. It
is probably several cells doing chemicals, several cells doing
ballistic missiles, several cells doing biological (components),
and a cell doing nuclear (devices). You might be talking 50, 60
sites in Iraq at any one time with all that. Then you have the
groups responsible for monitoring ... personnel. Then you have a
group responsible for monitoring UNSCOM _ trying to collect
intelligence on what UNSCOM is doing. And Iraq has this regime of
terror and control. ... They can tap into any resource in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did Israel help crack the code of concealment?
</P>
<P>
   A: We used the methodology that Israel was considered to be the
best at in the world. We cracked the code, not Israel. Israel was
not in the lead on this, but I can say that UNSCOM could not have
solved this problem without the help of Israel. It's absolutely
essential. We could not have done what we did. We couldn't even
come close without the help of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   I was in charge when I went to Israel. Israel responded. My
requirements and my tasking came from the executive chairman.
Israel did not control the Special Commission. Israel didn't want
to control the Special Commission. Israel was a fair player on all
of this. It was extremely responsible.

   Q: Were your trips and cooperation with Israel authorized by the
head of UNSCOM? Was it also approved by the U.S.?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ekeus started this, yes. It was all authorized by Ekeus. It
was a totally authorized thing and it was approved by the U.S.
government. Every aspect was approved by the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who ran the Iraqi concealment program?
</P>
<P>
   A: Abed Hamed Mahmoud, the presidential secretary. He is
probably the most powerful man in Iraq after the president. He is
Saddam's bodyguard, confidant, right-hand man. Qusay Hussein
(Saddam's son) cannot go to the president without going through
Abed Hamed Mahmoud. He is the gatekeeper. He is the man responsible
for coordinating the national security policy of Iraq. He's the
secret power in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   He runs what's called the joint committee, (which) coordinates
all the national security. ... He's the one who brings people in
and gives them concealment tasks. He's the one who (manages) the
concealment operation center that monitors all the stuff that is
moved around Iraq. Abed uses the special security organization
[SSO] as the tool for concealment.
</P>
<P>
   I can name officers within the special security organization who
did concealment, and I can tell (the UNSCOM) chairman, how, when,
where and why specific acts of concealment took place. That's how
good we got. I can't say how we did it. But I can say how good we
got. So we started with nothing and in the end we were down to
where we knew when, where, how, why, who and what was happening.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How does the concealment work?
</P>
<P>
   A: It basically works like a mafia organization. ... you have
cells. And ... the cells can rely on a larger infrastructure, the
Special Security Organization, the Special Republican Guard. These
elite organizations are populated by people loyal to Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Now they don't have a mission per se of concealment, but if you
need a truck, you can go to that Special Republican Guard and
vehicle resources. If you need 15-man working party, you can go to
that Special Republican Guard unit and get 15 soldiers to do
something for you.
</P>
<P>
   So you have the resources of the SSO and SRG at your disposal if
you want to hide these weapons. You're given vehicles, you're given
money, you're given a safe house. You're given the responsibility
to go out and find a location to hide this stuff. ... You go to
your uncle who has a farm in Samara, and you say on that farm, 'I
need to use that shed. I can't tell you what for, it's a family
business.'
</P>
<P>
   Thirty days later, they leave and he has a soldier on his team.
He asks: 'Do you have a relative near here?' They go to the cousin
and say, 'We need to use your farm and hide stuff on your farm.'
And that's how they move stuff around.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many people do you think are involved?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think we are talking about hundreds of people involved. It
is probably several cells doing chemicals, several cells doing
ballistic missiles, several cells doing biological (components),
and a cell doing nuclear (devices). You might be talking 50, 60
sites in Iraq at any one time with all that. Then you have the
groups responsible for monitoring ... personnel. Then you have a
group responsible for monitoring UNSCOM _ trying to collect
intelligence on what UNSCOM is doing. And Iraq has this regime of
terror and control. ... They can tap into any resource in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did Israel help crack the code of concealment?
</P>
<P>
   A: We used the methodology that Israel was considered to be the
best at in the world. We cracked the code, not Israel. Israel was
not in the lead on this, but I can say that UNSCOM could not have
solved this problem without the help of Israel. It's absolutely
essential. We could not have done what we did. We couldn't even
come close without the help of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   I was in charge when I went to Israel. Israel responded. My
requirements and my tasking came from the executive chairman.
Israel did not control the Special Commission. Israel didn't want
to control the Special Commission. Israel was a fair player on all
of this. It was extremely responsible.

DVORAK SMARTLY DONE  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 20)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Big and powerful are adjectives that spring to mind when
listening to the Eroica Trio, but a more pithy description might be
intelligent. The group's second recording, ``Dvorak: Piano Trio
Dumky'' (EMI 7243 5 56673 2), represents thoughtful music making of
a high caliber.
</P>
<P>
   Eroica's musicians _ Erika Nickrenz, pianist; Adela Pena,
violinist, and Sara Sant'Ambrogio, cellist _ have the muscle to be
purely dramatic and emotional, but here, they stand out for subtler
reasons: all three players are soloists who have a lot to say, and
every note, no matter how light, has some significance.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, no voice ever fades into the background; rather, the
instruments not featured in a particular passage assume the active
stance of intelligent listeners, making comments on the main
statement or, in some cases, quietly but compellingly pursuing
their own trains of thought.
</P>
<P>
   In the last measures of Dvorak's ``Dumky'' Trio, for example, as
the cello nears the end of an expository thread, the violin ponders
a major third with quiet insistence so that when the piano breaks
in with an emphatic concluding theme, the listener wants to urge
them to slow down, so there is time for the different ideas to sink
in.
</P>
<P>
   The program, too, is intelligently selected. This is a Slavic
disk; the Dvorak is followed by Shostakovich's Second Trio and an
arrangement of Rachmaninoff's ``Vocalise.'' These works have in
common a kind of tortured Romanticism and rootedness to a folk
idiom.
</P>
<P>
   All three have passages evoking the elegiac mood of a solitary
singer in the course of a melancholy ballad; often, the music seems
to hover on the brink of actual speech, particularly in Eroica's
performance. Both Dvorak and Shostakovich juxtapose these moments
abruptly with the driven, sometimes manic rhythms of folk dance.
</P>
<P>
   An example of the Eroica's intelligence is the way the players
use special effects (especially in the Shostakovich) to expand
their instruments' vocabulary, rather than merely as decoration.
Stifled plucked notes, or a bow struck on the body of the
instrument, are as articulate as if produced by a percussionist.
</P>
<P>
   In one fast passage in the second movement of the Shostakovich,
the three instruments merge in a series of tugged, slurred chords
that help create an intensity so visceral it is hard to sit still.
The Prokofiev-like fourth movement opens with the plucked strings
taking on an assumed, comically hollow voice, like a cartoon
character; in their next statement of the theme, they whiz like a
kazoo.
</P>
<P>
   Given the kind of charge these players generate with one
another, it is no surprise that intensity and drama can get a bit
out of hand. In this fourth movement, they rise prematurely to the
climax, reaching a pitch of emotion that is impossible to sustain
without slipping into the realm of the overwrought.
</P>
<P>
   There is no denying the honest motivation behind such emotional
outbursts; but it makes it a little hard to hear exactly what the
music is saying.
</P>
<P>
   The tantrum, however, very appropriately colors the end of the
Shostakovich with the exhaustion that follows tears, until the
strings wearily whisper a few last remnants of the theme before
fading out altogether in the piano's last light chords, falling
like drops of water.

ZOLAK GETS THE NOD AGAINST 49ERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Three quarterbacks who started the season as
backups were named to the Pro Bowl Wednesday. Randall Cunningham
(Vikings), Doug Flutie (Bills), and Vinny Testaverde (Jets) didn't
have realistic hopes of playing much when they joined their
respective teams, but injury situations thrust them into starting
roles and all three came up huge.
</P>
<P>
   So huge they are now MVP candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Zolak finds himself in a similar spot, but his assignment
is temporary. His job is to produce immediately and keep the
Patriots' playoff hopes alive while Drew Bledsoe nurses his broken
right index finger.
</P>
<P>
   There is virtually no room for error for Zolak, named by coach
Pete Carroll Wednesday as the starter for Sunday's game against the
49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll kept his two backups guessing until Tuesday night when
he told Zolak of his decision, but it really wasn't a decision at
all. Carroll acknowledged he just wanted to make sure Tupa was
prepared to be the backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got that message across,'' said Tupa. ``I'm ready.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be no break-in period for Zolak. After three years of
basically sitting and watching, he must get off the bench and
perform at a high level.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie had a nine-year absence from the NFL, but he spent eight
of those years as a standout in the Canadian Football League.
Testaverde was an All-Pro with the Baltimore Ravens two years ago,
and Cunningham, who was out of football for a spell, still played
more the past three years than Zolak.
</P>
<P>
   If Zolak, an unrestricted free agent, performs heroically, he
could earn himself a sizable pay raise in the open market. If he
doesn't, he may be looking for work.
</P>
<P>
   The onus is not only on Zolak but also on offensive coordinator
Ernie Zampese, who must put the substitute quarterback in position
to get the job done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to go heavy on things in the playbook that Scott
can do and shorten up the things we think he can't do,'' siad
Zampese. ``We'll go with his strength. He's a big, strong
quarterback who has a lot of experience in the league. He's got a
strong arm, and there's no question that this is a tough situation
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Zampese agrees that backup quarterbacks must be able to step
in and win right away in today's NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' he said. ``Scott will have some things to
overcome, mainly that we don't have Terry Glenn and we're injured
in the fullback spot. But these are things Drew would have had to
overcome also.''
</P>
<P>
   Zampese has coached Dan Fouts, Troy Aikman, Jim Everett, and
Bledsoe, but he remembers some of his backups _ Mark Herrmann, Ed
Luther, Jason Garrett, and Rodney Peete.
</P>
<P>
   Zolak could easily go to the head of that class.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to stay within himself,'' said Zampese. ``He has to be
told that he doesn't have to win the game himself. He needs to let
other guys make plays for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe, who appeared at a brief press conference with his
finger exposed and the infamous pin sticking out from the top, said
he will do what Zolak has tried do for him _ serve as a supportive
friend.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe's streak of 58 straight regular-season games, tops among
AFC quarterbacks, is ending, but he hopes he will heal sufficiently
to play in the regular-season finale against the Jets Dec. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to assess Zolak's talents, Bledsoe said, ``Scott's
accurate. He does a good job of throwing the deep ball. I look for
us to throw the ball upfield. He does a good job of going through
progressions and makes the right reads. When he's forced to, he can
do a good job running the game. I feel he'll go in and give us a
very good chance to win the game this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to help Scott as much as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Zolak said this will be the most significant start of his
career. He started some games in 1992 and 1995, but this is a
late-season game with playoff implications.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about it,'' he said. ``I've been looking to be in
a meaningful game all my life. We can still win the division. With
all we've been through, guys have stepped up. I need to pick up
where he left off. I can't do the things Drew does, but I have to
move the sticks and let the guys run and make plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Zolak said he's going to watch the game films from '92 and ``get
the goose bumps back. I've been doing a lot of throwing to these
guys, so it won't be a situation of cold turkey. I think the
receivers are excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing he'll be the guy ``makes me more focused, and I look
forward to it even more. I'm kind of itchy about it. I wish the
game was tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of his teammates are glad the game is Sunday. They'll have
more time to get used to Zolak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not changing anything,'' said Zolak. ``I'm me. Drew's
Drew. He does things his way. I do things my way. If somebody makes
a play, I'll get excited for him. I just want to get in there and
get some points early, not only for my confidence but for the
team's confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Zolak is not lacking for advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a challenge for any backup,'' said San Francisco's Steve
Young, who for years was Joe Montana's backup. ``There's no secret
to it. Staying prepared week in and week out is key. Getting the
flow of the game when you haven't been in is. It's like driving
around in a Volkswagen and then getting into a Ferrari. The hard
part is that everything is new.''
</P>
<P>
   49ers coach Steve Mariucci was noncommittal about how the change
will affect his team's chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the world of Drew Bledsoe,'' said Mariucci. ``It's
unfortunate he broke that finger. He's had a heck of a year. Scott
is a guy who's been in the league eight years, he's not a a rookie,
so we have to treat him as we would Drew Bledsoe. We know we have
to play a physical game and stop the running game and Ben Coates.
We have to win a game on the road. That starts with defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the 49ers' defense will be gunning for Zolak, just as
the Rams did last Sunday when Bledsoe went briefly to the locker
room for repairs. They decked him after a lineman missed a blocking
assignment, and Ray Agnew throttled Zolak, sacking him and forcing
a fumble on the quarterback's first play.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the things he'll have to overcome, but Zolak is ready
for the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I've worked and paid my dues,'' he said, ``and I feel I
deserve this chance and I'm excited about it.''

 &HT;    ANALYSIS: AIRSTRIKES FINAL STEP IN YEAR-LONG CLINTON, SADDAM
DANCE
 &HT;    With US-AIRSTRIKES-1217.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Wednesday's attack on Iraq capped off a year of
brinksmanship between President Clinton and Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein over Iraq's production of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Twice this year -- last February and again in November --
Clinton has ordered dozens of warships, scores of attack aircraft
and thousands of U.S. troops to the Persian Gulf region in
preparation for strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, Iraq managed to slip the noose by offering
last-minute diplomatic concessions, only to later break its promise
to allow United Nations inspectors full access to its alleged
weapons manufacturing and stockpiling facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Four weeks ago, though, when Clinton first ordered an attack,
then called it off less than an hour before cruise missiles and
bombs were scheduled to begin hitting Iraq, he warned that this
time promises alone would not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam would be held accountable, Clinton warned, and airstrikes
could take place, without warning, if Saddam went back on his word
again.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Richard Butler, head of the United Nations Special
Commission, or UNSCOM, responsible for inspecting Iraq's weapons
programs, submitted a report to the United Nations in New York
alleging a pattern of continuing Iraqi attempts to impede
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who had learned the substance of Butler's report
Tuesday night, while traveling back to Washington from the Middle
East aboard Air Force One, convened a meeting of his national
security team at 7:30 a.m. Wednesday -- just seven hours after
returning to the White House -- to approve Wednesday's attack
without warning, without diplomacy, without giving Saddam the
chance to make one more promise that few believe would be kept.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was the continuing impediments Saddam threw up
against the UNSCOM inspectors on the ground in Iraq that convinced
Clinton's security advisers that there was little point in giving
Saddam another chance.
</P>
<P>
   Since agreeing on November 15 and 16 to cooperate fully with the
UNSCOM teams, ''Iraq has tried to create new safe havens, they've
cleaned out sites before UNSCOM has arrived, they've interfered
with photography, they've interfered and put at risk (UNSCOM)
helicopters,'' said State Department spokesman James Rubin. ''And
there is no end in sight for this pattern of obfuscation,
obstruction and outright violation.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest act in the long-running U.S.-Iraq drama unfolded on
the eve of a scheduled debate in the House of Representatives over
whether to impeach Clinton on any of four charges stemming from the
Monica Lewinsky sex-and-deception scandal.
</P>
<P>
   That has prompted some of the president's critics, at home and
abroad, to charge Clinton with trumping up a military crisis to
divert public attention from his personal travails, a charge the
administration rejects.
</P>
<P>
   ''The wags will continue to talk about whatever it is we do,''
Rubin told reporters at the regular daily State Department briefing
on Wednesday. ''The timing here is generated by Iraq's failure to
comply.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Clinton's most enduring national security headaches, the
problems with Iraq are those he inherited when he took office in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the terms of his surrender to U.S.-led coalition
forces at the end of the Persian Gulf War in 1991, Saddam agreed to
destroy any chemical, biological and nuclear weapons in his arsenal
and to dismantle any facilities involved in producing such arms.
</P>
<P>
   He further agreed to allow United Nations inspections teams,
structured as UNSCOM, to verify that he did as he promised.
</P>
<P>
   Compliance, though, has rarely been anything other than spotty.
The result is that UNSCOM has not yet been able to verify that Iraq
no longer has, or is building, weapons capable of killing thousands
of people in a single strike with lethal chemicals or deadly germs.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the U.S. intelligence community, moreover, have
testified in recent weeks that Iraq has the capability to build a
nuclear weapon within as little as two years, unless its
proliferation program is curbed.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago last month, Iraq threatened to shoot down the U.S.
warplanes that routinely fly over Iraqi airspace, under U.N.
auspices, in part to provide support to UNSCOM inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Last January, Iraq blocked UNSCOM teams from inspecting
suspected weapons sites, then expelled UNSCOM completely, forcing a
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's response was to deploy a massive military force and
wage a weeks-long campaign to win public support, in this country
and abroad, for contemplated strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Under threat of those strikes, Saddam backed down and, in
February, promised U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan that he would
cooperate with UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
   By August, though, compliance was again thrown into doubt,
though briefly, and in October, Saddam, yet again, challenged
inspectors to the point that they concluded they could no longer
perform their tasks.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted the November Gulf build-up. On November 15,
Clinton ordered a massive attack on Iraq, only to call it off with
bombers only 20 minutes or less from releasing cruise missiles and
bombs against their targets, after Saddam sent a letter, which he
modified through the night and into the morning of November 16,
vowing compliance.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the White House said its plan was to conduct
increasingly aggressive inspections in Iraq to test Saddam's word.
</P>
<P>
   By early Wednesday, the White House verdict was in: ''Iraq has
failed that test,'' said Rubin. ''Iraq has not changed its stripes
and it does not intend to comply.''

   As part of the terms of his surrender to U.S.-led coalition
forces at the end of the Persian Gulf War in 1991, Saddam agreed to
destroy any chemical, biological and nuclear weapons in his arsenal
and to dismantle any facilities involved in producing such arms.
</P>
<P>
   He further agreed to allow United Nations inspections teams,
structured as UNSCOM, to verify that he did as he promised.
</P>
<P>
   Compliance, though, has rarely been anything other than spotty.
The result is that UNSCOM has not yet been able to verify that Iraq
no longer has, or is building, weapons capable of killing thousands
of people in a single strike with lethal chemicals or deadly germs.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the U.S. intelligence community, moreover, have
testified in recent weeks that Iraq has the capability to build a
nuclear weapon within as little as two years, unless its
proliferation program is curbed.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago last month, Iraq threatened to shoot down the U.S.
warplanes that routinely fly over Iraqi airspace, under U.N.
auspices, in part to provide support to UNSCOM inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Last January, Iraq blocked UNSCOM teams from inspecting
suspected weapons sites, then expelled UNSCOM completely, forcing a
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's response was to deploy a massive military force and
wage a weeks-long campaign to win public support, in this country
and abroad, for contemplated strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Under threat of those strikes, Saddam backed down and, in
February, promised U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan that he would
cooperate with UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
   By August, though, compliance was again thrown into doubt,
though briefly, and in October, Saddam, yet again, challenged
inspectors to the point that they concluded they could no longer
perform their tasks.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted the November Gulf build-up. On November 15,
Clinton ordered a massive attack on Iraq, only to call it off with
bombers only 20 minutes or less from releasing cruise missiles and
bombs against their targets, after Saddam sent a letter, which he
modified through the night and into the morning of November 16,
vowing compliance.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the White House said its plan was to conduct
increasingly aggressive inspections in Iraq to test Saddam's word.
</P>
<P>
   By early Wednesday, the White House verdict was in: ''Iraq has
failed that test,'' said Rubin. ''Iraq has not changed its stripes
and it does not intend to comply.''

BROWN BECOMES PATIENT OF JOBE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before the Dodgers rolled out their $105 million man for the
media Tuesday, Kevin Brown went to visit Dr. Frank Jobe, who is to
the human arm what Michael DeBakey is the human heart.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers had no reason to question Brown's ticker. Their new
ace pitcher has proven to have the kind of pump, as well as other
key body parts, that separates one from your generic starting
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   But arms are so fragile, especially those asked to hit 90 miles
per hour on the speed gun, throw 220 or more innings a year, and
last for seven seasons, a veritable eternity in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Jobe knows best, because he's rebuilt a few hundred over the
years. So for assurance and insurance, the Dodgers put Brown's
33-year-old right arm in the hands of the arm doc.
</P>
<P>
   Jobe's report: Kevin Brown has a clean elbow and a clean
shoulder. Brown's right arm is the epitome of health. ``Dr. Jobe
said we got a bargain,'' said Dodgers' general manager Kevin
Malone. ``He should pitch for 10 more years.''
</P>
<P>
   Great. So now would be a good time to renegotiate, right?
</P>
<P>
   Everyone on hand chuckled at the notion of a $105 million
bargain and a warranty on a body part. But the Dodgers and Brown
are dead serious about two of these matters.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers will take Dr. Jobe's report and some more of Rupert
Murdoch's money and buy some disability insurance on their
seven-year investment. Baseball people are already hooting at the
Dodgers giving a pitcher a seven-year contract; it would be double
jeopardy to have Brown's arm blow and not be covered.
</P>
<P>
   And Brown truly he believes he will pitch another 10 years. As
far as he's concerned, he can pitch as long as Nolan Ryan, who
didn't holster his gun until he was 46.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've looked at every year as an opportunity to get better,''
said Brown. ``I'm never satisfied. I'm always looking to be better
and find a way to stay strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can stay away from any freak accident, like falling down
a doorstep, I can be competitive for a long time. I'd like to be
like Nolan and pitch until I'm 46. I obviously don't look that far
ahead, but I believe in my heart of hearts that I can.''
</P>
<P>
   The consensus thought in baseball is that pitchers are poor
risks when it comes to multiyear deals. They only pitch every five
days as it is, and a torn rotator can end a career quicker than any
fastball.
</P>
<P>
   It will shock you not at all to learn that Scott Boras, Brown's
agent, doesn't agree. His research says a 33-year-old position
player is more likely to spend time on the disabled list than a
33-year-old pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   His client has never had any arm problems, and the last three
years of his career are comparable to those of Ryan, Steve Carlton,
Tom Seaver, Don Sutton and Gaylord Perry at the same age. And every
member of that group pitched into his 40s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the elite group of pitchers,'' Boras said, ``Kevin and Greg
Maddux are the only two who have not had any arm problems. When you
look at the general shortage of pitching, it supports the value of
someone like Kevin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team the Padres took to the World Series this year is
basically the same team they had in 1997, with the exception of
Kevin. He's durable, he wins, and he's getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's rich. Having landed his client a contract, Boras
doesn't need a Greek chorus for support. But he's dead-on in his
comparisons. Assuming Brown doesn't have a piano fall on his head,
he could be part of the Dodger rotation in 2005, when he's 40.
</P>
<P>
   Perry, a Hall of Famer, was 21-6 for the Padres in 1978 at the
age of 40. He would win 47 more games over the next five seasons
before finally accepting his AARP card. It's debatable whether his
career was spit-aided, but the numbers seem to hold water.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton, a Hall of Famer, won 16 games at the age of 30 in 1975,
and 15 at the age of 40 in 1984. The ex-Dodger won 108 of his 324
games after turning 35.
</P>
<P>
   Seaver, a Hall of Famer, was 14-2 for the Reds in 1981 at the
age of 36. That was considered a fluke until he bounced back with
16 wins in 1985 at the age of 40, and 15 more in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Carlton, a Hall of Famer, was 23-11 in 1982 at the age of 38. He
won 15 games a year later, and 13 when he was 40. He would pitch
until he was 43.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens has bounced back from a career pause to win a pair
of Cy Youngs after reaching 35. Dennis Eckersley, who just retired,
made more than 600 appearances after turning 30. And we all know
Fernando Valenzuela pitched into his 60s. (Lo siento, amigo.)
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, who will be elected to the Hall of Fame next year, won 19
games in 1977 at the age of 30. Two years later, Angels' G.M.
Buzzie Bavasi balked at Ryan's contract demands. Ryan would move on
and pitch for another 14 seasons, throw three more no-hitters, and
win 71 games in his 40s.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers will settle for half that.
</P>
<P>
   A decade and several world titles from now, maybe everyone will
gather at the ceremony where Brown's jersey and Jobe's scalpel are
retired, and we'll giggle about how $105 million seemed like such a
large number back in '98.

DODGERS' HISTORY OF FREE AGENTS A BUMMER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the Dodgers had considered their free agent history this
shopping season, they wouldn't have signed Devon White, much less
the $105 million man, Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have had little success in the free-agent market.
The signing of Kirk Gibson in 1988 produced a World Series, but
many people forget he played only 179 games the next two seasons
and left the team before the conclusion of the 1990 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to pin the past on them,'' said Dodgers
president Bob Graziano. ``We're dealing with different guys at a
different time, and the decision-making process has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   A glimpse at Dodger free agent lore, or gore:
</P>
<P>
   Terry Forster:
</P>
<P>
   The first major free-agent acquisition, the reliever spent five
years with the team and played in the 1978 and 1981 World Series.
He had 22 saves in 1978, but made only 47 appearances the next
three seasons because of injuries. He's best remembered for giving
up the pennant-losing home run to Joe Morgan in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Goltz and Don Stanhouse:
</P>
<P>
   Two disastrous 1980 signings. A 20-game winner for the Twins in
1978, Goltz was 9-18 in two seasons here before being traded in
1982. Stanhouse was an all-star closer for the Orioles in 1979, but
made just 21 appearances for the Dodgers in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Class of '88:
</P>
<P>
   Despite modest numbers (.290, 25 home runs, 76 RBI), Gibson was
named N.L. MVP for leading the Dodgers to an improbable World
Series championship. The other '88 free agent signee, Mike Davis,
hit .196.
</P>
<P>
   He is best remembered for earning a two-out walk in the ninth
inning of Game 1 from Dennis Eckersley, giving Gibson the chance to
be a hero.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Strawberry:
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers signed Strawberry from the Mets and he hit 28 homers
and drove in 99 runs in 1991. But he was hurt most of the next two
seasons, and a lapse in his drug rehab led to his departure. Brett
Butler, also signed in 1991, was probably the Dodgers' most
successful free agent, although he didn't win a postseason game.
</P>
<P>
   Others of note:
</P>
<P>
   Jim Gott (1990) pitched for five seasons and had 25 saves in
1993. Hubie Brooks (1990) lasted one year. Kevin Gross (1991)
pitched a no-hitter but was 40-43 record in four seasons. Cory
Snyder (1993) hit around .250 in two seasons. Todd Worrell (1993)
saved 111 games between 1995 and 1997, but he ended '97 with a 5.28
ERA and the ire of most fans. Greg Gagne (1996) was a very slight
improvement on Jose Offerman at shortstop. Todd Zeile (1996) hit 30
homers in 1997. Jose Vizcaino (1997) was hurt at mid-season.

COURT RULING FAVORS HOME-SCHOOL PARENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH DALEY AND JOHN ELLEMENT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a major victory for home schoolers that also serves
as a warning to school districts statewide, Massachusetts' highest
court Wednesday ruled that Lynn school officials have no right to
visit parent's homes to see how they teach their children.
</P>
<P>
   Capping a seven-year lawsuit over parents' rights to teach
children any way they choose, the ruling comes at a critical time
for home schoolers: As their numbers have quadrupled in the last
decade to an estimated 4,500 statewide, hundreds of families are
struggling to understand their rights in vaguely written laws and
court rulings.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn will not appeal the decision and the new school
superintendent said Wednesday the district had already begun to
revamp the policy before the Supreme Judicial Court ruled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, this ruling definitely clears the air for school
districts,'' said Lynn superintendent James Mazareas, who took
office in August. The district originally pursued the case because
``Six or seven years ago this was uncharted territory,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The case stretches back to 1991, when Stephen and Lois Pustell
filed a suit against the Lynn School Committee because the board
required home schoolers to be periodically observed by school
officials. In 1994, Michael and Virginia Brunelle faced criminal
charges in the same city when they objected to home visits and
refused to submit their educational plans to Lynn officials.
</P>
<P>
   While the criminal charges were dropped, the Brunelles, Pustells
and their attorneys challenged the validity of Lynn's policy first
in the federal courts and then in the state courts during the past
three years. Meanwhile, both couples, each with five children,
continued teaching their children at home rather than sending them
to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just thrilled with the decision,'' said Stephen Pustell,
44, a computer analyst, Wednesday. The city's job ``is to know that
children are being educated, not to educate them.''
</P>
<P>
   The court did not rule on the constitutionality of visiting home
schoolers and instead relied on a much simplier argument: there is
no state law that says school districts can require home visits.
The court also re-emphasized parents' long-standing rights to
educate their children in the best way they see fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big victory with national significance,'' said Michael
Farris, a lawyer from the Virginia-based Home School Legal Defense
Association, who represented the parents. ``Home school laws are in
constant flux. If this decision would have gone the other way, we
think there would have been copycat school districts all over the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   While Lynn is considered the only school district in the country
to have required home visits, some school districts statewide have
had the requirement on their books, but did not enforce it. Some
districts that did not have the requirement would ask parents for
home visits. Many times parents, unsure of their rights, agreed to
allow inspectors into their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ruling will help clarify things,'' said Pat Farenga,
president of Holt Associates, publisher of a magazine about home
schooling. ``There are a lot of people who don't want to report
they home school because of the vagueness'' of regulations.
</P>
<P>
   State law does allow local boards to monitor home schooling.
Most school systems require some type of documentation _ portfolios
of student work, assurances that students are being taught the full
school year, or proof of lesson plans.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, some school districts said they welcomed the SJC
decision to give them guidance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law is very vague. . .it's been difficult,'' said Lois
Sullivan of the Cambridge Public Schools. While home visits can be
part of an agreement between a home schooler and the district, it
is never required, she said, adding, ``This will help us.''
</P>
<P>
   While flatly rejecting the inclusion of home visits as a
mandatory right of school board's oversight, the SJC left the door
open for home visits in cases where a child may be failing
educationally, or if other families send their children to a
neighbor for schooling.
</P>
<P>
   But the SJC said there was no valid reason to consider home
visits essential today to meet the state goal of ensuring all
children are being properly educated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teaching methods may be less formalized, but in the home
setting may be more effective,'' Greaney wrote.
</P>
<P>
   While not directly endorsing the home schooling movement, the
court said officials need to trust that parents who choose home
school over public school are capable of educating their children _
although it many be in a different way than a public school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We doubt that parents like the (Brunelles and Pustells), who
are so committed to home education that they are willing to forgo
the public schools, and devote substantial time and energy to their
children, will let the children's progress suffer for lack of
adequate instructional space,'' he wrote.

NASA OFFICIALS STRESS SAFETY TO WORKERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amid excitement over the success of its first international
space station assembly mission, top NASA officials have urged
thousands of workers involved in the U.S.-led project to guard
against becoming complacent over safety.
</P>
<P>
   New cautionary notes were sounded soon after the space shuttle
Endeavour touched down late Tuesday at NASA's Kennedy Space Center
in Florida. The shuttle's six-member crew joined the first two
modules of the orbital outpost during a 12-day flight.
</P>
<P>
   Full assembly will require six years, at least 35 more space
shuttle missions and more than 160 spacewalks by U.S. and Russian
astronauts. Space agency officials characterized Endeavour's flight
as one of the 17-year-old shuttle program's most difficult but one
of the less complicated for station construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not project forward that everything is going to be
easy,'' warned NASA administrator Dan Goldin as he greeted the
Endeavour crew. ``This is tough stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Holloway, NASA's shuttle program manager, said, ``Although
(the Endeavour mission) appeared easy, I can assure you it took a
lot of hard work, preparation and attention to detail to make sure
it operated the way it did.''
</P>
<P>
   Holloway disclosed a memo circulated before Endeavour's Dec. 4
launching in which he urged workers to ``take stock'' of their
safety commitments based on what he characterized as three recent
``close calls'' for shuttles and other highly visible incidents in
commercial aerospace, such as the May 1996 crash of a ValuJet
airliner in the Florida Everglades that killed 110 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shuttle is a robust system and fundamentally very safe.
The people make it safe,'' Holloway said. ``I wanted to remind the
work force it is their responsibility and our responsibility. That
includes the decisions I make every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The incidents he cited include the previously disclosed loss of
the drag chute door on the shuttle Discovery as it launched Oct. 29
with a crew that included 77-year-old U.S. Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio.
The 11-pound aluminum door fell from the tail where a braking
parachute is housed for the shuttle's landing. The panel struck an
engine nozzle as it fell away.
</P>
<P>
   The consequences could have been catastrophic had the panel
struck and punctured enough of the 1,082 lines that circulate
explosive hydrogen through the three nozzles for cooling.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway said the cause of that incident still is under
investigation but appears to involve several factors. Those include
an unusually rough rocket engine ignition and an inadequate design
of the door hinges. In combination they permitted the vibrations to
shake the door off.
</P>
<P>
   The parachute was not used on Endeavour's mission and a redesign
effort for the door is under way.
</P>
<P>
   A second incident involved Discovery's June 2 launching to the
Russian Mir space station. Early in Discovery's ascent, a rocket
engine pressure sensor was rendered inactive by a small piece of
test equipment that had been inadvertently left inside a narrow
hydrogen line during ground operations.
</P>
<P>
   A backup sensor furnished reliable pressure readings to shuttle
flight computers.
</P>
<P>
   But had the disruption occurred later in flight, the computers
might have shut down the engine prematurely, triggering a launch
abort, Holloway said.
</P>
<P>
   The initial incident he cited was also previously disclosed and
involved unmanned shuttle activity. On Nov. 11, 1997, the shuttle
Atlantis left Kennedy bolted atop a jumbo jet for a round of
modifications and inspections at Boeing Co. facilities in Palmdale,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Later, it was discovered that some of the large washers that
distribute the forces of the 150,000-pound shuttle on the fastening
bolts had not been installed. In a worst case, Atlantis could have
separated from the jumbo jet in mid-air.

JOHN HANCOCK TO PURSUE ACQUISITIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Budgeted as Hancock-Unit)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Dormant in recent years as a buyer of financial
services firms, John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. is
reactivating the acquisitive streak it displayed earlier this
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock, among the nation's top 15 life insurers, said Wednesday
it would seek to buy smaller financial companies next year as it
prepares to go public. After raising cash in a planned initial
public offering in early 2000, Hancock intends to spend billions of
dollars more acquiring additional financial firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're looking for is to grow the asset management piece
of the business right now,'' Hancock chief financial officer Thomas
Mallory said. ``There's the possibility for more acquisitions in
1999, and after demutualization, the size of the acquisitions will
become much larger.''
</P>
<P>
   A company statement said Hancock would concentrate on smaller
mergers and acquisitions before converting from a mutual company,
owned by its policyholders, to a publicly owned company, a process
known as demutualization. Once publicly traded, the statement said,
Hancock would seek deals worth several billions of dollars to
expand products and distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock is part of a larger trend among insurers seeking to cast
off the mutual form of ownership in favor of going public and
gaining access to capital markets to finance acquisitions.
Insurance companies are particularly keen to acquire more assets in
the retail fund, variable annuities, and pension businesses as well
as broaden the channels through which they sell products.
</P>
<P>
   Mallory said estimates Hancock could raise $10 billion to $14
billion in an initial public offering were ``a little high,''
adding that if market conditions were not right, the company could,
under special conditions agreed with regulators, delay issuing
stock until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock bought a host of smaller mutual fund firms between 1991
and 1994, building up its John Hancock Funds unit. Then it fell
quiet, selling off its Tucker Anthony Inc. and Sutro &AMP; Co.
brokerage and investment units in 1996 in much-criticized deals.
Hancock officials declined to comment on new acquisition targets,
but one fund industry source said the company was eyeing Nicholas
Applegate Capital Management of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry observers have wondered if Hancock would
eventually sell itself to a bank, possibly BankBoston Corp. or
Fleet Financial Group Inc. But Salomon Smith Barney analyst Colin
Devine said Hancock was behaving like a company that intended to
remain independent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've actually decided that banks are in our
future _ that would appear very long term,'' Mallory said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its new expansion effort, Hancock appointed senior
vice president and former treasurer John Farady to head up a new
strategic acquisitions unit. Gregory Winn, a vice president, was

 &HT;    Forbes questions Lockheed plant's future
 &HT;    By Staff reports
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Newt Gingrich's departure as speaker of the House may
be a blessing to Lockheed Martin, since it will remove the last
protector of Lockheed's giant _ but costly _ suburban Atlanta
assembly plant, Forbes (Dec. 28) says. Now, Forbes contends,
Lockheed Martin Chairman Vance Coffman will be able to apply the
cost-cutting knife even to the World War II-vintage aircraft plant
that employs 9,600 _ a plant Forbes calls ``an albatross'' for
Lockheed Martin.
</P>
<P>
   According to Forbes, the company's third-quarter financial
report lists a writedown of $350 million to $400 million for the
first quarter of 1999, ``mostly to cover cost overruns on the
latest update of the C-130 Hercules, which is built in Marietta.''
Forbes suggests this may be ``a first installment'' on the cost of
closing the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes says the plant is also in trouble developing the Air
Force F-22 stealth fighter, a joint $40 billion program with
Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Blackwell, president of Lockheed Martin's aeronautics
divison, rejects the idea of closing the Marietta plant, because it
would be too costly to do so, although he is closing 40 smaller
factory units in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasts keep coming
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 forecast sweepstakes continue with magazines offering
their best bets for the year ahead.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine (January) is out with
its annual forecast issue, which concludes ``there is more promise
than peril'' for investors in the year ahead. As for the ``Year
2000'' problem _ when computers will be confused by a year ending
in double zeros _ Kiplinger's says ``most things will still work.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Individual Investor (January) says the outlook for stocks ``is
as uncertain as it's been in awhile,'' which is why the magazine
suggests investors spread their risk. The magazine recommends
stocks in five groups: corporate titans (Time Warner), turnaround
plays (Motorola), on the move (Gulfstream Aerospace), special
situations (Monsanto) and bargain bin (Ford Motor).
</P>
<P>
   More consumer delights
</P>
<P>
   Glorious TV pictures, portable phones that operate anywhere,
artificial skin for treating disease, and Viagra, Pfizer's
impotence pill, are among the best new products of 1998, Business
Week (Dec. 21) reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be they lightweight computers, clever toys or medical marvels,
the products touch every part of our daily lives,'' says the
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Others include Gillette's triple-bladed razor, Yamaha's silent
violin that the musician hears via headphones, and without
disturbing the neighbors, and, of course, Furby, Tiger Electronics'
gremlin-like doll.
</P>
<P>
   Worth mentioning . . .
</P>
<P>
   _ Success (January) offers readers a ``guide to the 21st
century,'' complete with advice on raising capital, hiring and
tapping new markets.
</P>
<P>
   _ Barron's (Dec. 14) looks at the best and worst of new stock
offerings in 1998, noting that IPOs _ initial public offerings _
looked dead in the water about five months ago only to come roaring
back, powered by the Internet.

 &HT;    Martinez on mission of conscience
 &HT;    By Tim Tucker
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dennis Martinez went home to Nicaragua in fine style
last month, traveling with Tipper Gore and six members of Congress.
``There I was on Air Force Two, like a dream,'' Martinez says. But
all the while, traveling to the hurricane-ravaged nation, he felt
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking: `Why do I, a kid from Nicaragua, have all that
I have?' '' he says. ``I've always felt proud about what I've done
in my life. But now I felt so bad to know I sit in my (Miami)
house, with whatever luxury I can have, eating and drinking
whatever I want, when so many people in my (homeland) suffer
without food or medicine or a place to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt ashamed of myself in a way. The more I think about it,
the more down I get. And the more I have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   And so Dennis Martinez, the winningest Latin American pitcher in
baseball history, a big leaguer for 21 seasons and a Brave in '98,
was in Atlanta on Wednesday, starting an effort to raise $100,000
here for Nicaraguans suffering from the devastation of Hurricane
Mitch. The idea is that Martinez, in conjunction with Turner
Broadcasting and WSB-TV's ``Family 2 Family'' project, can raise
enough money to buy a planeload of medical supplies. And then the
Hawks' team plane, underutilized these days, will fly the items to
Nicaragua on Jan. 18.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he returned from his trip on Air Force Two, Martinez
began a campaign to collect food, medicine and clothing in Miami,
and he talked a business executive into providing a plane to take
the goods to Nicaragua a few weeks later. For Martinez, so popular
in his homeland that he often is mentioned as a possible
presidential candidate there, it was another painful trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``People wanted the supplies, but they were more interested in
the boxes,'' he says, sadly. ``They said they could use the boxes,
which were large, to make a shelter over their children. Or turn
them into sleeping mats for the kids. That's how bad it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Mitch killed 11,000 people, left millions homeless and
did billions of dollars of damage in Central America. Doing what he
can, Martinez will have another planeload of supplies ready to
leave Miami for Nicaragua soon. And among other things, he has
written letters to every major-league player and general manager,
asking for assistance. ``It hurt me _ I couldn't believe it'' _
when two teams wrote back saying they couldn't help, Martinez says.
He also was disappointed by the initial response from players, but
he says they have come around, and ``now, almost every day, one or
two checks arrive.''
</P>
<P>
   As he discussed Hurricane Mitch's devastation over lunch
Wednesday at a CNN Center restaurant, Martinez spotted Ted Turner
across the way. He chased him down and hugged him. Back at the
table, the 43-year-old pitcher said he hasn't decided whether he
wants to play baseball in '99. If he plays, he'd prefer to play
here, but the Braves haven't approached him. The Cleveland Indians
expressed interest, but he put them off until January. ``Right now,
my mind is not on baseball.''

IN LOS ANGELES, SET-DRESSING THE SUBWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Dec. 20.) 
(dal) 
 By DAVID HAY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When the Red Line subway station on the corner of
Beverly Boulevard and Vermont Avenue opens here next year, the
first thing commuters will see is a giant outcropping of
sandy-colored rock that straddles the entrance. Looming ominously
over the escalators down to the trains, it looks like a leftover
from the desert scenes in ``Raiders of the Lost Ark.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to reveal the relationship of the subway to its
geological environment,'' said George Stone, a sculptor
commissioned by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to
enliven this station. ``Architecture in general tends to hide the
fact of its location, even the fact, in this case, that we are
underground.''
</P>
<P>
   What Stone calls his ``art rocks'' _ three more of the
prefabricated boulders hang from the roof of the pristine,
marble-floored station below _ are part of one of the most
imaginative public art programs in the country. Though other
cities, including New York, have major subway art initiatives, Los
Angeles is distinct for insisting that artists be included at the
planning stages.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is exciting about this program is the experimental way in
which the art has been worked into the design process right from
the beginning,'' said Elizabeth Smith, a curator at the Los Angeles
Museum of Contemporary Art. ``A subway station used to be the
province of the engineer and the architect. Now the artist has been
allowed to to have a profound impact on the physical aspect of the
space.''
</P>
<P>
   This impact was first evident in the small section of the Red
Line that opened in June 1990. The contribution from artists has
been expanded in the design of the next eight stops, which will
extend the $2.75-billion line from downtown to North Hollywood.
Each station has been allocated $300,000 for art. Five of these
stops are scheduled to open in May; the final three are to be ready
a year later.
</P>
<P>
   A quintessentially suburban city with no history of underground
mass transit, Los Angeles has been slow to warm to the idea of a
subway. The project has been dogged by controversy from its
beginning in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, tunneling at the corner of Normandie Avenue and
Hollywood Boulevard caused a sinkhole wide enough to gobble up
cars. During later excavation, sections of the famous boulevard
near the Chinese Theater sank by more than a foot.
</P>
<P>
   Then came opposition from home owners above the Cahuenga Pass.
They staged loud protests, ultimately unsuccessful, against the
plan to tunnel under the Hollywood Hills and into the San Fernando
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the negative publicity helped insure passage of
Proposition A, a countywide referendum, which prohibits use of MTA
money for further ``below ground'' projects, including the
extension of the Red Line into the predominantly Hispanic
neighborhoods of East Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Given the lukewarm public reaction, MTA officials hope their
ambitious Metro Art Program will promote a more positive image,
even if the subway has a doubtful future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Art is a means by which we can give the community a sense of
ownership and pride in their subway,'' said Maya Emsden, director
of the program.
</P>
<P>
   Program officials relied on neighborhood input, picking boards
of community advisers to help design each station. Along with two
outside art experts, these advisers chose the final plans.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Stone, a talkative devotee of environmental and
narrative uses of sculpture, the agency got more than it bargained
for. Some officials feared that the artist's rocks at the
Vermont-Beverly Station were too suggestive of earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board freaked,'' the 52-year-old artist recalled. ``I went
round and got letters from psychologists, who reassured us that the
rocks would not scare off potential riders.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The Red Line station at Vermont Avenue and Santa Monica
Boulevard bears the imprint of the minimalist artist Robert Millar.
The 40-year-old Millar, who worked for 12 years as a lighting
consultant on public works projects, suggested to the station's
architect, Mehrdad Yazdani, that they create a space for street
performers behind the large glass and steel wedge that towers over
the entrance for the station. To illuminate this street-level
plaza, which is next to Los Angeles City College, Millar
collaborated with the designer, Teal Brogden, in drawing up giant,
Coca-Cola red, cantilevered lights. Giant versions of movable
bedside lamps, they give the station a powerful glow at night.
</P>
<P>
   Millar, a Californian in the tradition of Robert Irwin, James
Turrell and Ron Cooper, will make his greatest impact on the long,
gray concrete entrance tunnel. This month the artist, a thoughtful,
blond-haired beach dweller, is planning to paint the tunnel walls
with 10,000 questions, ranging from ``Does art seek meaning?'' and
``Does art avoid meaning?'' to ``Does the public transportation
system make moral decisions?'' and ``How might tomorrow be
different from today?''
</P>
<P>
   The questions will be spelled out in Times Roman, a type font
used by many newspapers; Millar said he wanted ``to refer back to a
newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Viewed from afar they serve to give a texture to the space,''
the artist said. Up close, he added, the riders can read each
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority aren't that important,'' Millar said. ``But
they're part of the process that leads you to ask the more
important questions.''
</P>
<P>
   On the wide concrete beams that cross the entrance-tunnel roof,
the artist has erected compositions of blue, white and red
fluorescent tubing. Opposite them, Millar placed a series of
minimalist paintings made from poly-carbonate. Clear in some
places, opaque in others, they subtly absorb the multihued light
from his fluorescent strips.
</P>
<P>
   Assigning different artists to eachsubway stop means no two
stations will look alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted subway riders to know where they were by seeing the
art,'' Ms. Emsden said. ``It's a modern version of traditional
signage.''
</P>
<P>
   May Sun, a soft-spoken, 44-year-old multimedia artist, is
working on the stop at the economically depressed corner of
Hollywood Boulevard and Western Avenue. She placed detailed
reminders of what she called the corner's ``neglected history''
into the station's tiled walls and floors.
</P>
<P>
   At the entrance, commuters will walk across a series of granite
tiles, each of which bears the outline of a fossil: the molar of a
mastodon, a camel tooth and the toe of a prehistoric horse. All
were uncovered at the site during the long months of tunneling. Ms.
Sun laid other tiles into the entrance, their surface patterns
modeled on hobo signs _ familiar greetings left by one transient to
another _ found in railway yards during the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Photographic murals of railroad workers in Los Angeles,
including those building this new subway, line a mezzanine wall.
Smaller snapshots of neighborhood landmarks like the Variety
Discount Bargain Saver store across the street are placed in the
tiled entrance walls.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by the animals that once roamed the Hollywood Hills,
Ms. Sun designed Matisse-like portraits of a cougar, a deer and a
fish in red granite, which appear on tiles in the station's floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to have a lot of different elements,'' said Ms. Sun,
whose earlier work includes ``L.A./River/China/Town,'' an
installation project. ``I thought the same people would be taking
the subway on a daily basis and I wanted them to discover something
new each time.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Davis designed the station at the corner of Sunset
Boulevard and Vermont Avenue. On a visit to the site eight years
ago, the 50-year-old artist turned his eyes north and saw the
Griffith Park Observatory, a local landmark that brought back
childhood memories; Davis grew up in the Crenshaw District and
could see the observatory from his home. Wanting to use the stop,
which is flanked by three hospitals, to lift the spirits of riders,
he decided to incorporate his memories into his design.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a whole thing about the 1950s,'' said Davis, wiry and
engaging, with short, silver-blond hair. ``There was a real
optimism about the future then. You could see it in their designs,
even in the space stations they liked to draw.''
</P>
<P>
   The artist decided that his station would be an homage to ``one
of those imaginary spaceships.'' Davis' playful take on deep space
is immediately apparent in the open, curving entry tunnel. The
railings have different-sized orbs _ patterned after constellations
_ set between bars. On the mezzanine level, riders will walk under
a stainless-steel circular roof. Each of its silvery sheets has
been punched with countless tiny holes. Lighted brightly from
above, Davis' ceiling resembles a star-studded sky.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing a more literal connection to the hospitals above, Davis
created his version of the nine planets, circular cast-terrazzo
tiles set in the marble floors. On each he etched an abstract
medical image. The smallest is a replica of a virus as seen through
a microscope. The next largest is Davis' rendering of the X and Y
chromosomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Astronomy is looking for the same things as medicine _ the
origins of life,'' Davis said. ``This was the best way of combining
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The artist Magu, formerly known as Gilbert Lujan and a founding
member of a group of Chicano artists known as Los 4our, took a much
less abstract approach to his commission at Hollywood and Vine. The
station is an homage to the movie industry.
</P>
<P>
   On the street-level plaza, pedestrian shelters are topped by
replicas of the Brown Derby, a white stretch limousine and the roof
of Mann's, formerly Grauman's, Chinese Theater. A yellow-tiled
pathway _ the artist's version of the Yellow Brick Road _ leads
down the steps and through the winding mezzanine, where it ends
facing two giant, old-fashioned projectors donated by Paramount.
The station's roof is lined with now-obsolete 35-millimeter film
reels, painted blue.
</P>
<P>
   Magu has set 242 hand-painted tiles into the station's walls.
Some are tributes to Hollywood's past; others, like the tiles
depicting the elaborately made-over low-rider cars that cruise the
boulevard at night, reflect the more recent history of this famous
street.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the MTA is not taking any chances that its art will go
unseen. For those Angelenos who remain wary of mass transit, yet
still want to view these Red Line stations, the agency is
sponsoring art tours.

HARVARD INVESTMENT EXECUTIVES' COMPENSATION UP 55 PERCENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The price of excellence keeps going up at Harvard Management Co.
</P>
<P>
   Compensation at the investment arm of Harvard University jumped
55 percent for the top six executives in the last fiscal year.
Jonathon Jacobson, the perennial top earner, became the first to
pass the $10 million mark. Two other managers fell just shy of $10
million each.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson, who left Harvard Management in July to start his own
private investment fund, made $10.2 million for the fiscal year
ended in June, up from $7.6 million the year before. Jacobson's
equity portfolios produced an extraordinary annualized return of
42.7 percent over the last three years. He declined to comment on
his compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, five Harvard money managers and the firm's
president, Jack Meyer, made $45.4 million, up from $29.2 million
the year earlier. The 1998 compensation is nearly four times the
$11.6 million that the top six executives were paid two years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   As it has in the past, Harvard Management defended the pay
levels, which have been controversial in some quarters because they
dwarf what top academics at the university receive. It said the
compensation reflected the value the managers had added to the
school's $13 billion endowment.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Harvard Management reported a total return for
fiscal 1998 of 20.5 percent, or 2.6 percentage points ahead of the
typical large institutional fund. Over five years, Harvard showed
an annualized return of 19.6 percent compared with 14.8 percent for
similar funds. Harvard estimates its outperformance provided the
university with an extra $2.7 billion over that five years.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most money management firms, Harvard is required to
report on compensation in the tax returns it files as a nonprofit.
Most of the compensation for money managers is tied to performance
rather than salaries, and factors in performance over three years,
Harvard says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been an extraordinary three-year period and that is
what you are seeing in the bonuses,'' Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Jacobson, the other top earners at Harvard
Management were: David Mittelman, a fixed-income manager, $9.8
million; Phillip Gross, equities, $9.7 million; Robert Atchinson,
equities, $7.9 million; Maurice Samuels, $6 million; and Meyer, the
president, $1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Lieberman, managing director of the Orion Group, a
mutual fund executive search firm in Princeton, N.J., said it was
not unusual to see a top mutual fund manager making $3 million to
$5 million. The $10 million paid by Harvard is unusual, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten million does not put them in a class by themselves, but in
the mutual fund business as opposed to the hedge fund business it
puts them on the high end,'' Lieberman said.

BUG BOOK PROVIDES FOOD FOR THOUGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Rich Martin  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Everyone's looking for the perfect diet. Well,
here's one that will do the trick. Guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy. You need lots of protein, a little fat and some bugs.
</P>
<P>
   Try a Three Bee Salad for lunch. How about Cockroach a la King?
</P>
<P>
   David George Gordon has opened a new front in the anti-fat war
with ``The Eat-A-Bug Cookbook'' (Ten Speed Press; $12.95). And he
makes as good a case as can be made for eating insects.
</P>
<P>
   Livestock are a ``tremendous waste of the planet's resources,''
while chickens and pigs cause pollution. All those animals create
methane gas, which leads to global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon also points out in the 102 pages that we are eating bugs
whether we know it or not. The Food and Drug Administration lists
permissible amounts of insects in various foods. You may want to
put that sandwich down before reading this, but two or three
fruit-fly maggots are allowed in 200 grams of tomato juice and 34
fruit-fly eggs are permitted in a cup of raisins.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are finicky about eating insects, though he points out
how we don't mind scarfing down huge amounts of fat. On the other
hand, Colombians eat roasted ants in movie theaters and insects are
common fare in the Third World.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Gordon is a good advocate. But I'm bugging out of this
menu. Our rating: (2 stars) &QL;

   __Yellowstone, like Yosemite and the Grand Canyon, can provide a
microcosm of the country's natural history. Paul Schullery, in
``Searching for Yellowstone'' (Houghton Mifflin Co.; $25), serves
up tidbits that provide penetrating insights into issues of
conservation and development _ inside and outside the famous
national park.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the 338-page book centers on the debate over Yellowstone
wildlife, which may be the park's biggest draw despite the geysers.
There are too many elk, or maybe there aren't. The philosophy used
to be that predators were bad and must be eradicated; now grizzly
bears and wolves are seen as enhancing the park.
</P>
<P>
   The book attempts to show how environmental views have changed
since Yellowstone inaugurated the National Park System in 1872.
Since World War II, Schullery points out, the emphasis has been on
the appreciation of nature on its own terms.
</P>
<P>
   Another major issue has been the preservation of species, with
Yellowstone the testing ground. Protecting single species has given
way to the prevailing view now of preserving habitat. Introducing
non-native species is no longer seen as a good practice.
</P>
<P>
   Schullery, a historian, outdoors writer and longtime Yellowstone
employee, is refreshingly free of agenda. He wonders how
Yellowstone could have avoided becoming such a popular park and
refuses to give in to environmental doomsaying _ one of the less
attractive aspects of the movement.
</P>
<P>
   Other enlightening parts of the book focus on the U.S. Army's
administration of the park in the 19th century and the prominent
role of railroad interests in early development. Our rating: (3
stars) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __Reading Robert Mohle's Southern California kayaking book makes
one want to get out there. That it stokes the flames of desire for
adventures may be the best possible recommendation for a guidebook.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adventure Kayaking: Trips From Big Sur to San Diego''
(Wilderness Press; $15.95), includes 52 well-organized trips,
including nine in the Channel Islands and several others in Los
Angeles, Ventura, Orange, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo and
Monterey counties, as well as on the Colorado River.
</P>
<P>
   Each section includes topographic maps and voluminous data on
how to get to the location, recommended skill levels, camping,
water hazards and lengths of the trips. An introduction provides
some of the basics necessary before undertaking such journeys.
There is a decent appendix and plenty of description of personal
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   One can quibble about the 277-page work. It seems strange there
is only one Ventura County outing. And the photos, while decent,
would have been much better in color.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the organization, introduction and overall quality make this
a more-than-adequate guidebook. Our rating: (2{ stars)

<P>
   Air power is an unusually seductive form of military strength,
in part because, like modern courtship, it appears to offer
gratification without commitment.
</P>
<P>
   More than one commentator who had reservations about aerial
bombardment in the Persian Gulf War expressed a newfound belief in
its utility as a tool of U.S. foreign policy in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Lewis of The New York Times wrote during the gulf
conflict in disgust at the ruin wrought by aerial bombardment: ``We
should never again tolerate anyone who talks about `surgical
strikes.'''
</P>
<P>
   Since then he has developed a keener appreciation of air power,
more recently asserting that ``a few air strikes in Dubrovnik''
would have stopped the Yugoslav horrors in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Many individuals came away from the gulf war with a far
healthier respect for air power, believing it had made all the
difference. Indeed it had. Some 52,000 air-to-surface sorties
delivered approximately 210,000 unguided bombs, 9,300 guided bombs,
5,400 guided air-to-surface missiles and 2,000 anti-radar missiles.
</P>
<P>
   American forces also hurled more than 300 cruise missiles at the
enemy. To what effect? Of its 700 aircraft, the Iraqi air force
lost 33 in the air; approximately 140 perished in hardened aircraft
shelters and more than 120 were flown to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi air-defense system succumbed within days _ really,
hours _ to an extremely sophisticated attack. It managed to shoot
down only a tiny fraction of the attacking aircraft. Moreover, air
power had completely disrupted Iraqi logistics and immobilized the
Iraqi army.
</P>
<P>
   Although ground action necessarily consummated the final victory
for coalition forces, air power had made the final assault as
effortless as a wartime operation can be.
</P>
<P>
   If the claims of air-power advocates are correct, the United
States, after the gulf war, acquired a military edge over
conventional opponents comparable to that exercised in 1898 by the
soldiers of Lord Kitchener against the sword-wielding dervishes of
the Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if air power performed as spectacularly as first
appeared in the Persian Gulf, the way to a U.S.-policed world order
might look remarkably smooth. Did, then, the gulf war become a
major departure in the history of warfare and has it paved the way
to unshakable American military preeminence?
</P>
<P>
   This conflict saw the first extensive use of some new
technologies. The F-117 stealth fighter penetrated Iraqi radar
safely and secretly. The Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar
System detected Iraqi trucks and tanks along highways in Kuwait. An
array of satellites gave unparalleled support to military
commanders for intelligence gathering, map-making, communication,
navigation, meteorology and missile-launch detection.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the bulk of the work came from much older systems and
mundane technologies such as air refueling. In fact, most of the
weapons used in the Persian Gulf dated back two decades or more.
Air Force B-52 and Navy A-6 bombers had seen at least 20 years of
active service, although they employed newer electronics. Guided
bombs first appeared in the Vietnam War, when U.S. aircraft dropped
4,000 or so on the Vietnamese communists. Even modern, first-line
fighters such as the F-16 have been in use for almost a decade.
</P>
<P>
   So the ``military-technical revolution'' sparkled in new
systems, but it drew as much on considerably more mature
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The most profound change in military technology, however, was
the vast increase in usable and communicable information. The 1991
war saw, for example, the first combat use of the Global
Positioning System, which allows units to locate their position in
three dimensions by a mere press of a button.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional warfare depends increasingly on the skillful
manipulation of electronically transmitted information. The
advantage goes overwhelmingly to combatants who can bring together
information from many sources, including updating old databases _
for example, removing from the target list a radar station already
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, the struggle for information may assume the place
a contest for geographic position took in the past. But the
information explosion does not mean that war will become more
``transparent'' to those who conduct it. The so-called ``fog of
war'' may now descend on the battlefield not so much from a paucity
of good information as from a plethora of half-knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Such a fog certainly lay heavily over the Persian Gulf conflict.
There, commanders changed one-fifth of all missions during the few
hours between the time staffs printed the centralized air-tasking
order and the time aircraft took off. They made many more changes
before the order was officially issued and still more after
aircraft had left their bases.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes these decisions made sense; other times they did not.
In all cases they created great uncertainty among the pilots flying
the missions. Indeed, pictures sometimes lie, or at least deceive.
Coalition air planners in Riyadh tried to do their own bomb-damage
assessment by looking at videotape footage of laser-guided bomb
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking time _ and, in some cases, experience in photo
interpretation _ they sometimes misinterpreted what they saw,
mistaking an exploding fuel truck or decoy for a mobile missile
launcher, for example, or thinking that a bomb bursting on a
concrete roof meant the contents of the building had been
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Vietnam War, American generals have decried civilian
micro-management of military operations, an indictment only partly
warranted but accepted uncritically by politicians as well as
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, the danger of military micro-management looms
much larger. A general in Washington, an admiral in a command ship
or a theater commander in rear headquarters may have access to
almost the same information as a forward commander, and in some
cases more. Those distant commanders will often succumb to the
temptation to manipulate individual units in combat.
</P>
<P>
   During the gulf war, pilots complained of having to fly missions
without the kind of target graphics they had used in training. In
the future, soldiers may become overly dependent on detailed,
well-presented and accurate information that simply may not exist
in wartime.
</P>
<P>
   And as the verisimilitude of computer simulators and war games
increases, future warriors may paradoxically find themselves all
the more at a loss when the real world differs sharply from a
familiar cyberworld.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the more sophisticated and expensive the
information-gathering system, the greater the premium opponents
will put on disabling it with anything from electronic attack to
homing missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The gulf conflict also demonstrated a trend toward the evolution
of distinct families of munitions. Anti-radiation missiles not only
destroyed Iraqi radars, but intimidated air-defense crews from
turning them on in the first place. Specially tipped laser-guided
bombs punctured hardened aircraft shelters immune to regular high
explosives.
</P>
<P>
   But as air-delivered munitions have become increasingly
specialized in their effects, they have become susceptible to
unintentional misuse.
</P>
<P>
   Air-campaign planners expected extremely high kill rates against
Iraqi tanks and armored vehicles, for example, based on the use of
a scatterable mine, the CBU-89. But the projected lethality of
CBU-89 relied on calculations made for a war in Europe, fought
against Soviet tank armies on the move. Against static, dug-in
Iraqi tanks, the CBU-89 had much less to offer.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, reliance on air power has set the American way of war
apart from all others for well over half a century. Only the United
States has engaged in a single-minded and successful quest for air
superiority in every conflict it has fought since World War I.
</P>
<P>
   And so air warfare remains distinctively American _ high-tech,
cheap in lives and, at least in theory, quick. To America's enemies
_ past, current and potential _ it is the distinctively American
form of military intimidation. Air warfare plays to the
machine-mindedness of American civilization. Aircraft can direct
massive and accurate destructive force at key points without having
to maneuver cumbersome organizations on land or sea.
</P>
<P>
   Air power can indeed overawe opponents, who know quite well that
they cannot hope to match or directly counter American strength.
But these enemies may well find indirect responses. When F-117s
struck the al-Firdos bunker _ a perfectly appropriate military
target _ they apparently killed the wives and children of Iraqi
leaders using the facility as a shelter.
</P>
<P>
   For the next four days, all air operations against Baghdad
ceased. When they resumed, politically motivated controls reduced
the number of targets to a bare handful. The simple and brutal fact
remains that force works by destroying and killing.
</P>
<P>
   As leaders attempt to use their civilians as hostages against
American air power, whether we like it or not, it will become ever
more true that war will mean bringing power, particularly air
power, to bear against civil society.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries military power has become
increasingly intertwined with civil society. The electric
generators that keep a defense ministry's computers running and its
radars sweeping the skies also send energy to hospitals and
water-purification plants. Bridges indispensable to the movement of
military forces also carry food, medicine and other goods to
civilian populations.
</P>
<P>
   When American presidents use air power, they should either hurl
it with devastating lethality against a few targets _ say, a
full-scale meeting of an enemy war cabinet or senior military staff
_ or extensively enough to cause sharp and lasting pain to a
military and a society.
</P>
<P>
   The sprinkling of air strikes over an enemy will harden him
without hurting him and deprive the United States of an intangible
strategic asset.

gratification without commitment.
</P>
<P>
   More than one commentator who had reservations about aerial
bombardment in the Persian Gulf War expressed a newfound belief in
its utility as a tool of U.S. foreign policy in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Lewis of The New York Times wrote during the gulf
conflict in disgust at the ruin wrought by aerial bombardment: ``We
should never again tolerate anyone who talks about `surgical
strikes.'''
</P>
<P>
   Since then he has developed a keener appreciation of air power,
more recently asserting that ``a few air strikes in Dubrovnik''
would have stopped the Yugoslav horrors in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Many individuals came away from the gulf war with a far
healthier respect for air power, believing it had made all the
difference. Indeed it had. Some 52,000 air-to-surface sorties
delivered approximately 210,000 unguided bombs, 9,300 guided bombs,
5,400 guided air-to-surface missiles and 2,000 anti-radar missiles.
</P>
<P>
   American forces also hurled more than 300 cruise missiles at the
enemy. To what effect? Of its 700 aircraft, the Iraqi air force
lost 33 in the air; approximately 140 perished in hardened aircraft
shelters and more than 120 were flown to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi air-defense system succumbed within days _ really,
hours _ to an extremely sophisticated attack. It managed to shoot
down only a tiny fraction of the attacking aircraft. Moreover, air
power had completely disrupted Iraqi logistics and immobilized the
Iraqi army.
</P>
<P>
   Although ground action necessarily consummated the final victory
for coalition forces, air power had made the final assault as
effortless as a wartime operation can be.
</P>
<P>
   If the claims of air-power advocates are correct, the United
States, after the gulf war, acquired a military edge over
conventional opponents comparable to that exercised in 1898 by the
soldiers of Lord Kitchener against the sword-wielding dervishes of
the Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if air power performed as spectacularly as first
appeared in the Persian Gulf, the way to a U.S.-policed world order
might look remarkably smooth. Did, then, the gulf war become a
major departure in the history of warfare and has it paved the way
to unshakable American military preeminence?
</P>
<P>
   This conflict saw the first extensive use of some new
technologies. The F-117 stealth fighter penetrated Iraqi radar
safely and secretly. The Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar
System detected Iraqi trucks and tanks along highways in Kuwait. An
array of satellites gave unparalleled support to military
commanders for intelligence gathering, map-making, communication,
navigation, meteorology and missile-launch detection.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the bulk of the work came from much older systems and
mundane technologies such as air refueling. In fact, most of the
weapons used in the Persian Gulf dated back two decades or more.
Air Force B-52 and Navy A-6 bombers had seen at least 20 years of
active service, although they employed newer electronics. Guided
bombs first appeared in the Vietnam War, when U.S. aircraft dropped
4,000 or so on the Vietnamese communists. Even modern, first-line
fighters such as the F-16 have been in use for almost a decade.
</P>
<P>
   So the ``military-technical revolution'' sparkled in new
systems, but it drew as much on considerably more mature
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The most profound change in military technology, however, was
the vast increase in usable and communicable information. The 1991
war saw, for example, the first combat use of the Global
Positioning System, which allows units to locate their position in
three dimensions by a mere press of a button.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional warfare depends increasingly on the skillful
manipulation of electronically transmitted information. The
advantage goes overwhelmingly to combatants who can bring together
information from many sources, including updating old databases _
for example, removing from the target list a radar station already
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, the struggle for information may assume the place
a contest for geographic position took in the past. But the
information explosion does not mean that war will become more
``transparent'' to those who conduct it. The so-called ``fog of
war'' may now descend on the battlefield not so much from a paucity
of good information as from a plethora of half-knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Such a fog certainly lay heavily over the Persian Gulf conflict.
There, commanders changed one-fifth of all missions during the few
hours between the time staffs printed the centralized air-tasking
order and the time aircraft took off. They made many more changes
before the order was officially issued and still more after
aircraft had left their bases.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes these decisions made sense; other times they did not.
In all cases they created great uncertainty among the pilots flying
the missions. Indeed, pictures sometimes lie, or at least deceive.
Coalition air planners in Riyadh tried to do their own bomb-damage
assessment by looking at videotape footage of laser-guided bomb
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking time _ and, in some cases, experience in photo
interpretation _ they sometimes misinterpreted what they saw,
mistaking an exploding fuel truck or decoy for a mobile missile
launcher, for example, or thinking that a bomb bursting on a
concrete roof meant the contents of the building had been
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Vietnam War, American generals have decried civilian
micro-management of military operations, an indictment only partly
warranted but accepted uncritically by politicians as well as
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, the danger of military micro-management looms
much larger. A general in Washington, an admiral in a command ship
or a theater commander in rear headquarters may have access to
almost the same information as a forward commander, and in some
cases more. Those distant commanders will often succumb to the
temptation to manipulate individual units in combat.
</P>
<P>
   During the gulf war, pilots complained of having to fly missions
without the kind of target graphics they had used in training. In
the future, soldiers may become overly dependent on detailed,
well-presented and accurate information that simply may not exist
in wartime.
</P>
<P>
   And as the verisimilitude of computer simulators and war games
increases, future warriors may paradoxically find themselves all
the more at a loss when the real world differs sharply from a
familiar cyberworld.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the more sophisticated and expensive the
information-gathering system, the greater the premium opponents
will put on disabling it with anything from electronic attack to
homing missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The gulf conflict also demonstrated a trend toward the evolution
of distinct families of munitions. Anti-radiation missiles not only
destroyed Iraqi radars, but intimidated air-defense crews from
turning them on in the first place. Specially tipped laser-guided
bombs punctured hardened aircraft shelters immune to regular high
explosives.
</P>
<P>
   But as air-delivered munitions have become increasingly
specialized in their effects, they have become susceptible to
unintentional misuse.
</P>
<P>
   Air-campaign planners expected extremely high kill rates against
Iraqi tanks and armored vehicles, for example, based on the use of
a scatterable mine, the CBU-89. But the projected lethality of
CBU-89 relied on calculations made for a war in Europe, fought
against Soviet tank armies on the move. Against static, dug-in
Iraqi tanks, the CBU-89 had much less to offer.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, reliance on air power has set the American way of war
apart from all others for well over half a century. Only the United
States has engaged in a single-minded and successful quest for air
superiority in every conflict it has fought since World War I.
</P>
<P>
   And so air warfare remains distinctively American _ high-tech,
cheap in lives and, at least in theory, quick. To America's enemies
_ past, current and potential _ it is the distinctively American
form of military intimidation. Air warfare plays to the
machine-mindedness of American civilization. Aircraft can direct
massive and accurate destructive force at key points without having
to maneuver cumbersome organizations on land or sea.
</P>
<P>
   Air power can indeed overawe opponents, who know quite well that
they cannot hope to match or directly counter American strength.
But these enemies may well find indirect responses. When F-117s
struck the al-Firdos bunker _ a perfectly appropriate military
target _ they apparently killed the wives and children of Iraqi
leaders using the facility as a shelter.
</P>
<P>
   For the next four days, all air operations against Baghdad
ceased. When they resumed, politically motivated controls reduced
the number of targets to a bare handful. The simple and brutal fact
remains that force works by destroying and killing.
</P>
<P>
   As leaders attempt to use their civilians as hostages against
American air power, whether we like it or not, it will become ever
more true that war will mean bringing power, particularly air
power, to bear against civil society.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries military power has become
increasingly intertwined with civil society. The electric
generators that keep a defense ministry's computers running and its
radars sweeping the skies also send energy to hospitals and
water-purification plants. Bridges indispensable to the movement of
military forces also carry food, medicine and other goods to
civilian populations.
</P>
<P>
   When American presidents use air power, they should either hurl
it with devastating lethality against a few targets _ say, a
full-scale meeting of an enemy war cabinet or senior military staff
_ or extensively enough to cause sharp and lasting pain to a
military and a society.
</P>
<P>
   The sprinkling of air strikes over an enemy will harden him
without hurting him and deprive the United States of an intangible
strategic asset.

SIGNS OF RENEWAL IN THE LATEST BRITISH INVASION  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 20.)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
Will Joyner, a former editor for Arts and Leisure, writes
frequently about film and television. 
 By WILL JOYNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This week, five films that can legitimately be described as
British will be showing in U.S. theaters. Given the anxiety of
holiday marketers, that number is in itself an eye-popper.
</P>
<P>
   What's more surprising, though, is that not one of these British
films is about expendable laborers trying to salvage self-regard in
a renovated upland city, or about young professionals contemplating
themselves in the sleek surfaces of the new London.
</P>
<P>
   These films _ ``Elizabeth,'' ``Little Voice,'' ``Shakespeare in
Love,'' ``The General'' and ``The Theory of Flight'' _ don't
represent anything as grand as the renaissance of a national
industry that looked so healthy in the 1960s and then again in the
1980s. The vagaries of multinational financing and staffing make
such a notion a dated one anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But the films' variety _ from sly revisionism on the Elizabethan
era to speculation about love and Lou Gehrig's disease _ is the
sign of a heartening creative reawakening. The sort of Yank
Anglophile who thinks back to classics like ``Room at the Top,''
``Sunday, Bloody Sunday,'' and ``My Beautiful Laundrette'' more
readily than to television's ``Upstairs, Downstairs'' should at
least start paying closer attention to the new images of Britain
that are sneaking now onto movie screens in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, the British cinematic presence here was less
distinct, and less encouraging. ``Nil by Mouth,'' the actor Gary
Oldman's grim depiction of his origins amid a working-class mire of
violence and addiction, was an impressive directorial debut but
almost willfully incoherent, in structure and dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Leigh's ``Career Girls'' had a razor-sharp poignance
because Katrin Cartlidge and Lynda Steadman were so perfectly in
form as newly mature women who meet again and reflect on their
dissolute student days. That movie nevertheless felt like a minor
chapter in Leigh's admirably idiosyncratic chronicling of
contemporary, class-skewed England.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, and more disturbingly, a film called
``Twenty-four Seven,'' the debut of a young director, Shane
Meadows, found its way into U.S. release. Set in decayed
Nottingham, ``Twenty-four Seven'' starred Bob Hoskins as an
alcoholic who tries to align his own recovery with that of a crew
of unemployed miscreants by reopening a boxing club.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a searing performance by Hoskins, the film left the
impression that it was simply a black-and-white, indie-hip exercise
on a socio-cultural theme that had recently been more adeptly
explored in ``Brassed Off''(out-of-work miners maintain their
identity through a brass band), ``The Full Monty' (out-of-work
steelworkers maintain their identity through bump-and-grind
dancing) and, in its own way, ``Trainspotting'' (out-of-work young
people maintain their identity through heroin).
</P>
<P>
   The implication was that the same amusing-but-painful,
stiff-upper-lip movie was going to be made over and over again
until all Britons were somehow integrated into the post-industrial
economy. Then, in late spring, from across the genre spectrum, came
``Sliding Doors'' and ``Shooting Fish.''
</P>
<P>
   For all their quirky angles and the charms of Gwyneth Paltrow
and Kate Beckinsale, respectively, these films implied that the
London romantic comedy was still following a course set four long
years ago by ``Four Weddings and a Funeral.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a relief when ``The Land Girls,'' an earnest, well-made
drama about the home front during World War II, appeared in early
summer. ``The Land Girls'' may have been predictable, but it was
what the British predictably do best: evoking that part of the 20th
century in which Britain was still arguably the center of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this fall, the best British film to open in U.S.
theaters, ``Velvet Goldmine,'' was actually a U.S. film, or, at
least, was directed by an American, Todd Haynes. That film _ a
scary fable about the glam-rock scene in the London of the early
70s, starring Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Ewan McGregor, financed on
both sides of the Atlantic _ represents a good argument for no
longer even speaking of British film, or American film, or Irish
film.
</P>
<P>
   These days, anyone who, through the good graces of Working Title
or BBC Films or Miramax, can avoid the Hollywood maw and put
together a distinctive piece of work occupies creative territory
that is, practically speaking, just as special as a homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The General,'' which opened on Friday, presents the same
argument: although it was directed by an eminent Englishman, John
Boorman, the movie is, after all, about a notorious Irish gangster,
Martin Cahill; it was filmed in Dublin, and it stars a red-hot
Irish actor, Brendan Gleeson. And Boorman himself lives in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That said, ``The General'' does have the feel of a film made by
a British director. Cahill's brutal story is told almost as that of
an Everyman, with an odd but effective mix of intimacy and
restraint; the details of Irish political life are present,
certainly, but are rendered in a peripheral manner that would be
unimaginable if the subject matter were in the hands of a romantic,
of Irish directors like Neil Jordan or Jim Sheridan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The General'' is British in the sense that it is planted in a
tradition that also includes memorable works like Karel Reisz's
``Saturday Night and Sunday Morning'' (1960) and Tony Richardson's
``This Sporting Life'' (1963), which also center ambivalently on
rogue heroes.
</P>
<P>
   The four other British films in U.S. theaters now may not be as
accomplished as ``The General,'' but they perhaps say even more
about where one should search hopefully for a renewed British
cinema.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little Voice,'' Mark Herman's adaptation of the play about an
emotionally damaged young woman with a gift for imitating great
singers, has some of the same overly melodramatic structure of his
``Brassed Off.'' Here, however, there is a range of darker, more
intricate acting _ especially on the part of Jane Horrocks in the
title role, Brenda Blethyn as her hysteric mother and Michael Caine
as a never-has-been promoter _ that tempers Herman's
sentimentalism, making for a more mature movie.
</P>
<P>
   As for approaches to Britain's past, it's possible to imagine a
stock, pedantic screen account of the young Elizabeth I, but
Shekhar Kapur's ``Elizabeth'' is surely not that. The
Protestant-Catholic gamesmanship that surrounded her ascendancy is
depicted in all its soul-staining terror, and Cate Blanchett,
although she's as gorgeous as ever, leads the way in working
against any notion that beauty and truth and goodness were the
order of the day.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Shakespeare in Love,'' no one will accuse John Madden
of not venturing from the traditional approach to a British icon
that he took to such fine effect last year in ``Mrs. Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is still such a thing as British film, then one of the
primary things going for it is a large pool of extraordinary actors
_ if they can be persuaded to touch base between more lucrative
Hollywood sojourns for long enough to make movies. In that regard,
``The Theory of Flight,'' which opens on Wednesday, is greatly
encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   It's a small, eccentric film but boasts two big, talented stars,
Helena Bonham Carter and Kenneth Branagh, who clearly relish art as
much as opportunity. As flawed as the film may be _ and the
metaphor-heavy attempt by a troubled artist (Branagh) to build a
flying machine gets a bit much _ Ms. Bonham Carter, who plays a
victim of Lou Gehrig's disease, offers up ample revelatory moments.
Her performance is a reminder that a British film is often the
occasion for an acting accomplishment that's larger than the movie
itself; Robert Carlyle's powerful presence in Michael
Winterbottom's ``Go Now'' is another example from the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Flight imagery abounds in the current crop of British films _ in
``The General'' and ``Little Voice,'' pet homing pigeons carry the
burden _ and in this context, the irony is obvious. British cinema
has always had trouble keeping its best directors from flying the
coop _ or, more accurately, has had trouble persuading them to
persuade Hollywood that the coop's an interesting spot to revisit,
as their Irish counterparts have managed to do with movies like
``The Boxer.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Britain's best directors, Stephen Frears, had a movie
open on Friday. It's called ``The Hi-Lo Country,'' and the title
refers to New Mexico, not the Lake District.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best wish that one could make for British film is
that Frears turn back to another film based on a Roddy Doyle novel,
or that Mike Newell return home from ``Donnie Brasco'' and
``Pushing Tin,'' his forthcoming movie about U.S. air-traffic
control.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, who needs them? There's a lot to be said for
simply looking forward to January and Ken Loach's ``My Name Is
Joe.''

HUNT IS SACRED _ AT LEAST TO THE HUNTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH MARTIN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``The Sacred Hunt II'' (Marty Stouffer Prods.;
$24.95) successfully argues the virtues of hunting but too often
engages in overkill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hunt,'' by Randall L. Eaton, with music by 50-year-old rocker
Ted Nugent, states the case for the defense: The sport provides
what men lack and what they desperately need _ a connection to the
land. Further, the video shows the mythic aspects, especially
American Indian views of hunting, as a male initiation rite and the
respect paid to the quarry.
</P>
<P>
   The activity, its proponents say, provides a unique relationship
to the land and to our past as hunters. But that sounds arrogant,
since hiking, fishing and many other outdoor activities could be
touted as having many of the same benefits. And to say that killing
an animal affords some kind of religious experience is going too
far.
</P>
<P>
   But the hour-long video achieves its goal of portraying the
honorable form of hunting _ when the animal should be used and
eaten, not simply thrown away, and it observes the cycles of life
and death.
</P>
<P>
   The sumptuous photography itself is enough to recommend this
work, even after the argument (repeated in solemn tones) becomes
tiresome and starts to sound a lot like propaganda. Our rating: (2{
stars)

BODY OF AMERICAN JOURNALIST FOUND IN MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CARMINA DANINI  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _20The body of an American journalist missing in the
rugged mountains of western Mexico was found Wednesday by Mexican
soldiers, a U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   Philip True, the Mexico City-based correspondent for the San
Antonio Express-News, apparently fell to his death in the Sierra
Madre range's Chapalagana Canyon, on the border between the states
of Nayarit and Jalisco.
</P>
<P>
   True's body was recovered by an army helicopter and flown to the
city of Tepic, said an official at the American consulate in
Guadalajara.
</P>
<P>
   True, 50, was last seen on Dec. 4 in Jalisco. He had embarked on
a solo hiking trip Nov. 29 to a sparsely populated area of the
Sierra Madres to photograph and report on the Huichol Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all mourn the loss of a colleague and an outstanding
journalist,'' said Larry Walker, publisher and chief executive of
the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Jesus Reyes Heroles, Mexico's ambassador to the
United States, said federal and state officials had few details
about the death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The corresponding authorities are going to put all their
efforts and attention to this matter,'' Reyes said, expressing his
``deepest regrets for this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   In a story proposal made in March, True said he wanted to write
about the Indians because, in contrast to the Maya Indians of
Mexico's highlands, the Huicholes ``have retained a certain joy in
their life. This kind of joy gives them a certain integrity in
their being that allows them to welcome in strangers, something the
Maya are usually loathe to do.''
</P>
<P>
   A latecomer to journalism, True was hanging wallpaper until his
late 30s, said John MacCormack, a San Antonio Express-News
reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``But by the time he was 50, he was the correspondent in Mexico
for a major Texas newspaper,'' MacCormack said. ``His dream came
true.''
</P>
<P>
   True's colleagues in the Mexico City press corps were stunned by
news of his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us correspondents _ and it's a very small community _ this
is a very sad day,'' said Paul de la Garza of the Chicago Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   Tracey Eaton, bureau chief for the Dallas Morning News, said:
``This just breaks all of us up. This is not one of our great
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Eaton recalled True as ``someone who really loved Mexico, and he
would go after stories with gusto.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Sam Dillon of the New York Times: ``He was a good
reporter.''
</P>
<P>
   Born on June 18, 1948, in San Fernando, Calif., True graduated
from the University of California at Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to be a teacher, but the school district wouldn't
hire him unless he cut his long hair,'' said his sister, Bonnie
Biggs, of Reno, Nev. ``Philip said his hair had nothing to do with
his teaching ability so he didn't cut it.''
</P>
<P>
   True moved to New York, where he worked on the docks and later
as a maritime union representative.
</P>
<P>
   He later made his way to the Texas-Mexico border and was hired
at the Brownsville (Texas) Herald.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the staff of the Express-News in 1992, and became the
newspaper's first border correspondent. He remained at the border
bureau in Laredo until January 1996, when he took over the Mexico
City bureau.
</P>
<P>
   As a newspaper reporter for the Express-News, True covered the
Zapatista uprising in Chiapas, opposition leader Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas' unsuccessful quest for the presidency in Mexico, the
massacre of Indian peasants in Guerrero, and Pope John Paul II's
historic trip to Cuba in January.
</P>
<P>
   He was still in Laredo when the Zapatista rebels launched a
brief uprising on Jan. 1, 1994, in the southern state of Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   True departed immediately for Chiapas and covered the rebellion
that ended 12 days later when then-President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari declared a cease-fire. Later that same year, True reported
on a meeting supporters held with ``Subcommander Marcos,'' the
Zapatista leader.
</P>
<P>
   His last major article for the newspaper was on the Sierra Gorda
Biosphere Reserve in Queretaro, Mexico, an environmental project
that has drawn international support and interest.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Marta, who is five months' pregnant
with their first child; his sister, Bonnie Biggs; and two nieces.
</P>
<P>
   A family member said True's body would be cremated in Mexico
City.

 &HT;    Scientists find Korean researchers' human clone claim suspect
 &HT;    By Diane Lore and Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ South Korean researchers said Wednesday they cloned a
human embryo through a breakthrough experiment - prompting other
scientists to question the accuracy of the claim and the Asian
team's medical ethics.
</P>
<P>
   The research team, headed by Kim Sung-ho and Lee Bo-yon of
Kyunghee University Hospital in Seoul, said they produced the
embryo using an unfertilized egg and a cell taken from the body of
a woman in her 30s. The embryo was aborted after it had divided
into four cells because of ethical and legal reasons, according to
the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But other cloning experts said Wednesday they were suspicious of
the claim and appalled at the attempt. No scientific papers had
been presented on the work and the team had not submitted their
results for peer review before making the announcement at a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen any information that suggests that they've
actually accomplished this,'' said Steven Stice, a world-class
cloning expert at the University of Georgia. ``And to say you have
four cells is a far cry from saying you have succeeded at cloning
humans.''
</P>
<P>
   Stice, formerly of Massachusetts, was the first in the world to
produce cloned calves that were also products of transgenics, the
science of altering and adding genes.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the Roslin Institute near Edinburgh, Scotland, who
produced the first cloned mammal, Dolly the sheep, were also
puzzled by the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is little in the reports to suggest that their work is
part of a substantial program of research,'' said Harry Griffin,
assistant director of the institute.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Caplan, professor and director of the Center of Bioethics
at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, emphatically
disparaged the Koreans for what he called their ``cowboying their
way to headlines.''
</P>
<P>
   ``First, science by press conference in an area like cloning is
very suspect,'' Caplan said. ``I believe that's a highly
inappropriate way to announce anything about cloning. If it is
true, it is an unethical, outrageous thing to have done, simply
because it would only be done for curiosity.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Caplan reiterated his earlier prediction that the first
human clone would be produced by foreign scientists. Many
scientists have agreed that human cloning is within the realm of
possibility, but say they will not pursue research in that field
because of ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Caplan emphasized that for every successful animal cloning,
there have been dozens _ in some cases, hundreds _ of dismal
failures resulting in grotesque malformations that are horrifying
in animals and would be tragic in humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't even know yet if Dolly and the other animal clones
are healthy,'' Caplan said. ``Making people for curiosity when you
can harm them is the height of irresponsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the experiment, Lee said he used the same
technique used by Teruhiko Wakayama of the University of Tokyo, who
produced 50 cloned mice from several different adult animals in
July while at the University of Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   The Korean experiment involved replacing the nucleus of the
donated egg cell with the nucleus of an ordinary body cell. The
scientists induced the egg to divide as if it were fertilized,
before the experiment was ended Friday. The embryo, if brought to
maturity, would have been genetically identical to the donor of the
body cell, they claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said Wednesday it probably is possible to clone humans
through the technique, but that it is morally reprehensible to
attempt it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt that any of all of us could do (human
cloning),'' said Corey Goodman, professor of neurobiology and
genetics at the University of California-Berkeley. ``If you can do
it for mice and cattle, you can do it for humans. This is not a
question of can we do it but should we do it? And I thought that
had argument had already been settled.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman speculated that the South Korean researchers were
conducting human-cloning experiments because it has been banned in
many other countries, setting the stage for publicity in a country
that had not outlawed such experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Virginia Papaioannou, a professor of genetics and
development at Columbia University in New York, also said she
believes the science is possible, but that the ethical cost in
experimenting with humans is too high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most responsible scientists have accepted that any technique
needs to be worked out very carefully in model animals and systems
before it could be applied to humans,'' Papaioannou said.
</P>
<P>
   And Stice, who's been successful at cloning, said there is still
a high failure rate with the procedure. It is indeed not difficult
to clone in the early stages. However, Stice said cloning experts
have found problems typically arise after embryos have developed
between 100 and 200 cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting beyond that is tough,'' he said. ``So there's no
indication that getting a four-cell embryo means you could get an
offspring.''
</P>
<P>
   Stice points out that one of the most difficult parts is getting
the embryos to thrive and implant properly. Stice's technique still
results in eight of 10 cloned embryos dying. And of those
implanted, only 20 percent survive. And that's considerably better
than the rate at the Roslin Institute. To get Dolly, the cloned
sheep, the institute made more than 250 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hilton Kort of Reproductive Biology Associates in Atlanta, a
leading infertility clinic, said four-celled embryos do have a
chance at successful implantation _ if the cells are healthy and
the development rate is on track. Typically, an embryo reaches the
four-cell stage roughly two days after the egg is fertilized.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see some embryos at 72 hours that are four cells,'' Kort
said. ``That's clearly not normal. Those embryos have a much lower
likelihood of implantation.''
</P>
<P>
   RBA waits to implant embryos in a woman's uterus until they are
between 6 and 12 cells, Kort said. RBA also has started implanting
embryos at a later stage of development, when they have divided
into hundreds of cells.
</P>
<P>
   News of the Korean experiment drew protests from local
environmental groups, and the South Korean parliament is
considering legislation that would prohibit gene reassembling
experiments ``which infringe upon the dignity of human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee said the research team had no intention of creating a
complete human clone, but hoped the technology could lead to the
production of replicated organs for transplant. Lee said the
research team would not attempt to take the cloning experiment
further until there was a social, legal and moral consensus to
support it.
</P>
<P>
   Stice said he has not heard of Lee or his team, nor had others
in the tightly-knit cloning world community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid it might be just a ploy to raise public awareness
for their cause,'' he said. ``This is extremely unfortunate and I'm
totally against what they are doing.''

 &HT;    Online shopping clicks in
 &HT;    By Frances Katz and Patti Bond
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This holiday season, it's not the crowds at the mall,
it's the crowds in front of the computer that shoppers must contend
with.
</P>
<P>
   The Web has emerged in 1998 as the year of the online shopper,
with millions of shoppers heading to the keyboard to buy most
everything they'd normally buy at the mall.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, America Online, the nation's largest online
service, said 750,000 first-time buyers logged on to do a little
holiday shopping. AOL said consumers snapped up everything from
toys to computer software. The company said the average shopper is
buying online twice every week, averaging $54 per order, more than
48 percent more than last year. Top categories for AOL users were
toys, children and baby items, apparel, books and music, and
electronics and video.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the apparel merchants, the Gap, J. Crew, Lands
End, Levi's, Eddie Bauer,'' says AOL's Vice President of E-commerce
Wendy Brown, ``it's literally as a good a selection as malls get. A
lot of people in America don't have access to these stores _ or not
all in one place as you have here. You're really seeing the
traditional things, but merchants have been able to use the space
to promote certain items.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of online shopping sales are as extravagant as
Amazon.com's stock price rise. A recent report by the Boston
Consulting Group and Internet retail trade group Shop.org says 1998
online sales will exceed $13 billion. Research firm Jupiter
Communications is half that optimistic, projecting $5.8 billion in
online revenue this year. But Jupiter predicts that by 2002, online
sales will hit $40.6 billion _ or equivalent to the current annual
revenue of Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Holiday sales alone this year will reach $2.35 billion,
according to Dataquest Inc., a unit of research firm Gartner Group
Inc. Still, that's less than 1 percent of projected holiday retail
sales of $490 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Media Metrix, the Web-based measurement service, reported this
week that online shopping sites show major growth across all gift
categories. In the week following Thanksgiving, Dec. 4 -10, Media
Metrix says online shopping increased 80 percent from the previous
week.
</P>
<P>
   Media Metrix Senior Vice President Bob Ivins, who heads the
company's' e-commerce initiatives, said the week-to-week growth
patterns suggest that ``shoppers are motivated to use a mouse and a
modem rather than fight crowds in malls or on Main Street.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go into one of the large bookstores and have to go
through what seems like a million books, then the Internet is a
feasible alternative for looking something up,'' said Beth
VanStory, vice president of Office Depot's online venture. Office
Depot took that theory, combined with its Internet-suitable
products, and launched a Web page in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, many of our customers don't shop for office
products for enjoyment. It's a chore, and the Internet makes it
easier,'' VanStory said. The site is generating sales equal to two
superstores, and VanStory expects that to increase 350 percent next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Office Depot sees the Web page as another channel of
distribution rather than a replacement for its sprawling
warehouse-style stores. But the company does expect online shopping
to impact its catalog business, VanStory said.
</P>
<P>
   Newcomers to online shopping headed straight for the online
outposts of their favorite department stores, with department store
Web sites reporting a 137 percent increase in traffic over the
pre-Thanksgiving period.
</P>
<P>
   Reflect shopping lists
</P>
<P>
   Media Metrix's most popular sites mirror the AOL users shopping
lists: book, music and movie sites such as Amazon.com, Barnes and
Noble, CDNow, Reel.com and others. Media Metrix reported 5.5
million visitors to those sites, followed by toys, apparel and
department store Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester analyst James McQuivey says one reason for the jump in
online shopping this quarter is that there are more things for
consumers to buy. ``Now everything you can think of is online,
including a Soviet satellite from online auctioneer eBay, although
nobody bid on it.''
</P>
<P>
   McQuivey used the satellite example to illustrate how many
products and retailers are online this holiday season who weren't
as recently as six months ago. ``There is more product online and
the people who were already shopping online reacted by spending
more because they had a comfort level and doubled the amount they
were spending. Then they went and told their friends, saying, 'You
should do this; this is the greatest thing since sliced bread,' and
then you have all these newbies coming online to shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had projected just over 2 million U.S. households would
shop online this quarter,'' McQuivey said, ``so AOL's numbers
indicate we are on track or maybe even conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds simple on its face to say there are more sites and
there are more people, but the reality is that there are so many
choices now that consumers are more likely than before to find an
online retailer they feel comfortable with.'' McQuivey also said
that the shopping boom is also partly due to online retailers
becoming more savvy in their use of Internet technology. ``They
explain privacy policies and made the ordering process faster. All
these little tweaks here and there mean more people are buying
things.''

REP. SOLOMON SAYS CLINTON TIMED ATTACK TO DELAY IMPEACHMENT VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: SUBS to recast 3rdgraf, ``For him ...)

 By ERIC ROSENBERG and JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Gerald B. H. Solomon, R-N.Y., on Wednesday
called President Clinton's decision to attack Iraq ``outrageous''
and accused him of launching air strikes on that nation in order to
delay an impeachment vote in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon, who is retiring at the end of the year, is chairman of
the House Rules Committee and an outspoken critic of Clinton. He
said White House officials were ``doing everything they can to
postpone this vote on impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For him to do this at this unbelievable time is just
outrageous,'' Solomon said, asserting there was no pressing
military need to attack Iraq as the House was preparing to debate
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon reflected Republican skepticism over the timing of the
air strikes and Clinton's motives for ordering them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never underestimate a desperate president,'' he said. ``This
time he means business. What option is left for getting impeachment
off the front page and maybe even postponed? And how else to
explain the sudden appearance of a backbone that has been invisible
up to now?''
</P>
<P>
   Solomon added, ``If he (had) delayed this until Monday or
Tuesday, it would still be outrageous but would not be as political
as it is today.''
</P>
<P>
   When Iraqi President Saddam Hussein surrendered after the 1991
Persian Gulf War, he agreed to relinquish nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons to U.N. inspectors. But the inspectors have
repeatedly cited the Iraqi regime for failure to reveal the extent
of its illegal weapons programs and for stockpiling weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ordered the attack a day after Richard Butler, the
U.N.'s chief weapons inspector, reported that Iraq was not
cooperating with his team.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon said Clinton could have ordered attacks against Iraq
many times since February after confrontations with the regime over
weapons violations, but chose not to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why now?'' Solomon asked.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., also raised
questions Wednesday about the strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both the timing and the policy are subject to question,'' Lott
said. ``While I have been assured by administration officials that
there is no connection with the impeachment process in the House of
Representatives, I cannot support this military action in the
Persian Gulf at this time,'' Lott added.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tillie Fowler, R-Fla., a member of the House National
Security Committee, said, ``I think this president is shameless in
what he would do to stay in office.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spokesman Joe Lockhart, responding to the criticism,
said, ``The president of the United States makes national security
decisions based on the recommendations of his national security
advisers and on the best interests of the people of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., called Solomon's comments
``outrageous,'' and added that the New York congressman ``has spent
a career making outrageous comments.'' Gejdenson said the attack on
Iraq was justified and that ``as an ex-Marine, Solomon should know
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all Republicans challenged the timing of the attack on Iraq.
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
said, ``Saddam Hussein has left the United States with no choice
but to strike Iraq, and I believe most Americans will support the
decision by our defense leaders.''

ITALY FREES KURDISH REBEL LEADER FROM HOUSE ARREST 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ An appeals court in Rome freed a Kurdish rebel leader
from house arrest Wednesday, further inflaming a bitter diplomatic
dispute between Italy and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The court determined that Italy had no grounds for detaining
Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party, which has
been fighting for self-determination in southeast Turkey. But
Italy's prime minister, Massimo D'Alema, quickly said Ocalan would
nevertheless be kept under police surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   After the ruling, Turkish officials, already furious with Italy
for refusing to extradite Ocalan to Turkey, expressed outrage and
renewed threats of economic retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will damage Turkish-Italian relations and international
law,'' Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin told Turkish television
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Italy has refused to extradite Ocalan, who is wanted in Turkey
on terrorism charges, because of a law that bans the extradition of
prisoners to countries with a death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan was arrested in Rome on Nov. 12 while trying to enter
Italy from Moscow on a false passport. Shortly after his arrest, he
requested political asylum in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Italy has so far been unable to persuade other European
countries to take him off its hands.
</P>
<P>
   Germany, which issued a warrant for Ocalan's arrest in 1990 on
homicide charges, declined to ask for his extradition, fearing
repercussions from Turkey and from Turks living in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, both D'Alema and Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said
Italy would either have to make Ocalan available for trial or expel
him. Neither mentioned a third option: granting him political
asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, D'Alema, a former Communist, refused to rule out
political asylum, a choice favored by some leftists in his
coalition. But pressure from Turkey and the United States, which
also regards Ocalan as a terrorist, has made political asylum less
palatable. Human rights groups have also accused Ocalan of killing
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers representing Ocalan said that though he was free to
leave Rome, he had decided to stay in the apartment where he had
been held under house arrest and await a decision on political
asylum. A commission of the Interior Ministry is expected to decide
on asylum by the end of the month or early January.

   PHOENIX - Fruitcake.
</P>
<P>
   There, we said it. Go ahead and giggle. That it's the only
material denser than a neutron star. That it should be an element
on the Periodic Table of Culinary Crap. That U.N. inspectors were
alarmed that Iraq had obtained advanced fruitcake technology.
</P>
<P>
   Knock knock. Who's there? Fruitcake. Go away or we'll call the
police.
</P>
<P>
   The sentiment, and the jokes, aren't new. The baked confection
gets less respect than the tobacco industry. Its name is a slang
(and politically incorrect) term for the mentally challenged.
</P>
<P>
   Through all this, the fruitcake lives. No, it thrives. Its gooey
goodness continues to spread holiday cheer throughout the
hemispheres, and not just because it travels so well.
</P>
<P>
   Fruitcake inspires the kind of passion rarely associated with
fruit-based goods. Do you find such emotional Internet sites
devoted to the pros and cons of the raspberry Danish? Raisin bread?
Apple Betty?
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead, cut into. Feel the surface give just slightly before
the knife slides in. Once inside, the knife meets just a slight
resistance before its dense treasures are revealed.
</P>
<P>
   Mmmm, pineapple. Cherries. Raisins. Walnuts. Dates. Pecans.
Those green chunks you can't quite identify but know are bursting
with fruity-nutty flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Few people participate in the annual ``Bring a Fruitcake to Work
Day'' (sponsored by the fictitious National Council of Fruitcakes).
But those who do say that, after their offerings receive the
popularly enforced snubs, the cake disappears bit by bit. Computer
techs report a higher incidence of ``foreign and very sticky
matter'' wedged between keys.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of fruit in cake is not lost on the good people
of Corsicana, Texas. If not for that simple combination of
ingredients, Corsicana might be known as ``The Gateway to Angus''
instead of ``The Fruitcake Capital of the World.'' Well, no one
really calls Corsicana that, at least to its face, but it is home
to Collin Street Bakery, where more than 33,000 fruitcakes roll off
the line each day during the holiday rush. That would be enough to
feed all residents of Corsicana each day, as long as they held
themselves to 1.3 fruitcakes each (and far above the U.S.
government's recommended daily fruitcake allowance).
</P>
<P>
   The bakery ships to 196 countries and is one of the few firms in
the world to be honored by the New York Gourmet Society as well as
the Texas Historical Commission. OK, maybe it's the only company
with those two plaques.
</P>
<P>
   (Warning, mandatory pun ahead.) Think people are nuts to like
fruitcake? The Collin Street Bakery makes a lot of dough. More than
$30 million a year in fruit, nuts and decorative tins.
</P>
<P>
   No one sends his favorite aunt a basket of holiday jelly
doughnuts. You can't order a lovely Santa tin of bear claws on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Fruitcakes are where you least suspect them. Like monasteries.
At least the monastery belonging to the Monks of Holy Cross Abbey
in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to prayer, solitude and communion with God, the
monks bake a mean fruitcake, one so good they unconditionally
guarantee it. Sales of the Monastery Fruitcake are the monks' chief
means of support. As ye bake, so shall ye reap. Be fruitcakeful and
multiply.
</P>
<P>
   Visit the monks' Web site (www. &QL; 
olworld.com/olworld/mall/mall &QL; 
(underscore)us/c(underscore)flower/ &QL; 
m(underscore)fruitcake/aboutcak.html) and learn not only of
Monastery Fruitcakes but of the demands of abbey life.
</P>
<P>
   You won't find such philosophical insights at www.pecanlogs.com.
In fact, you won't even find www.pecanlogs.com. Not even the star
of truck-stop snacks can compete with fruitcakes' popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Which came first, the fruits or the nuts? The holiday treat's
history is shrouded in baking mystery.
</P>
<P>
   It first was known for its mystical powers of healing . . . no,
wait, that refers to TV evangelists, not the kind of fruitcakes
we're looking for.
</P>
<P>
   First mention of the foodstuff apparently goes back to Roman
times, when it included ingredients such as pine nuts and raisins.
A century or so later (a mere decade in fruitcake years), Europeans
added spices, honey and preserved fruit.
</P>
<P>
   The cake traveled well, lasting weeks. Soldiers who didn't
consume it used it as impenetrable shields . . . hey, was that
another fruitcake joke? &QL;

JAKARTA AIDE, SEEING UNREST, ASKS SLOWING OF REFORMS 
</HEADLINE>
 - NYT  (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ A senior Indonesian Cabinet minister called
Wednesday for a slowdown of democratic reforms, warning of
widespread unrest unless the country's economic problems are solved
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've gone too far and too fast in this area of
openness,'' Culture and Education Minister Juwono Sudarsono said at
a meeting of the Indonesia-Australia Business Council. Management
of Indonesia's democratic reform process should be undertaken
peacefully and in stages because of the potential for unrest in an
``environment of economic deprivation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have been put into helter skelter now,'' he said. ``I
think there has to be a sense of proportion in the degree of change
we need to implement.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts said Sudarsono's remarks indicated a hardening of the
government's stance against student protesters pushing for a
speeding up of democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Within an hour of his remarks, in an incident not linked to his
speech, soldiers clashed with 400 student demonstrators outside the
Defense Ministry in downtown Jakarta. Witnesses said at least 20
students had been hurt and 40 arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Student leaders said they were protesting a plan by the armed
forces chief, Gen. Wiranto, to form a 40,000-member civilian
militia to help maintain law and order on the streets before
national elections next year. Along Jakarta's main street, students
strung banners calling for ``Human Rights Now.''
</P>
<P>
   Another larger demonstration Wednesday outside the attorney
general's office involved 1,500 students pressing their demands for
the arrest of former President Suharto on corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto's autocratic 32-year rule ended with his resignation in
May after riots in Jakarta and other cities that were set off by
unrest linked to the Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Protests by university students have become an almost daily
occurrence in Jakarta. The demonstrators' demands include the
arrest of Suharto, his family and close business associates on
corruption charges, the resignation of Wiranto and a speeding up of
democratic reforms. The government has begun an investigation into
Suharto's wealth, and he denies accusations that he illegally
amassed billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of a civilian militia has sparked heated debate.
Diplomats have expressed concern at the proposal, as have human
rights groups and opposition lawmakers alarmed that the force could
be used as vigilantes in support of the governing party.
</P>
<P>
   Sudarsono said he supported the militia force because election
violence was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in favor of building up the militia,'' he said. ``It's the
only way to decrease and limit the number of people who will be
killed in the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Indonesia's 200,000-member police force was not enough
to insure law and order during the election campaign. This month
the government announced that parliamentary elections would be held
on June 7 and that the top legislative body, the People's
Consultative Assembly, would convene on Aug. 29 to choose a new
president.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu all but
conceded Wednesday night that he expected his government to be
toppled on Monday, threatening to call for new elections so that he
could avoid the humiliation of being evicted from office against
his will.
</P>
<P>
   Standing strongly, even fiercely, by his side at a Likud Party
observance of Hanukkah Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon stated their
mutual opinion more forcefully and bluntly than the beleaguered
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided on our own initiative to push elections earlier,''
said Sharon, in his most thundering warrior voice. ``We have no
reason to be dragged into such a situation. Why should we be
dragged as a result of someone else's bill?''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day the cabinet said it would not hand over more
West Bank land to the Palestinians on Friday, defying the timetable
set by the American-brokered peace plan.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, indicating he would not move directly into an
election period, said he would first try to get a majority of the
parliament to stand behind his tough posture toward the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after President Clinton left the Middle East, the
Israelis pushed aside the issue of peace and pounced on the subject
that really preoccupied them: the fate of Netanyahu, whose struggle
to remain in office hung over and distorted the peacemaking mission
of the American president.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament, in a vote on Monday, is likely to declare no
confidence in Netanyahu, a result that would trigger elections
within 60 days. By beating parliament to the punch, the prime
minister seizes a tactical advantage that could improve his chances
with voters who might consider him tainted if he were forced to
abandon his post.
</P>
<P>
   A drumbeat for calling early elections started building almost
from the moment that Air Force One left Tel Aviv on Tuesday. By
this afternoon, Labor Party leader Ehud Barak had called on
Netanyahu to initiate them, pronouncing the right-wing coalition
government dead.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu made his announcement after lighting Hanukkah candles
at the top of the evening news Wednesday night, apparently in an
effort to preempt news of the expected defection of Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai, a political moderate and strong supporter of the
peace effort, sent out a portentous message Wednesday that he would
state ``his position regarding the political situation'' on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, Netanyahu laid out a series of conditions
that he would impose on the Palestinians before any further Israeli
troop withdrawal. He said that the Israelis would not just freeze
action called for in the peace agreement but stop complying with
the agreement if Israel's demands were not met.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was a demand that seems to go beyond the requirements
of the peace plan, that the Palestinians renounce their intention
to unilaterally declare a state. The Americans have said that this
asks too much of the Palestinians, who, they said, are entitled to
aspirations, and the demand is unlikely to be heeded.

 JERUSALEM: be heeded. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Netanyahu called the conditions ``the necessary principles for
the state of Israel to ensure its future.'' He said he would bring
them before his cabinet on Sunday. The principles are likely to be
approved by the cabinet but not in a subsequent vote e in
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the necessary majority is not found to support these
articles, we will initiate early elections to get from the people
the mandate necessary to secure real peace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With that, the Israeli campaign season opened, two years before
Netanyahu's term expires.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, the Labor Party leader, called for elections to be held
in the late spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt,'' he said, ``the government has reached the
end of its road.''
</P>
<P>
   While Netanyahu was speaking, Barak already was dining with his
campaign consultants: James Carville, a former strategist for
Clinton, and Stanley Greenberg and Robert Shrum. Carville, a
Louisiana native who spent his first few days ever in Israel this
week, was referring to Barak as ``the candidate'' hours before
Netanyahu's speech.
</P>
<P>
   Saying it was too early to describe strategy, Carville
nonetheless pounced on Netanyahu's ``lack of record'' and his
assessment that the Likud coalition ``is held hostage to small
extreme groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu has been represented by another American political
consultant, Arthur Finkelstein, who formerly worked for Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Tichon, the speaker of the parliament, said earlier
Wednesday that in the no-confidence decision, Netanyahu's fate was
likely to hinge on a single vote.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Sharon was witheringly critical of his Likud
audience for failing to stand behind the prime minister when it
became evident he could fall. He evinced obvious distaste for the
political jockeying for votes that has consumed him in the last
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to tell you the problem started from within,'' he said.
``Attacks from the outside we could have withstood if we stood
together. But we're crumbling from within.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found ourselves in a situation in which it is
impossible to continue,'' he added. ``We cannot conduct a constant
chase after this or that member of parliament or minister.''
</P>
<P>
   The discordant and unsupportive rumblings within the Cabinet
have most plagued Netanyahu. His government began disintegrating
after he signed the land-for-security peace plan in October,
alienating the right, which elected him largely because he opposed
territorial compromise. Many felt betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   But it was when he start losing his top ministers that the
discomfort set in.
</P>
<P>
   The first blow came Tuesday when Finance Minister Yaakov Neeman,
a professional appointee and once a personal friend of Netanyahu's,
said he would resign, partly in frustration with the prime
minister's political manipulation of the budget process. Then came
news of Mordechai's intentions, leaving the impression that
Netanyahu's ministers were jumping ship.
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai has been the staunchest supporter of the peace effort
within the cabinet, and he is reportedly alarmed that Netanyahu has
suspended carrying out the peace plan. During a cabinet meeting on
Wednesday, he warned that the Palestinian territories could erupt
in violent frustration.
</P>
<P>
   After the Cabinet confirmed there would be no troop pullback,
the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, termed the decision ``a
dangerous violation'' of the peace accord. One senior Palestinian
negotiator issued what sounded like a barely veiled threat that the
government could stand back and let the people take to the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Netanyahu's decision is a clear message that he wants to stop
the political process, and a public call to violence and a renewed
confrontation,'' Hassan Asfour said, referring obliquely to the
unrest in the West Bank that the Palestinian Authority had
suppressed during Clinton's visit.

CONGRESSIONAL AND U.N. RESOLUTIONS CITED AS JUSTIFICATION FOR
ATTACK
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The legal justification for Wednesday's bombing of
Iraq by U.S. forces is contained in congressional and U.N.
resolutions dating back to the 1991 Gulf War, government officials
and scholars of international law said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The most important element was the resolution adopted by the
United Nations to end the Gulf War in February 1991, which was
cited on Wednesday by James Rubin, the State Department spokesman.
That resolution provided for a cease-fire and established a system
under which Iraq would demolish any weapons of mass destruction and
allow unrestricted inspections by a U.N. commission of suspected
weapons sites.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the legal authority to launch a military strike,
Rubin told reporters: ``I think one need go no further than talk to
the subject of the cease-fire resolution, Resolution 687, which set
forth the conditions for a cease-fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Iraq has thwarted the weapons inspections required by
the cease-fire resolution, Rubin said, the United Nations may then
fall back on the earlier resolution that authorized military force
and began the Gulf War, the start of which President George Bush
announced to the nation on Jan. 16, 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Ruth Wedgewood of Yale Law School argued in the
current issue of the American Journal of International Law that the
cease-fire resolution was conditioned on Iraq's acceptance of
inspections of suspected weapons sites. By blocking the inspectors,
she said, the cease-fire resolution was automatically suspended.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, she also said that the United States was not
required to go back to the United Nations for additional
permission. She added that the bombing of Iraq in January 1993 by
forces from the United States, Britain and France reinforced the
notion that such nations may act by themselves to enforce U.N.
resolutions. That bombing occurred after Baghdad prevented weapons
inspectors from using the Habbaniyah airfield, effectively
preventing short-notice inspections.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Ratner, a lawyer with the Center for Constitutional
Rights in New York, said on Wednesday that he believed that the
United States had no legal right to conduct the military operation
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Ratner, who brought an unsuccessful lawsuit in 1990 trying to
block the Gulf War, said that after the cease-fire was in place,
all authorization to bomb Iraq ended.
</P>
<P>
   He said the United Nations would have to first formally declare
that there has been ``a material breach'' of the cease-fire before
it could fall back on the resolutions authorizing military force.
To do otherwise, he argued, would allow ``any nation in the world
to decide unilaterally that Iraq has breached its promise to abide
by the cease-fire resolution and bomb Baghdad.''
</P>
<P>
   A second legal issue is whether Clinton may authorize military
force on his own without congressional authorization. The
Constitution vests Congress with the sole power to declare war. Yet
according to various experts' tallies, presidents have dispatched
forces abroad between 130 and 200 times since the founding of the
Republic, even though Congress has explicitly declared war on only
five occasions: the War of 1812, the Mexican War, the
Spanish-American War and the two world wars. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have argued that a resolution passed by
Congress on the eve of the 1991 Persian Gulf War provides the
justification for the president to act unilaterally.

A FEARLESS CONFESSION HEARD ROUND THE WORLD  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 20)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By ANN DALY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Earlier this year, a conference of dance scholars retired from a
long day's meeting to an oyster house, where the oyster lovers set
out to seduce the skeptics into sampling the delicacy.
</P>
<P>
   A quotation from the modern dancer Isadora Duncan's
autobiography, ``My Life,'' persuaded the final holdout. ``You know
what Isadora wrote, don't you?'' said a clever historian. ``That
she began to dance in her mother's womb, in response to her
mother's diet of oysters and Champagne, the food of Aphrodite.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My Life'' turns 71 this month, a lifetime much longer than
that of its author. While 71 isn't a silver or gold anniversary,
the longevity of the book is testament to the importance of what
Duncan had to say. Sweeping episodically through her adventures and
misadventures up until 1921, when Duncan was invited to create a
dance school in the Soviet Union, the book is still quoted in
oyster houses and classrooms, still a rite of initiation for
aspiring dancers, and still a source of voyeuristic fascination.
</P>
<P>
   Since December 1927, when it began a run of seven printings in
six months, ``My Life'' has been reissued at least 13 times and
translated into as many languages. The Norton English-language
paperback sold 2,500 copies last year, and there is no indication
that its shelf life nears exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   The book was completed just months before her death, at age 50,
in a bizarre car accident in which she was strangled by her scarf
when it became snagged around a wheel as she was driving in Nice on
Sept. 14, 1927.
</P>
<P>
   Published posthumously, it turned out to be Duncan's final
performance. One of our century's most significant choreographers,
Duncan was never properly captured on film; instead, she was
recorded for posterity in the pages of ``My Life.'' The New York
Times dance critic John Martin remarked that the book had arrived
``like an epitaph of her own devising.''
</P>
<P>
   From the moment it was published, ``My Life'' was reduced in the
popular imagination to the torrid escapades of a female Casanova.
The story, after all, does start with oysters and Champagne and
proceeds through numerous love affairs and three pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   But a more subtle reading of ``My Life,'' afforded by the
explosion in the study of women's autobiography in the last decade,
reclassifies Duncan's story. Not just another romance, it is a
quest for a life lived without compromise, as both a woman and an
artist.
</P>
<P>
   Quests, however, have been the traditional domain of men, who
wrote them as authoritative accounts of heroic battles against
worldly and measurable obstacles. Duncan's quest, however, was
internal, and she could find no literary precedent for expressing
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``No woman has ever told the whole truth of her life,'' she she
wrote in her introduction, citing autobiographies that merely
reported the events of outward existence. Of their inner
experiences, Duncan insisted, women ``remain strangely silent.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan breached the silence with her book's first words: ``I
confess.'' This was a nod backward toward Rousseau's
``Confessions,'' which she admired, and forward, unknowingly,
toward the genre of women's confessional literature that would
flourish several generations later.
</P>
<P>
   Unafraid of the reality and richness of what others might
consider ``petty, human feeling,'' Duncan tackled just about every
taboo topic for a woman's public discussion _ desire, despair,
ambition and jealousy. She dealt with abortion, homosexuality and
suicide. She directly addressed the onset of middle age, extolling
rather than mourning what she saw as ``the magnificent and generous
gift of the Autumn of Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the book was dictated in a kind of free association that
can be felt in its fluid structure and conversational tone. Duncan
composed words the same way she did movement _ in grand swelling
rhythms. Stylistically, ``My Life'' duplicated the distinctive
tension in her personality, between the sensuousness of the artist
and the high-mindedness of the ``cerebrale,'' which Duncan longed
to be.
</P>
<P>
   She delivered the manuscript and was paid in monthly
installments, a contractual strategy devised by her American
publisher, Boni &AMP; Liveright, in order to insure the book's timely
completion. Although Duncan complained of feeling harried and
uncertain under such pressured circumstances, she was desperate for
the cash to pay her hotel bills.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The manuscript was published largely as she drafted it, but
before she could further edit it. In the end, the publisher excised
a number of passages in which she delved into her experiences (the
physical pain of losing her virginity, for example, and the bodily
flush of sexual excitement).
</P>
<P>
   The original dust jacket proffered ``My Life'' as ``probably the
most intimate book ever written by a woman.'' These memoirs are
indeed intimate, but not in the euphemistic sense that the word was
being used, to sell sex. It's not even intimate in the sense that
the author was whispering her innermost secrets to the reader.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan was not telling us her story; she was murmuring to
herself, and allowing us to eavesdrop. ``My Life'' recorded the
private, often painful process of re-collecting the fragments and
contradictions of her tumultuous past.
</P>
<P>
   Here, then, is a portrait of the female artist at middle age.
Artistically eclipsed by modernism and denied citizenship by her
country, Duncan wrote with a sobering backward glance. It was as if
she were sifting through the rubble, reconstructing the ruins of
her dreams, much as she was then literally trying to reclaim her
once-magnificent but long-abandoned home in Neuilly, France.
</P>
<P>
   What strikes me now, rereading ``My Life,'' is not the frankness
with which she described her love affairs but the frankness with
which she observed her failures and follies.
</P>
<P>
   She was alert to her ``deluded'' schemes, kind toward her
strident defiance, appreciative of her irrepressible emotions and
patient with her extravagances. She knew full well that she was
``impractical and untimely and impulsive.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan succeeded in living an extraordinary life only because
she was willing to risk excess and self-absorption. But she was a
woman, and, as such, her ambition was judged as hubris. The threat
posed to the world by her driving desire for autonomy, the
persistent theme of her life, was effectively neutralized by
discounting it as mere sexual precociousness.
</P>
<P>
   Always an astute _ and outspoken _ cultural critic, Duncan
reproached the public that, once having glorified her as a goddess,
now dismissed her as a matron. Duncan had always battled the
institution of marriage. Now, she also attacked the standard of
youthful female beauty that disapproved of her thickened figure and
proscribed her still-active libido. By writing a woman's life as
sensual as it was idealistic, Duncan rejected the script that she
was handed at mid-life.
</P>
<P>
   She wrestled with this impossible task, the fixing of her life
in black and white. If only it were easier, she lamented, to dive
down within herself ``and bring up thought as the diver brings up
pearls _ precious pearls from the closed oysters of silence in the
depths of our subconsciousness!''
</P>
<P>
   She did not consider herself a skilled enough writer to avoid
cliches, and feared that the work would turn out an awful mess.
Better to capture the truth of her life through fiction (``twenty
novels or so''), she argued, than through fact.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan understood that an autobiography is just a story, and
that an identity is at best a moving target. She embraced her many
metamorphoses _ ``the Chaste Madonna, or the Messalina, or the
Magdalen, or the Blue Stocking'' _ but resisted the
autobiographical imperative to choose one.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we write the truth about ourselves?'' she agonized in
her introduction. ``Do we even know it?''

CLINTON ORDERS ATTACK ON IRAQ; HOUSE DELAYS IMPEACHMENT VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Updates with Clinton address; House delays on vote.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton ordered sweeping air attacks on
Iraq Wednesday, prompting House Republican leaders to delay the
start of impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The president told a nationally televised audience that he
launched ``Operation Desert Fox'' on the eve of a scheduled House
impeachment vote to preserve the element of surprise and to avoid
initiating the campaign during the month-long Muslim holiday of
Ramadan that begins Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans leaders, anxious to avoid any political
fallout over voting on impeachment against the commander-in-chief
while U.S. military forces were in action, later postponed the
impeachment debate that had been scheduled to start Thursday. They
said the debate would be delayed for several days, possibly until
the beginning of next week.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision on Iraqi military action came amid a growing
wave of House members declared their intention to vote for his
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., questioned the
timing of Clinton's military action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both the timing and the policy are subject to question,'' Lott
said, adding that he had ``been assured by administration officials
that there is no connection with the impeachment process in the
House.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., complained: ``Is there anybody
who doesn't question whether the president has political motives?
It's time for this president to step down.''
</P>
<P>
   In his televised remarks, Clinton defended the timing of his
decision and said it was in response to a report from chief U.N.
weapons inspector Richard Butler that Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein had resumed cat-and-mouse efforts to hide components of
chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them
against U.S. allies such as Israel and oil-rich Arab nations in the
Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   The president said his national security team, including Defense
Secretary William Cohen, a former Republican senator from Maine,
unanimously endorsed the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had delayed for even a matter of days ... we would have
given Saddam more time to disperse his forces and protect his
weapons,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president referred only briefly to the impeachment struggle
that imperils his presidency, saying Hussein ``may have thought
that the serious debate currently before the House of
Representatives would distract Americans or weaken our resolve to
face him down.'' Not so, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   House Rules Committee Chairman Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., accused
Clinton of ordering the attack to delay or even thwart impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``For him to do this at this time is just outrageous,'' Solomon
said. ``He should have delayed this. It would not have been
political the way it is today.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tillie Fowler, R-Fla., said she too feared that Clinton
might be ordering military action to stall impeachment. As Fowler
put it: ``I think this president is shameless in what he would do
to stay in office. He will use our military and he will use our
foreign policy to remain president.''
</P>
<P>
   National Security Adviser Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger said the
impeachment struggle did not play any part in Clinton's decision to
order the attacks that had been suspended at the last minute in the
most recent showdown with Baghdad in mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   The Joint Chiefs of Staff, concerned that Saddam would disperse
his forces, advised the president that ``tactical surprise was
extremely important,'' requiring the United States to ``act as
swiftly as was militarily possible,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart rejected suggestions
that Clinton was using military action to distract attention from
the impeachment fight. ``The president of the United States makes
national security decisions based on the best interests of the
United States of America,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee and a former Navy combat pilot during the Vietnam War,
said decisive action by Clinton would rally public support, adding:
``Obviously, there will be those who will question his motives and
timing.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clinton continued efforts to urge Republican
moderates in the House to censure him rather than vote impeachment
for his cover-up of a sexual dalliance with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   He met privately at the White House with Rep. Amo Houghton,
R-N.Y., author of a White House-backed resolution of censure that
included a $500,000 fine. Clinton postponed a planned private
meeting with Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., another moderate
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said the president remained ``committed to finding some
bipartisan compromise that allows us to put this issue behind us
short of impeachment,'' adding: ``We continue to try to reach out
across party lines to find a bipartisan solution or compromise to
put this behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore told a group of business leaders at the
White House that there was ``still time for Democrats and
Republicans to come together and embrace a bipartisan compromise to
seek a resolution that is both quick and fair.'' Gore still enjoys
strong ties with lawmakers on Capitol Hill after representing
Tennessee in the House and Senate for 16 years before joining
Clinton on the Democratic ticket in 1992.

   The U.S. offensive was the third attack on Iraq during the
Clinton presidency. A total of 24,100 U.S. military personnel were
in the region as well as the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise and 22
other U.S. warships. Eight of the vessels are armed with 300
Tomahawk cruise missiles capable of delivering 1,000-pound warheads
against targets with pinpoint accuracy. A second aircraft carrier,
the USS Carl Vinson, is due to arrive Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said more than 200 combat aircraft also were
available, including 15 Cold War-era B-52 bombers capable of firing
air-launched cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has ordered U.S. military attacks on Iraq twice before.
</P>
<P>
   During his re-election drive in 1996, Clinton ordered a
44-cruise missile strike against Iraqi military and command posts
in southern Iraq to retaliate against Iraqi troop movements against
Kurds in northern Iraq in September 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In June, 1993, Clinton ordered a 23-cruise missile attack
against Iraq's intelligence headquarters in Baghdad in retaliation
for an Iraqi plot to assassinate former President George Bush
during the ex-president's visit to Kuwait in April 1993.

BESET BY IMPEACHMENT, BUT TOTALLY IN CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The American attack on Iraq, the growing
congressional support for impeachment, and the postponement of the
House vote on President Clinton's fate provide a window into what
power the president retains, what he has lost and how the country
has been altered in the last tumultuous week.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary set of events has shattered a decades-old
tradition that, until Wednesday, restrained opposition leaders from
questioning the political motives behind a president's national
security decisions, even as it fractured a century-old assumption
about how drastically an impeachment threat would weaken an
American president.
</P>
<P>
   By ordering a military strike at the time of his gravest
political peril, the president simultaneously signaled his hold on
power and underlined the brittleness of his position.
</P>
<P>
   And by questioning ``both the timing and the policy,'' as Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott did moments before Operation Desert Fox
began Wednesday night, the president's opponents shook the
bipartisan consensus that has traditionally accompanied the
beginning of American military involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with every precedent broken and every assumption shattered,
Clinton might be edging closer to destroying the ultimate political
assumption: That impeachment would shatter his effectiveness as a
leader.
</P>
<P>
   The military strikes were a joint undertaking of American and
British forces, and Prime Minister Tony Blair pointedly made a
televised statement first, almost certainly an effort to remove
political considerations from public perceptions. But even before
the explosions were visible above the Baghdad skyline, the
bipartisan consensus was endangered in Washington by a series of
remarks suggesting the president had ordered the air assault to
forestall impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never underestimate a desperate president,'' said
Representative Gerald B.H. Solomon, the New York Republican who
heads the House Rules Committee. GOP Representative Robert Barr of
Georgia added: ``For this sort of thing to seem to come to a head
on the eve of an impeachment vote is highly suspicious.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the president's actions demonstrated the remarkable
ability to carry on by a man who delivered the State of the Union
Message amid the wildfire of the Monica S. Lewinsky affair, ordered
air strikes against Sudan and Afghanistan amid the furor over his
grand-jury testimony, and pressed the Israelis and Palestinians to
embrace peace as the impeachment storm gathered.
</P>
<P>
   ``In areas where he has the ability to act unilaterally, like
bombing Iraq, he can still act,'' said Joseph Cooper, a political
scientist at Johns Hopkins University. ``But where he needs to make
compromises and elicit cooperation, it might not be so clear.''
</P>
<P>
   A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll taken after the House
Judiciary Committee reported out its impeachment resolutions but
before the military action began in Iraq found that seven out of 10
Americans believe Clinton can still be an effective president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's remarkable he can carry on in the face of what is
colliding or collapsing around him,'' said Senator Jeff Bingaman, a
New Mexico Democrat who is a member of the Armed Services
Committee. ``He'll probably be able to do that if he's impeached.
He can continue doing what he's doing _ and keep on keeping on.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than a century, the common American premise was that
impeachment was the surpassing stigma of American politics, an act
of discipline and disgrace that marked a president for historical
shame and exposed him to expulsion in a Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton, who in the past six years has upended so many of
the governing assumptions of politics, could be on the verge of
toppling traditional views of impeachment as well.
</P>
<P>
   Though the House Judiciary Committee has approved four
impeachment articles and the White House has failed to rally the
moderate Republicans who hold the balance of power in the
impeachment struggle, the House itself has not yet voted. Indeed,
it is possible that a major military action against Iraq could
change the political landscape in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But the widespread assumption, in the White House and on Capitol
Hill, that Clinton's critics have sufficient votes to impeach the
president is being accompanied by the growing notion that the
president's policies and strategies might not be altered by
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been business as usual all year,'' said Senator Edward M.
Kennedy. ``Impeachment may not have any influence whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the clearest sign of the potential irrelevance of
impeachment came from a leading Republican, Representative E. Clay
Shaw Jr., who has worked with Clinton on welfare overhaul and who
is preparing to negotiate with the president on ways to shore up
the Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   In a three-paragraph statement Shaw issued from his Fort
Lauderdale office before leaving for Washington for the expected
House vote, the Florida lawmaker, declared that he would vote to
impeach the president. His statement devoted two paragraphs to the
president's conduct, declaring there is a ``strong case against the
president on several of the impeachment resolutions'' and then
added:
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to be working closely with the president in my role as
chairman of the Social Security subcommittee of the Committee on
Ways and Means. It is my hope to reform Social Security with the
help and cooperation of Clinton as we did in welfare reform.''

BOEHLERT SAYS HE WILL VOTE TO IMPEACH CLINTON FOR PERJURY 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: INSERTS missing word in lead)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Sherwood Boehlert announced Wednesday that he
will vote to impeach President Clinton on at least one charge _
perjury before a federal grand jury _ but will wait until hearing
the House debate before making up his mind on three other
accusations against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Boehlert, a moderate New York Republican, said he believes
Clinton gave perjured testimony before the federal grand jury on
Aug. 17 about his sexual relationship with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he did not tell the truth and this is about truth and
law,'' Boehlert told a news conference, adding: ``It's something I
have arrived at after thoughtful deliberation.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the charge of perjury before a federal grand
jury, the president also is accused of perjury in the Paula Jones
civil lawsuit, obstruction of justice and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   Boehlert said Clinton has tried ``repeatedly to game the
judicial system.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the origins of this case, whatever the motives of his
questioners, the president had an obligation _ a legal and
constitutional obligation _ to tell the truth under oath,''
Boehlert said.
</P>
<P>
   Boehlert said deciding whether to vote for impeachment is the
most difficult decision he has made in his 16 years in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the past 10 days I have had sleepless nights,'' he said in
an interview. ``My wife reports that my sense of humor is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Boehlert compared Clinton to former President Richard Nixon who
resigned in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal as the House was
about to impeach him in August 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a rare moment of personal insight, Richard Nixon concluded
that he had destroyed himself by hating his enemies back,'' he
said. ``I am afraid that President Clinton fell into the same, all
too human, trap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blinded by his contempt for people who he thought were out to
get him, the president forgot his larger obligations to his office,
the Constitution and to the American people. He let his personal
feelings interfere with fulfilling his Constitutional
obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   Boehlert said none of the members of the Republican
congressional leadership have tried to sway his decision, which he
made after consulting judges and academics.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, he was elected to a ninth term in his upstate New
York district by winning 80 percent of the vote. Two years earlier,
Clinton won only 46 percent of the vote in the district.
</P>
<P>
   Boehlert said he has received over 2,500 calls since Friday,
with the callers evenly split on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Boehlert insisted impeachment ``is not a partisan issue. It is a
serious, sober, heart-rending debate on the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a vote of conscience _ my conscience is
nonnegotiable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Boehlert said the House had very few options _ to vote yes or no
on impeachment, but the Senate has ``different options and a broad
array of possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I am doing is sending this matter to the Senate, which
has a lot more flexibility than we do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Boehlert said he ``was enamored of'' a proposal by former
Massachusetts Gov. William F. Weld, a Republican support of the
president. Weld has proposed that Clinton be reprimanded and pay a
fine.
</P>
<P>
   Weld's proposal ``deserves the most careful consideration''
Boehlert said.

PARTY GOES ON IN BRITAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ As the United States bombed Iraq Wednesday night, the
nerve center of its closest ally partied.
</P>
<P>
   As bombs rained down on Baghdad, the annual British Foreign
Office Christmas party was in full swing. Revelers sipped white
wine from France, red wine from South Africa and Foster's lager
from Australia. The diplomats and analysts who had to return to
their computer terminals for an all-nighter settled for orange
juice.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred journalists and diplomats mingled as the bombs
dropped, remarking on the incandescent beauty of the Locarno Room
off King Charles Street where the event was held.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was where the empire held court, when we ruled India,''
said George Jones, political editor of The Daily Telegraph, staring
up at the magnificent, pastel cathedral ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   While the right-wing press, including the Telegraph, has
disparaged the relationship between British Prime Minister Tony
Blair and President Clinton, portraying London as a Washington
lapdog, Jones does not dismiss it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's serious, as I think the relationship between (British
Foreign Secretary) Robin Cook and (US Secretary of State) Madeleine
Albright is very close and very good,'' said Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The opulence of the Locarno Room, however, seemed to unnerve
more than one celebrant. Many of the people who attended the party
commented on the irony of what they described as London fiddling
while Baghdad burned.
</P>
<P>
   As he entered the room, Cook seemed a bit disarmed. In a brief
interview less than two hours before the attack, Cook seemed as
much at ease as he was nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the bombing would take place, Cook raised his
omni-arched eyebrows and said, ``I can't say.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Cook was more interested in the fate of President
Clinton, asking an American newspaper reporter to explain the
timetable of the impeachment hearings should the bombing go ahead.
Advised that those hearings would likely be put off a week, Cook
asked, ``Really?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had ever seen or heard of ``Wag the Dog,'' the movie
that uses as its premise a president bombing a defenseless country
to divert attention from his indiscretion with a woman not his
wife, Cook shook his head and said, ``No. I've never seen it.''
</P>
<P>
   The critics of the Blair administration say that Cook's
responses illustrate exactly what is wrong with the government,
that it is clueless to the realities of the Beltway, and that it
takes direction from Washington without question.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Office officials, however, are quick to rebut those
allegations, even if they are not as quick to supply their names.
</P>
<P>
   ``This stuff that we're in the pocket of Washington is so much
tripe,'' says a British official, barely hiding his contempt for
the allegation.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, when the White House lined up its bombers, the only
indisputable ally was Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from a microphone to the 200 to 300 journalists and
diplomats who had crowded into the Locarno Room for free booze,
food and advice, Cook said he had spent the last year accruing 177
hours in airplanes, visiting 29 countries, circumventing the globe
2 1/2 times, unable to claim frequent-flyer miles because they were
deemed unethical by some faceless bureaucrat.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Cook rolled his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to take New Year's off,'' the foreign minister
informed those who dog him, ``and I will drink a toast to you _ one
by one.''

CLINTON ORDERS ATTACK ON IRAQ; HOUSE DELAYS IMPEACHMENT VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Updates with Clinton address; House delays on vote.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton ordered sweeping air attacks on
Iraq Wednesday, prompting House Republican leaders to delay the
start of impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The president told a nationally televised audience that he
launched ``Operation Desert Fox'' on the eve of a scheduled House
impeachment vote to preserve the element of surprise and to avoid
initiating the campaign during the month-long Muslim holiday of
Ramadan that begins Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans leaders, anxious to avoid any political
fallout over voting on impeachment against the commander-in-chief
while U.S. military forces were in action, later postponed the
impeachment debate that had been scheduled to start Thursday. They
said the debate would be delayed for several days, possibly until
the beginning of next week.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision on Iraqi military action came amid a growing
wave of House members declared their intention to vote for his
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., questioned the
timing of Clinton's military action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both the timing and the policy are subject to question,'' Lott
said, adding that he had ``been assured by administration officials
that there is no connection with the impeachment process in the
House.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., complained: ``Is there anybody
who doesn't question whether the president has political motives?
It's time for this president to step down.''
</P>
<P>
   In his televised remarks, Clinton defended the timing of his
decision and said it was in response to a report from chief U.N.
weapons inspector Richard Butler that Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein had resumed cat-and-mouse efforts to hide components of
chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them
against U.S. allies such as Israel and oil-rich Arab nations in the
Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   The president said his national security team, including Defense
Secretary William Cohen, a former Republican senator from Maine,
unanimously endorsed the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had delayed for even a matter of days ... we would have
given Saddam more time to disperse his forces and protect his
weapons,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president referred only briefly to the impeachment struggle
that imperils his presidency, saying Hussein ``may have thought
that the serious debate currently before the House of
Representatives would distract Americans or weaken our resolve to
face him down.'' Not so, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   House Rules Committee Chairman Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., accused
Clinton of ordering the attack to delay or even thwart impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``For him to do this at this time is just outrageous,'' Solomon
said. ``He should have delayed this. It would not have been
political the way it is today.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tillie Fowler, R-Fla., said she too feared that Clinton
might be ordering military action to stall impeachment. As Fowler
put it: ``I think this president is shameless in what he would do
to stay in office. He will use our military and he will use our
foreign policy to remain president.''
</P>
<P>
   National Security Adviser Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger said the
impeachment struggle did not play any part in Clinton's decision to
order the attacks that had been suspended at the last minute in the
most recent showdown with Baghdad in mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   The Joint Chiefs of Staff, concerned that Saddam would disperse
his forces, advised the president that ``tactical surprise was
extremely important,'' requiring the United States to ``act as
swiftly as was militarily possible,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart rejected suggestions
that Clinton was using military action to distract attention from
the impeachment fight. ``The president of the United States makes
national security decisions based on the best interests of the
United States of America,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee and a former Navy combat pilot during the Vietnam War,
said decisive action by Clinton would rally public support, adding:
``Obviously, there will be those who will question his motives and
timing.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clinton continued efforts to urge Republican
moderates in the House to censure him rather than vote impeachment
for his cover-up of a sexual dalliance with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   He met privately at the White House with Rep. Amo Houghton,
R-N.Y., author of a White House-backed resolution of censure that
included a $500,000 fine. Clinton postponed a planned private
meeting with Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., another moderate
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said the president remained ``committed to finding some
bipartisan compromise that allows us to put this issue behind us
short of impeachment,'' adding: ``We continue to try to reach out
across party lines to find a bipartisan solution or compromise to
put this behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore told a group of business leaders at the
White House that there was ``still time for Democrats and
Republicans to come together and embrace a bipartisan compromise to
seek a resolution that is both quick and fair.'' Gore still enjoys
strong ties with lawmakers on Capitol Hill after representing
Tennessee in the House and Senate for 16 years before joining
Clinton on the Democratic ticket in 1992.

DRASTIC MEASURES TO KEEP LID ON SLAYINGS IN BALTIMORE 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Like 50 to 100 other normally desk-bound day-shift
police officers, Michael Hilliard showed up for the 5:39 roll call
Tuesday afternoon and was soon dispatched to the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've shut down the administrative offices for 30 days,'' said
Hilliard, an administrative officer. ``We have 296 homicides, and
the goal is to complete the year with no more.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing before the men and women, Lt. Donald Healy urged them
to go after the drug dealers, who are responsible for
three-quarters of those homicides. ``Shut them down and bring them
in.''
</P>
<P>
   With officer clerks and computer operators assisting regular
officers assigned to high crime areas, this department is hitting
the streets, following the threads that lead from street-corner
questionings to arrests for sales of $10 rocks of crack cocaine to
whatever it is that makes this city one of the nation's most
murderous.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore, like other cities throughout the nation, has
experienced a decline in crime. But throughout the 1990s, this city
has defied the trend in one category of violent crime _ homicide.
Throughout the 1990s, it has recorded 304 to 353 homicides a year,
three-quarters of them drug-related.
</P>
<P>
   Federal crime statistics show the Baltimore area, with 2.5
million residents, with a rate of 14.2 murders last year for every
100,000 residents. The rate is far above those of most other big
cities, including New York and its suburbs, where the rate last
year was 9.3.
</P>
<P>
   So early last week, Police Commissioner Thomas Frazier, who
previously assigned his troops more overtime during the Christmas
shopping season, started what he called an ``enhanced holiday
deployment.'' He has shut down most administrative work for a month
and assigned desk-bound officers to the streets and directed the
regulars to concentrate on the high-crime areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to make every effort we can to bring in the crime
rate as low as we can,'' Frazier said. ``We're bringing in everyone
who we can wring out of a non-enforcement assignment. I did 15
hours yesterday, and I will be on the street tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   But even with the special deployment, the prospects of keeping
the number of homicides under 300, the department's goal, are grim.
Through October, it recorded 259 homicides, five more than by the
same time last year, when 310 were recorded for the full year.
Lately, the pace has continued, with a homicide a day.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the department reported No. 295. A male with multiple
stab wounds was found partially covered with leaves in the back of
a row house. On Tuesday, a woman in the trunk of a car that had
been intentionally set on fire became No. 296. Thirty minutes after
midnight Tuesday, No. 297, a man in his late 20s, was found shot in
the back and sprawled on a sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   After roll call, Officers Warren Smith and Tim Palmer, each
married, each father of one child, both sinewy, proud members of
Baltimore's SWAT team, hurried off in their new unmarked cruiser.
They were given a single assignment, to seek out the furtive
gestures and quick transactions of drug dealing.
</P>
<P>
   Twice on Tuesday night, with Smith at the wheel, they turned
their vehicle into a rocket of siren and light. But mostly they
wove their way through the desolate streets of largely boarded-up
row houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time out!'' they heard someone shout from a cluster of six
people gathered at a corner as the well-recognized white Ford Crown
Victoria approached. The six, indistinguishable by sex or age in
their loose-fitting, hooded parkas, ambled off, hands in pockets.
The officers left them alone.
</P>
<P>
   The officers headed across North Avenue and into the dark side
streets. A woman about 50 crossed in front of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you got in your pocket?'' Smith asked, getting out of the
car with Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing,'' she told them. Nonchalantly, she said she was on
her way to buy something.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are you dealing with?'' Smith asked
</P>
<P>
   ``Heavy,'' she replied, a man named Heavy. Heavy is nowhere
around. The officers made note of his name and moved on.
</P>
<P>
   They spotted a group outside a corner store. Corner stores _
delis, take-out food stores, convenience stores _ are the only
commercial establishments along the streets off the thoroughfares,
like North and Pennsylvania Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``My pet peeve is the corner store,'' Smith said. ``The stores
give them an excuse to be on the corner. If you see people in the
store, they're not buying anything.''
</P>
<P>
   They told one cluster of young men to pull up their shirts, a
way to find if they were carrying guns. Or they called, ``Show me
your hands,'' a way of finding drugs. ``You look for somebody
making a quick movement,'' Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   The law requires the police to ask before frisking anyone, but
usually permission is granted.
</P>
<P>
   In front of a store on a corner on Edmonson Avenue, they spotted
a transaction. Slowly, Smith followed one of the people onto a side
street. He turned on his search light and pulled up to a young
woman in gray sweat pants, a blue parka and a gray knit hat.
</P>
<P>
   Frightened, just 17, she held a marijuana cigar, evidently not
having learned to surreptitiously let it drop. They stood near a
gray brick wall with ``R.I.P'' scrawled on it and the names Jeneen,
Fade, Mark, Sean, Tish, Lance, Oscar and Reggie _ all slain.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer asked what she was handing the man at the corner. ``I
didn't give him nothing,'' she said, still holding the cigar.
``Fifty cents. I swear I gave him 50 cents.''
</P>
<P>
   They took the cigar and asked to go through her pockets. They
found two tiny bags of marijuana, called a patrol wagon to bring
her in.
</P>
<P>
   After she was booked and briefed, she smiled easily and
innocently, saying she is in the 10th grade, wants to be a lawyer
or a basketball player and works in a Burger King part time. She
will be held in a cell block for juveniles until her mother comes
to get her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's still reachable,'' Palmer said. ``I'd rather lock up the
adult who sold it to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she could be a link in the chain that leads to
Baltimore's many homicides. As part of her debriefing, and those of
the 10 other people arrested in the night, Detective Irvin Bradley
of the homicide squad, suggested, without promising, that in return
for leniency in court, they steer him to the guns and the dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is particularly interested in leads to ``stick-up
boys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They rob the drug dealers,'' he said. ``These drug dealers are
not going to call the police and say, `He stuck me up.' They handle
it themselves, and the way they handle it is to kill them.''
</P>
<P>
   He also wants locations of ``stash houses,'' places near the
sites of their sales where dealers hide guns so they won't be
caught with them and can still get to them. By late Tuesday night,
he said he had collected the addresses of four.

FLY-TIER BUCKS TRADITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Oh to be a fly on the wall of Steven Fernandez's
Venice home. A fishing fly, that is.
</P>
<P>
   For it is in a picture frame you'll remain, far from line's end
in the waters of a Sierra trout stream.
</P>
<P>
   You see, the San Fernando Valley native and renowned fly-tier is
an artist. And while his background is anchored in commercial
enterprise, having crafted hundreds of thousands of flies that were
gobbled up by anglers and fish alike, many of his creations of fur
and feather are fit for a gallery, transcending mere tackle and
practicality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no longer a fishing hook when you put 20 hours into a
fly,'' said Fernandez, 38, who makes his living as an architect and
is invited to places like Norway, England, Scotland to demonstrate
his fly-tying skills. ``Enough people are tying flies to look like
bugs. Why not do something different?''
</P>
<P>
   As he constantly rediscovers his tying method, the dividing line
between art and craft begins to blur. When a fly hits the water is
it no longer art?
</P>
<P>
   ``That is something I haven't tackled yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are few clear-cut answers for Fernandez, a walking
contradiction who is shy but passionate, who seems to want to be
more eccentric than he is, who appears more complicated than he
wants to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can talk about the use value of art,'' he said. ``Does art
have to stay in a museum? Does it have to stay in concept? Where
does it cross the line?''
</P>
<P>
   The struggle is one of many that makes Fernandez a fascinating
character in a field of fly-tiers that is stretching the bounds of
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Engage him in discussion and Fernandez inevitably turns to art
and personal politics. He looks like Tim Roth and talks like James
Woods and seems perfectly suited for Venice, that hodgepodge of
millionaires and homeless where the walls of his house are painted
in, well, let's call it a funky gold patina.
</P>
<P>
   He dismisses notions that fish aren't hurt by hook points and
questions whether catch and release is a worthy endeavor when the
act of fighting a trout is a form of torture for the quarry. He may
wind up quitting the sport for fear of being a hypocrite.
</P>
<P>
   He adores the materials used to dress today's most bejeweled
flies, but promotes moving away from the ``requirement'' they
include feathers of exotic and often endangered birds.
</P>
<P>
   He has no problem with foreign labor cranking out inexpensive
flies for American companies but abhors the possibility it could
outcompete and ultimately shun the craft of the Montana tier who
``requires a higher wage to live here and whose life and livelihood
is intrinsically and inextricably connected to this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very sensitive,'' said Art Delano of Woodland Hills, who
has been tying conventional flies for two decades and is joined by
Fernandez as a member of the Valley-based Sierra Pacific
Flyfishers. ``He gives pause for thought; he is much more than a
fly-tier.''
</P>
<P>
   And Fernandez is far from alone grappling over art vs. craft.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the tier who's tying for fishing, as long as the fly is
halfway decent and it's on hook, it doesn't matter,'' Delano said.
``Luckily the fish are dumb enough to hit the fly or none of us
would be in business.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I would be reluctant to use even Steve's `craft' fishing
flies. They are just too pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In Steve's case,'' Delano said, ``the design is everything
because he is one of the most creative fly-tiers. He develops new
methods to apply products to a hook to fascinate the viewer and
overwhelm the knowledgeable fly-tier.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, Fernandez challenged his fly-dressing brethren
by crudely straightening hooks so they were no longer fishing
instruments and placed feathers and droplets of glue at spots where
they are never adhered. It was as if he was calling out, ``OK,
let's make art,'' to other fly-tiers who were not satisfied with
age-old practices.
</P>
<P>
   The bold ``deconstruction'' move largely backfired. ``A few
people liked them but most people hated them and thought I had
flipped my lid,'' Fernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   He persevered, however, and eventually reinvented the Atlantic
salmon fly, the crown jewel of fishing flies, ``the ultimate
flights of fancy.'' The gaudy design stems from the Victorian era,
when explorers brought back to England the feathers of wild things
like the bird of paradise and cock of the rock to adorn the hooks
of dukes, earls and other nobles who targeted salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the salmon fly that tradition dictates must be tied
above the body of the hook were attached to the underside. Feathers
were swept forward instead of back, hence the Pompadour fly was
born. The hook's solid black was replaced with splatter paint or
white. Its eye was removed, ``because it's not for fishing
anymore.'' Then the hooks disappeared altogether. Feathers were
dressed on piano wire; the crests of golden pheasant were fashioned
to resemble hooks.
</P>
<P>
   His work attracted the eye of art critic, author and editor
Judith Dunham of Berkeley, who featured Fernandez's Pompadour and
Easy Off designs in her 1991 coffee-table book ``The Atlantic
Salmon Fly: The Tyers and Their Art.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the way that Steve both honored tradition and
questioned it,'' Dunham said this week. ``He wasn't afraid to take
the classic form of the fly and then do something entirely
innovative with it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always as a form of personal inquiry,'' she said. ``He
was never saying, `Everyone should tie like this.' He was saying,
`These are some things I wasn't thinking about and would like to
share.'''
</P>
<P>
   He has come a long way from his Reseda teen-age days of tying at
55 cents a fly for Fishermen's Spot in Van Nuys and Ned Grey's
Sierra Tackle in Montrose, when his skills were first well
publicized in a 1977 Field and Stream feature.
</P>
<P>
   But in Fernandez's topsy-turvy world where everything new is old
again, he may be closer to taking those flies out of their frames
and casting them to trout than observers might think.

DEMOCRATS EXPECTED TO RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT TRIPP'S ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By JILL ABRAMSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee
originally had hoped to use impeachment hearings to show that
President Clinton was set up by political enemies who colluded with
lawyers for Paula Jones and with lawyers from the office of Kenneth
Starr, the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Although the evidence is at best ambiguous, President Clinton's
lawyers and defenders contend that his pursuers set a perjury trap
that ensnared him in the scandal that threatens his presidency, and
the Democrats wanted the motives of his pursuers to be weighed in
judging the fairness of the case against him.
</P>
<P>
   But they were largely unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, chairman of the judiciary committee, decided
against calling witnesses who played an early and pivotal role in
exposing the President's affair with Monica Lewinsky, the former
White House intern. Several Democrats on the judiciary committee
said they had wanted to call as witnesses Linda Tripp, Ms.
Lewinsky's former confidante; Lucianne Goldberg, a New York
literary agent, and a group of conservative lawyers with ties to
the Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   If the Senate conducts an impeachment trial, it is almost
certain that Democrats will again try to raise questions about the
chain of events in late 1997 and early 1998 that led Mrs. Tripp,
who taped her conversations with Ms. Lewinsky, to the Jones lawyers
and then to Starr's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of a pattern to put attention on the prosecutors and
deflect attention away from the facts,'' said Charles Bakaly, a
spokesman for Starr's office. ``We have flatly said there was no
conspiracy or coordination between us and the Jones lawyers. It
just didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Some new evidence about this early period emerged from the
hearings, although there are still many more questions than
answers. Late last week, the Judiciary Committee released a new
batch of documents, including a 29-page letter from Starr and
transcripts of taped conversations between Mrs. Tripp and Ms.
Goldberg. These documents shed more light on Mrs. Tripp's early
dealings with the Jones lawyers and with Starr's office.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's letter, sent to Hyde and Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., on
Dec. 11, confirms that Mrs. Tripp's lawyer, James Moody, supplied
an early and crucial piece of evidence to Starr _ Ms. Lewinsky's
affidavit in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   In the affidavit, which Starr said his office received
anonymously by fax on Jan. 15, Ms. Lewinsky denied having a sexual
relationship with the president. The affidavit, which Ms. Lewinsky
later admitted was false, was a catalyst for Starr to seek
permission from the Justice Department to expand his Whitewater
investigation into the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   The president's defenders had earlier contended that Starr got
the affidavit, which Ms. Lewinsky's lawyer had not yet filed in
court, from the Jones camp. Moody, who was acquainted with lawyers
who had written briefs for Mrs. Jones, said in an interview this
week that he is ``99 percent sure'' that he obtained the affidavit
from the Jones lawyers. He said it was his idea to give the
affidavit to Starr.
</P>
<P>
   How and when Mrs. Tripp first contacted Starr's office has also
been much debated. In his letter to the judiciary committee, Starr
said he had not discussed the Jones sexual misconduct case against
President Clinton with Richard Porter, who was once Starr's law
partner at Kirkland &AMP; Ellis. Porter is friendly with several
lawyers who worked on the Jones case. Porter also had discussions
with Ms. Goldberg about how Mrs. Tripp might contact Starr's
office. On Jan. 8, one of Starr's prosecutors learned of Mrs. Tripp
from Jerome Marcus, another conservative lawyer with whom Ms.
Goldberg had talked.
</P>
<P>
   Months earlier, Mrs. Tripp and Ms. Goldberg first discussed the
possibility of tipping off the Jones team about the president's
affair with Ms. Lewinsky, according to a transcript of a
conversation the two women had in September 1997.

 WASHINGTON: September 1997. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Is there any way,'' Ms. Goldberg asks, ``to have her be, uh,
shall we say, reached by the Paula Jones people?''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp responds that Ms. Lewinsky, whose name she had not
yet disclosed to Ms. Goldberg, has no desire to go public or hurt
the president.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp testified before the grand jury that fear compelled
her to tape her conversations with Ms. Lewinsky. She told the grand
jury that she was worried that the president's allies might try to
destroy her and that Ms. Lewinsky was pushing her to lie in the
Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   But the Tripp-Goldberg transcripts released by the judiciary
committee reveal another motive. Mrs. Tripp talked with her friend
about using her knowledge of the president's affair to help get a
book deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The climate is extremely good for this kind of information,``
Ms. Goldberg tells Mrs. Tripp. Mrs. Tripp responds that she would
have have ``no quarrel'' with taking some information to the
tabloids, in an effort to stimulate public interest. ``If it gets
out,'' Mrs. Tripp says, ``it gets it out quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Goldberg tells Mrs. Tripp she must be ready to turn on her
friend, emphasizing ``you've got to really rat, and you've got to
tape.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp agrees. ``This would have been a great time for a
tape,'' she tells Ms. Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   By November, Mrs. Tripp was taping her conversations with Ms.
Lewinsky and talking to the Jones lawyers. On Jan. 16, the day she
helped Starr's investigators lure Ms. Lewinsky to the Ritz-Carlton
Hotel, Mrs. Tripp also briefed the Jones team about the
Lewinsky-Clinton relationship. Starr has said he knew nothing about
Mrs. Tripp's appointment with the Jones lawyers, and in his letter
he said no one from his office drove Mrs. Tripp to the appointment.
Starr acknowledged on the ABC News program ``20/20'' that he should
have kept better tabs on Mrs. Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 17, in his deposition in the Jones case, Clinton was
asked detailed questions about Ms. Lewinsky, including questions
about the gifts they had exchanged and whether they had had
specific forms of sexual relations. His misleading answers to those
questions are at the heart of the impeachment articles facing him
in the House.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Moody downplayed the importance of the meeting
between Mrs. Tripp and the Jones lawyers on the eve of the
president's deposition, saying he arranged the briefing so that
Mrs. Tripp would not have to testify in the case. ``I did not tell
Starr's office,'' he said. ``It didn't seem appropriate for me to
tell them.'' He also emphasized that the Jones lawyers already knew
a lot about Ms. Lewinsky, including information about the gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp, a Pentagon employee who is working at her job from
home, has been watching the impeachment proceedings in seclusion.
Her current lawyer, Anthony Zaccagnini, said in an interview, ``She
is not invested in impeachment. She has never said, `I hope he is
impeached.' ''

 &HT;    Jon Stewart readying for `Daily Show' role
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera and Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jon Stewart is cooling until he takes over as host of Comedy
Central's ``The Daily Show'' next month (current host Craig Kilborn
signs off at 11 tonight, with guest Richard Lewis). ``The Daily
Show'' satirizes events of the day, so jokes can't be written in
advance. Stewart meets with the staff on Jan. 4 and goes on-air on
Jan. 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have five good days to put the thing together,'' he says
from New York. ``It'll be five days of being like a biohazard drill
team: We'll just be working on logistics. In the meantime,
everybody gets a break to get straight and sober.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart hosted an MTV talk show in 1994 and 1995, after which he
became the most mentioned possible replacement in the business.
David Letterman's production company wanted to create a show for
Stewart to follow ``The Late, Late Show With Tom Snyder.'' Then
Stewart was supposed to replace Snyder, for whom he often
guest-hosted (Kilborn got the spot). He also appeared on HBO's
fictional talk show ``The Larry Sanders Show'' as himself _ a
comedian rumored to replace the host. The role was so successful
there was talk of the HBO show continuing with Stewart replacing
Garry Shandling as the show's fictional host.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Stewart wrote a book of humor essays (``Naked Pictures
of Famous People'') and worked on two movies that open within the
month (``Playing by Heart'' and ``The Faculty''). He took time
Wednesday from doing not much of anything to talk about ``The Daily
Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: How will the show change?
</P>
<P>
   A: At first the difference will be in whatever atmosphere I
bring into it. It's not going to be like, ``I really want to do
`The Daily Show' and I'd love to turn it into an abstract
musical.'' I like the format and the chance to satirize the news.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We've had this parade of pretty boys named Greg Kinnear and
Craig Kilborn _ any plans to change your name to a variation of
Greg?
</P>
<P>
   A: We're talking about that, but we may want to ease people into
it. I'm like Bobby on ``The Brady Bunch'' when he hangs from the
chin-up bar to make himself taller.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Anxious to get started?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've spent the last few years getting some things out of my
system (the movies and book). Now I want to get into the rhythm of
being able to respond to things. The other night I was in bed when
Mary Bono was questioning the Democratic counsel, asking should she
tell her children about the president. I wanted to run to the
studio and say, ``Tell them he was addicted to pain killers and
skied into an intern!''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What happened to talk between you and Letterman about doing a
show after Tom Snyder, or replacing him?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was like a shotgun marriage. I was on the show one night
and David called the next day about joining forces. But the more we
got into it, the more I realized there were other things I still
wanted to do. There was talk of a sitcom around the same time ``The
Daily Show'' came up, and I decided this made more sense for me.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was talk of you hosting ``The Larry Sanders Show'' ever
serious?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not really. It was something we'd talk about at 2 in the
morning and giggle about it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where do you see yourself on the Planet Comedy?
</P>
<P>
   A: Same place I've always seen myself. OK, I may never be Woody
Allen, but at least I'm not that other (guy) I saw the other night.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Plans for more movies?
</P>
<P>
   A: The focus right now is getting up to speed on the show and
taking two or three months to get my bearings. It's going to be
like ``The Jerk'': (the staff) knows (its) rhythm and I'm Steve
Martin on the porch, trying to clap and keep up.

   TV Guide on Tailwind
</P>
<P>
   CNN is more than a little nervous over a large-scale revival of
its Operation Tailwind fiasco that's coming next week. TV Guide
will publish the first installment of a four-part report, the
longest in TV Guide's history, in the magazine hitting newsstands
on Monday. No one outside TV Guide has seen the report, but
veterans who have been critical of CNN are anticipating it.
</P>
<P>
   The story, which has been in the works since September, was
written by Mary Murphy and Dennis McDougal; according to TV Guide,
they reviewed thousands of documents. The network's Tailwind story
in June alleged that U.S. military forces used nerve gas in Laos in
1970; CNN later retracted the story and apologized in the most
serious embarrassment it has suffered.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath, Brill's Content magazine and American
Journalism Review have both done postmortems of Tailwind without
turning up any major new facts that were not known during the
summer. An early release by TV Guide does not mention any
revelations, only that it will tell ``the entire story of Tailwind
in complete detail for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   What remains to be seen, however, is how much clout a TV Guide
story will have, given that the magazine has focused heavily on
soft features in recent years.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Tom DeLay was a boy, his parents would wake
him early on Christmas mornings so he could help them finish
assembling the other children's toys. ``I read the instructions,''
he said. ``I've always been a rules person.''
</P>
<P>
   That affinity for the rules, the small print, the Bible and the
Constitution, says DeLay, the House majority whip, is the key to
why he is leading the drive to impeach President Clinton, although
he hastens to add that he isn't ``driving anything, just showing
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is why he has never doubted throughout the impeachment
battle that he is right. ``Believe me, I take no pleasure in
this,'' he said in an interview at his office. ``But it's
absolutely clear to me.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay has been the House Republican leadership's point man on
impeachment for months, having kept the issue alive while other
Republicans pulled back. Fighting on procedure, he has blocked
efforts to make censure an option. And in filling a leadership void
that has opened between the speakerships of Newt Gingrich and Bob
Livingston, he has been ``the de facto speaker,'' in the words of
one senior Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, with more House Republicans announcing that they
would vote to impeach, the president's press secretary, Joe
Lockhart, said: ``Given the results, whatever he's saying it must
be awfully effective. Whatever power he has over members, he's
certainly proved to be a persuasive fellow.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats also feel that DeLay, known as ``the Hammer'' for
his aggressive whipping of GOP members, shows excellent potential
as a replacement for Gingrich as the Republican they most love to
hate.
</P>
<P>
   But DeLay does not seem to mind very much. And if most of the
public does not agree with him on impeachment, that, too, is fine.
He figures that everybody who says the Republicans will suffer as a
result of the push toward impeachment is probably a Democrat;
leadership on the issue, he says, will solidify the party, if
anything.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay has repeatedly and heatedly spoken of the president's
dishonesty, recently boiling it down to this: ``I don't believe a
word he says.'' And that, friends say, is at the heart of what
really bothers him about Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A number of friends interviewed about DeLay mentioned his
honesty first. Clinton has said he thinks that both Anita Hill and
Clarence Thomas were telling the truth as they remembered it. Such
a notion is so different from DeLay's own much more static sense of
what is real and true, friends say, as to be an affront to him.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay says he tries to keep his personal feelings about the
president separate from the impeachment issue. But he allows:
``That's hard to do. I've seen what goes on, and I've been lied to.
Lies, stonewalling. What's happening now is the culmination of this
man's whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   He can remember the day he says Clinton first lied to him: Nov.
19, 1995. Not more than 15 minutes after congressional Republicans
agreed to end the partial government shutdown that had resulted
from a budget stalemate, the president went back on his word, DeLay
says, breaking an accord the two sides had just negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   But the reason Clinton should be impeached, DeLay said, is to
uphold the law and the Constitution, a tiny copy of which he has
carried in his pocket for almost 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, DeLay is not working the phones this week. He
is not calling in chits, mobilizing his 64 deputy and assistant
whips or orchestrating indirect communication through his staff. In
fact, he shows no evidence of whipping this one at all.
</P>
<P>
   He does not have to, fellow House Republicans say, because he
has made himself clear without resorting to arm-twisting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very effective at getting votes for the Republicans
through TV appearances or through what Tom calls intelligence
gathering,'' said Rep. Peter King, a New York Republican against
impeachment. ``Everybody knows his reputation of being the Hammer,
and it may help him so much he doesn't have to do anything. People
will still think he could make sure you don't get as much money
from lobbyists or longtime Republican contributors.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although DeLay, a former exterminator from Sugar Land, Texas, is
best known for applying blunt force, he is far more fluent in the
subtler political arts than his critics acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
   His admirers say he is the best whip in a generation, because he
is able to tailor his sales pitches, making it his business to
understand each member's psyche and paying close attention to
vulnerabilities and motivations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows everyone's idiosyncrasies, quirks and buttons that
can be pushed,'' said Rep. Henry Bonilla, a fellow Texas
Republican. ``Someone will walk to the door in a meeting,'' Bonilla
said, and while no one else is paying much attention, DeLay will
note, `` `That guy needs a cigarette.' He's extremely wired to
everyone's personal needs.''
</P>
<P>
   His own motivations, friends say, are pretty straightforward: He
got into politics as a small-business owner frustrated by big
government. And always, he has been ambitious for both himself and
his hard-line conservative ideology.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, born in the border town of Laredo, Texas, grew up in
Venezuela, where his father was an oil drilling contractor. While
in grade school, he decided that he was a Republican at heart, much
to the surprise of his Democratic parents.
</P>
<P>
   He studied chemistry at the University of Houston because his
father wanted him to be a doctor, but ended up buying a
pest-control business. Soon the red tape was bothering him more
than the bugs. About that time he suffered his only electoral
defeat, in a race for treasurer of the Texas Pest Control
Association, to a competitor he still refers to as ``my nemesis.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, after reading a how-to book on campaigns, he ran for
the Texas Legislature and became the first Republican ever elected
from Fort Bend County. He was elected to Congress in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   A born-again Christian and ally of the religious right, he spent
much of the last year fighting losing battles like the drive to end
financing of the National Endowment for the Arts. And on a personal
level, he said, ``it's been a horrible year,'' between the upheaval
in the Republican leadership and, particularly, the shootings this
summer in which two Capitol police officers, one of whom worked in
DeLay's own office, were killed.
</P>
<P>
   With all that, though, he says his faith keeps him from worrying
too much about what lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy,'' he said, and pointed to a wooden plaque in his
office.
</P>
<P>
   It reads, ``This could be the day,'' in reference to the end of
the world.

MUSLIMS EXPRESS RESENTMENT AT ATTACK NEAR RAMADAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUWAIT CITY, Kuwait _ With Ramadan, the Muslim month of mercy,
just days away, early Arab reaction to the American-led air strikes
on Iraq included flashes of the kind of resentment that President
Clinton said he had hoped to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he had launched the attack early Thursday morning
here in part because, to have waited until Ramadan began would have
been ``profoundly offensive to the Arab world.'' Still, some people
interviewed at random here and in Cairo, Egypt, said they found the
timing of the attack offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ramadan is a great month,'' said Khaled Abdulkarim, a
40-year-old Qatari visitor to Kuwait. ``It should have been a time
to bring the Muslims and the Arabs closer together, not tear them
apart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is bad timing,'' said Mohsen Abdel Salam, a
35-year-old physician in Cairo. ``As a Muslim, it fuels my anger
against America and its policy towards us as Arabs and Muslims.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in ordinary times, the attitudes of Arab governments and
people about American strikes against Iraq often seem conflicted.
</P>
<P>
   And on the cusp of Ramadan, several experts said a sense of Arab
solidarity with the Iraqi people could spill over into animosity or
perhaps even terrorist strikes against the United States if what
President Clinton called ``unintended Iraqi casualties'' of the air
strikes include large numbers of Iraqi civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Arab leaders and ordinary people say the religious and cultural
ties they feel with ordinary Iraqis have made them deeply
uncomfortable with military action.
</P>
<P>
   In that respect, Kuwait _ with its vivid memories of Iraqi
occupation in 1990 and 1991 _ has been a hawkish exception.
</P>
<P>
   As the news spread early this morning that an attack the United
States has threatened for so long had begun, car horns around the
city could be heard honking in celebration. But the attack began at
1 a.m. in Kuwait, and governments around the Arab world did not
volunteer any immediate reaction.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear, for example, whether Saudi Arabia would permit
the U.S. war planes based on its soil to take part in attacks on
Iraq, something the Saudi government has said in the past it would
oppose.
</P>
<P>
   The Ramadan-related pall over the military action had been
anticipated, diplomats said, and researchers in Washington and
London have spent weeks seeking precedents that might soothe the
expected Arab complaints.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the prophet Mohammed and his army battled in Mecca
during Ramadan against those they regarded as infidels. And Arab
armies have often chosen to disregard the holiday, most notably
with the simultaneous Egyptian and Syrian attacks on Israel that
began the 1973 war.
</P>
<P>
   But in general, Muslims are taught that war during Ramadan is
unacceptable except in self-defense, a view that was repeated time
and again here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Saddam was hoping the holiday would protect him,
because he knows that Muslims don't want a war during Ramadan,''
said Mohammed Saleh, 30, a Kuwaiti customs officer. ``I don't want
a war during Ramadan either.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past six weeks, a diplomatic drive by U.S. officials has
succeeding in persuading eight Arab governments _ Egypt, Syria,
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and five other countries in the Persian Gulf _
to put new distance between themselves and the Baghdad government.
</P>
<P>
   But with Ramadan now at hand, Kuwaiti-based diplomats suggested
that the United States and Britain might best avert complaints if
the attack is wrapped up before the holy month begins over the
weekend. (The exact timing depends on the sighting of the new
moon.)
</P>
<P>
   In briefings in Washington, U.S. officials would not say
specifically when they expected the attacks to end. Defense
Secretary William Cohen said that he ``wouldn't want to set any
time frame'' and that the attacks would continue ``until such time
as we accomplish our set goals.''

SOME RELIEF WORKERS STILL IN BAGHDAD
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ In the hours before the U.S. and British
military strike began Wednesday, all international arms inspectors
were hurriedly evacuated from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   But 133 relief workers remained behind at the United Nations'
Baghdad headquarters on the orders of Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's decision, based in part on fears of the risks involved
in evacuating dozens of people over a long desert road to Jordan by
night, caused concern among some officials, who feared for their
colleagues' safety in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   About 73 U.N. relief workers were able to leave Iraq, most for
scheduled holiday breaks that some of them had moved forward to get
out of the country sooner than planned.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining foreigners working for the organization and for
its agencies were sent to the U.N. headquarters at the Canal Hotel,
a former hotel school on the edge of Baghdad, to sleep in their
offices.
</P>
<P>
   An official with the U.N. Special Commission, the inspectors who
have been disarming Iraq and whose headquarters are also in the
Canal Hotel, said Wednesday night that the commission was in touch
with relief workers in the building and that there had been no
problems in the early hours of the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Another 232 relief workers are in the Kurdish areas of northern
Iraq. They remain on duty, officials said.

   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Zimbabwe's former president, the
Rev. Canaan Banana, who fled Zimbabwe just before his conviction on
sodomy and sexual assault charges last month, turned himself in to
authorities there Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Banana, 62, who had been in hiding in Botswana and South Africa,
arrived at the High Court in the capital, Harare, in a Mercedes. He
was dressed, as usual, in a Mao-cut suit and walked with a cane.
</P>
<P>
   Through his lawyer, he told the judge he had not fled the
country to escape justice, but to discuss politics with other
African leaders. The court ordered him placed under house arrest in
his mansion in the Harare suburbs. He is due to be sentenced soon
and could face up to 22 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   In a short discussion with reporters on the courthouse steps,
Banana said ``political assassins'' were ``carrying out a plot
against me.''
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 26, Banana was convicted of 11 counts of sodomy,
attempted sodomy and indecent assault, all stemming from incidents
with young male bodyguards, gardeners and cooks assigned to him
when he was president from 1980 to 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The charges grew out of the 1995 murder trial of a police
inspector, Jefta Dube, who killed a colleague; Dube said the man
had taunted him, calling him ``Banana's wife.''

`PRINCE OF EGYPT' A MUCH CLASSIER   `TEN COMMANDMENTS'
</HEADLINE>
 OUR RATING: 3 Stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Pharaonically ambitious ``Prince of Egypt''
does indeed take feature-length animation in impressive new
directions. Arguably the most beautiful film ever drawn, this
telling of the biblical Moses story is an unequivocal masterpiece
of both design and that rarest of cartoon qualities, good taste.
</P>
<P>
   Narratively and theologically, the results are a little iffier.
While certainly reverent, ``Prince's'' screenplay, which is
credited to Philip LaZebnik, strains strenuously to make it play
for contemporary sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   But even though the movie dispenses with key passages in the
book of Exodus and has a tendency to depict God's messenger as
something of a California dude (Valley boy Val Kilmer provides the
voice of Moses), there are more than enough moments of carefully
wrought religious spectacle to validate the piece.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, complaints that it's like one big, colorful Sunday
school lesson are a matter of individual experience.
</P>
<P>
   Exciting/comic chariot races and a magic show production number
straight out of Siegfried and Roy won't invoke most folks' memories
of childhood religious training. At the same time, though, the
story unfolds in a kind of walking-on-eggs manner, as if the
filmmakers were too awestruck _ or, more likely, too worried about
offending the slightest sensibility of a single potential customer,
believing or secular.
</P>
<P>
   One thing's for sure, though: ``The Prince of Egypt'' is
infinitely classier than its closest cinematic forebear, Cecil B.
DeMille's 1956 ``The Ten Commandments.''
</P>
<P>
   The acting's better (and these are cartoons!). Interpretive
ideas are smarter; there's a fine, Genesis-like subtext here about
fraternal love and conflict, both between Moses and his virtual
brother Rameses (voiced by Ralph Fiennes) and his blood siblings
Miriam (Sandra Bullock) and Aaron (Jeff Goldblum).
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps its most felicitous modern touch, ``Prince''
dispenses with ``Commandments''' rampant misogyny. In this one,
Moses' shepherdess wife, Tzipporah (Michelle Pfeiffer), is not only
a tough customer, she's her husband's primary earthly support when
he returns to Egypt. And there's no Nefertiri figure to turn the
Moses-Rameses conflict into an overheated love triangle; the
conflict between the Pharoah and the Hebrew leader is purely a
matter of politics, conflicting interests and perceived personal
betrayals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prince of Egypt's'' real elegance, however, is in its visuals.
Truly inspired by Egyptian art, the film has an architectural scope
as imposing and graphically audacious as the pyramids themselves.
Cities burst with beautiful, gigantic structures; the grandly
composed color scheme is only enriched, rather than dulled, by its
sun- and sand-blasted qualities; and water has never been animated
more effectively, whether as a tear on a mother's cheek, the Nile
expelling a plague of frogs or _ the show stopper _ the Red Sea
parting, then reforming with a mighty vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   It's smart, too. The still-princely Moses' nightmare, from which
he realizes his true identity, is done in a stiff, scary,
hieroglyphic motif. And when the Angel of Death comes to claim
Egypt's firstborn, the screen mutes into a palette of mournful
grays that stirringly evokes the terror, tragedy and necessity of
it all.
</P>
<P>
   In the minus column, the songs aren't so hot (Stephen Schwartz,
of Disney's ``Pocahontas'' and ``Hunchback of Notre'' fame,
composed). Only the Whitney Houston-Mariah Carey shouting match,
``When You Believe,'' is really memorable, and that's never a good
sign for a musical soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   Others might regret the short shrift given the Commandments
here. All we get on that subject is a single shot of Moses carrying
tablets down from the mountain; there's no hint as to why Exodus is
not just a great story of liberation but of the lesson that freedom
without law is worthless anarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Reckon they didn't want to come off too preachy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prince of Egypt'' is credited to three directors _ Brenda
Chapman, Steve Hickner and Simon Wells _ but it's fairly common
knowledge that this is really DreamWorks partner Jeffrey
Katzenberg's baby. As he did at Disney before forming his own
studio with Steven Spielberg and David Geffen, Katzenberg oversaw
everything about the movie and has tried his best to move the
medium into worthy new territory with it.
</P>
<P>
   He succeeded at that; no one will mistake ``Prince of Egypt''
for a Disney product. But it is definitely a Hollywood product,
something that plays it as commercially safe as it can while
charting a path of divine inspiration.

JUDGE REDUCES SENTENCE OF BLACK MAN, CHARGING BIAS IN HIGHWAY
PULLOVERS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Mass., Md., N.J., Pa.)   By FOX BUTTERFIELD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a case believed to be the first of its kind, a
federal judge in Boston, sentencing a black man for gun possession,
reduced the sentence because his lengthy arrest record, she said,
reflected a tendency by the police to stop black motorists more
often than whites.
</P>
<P>
   Local and state police forces in several states have been
accused of pulling over black motorists for no apparent reason, or,
as critics complain, for ``driving while black.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Nancy Gertner of U.S. district court, said the
preponderance of minor traffic offenses on the arrest record of the
man, Alexander Leviner, raised ``deep concerns about racial
disparity'' because none of his motor vehicle charges involved
erratic driving or other behavior likely to attract police
scrutiny. Most were for driving after his license had been
suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Gertner sentenced Leviner on Dec. 3. Her decision was
first reported Wednesday in The Boston Globe.
</P>
<P>
   In his most recent arrest, in September 1997, Leviner was
stopped while driving fast at night with his lights off. At the
time, the police were investigating a report of shots being fired
in the predominantly black Roxbury section of Boston, and they
found a spent shell casing on his car floor along with a handgun.
Given Leviner's prior convictions, which included drug possession
charges, he was charged with possession of a gun, a federal felony.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rigid federal sentencing guidelines, which assign
mathematical scores for a defendant's criminal record based on the
length of time he has served in prison on previous convictions,
Judge Gertner could have sentenced Leviner to four to six years in
prison. Instead, she rejected the guidelines and gave him just two
and a half years.
</P>
<P>
   In reaching her decision, Judge Gertner said she took note of a
growing body of research that ``strongly suggests there is racial
disparity in the rates at which African-Americans are stopped and
prosecuted for traffic violations.''
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit in Maryland, for example, Robert Wilkins, a black
public defender who was stopped by the state police on Interstate
95, learned through discovery that while blacks made up 17 percent
of the drivers on the highway, they constituted 70 percent of the
drivers stopped by the Maryland state police.
</P>
<P>
   David Rudovsky, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania
Law School and a civil rights lawyer in Philadelphia, found similar
racial disparities in traffic stops along Interstate 95 south of
Philadelphia, and won a class action suit against Tinicum Township,
where the stops were being conducted. Huge differences have also
been found as the result of lawsuits involving traffic stops in New
Jersey and Florida, Rudovsky said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely no question that minorities get stopped on
the highways in a severely disproportionate way because of their
race,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Leviner's case, Judge Gertner found, the racial disparities
in traffic stops are then compounded by the way the federal
sentencing guidelines work, because they require the judge to fix a
sentence based on the length of prison sentences handed out in
earlier cases by state courts. ``By counting the imprisonment that
the defendant has received for the prior offenses, the system
effectively replicates disparities in sentencing in the state
system,'' Judge Gertner wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Motor vehicle offenses, in particular, raise deep concerns
about racial disparity,'' Judge Gertner said. Leviner had
previously been stopped in three largely white Boston suburbs,
Milton, Brookline and Waltham, and charged with driving after his
license had been suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Gertner also found that the federal sentencing guidelines
focused ``entirely on the sentences received for prior
convictions'' and did not make distinctions based on the kind of
offenses he had committed _ mostly motor vehicle violations.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Judge Gertner found, under the guidelines' arcane
mathematical structure, an 18-month sentence he received in 1997
for possession with intent to sell drugs was counted the same as if
he had been given an 18-year sentence for murder.
</P>
<P>
   David Harris, a professor of law at the University of Toledo,
said Judge Gertner's decision was the first in the nation to depart
from the sentencing guidelines because the defendant's record may
have been inflated by racial disparities in traffic stops.
</P>
<P>
   These disparities, felt by many black men, ``are having a
corrosive effect on our criminal justice system and other
government institutions, breeding cynicism and distrust,'' Harris
said. ``Traffic stops are the major source of contact between
citizens and the justice system, and blacks feel they are being
treated unfairly.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With a postponed but still-looming vote in the
House of Representatives, stunned Democrats are puzzling over the
revival of an impeachment effort they thought they'd snuffed out.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, the outnumbered pro-impeachment forces had steadily
gained momentum. But where were the labor unions and the rest of
President Clinton's political base? Where were the Wall Street
financiers and business leaders to warn against the uncertainty?
</P>
<P>
   Despite a last-minute flurry of activity from Democratic allies,
many of Clinton's champions were barely visible for the past five
weeks, as momentum gained for impeachment in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was almost disbelief that this was actually going to get
to this level,'' said Naomi Walker, spokeswoman for the AFL-CIO.
The labor organization had suspended its stop-impeachment efforts
after the Nov. 3 elections in which Republicans unexpectedly lost
seats in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``People thought (Republicans) had heard what they said in
November'' and would give up on impeaching Clinton, Walker said.
The unions have hurriedly reassembled a lobbying effort.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street and in corporate America, the silence has been
deafening.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, a former Wall Street investment
banker, has made no apparent attempt to whip up concerns about the
economic effects of an impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the underlying economy, which is in the long run
what drives markets ... I think the most likely scenario is still
to look forward to solid growth and low inflation,'' he said
Wednesday, according to the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Nor have business leaders expressed a general concern about
instability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is a business issue,'' said Frank Coleman,
spokesman for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He said his members,
instead of viewing it as an economic question, are asking, ``Do we
really want to do this?'' and ``Don't we want to draw the line
somewhere?''
</P>
<P>
   The president's admitted misconduct also has been a factor. It
has sapped some of the enthusiasm from defenders, according to
longtime Clinton ally, Will Marshall, president of the Progressive
Policy Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plenty of people have rallied behind the president and
defended him over the course of the last year,'' Marshall said.
``And many of them felt burned when he, in the end, was forced to
admit what had happened'' in the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall said ``most people think he acted deplorably,'' and he
added many Democrats have therefore shifted their focus from
Clinton himself to defending ``the results of a democratic
election.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has had the steady backing of African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson has called a prayer vigil at the U.S.
Capitol for Thursday, the day the impeachment date was originally
scheduled to begin. But even Jackson has not been highly visible in
the Clinton defense in the past weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win, our presence will have made a statement,'' Jackson
said in calling for the 11th-hour vigil. ``If we lose the vote, at
least we were witnesses to this action.''

SOUTH KOREAN SCIENTISTS SAY THEY CLONED A HUMAN CELL

<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ South Korean scientists said Wednesday that
they had cloned a human cell from an infertile woman, creating a
four-cell embryo that theoretically could have grown into a
genetically identical replica of the woman. But they said that
because of the legal and ethical implications of their work, they
stopped the experiment and did not try to create a human clone.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists, at a major hospital here, are believed to be the
first to publicly claim that they taken steps to clone a human
being. Their research has not been confirmed or reviewed by other
scientists, but experts in the United States said that although
they did not know of the scientists' work, the requisite techniques
had been demonstrated in animals and that there was no theoretical
reason they could not be applied to people.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean researchers said they let the embryo reach only
four cells before halting the experiment and did not take the
critical step of implanting the embryo in a woman, so there is no
guarantee that it would have developed into a fetus. Still, the
research shows how quickly cloning, dismissed as science fiction a
decade ago, has crossed into uncharted ethical territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need some genetic proof that this really happened,'' said
Dr. Alan DeCherney, chairman of the obstetrics and gynecology
department at University of California, Los Angeles. But what is
``interesting,'' he said, is ``if they're trying it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Scotland, researchers at the institute that produced the
first clone, Dolly the sheep, also expressed skepticism about the
Korean claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``By stopping the experiment when they did, the Korean
researchers are unable to provide any evidence that the transferred
nucleus had been successfully `reprogrammed,''' said Harry Griffin,
assistant director of the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh.
</P>
<P>
   In the experiment, conducted by a three-person research team at
the Kyunghee University Hospital in Seoul, scientists at an
infertility clinic said they cultivated a human embryo by using an
unfertilized egg and an ordinary, or somatic, cell donated by a
woman in her 30s. They used a technique similar to the one used by
researchers at the University of Hawaii who announced in July that
they had cloned mice.
</P>
<P>
   The Korean government restricts the cloning of humans, though it
does not ban it outright. There is a significant amount of cloning
experimentation in South Korea, and some experts say that it is
about as advanced as that in Japan, where scientists recently
cloned eight calves from a single adult cow.
</P>
<P>
   Yukio Tsunoda, a scientist at Kinki University who led the
recent cloning of the eight calves in Japan, said that he had
little information on the research work by the Korean team. But he
said that since cloning of animals could be done, he did not see
any scientific reason why cloning humans could not. Moreover, he
said it is possible that human cloning to the same stage reached by
the Korean team may have been done secretly in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than admiration, however, the work in Korea inspired
outrage and was immediately denounced by lawmakers and civics
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We oppose the cloning of human cells,'' said Jung Myoung-hee,
director of Green Korea United, a group concerned with ethics in
biology and environmental pollution. ``This is not an advancement
for medical technology and now we have to be prepared to accept
international criticism. The result of this experiment is not
something Koreans should be proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason other countries have not developed this
technology is because they feared the ethical repercussions, not
because they lacked the technology,'' Jung said.
</P>
<P>
   Rhee Shang-hi, a legislator, along with 35 other lawmakers
introduced a proposal in Parliament last month that would strictly
limit experimentation on areas that ``may damage the integrity of
human life,'' according to a statement released by Rhee's office.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Sung-bo, who supervised the research team, said he was very
aware of the ethical issues surrounding his experiment. He added
that while he was worried that such concerns could sometimes stand
in the way of medical advances, his team had no plans to disregard
ethical standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no intention of developing our technology while
disobeying the rule of ethics,'' said Kim by telephone. ``But if
conditions are ripe and if we can reach a point of agreement with
medical experts around the world, we are willing to continue our
experiment within limited boundaries, but not involving the
implantation of an egg into a uterus.''
</P>
<P>
   Implantation was the key step that the team did not take. If
they had taken the embryo and implanted it in the woman's uterus,
they said, it perhaps would have developed as a fetus and been born
regularly, but they chose not to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The team said it plans to publish its results, but did not have
a timetable. Kim said that the team had not videotaped the work,
but that members planned to include photographs in their
description of the work.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I think they wanted to experiment on the early stage of human
embryo growth, which is potentially a technology of making
clones,'' said Shohei Yonemoto, senior researcher at Mitsubishi
Kasei Institute of Life Sciences in Japan. He noted that even if
the embryo had been implanted, the success rate of in-vitro
fertilization is only about 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Kim's colleague in cloning the human cell, Lee Bo-yon, said
Wednesday that ``cloning humans was not so high-tech.'' He also
stressed, however, that the experiment was not related to solving
infertility problems for patients at the clinic, and that
participants had received permission from the donor to use three of
her eggs for experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, the team cultured six eggs on two different
occasions from two different women. But only one developed into an
embryo. In the successful round, Lee said that on Dec. 8 he took an
egg from a woman and removed its nucleus, which contains its
genetic material. In its place, he put the nucleus from a somatic
cell, which is a typical cell from the body. By Dec. 10, the cell
had divided into four cells, a stage at which it could have been
implanted.
</P>
<P>
   Though it may appear relatively simple, the experiment could be
looked upon in the future as a milestone. ``It might be said that
this experiment was a trigger,'' said Yonemoto, at Mitsubishi. ``It
showed proof that human cloning is possible.''

 &HT;    Glenn charges America to revive public service
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Jim Bebbington
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Retiring U.S. Senator John Glenn on Wednesday
challenged a standing-room-only crowd crammed into the Ohio House
chambers to rekindle respect for public service.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a rare joint session of the Ohio House and Senate
gathered to hear him, Glenn praised the representatives and
senators for entering public life. He said the public now thinks
little of politicians and that too many people are cynical about
the value of public service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is vital that everyone be willing to devote at least some
of their talents and a portion of their time to solving the many
pressing problems that plague our communities, our country and our
world,'' Glenn said.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn received standing ovations and applause throughout his
visit Wednesday in Columbus as he was featured in a downtown parade
and in his speech to the Legislature. He and his wife, Annie, are
traveling throughout the state this week taking part in events
marking the conclusion of his 24-year Senate career and his
November mission aboard the space shuttle. He will finish attending
public events this weekend in his hometown of New Concord.
</P>
<P>
   Gov.-elect Bob Taft praised Glenn for bringing honor to all
Ohioans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a man who came from a small town but held big dreams,''
Taft said.
</P>
<P>
   The parade brought out crowds of downtown workers and
schoolchildren to line several blocks to cheer Glenn. Children who
were too young to remember even Glenn's failed presidential bid
from 1984 clamored to get a front-row seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all want to meet him and get his autograph,'' said Chance
Leslie, who was shepherding four Cub Scouts through the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn is scheduled to visit the Dayton area at 4 p.m. today at
Carillon Park to return a portion of the Wright brothers' first
powered aircraft he took with him aboard the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Glenn said, the country has had no traumatic
events such as those in the past that forced people to care about
their society. The Depression and the wars that followed showed
people the need for being active in society. Today, Glenn said,
young people want no part of politics or serving the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to convince them, young people in particular, that our
democracy has no room for the cynicism and apathy that we find
toward politics and government in our society,'' Glenn said.
</P>
<P>
   After he leaves the Senate, he will be an adjunct professor at
Ohio State University helping establish the John Glenn Institute
for Public Service and Public Policy.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn also stressed the message that his shuttle flight has sent
to senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``This nation needs our efforts and our wisdom every bit as much
as we need that of our younger citizens,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He joked that his age, 77, was overplayed during his shuttle
mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely no truth to the rumor that NASA refused to
schedule a space walk for me because they were afraid I'd wander
off someplace,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Bigger is better. That seems to be the view of Frank Zarb,
chairman of the National Association of Securities Dealers, the
nation's largest self-regulatory organization and parent of the
Nasdaq stock market.
</P>
<P>
   As head of an organization that oversees some 5,600 member
brokerage firms, Zarb's domain is already plenty big. But he wants
to become the world's No. 1 market for stocks and has recently
acquired the American Stock Exchange and the Philadelphia Stock
Exchange, and is talking about Nasdaq alliances with the main stock
markets in Germany and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   There is just one problem. Back home at the very grass roots of
his organization, Zarb is having trouble putting out a little brush
fire. Many owners of the smaller brokerage firms that make up the
lion's share of NASD members, from places like Redwood Falls,
Minn., West Hartford, Conn., and Weston, W.Va., are angered by a
lack of representation on NASD. And they are threatening to loosen
the stranglehold that large firms like Merrill Lynch, Paine Webber
and Goldman, Sachs have on NASD's rule-making board and its
operations.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in its 60-year history, the securities
dealers association's election for seats on the board of governors
is being contested. On one side are NASD's official slate, selected
by its nominating committee. They include former President Ford;
James Dimon, the former president of Travelers who resigned last
month from Citigroup, and Arthur Rock, a top venture capitalist.
Opposing these nominees are a slate of four unknowns, put up by
associations of small brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, NASD holds elections to replace retiring members of
its 35-seat board, which votes on new rules and other issues
surrounding the operations of the stock market and member firms.
This year's election, replacing 12 retiring members, will be
decided on Dec. 21.
</P>
<P>
   But while other NASD elections have been nonevents, this time
throngs of small brokerage firms _ those employing 100 or fewer
employees but making up 91 percent of the member firms _ are up in
arms. They say they have become increasingly disenfranchised, even
discriminated against by an organization whose board is dominated
by executives from large, household name brokerages. Believing they
are over-regulated and under-represented, the small firms want more
say in the oversight process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NASD is an organization that is resistant to change,''
said Alan Davidson, president of the Independent Broker Dealer
Association and Zeus Securities, a one-office securities firm in
Jericho, N.Y., that specializes in bonds. Davidson is also the
force behind the independent slate of candidates for the
association's board. ``They have betrayed the bulk of their
membership.''
</P>
<P>
   This David vs. Goliath story might be of no concern to the
investing public but for one thing. Small broker-dealers, the
association's roots, perform several important functions. They
create jobs across the country and help small companies that are
shunned by big firms raise capital so they can grow and create
jobs. Furthermore, many of these smaller brokers make markets in
shares of obscure local companies, providing liquidity to investors
who are trading these shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is in the public interest that smaller firms be given the
chance to survive and prosper,'' said Lewis Lowenfels, a prominent
securities lawyer in New York who represented the American Stock
Exchange floor brokers in the exchange's merger with NASD earlier
this year. ``The NASD was built in large part on the
entrepreneurship of smaller firms and must be particularly
sensitive to the needs of these firms as it builds and expands its
global empire.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what Frank Zarb has been doing all year, says Michael
Jones, chief administrative officer of NASD. ``To say Frank has
been aggressively pursuing and implementing the inclusion of small
firms would be an understatement,'' he said. Of course, Zarb and
his colleagues have to serve many masters: large firms and small,
investors trading in Nasdaq stocks, issuers whose shares trade on
the various Nasdaq markets.
</P>
<P>
   But even more important, Zarb has had to work overtime to clean
up NASD's image after it was censured by the Securities &AMP; Exchange
Commission in 1996 for failure to regulate its market adequately.
Increasing the regulatory structure was a natural response.
</P>
<P>
   Although NASD began as a self-regulatory organization for
smaller firms, it has become increasingly oriented to the big
firms. Since 1988, eight board chairmen have come from firms with
more than 200 employees; twice during that time a Merrill Lynch
executive has headed the board.
</P>
<P>
   That the NASD favors big firms was one of the problems cited two
years ago by Arthur Levitt, chairman of the SEC when it published
the results of its investigation into accusations about Nasdaq
trading improprieties and other issues. In addition to Nasdaq
market makers' unfair trading practices, Levitt said: ``The NASD
allowed the interests of large market-making firms to have undue
influence over the conduct of its affairs and the regulation of the
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Many small firms believe little has changed since Levitt
delivered his thunderbolt. The NASD, however, says that much has
been done to open the regulatory structure to participants from
outside the securities industry and the crucial separation of the
regulatory arm from the operation of the stock market. ``We've come
a long way under Frank's direction to balancing our
constituencies,'' said Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of this happened earlier this year when the board
reserved one seat for a small broker dealer. The association also
formed the Small Firm Advisory Board to address the concerns of
those constituents. That panel is headed by Carl Sherr, who runs
his own small firm in Worcester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   But Sherr is no outsider. He was chairman of the NASD in 1984
and has frequently sat on arbitration panels assembled by the
regulator. He is also chairman of one of the association's district
committees. ``He is supposed to be our representative,'' Davidson
said. ``But he's one of them, not one of us.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nelson runs Minnesota Valley Investors, a full-service
brokerage in Redwood Falls, Minn., which has seven registered
representatives and four offices. ``What bothers me is the lack of
input asked for from small firms,'' he said. ``I haven't seen any
information from the Small Firm Advisory Board on what positions
they've taken on any proposed regulation. I know it's out there,
but I don't know what they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, members of the securities dealers association have
not been permitted to vote on rule changes made by the board. The
NASD argued that sending out rule changes to an enormous membership
was becoming too costly and inefficient. But to small
broker-dealers this was proof that their input was unwelcome. It
meant that the merger with the American Stock Exchange, which was
put to a vote of the Amex members, was not approved by a vote of
NASD member firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NASD owns and operates a television studio, sponsors the
Super Bowl, has plenty of money for a multimillion-dollar sign in
Times Square, but it doesn't want to spend 32 cents to mail members
their own rule changes,'' Davidson said.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller firms are also deeply concerned about increasingly stiff
fees and fines for even the most minor infractions. Joseph Mays
Jr., president of Securities Consulting Group in New York, advises
small securities-firm clients and was a compliance examiner at NASD
from 1982 to 1987. ``In the past, some rule violations would have
not been considered finable,'' he said. ``Now, they're looking for
ways to catch firms in minor rule violations so they can put a
dollar sign on the examination. They're turning the membership into
a profit center.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, critics say that NASD's approach to overcoming the
year 2000 computer bug has been heavyhanded. Many smaller firms
clear their clients' mutual fund, stock or bond trades through
larger firms, handle no customer money or securities and may not
even have a computer. Understanding this, the SEC suggested
exempting these broker dealers from Y2K compliance surveys.
</P>
<P>
   But NASD said no. Last summer it sent out a 19-page form for all
firms to fill out on their preparedness. Many tiny firms were a
little late filing their reports. In the past, that would have
probably been overlooked.This time NASD has moved to censure the
firms and impose fines on them of $2,500, or roughly half the
amount many of them have in net capital.
</P>
<P>
   Dues and incidental fees imposed on members have also jumped in
the past three years, far in excess of inflation.The minimum annual
fee is $1,200, but with add-ons a small firm could be charged
$3,000 while a much larger firm might wind up paying only $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Jones says the regulator's costs have increased as the industry
has grown. But the cost increases are onerous to small firms. ``We
service a lot of jeans-and-sneakers kind of people,'' said Thomas
Pringle, president of Mark Securities, a two-branch brokerage in
West Hartford, Conn. ``To treat Mark Securities like it's Merrill
Lynch or vice versa is not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the structure of NASD calls for one firm, one vote,
many of the smaller firms complain that the bigger firms carry more
weight with the market supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   Small firms, 91 percent of the membership, hold only 10 percent
of the industry representation on the board.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the vast majority of brokerage firms are honest,
small firms find themselves standing out more on NASD's regulatory
radar screen because of its increasing focus on microcap fraud _
securities violations perpetrated on gullible investors in tiny
stocks by bucket shop brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big companies don't do it because they have too much to
lose,'' argued Alfred Berkeley III, Nasdaq's president, in an
interview earlier this year with USA Today. ``Little teeny
companies and investment banks may have the incentive to fool
people. And I'd like to put nails deep in their bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chris Nelson of Minnesota Valley Securities said many
smaller firms are being wrongly tarred by NASD's brush. ``Out here
in a town of 6,000, all you have is your reputation,'' she said.
``You don't have an option not to run a clean operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of smaller firms also point to scandals
involving big firms, such as the sales practices at Prudential
Securities that led to a billion dollar settlement with aggrieved
investors and Merrill Lynch's involvement in the Orange County
bankruptcy. Small firms are particularly worried about a proposal
approved by the board in October that would allow NASD's regulatory
arm to issue temporary cease and desist orders to ``prevent
continuing violations of specific NASD rules and the securities
laws.'' This essentially means that regulators need no longer show
cause to a federal judge to shut down a brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The view of the organization is that we deal with each firm on
its own merits,'' said Jones of NASD. But many owners of small
firms who were interviewed for this story declined to speak for
attribution. They believe that retribution from NASD would result
from on-record criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   La Rae Bakerink, vice president of compliance at SK
International Securities in La Jolla, Calif., says they have reason
to be concerned. Just weeks after Ms. Bakerink's name appeared on
the NASD ballot as an independent nominee, she received word that
her firm was being audited by NASD, more than nine months ahead of
schedule. ``Fortunately, I'm not concerned,'' she said. ``We do a
really clean business. But I still feel it's intimidation
tactics.''

INDICTMENT SAYS 5 WORKED WITH BIN LADEN IN TANZANIA BLAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal prosecutors charged Wednesday that the
American Embassy in Tanzania was attacked by at least six men who
detonated a bomb packed with car batteries and oxygen tanks,
apparently to enhance the lethal force of the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   One of the bombers died in the assault, which killed 11 people
and wounded more than 80, while another photographed the
destruction before fleeing, prosecutors asserted in a new
indictment returned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment provides the first detailed account of the
bombing on Aug. 7 of the American Embassy in Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania. It accuses five men of conspiring with Osama bin Laden,
the Saudi exile who is suspected of organizing the simultaneous
bomb attacks on the embassies in Tanzania and Kenya as well as
other acts of terrorism against Americans abroad.
</P>
<P>
   All five of the new suspects are at large, authorities said, and
each faces charges for which he could, if eventually convicted,
face the death penalty in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The government announced rewards of up to $5 million each for
information leading to the arrest or capture of the new suspects,
matching a similar amount being offered in the case of bin Laden
and two other associates.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment brings to 14 the number of men known to have been
charged by federal prosecutors in their investigation of the
embassy bombings and bin Laden's global organization. Four of those
are in custody in New York and two others are awaiting extradition
from Germany and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's charges reaffirm the mutual and unrelenting resolve of
Tanzania and Kenya and American authorities to find, apprehend and
prosecute every single person who participated in the murderous
terrorist bombings in East Africa,'' Mary Jo White, the U.S.
attorney in Manhattan, said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors did not charge the two men who are being held in
Tanzania in connection with the bombing. One of those men, Mustafa
Mahmoud Said Ahmed, walked into the American embassy late last year
and warned authorities about a plot to blow up the embassy in
Nairobi. American officials have declined to say why they are not
seeking his extradition.
</P>
<P>
   The government has previously charged bin Laden and associates
with the bombing in Tanzania, but until now has provided few
details. Previous indictments in the case have been much more
expansive about the bombing of the Nairobi embassy, which left more
than 200 dead and thousands injured.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest indictment, prosecutors suggest the two attacks
were coordinated so as to occur almost simultaneously in the two
countries, under the supervision of members of bin Laden's group.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the indictment describes a meeting between one of
the suspects in the Tanzania attack, Mustafa Mohamed Fadhil, an
Egyptian in his early 20s, and Mohamed Sadeek Odeh, who has since
been arrested and charged in the Kenya attack. It says they
discussed a fatwa, or religious opinion, in which bin Laden called
for attacks against Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Fadhil and another suspect in Tanzania rented a villa
in Dar es Salaam, which became the ``bomb factory,'' prosecutors
charged..
</P>
<P>
   Around that time, the indictment says, Odeh and other
Kenya-based operatives were preparing in that country for the
attack in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   In June and July, the indictment says, the suspects in Tanzania
bought a 1987 Nissan Atlas truck to carry the bomb to the embassy,
and a white Suzuki Samurai, in which the suspects would flee.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects arranged for welding and other mechanical work to
be done on the truck, apparently to equip it to carry the bomb, the
indictment says. They also were said to have bought oxygen and
acetylene tanks and two large truck batteries. Experts say these
are typically used to augment the ignition and explosion of a bomb.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Aug. 5, two days before the bombings, one of the conspirators
in Tanzania telephoned a counterpart in Nairobi, the indictment
says.
</P>
<P>
   Suspects in each country fled just before the bombings occurred,
it says. On Aug. 6, for example, the night before the attacks, Odeh
flew on Pakistani International Airways Flight (NU)746 to Karachi,
Pakistan, along with one of the suspects who helped to prepare the
Tanzania attack, the indictment says. It says the men left on
instructions from other members of bin Laden's group.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 7, a man described only as ``Ahmed the German''
detonated the explosive device in Dar es Salaam, which was being
carried in the Nissan Atlas truck along with the tanks and
batteries. He died in the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, another operative who was riding in the Suzuki
Samurai photographed the embassy ruins as he left the scene, the
indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Fadhil, the other four men charged Wednesday were
two Tanzanians, Khalfan Khamis Mohamed and Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani,
each 24, and two Kenyans, Fahid Mohammed Ally Msalam, 22, and
Sheikh Ahmed Salim Swedan, 29.

NEW POLITICAL SCANDAL ROCKS IRELAND
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ A new scandal emerged Wednesday in Ireland
over assertions of corruption and nepotism at the highest level of
government, plunging the country into a national debate.
</P>
<P>
   The debate came after the disclosure of an official ruling that
former Prime Minister Charles Haughey owed no taxes on a $2 million
gift from a businessman and that the decision was made by a
brother-in-law of present Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, whose
political career was fostered by Haughey. &UR;  &LR;  In the Parliament,
members of the opposition party, Fine Gael, charged the Fianna Fail
party of Ahern and Haughey of corruption and nepotism. Opposition
members said that a tribunal stated unequivocally last spring that
the $2 million was taxable as a gift.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is incredible,'' said Labor Party leader Ruairi Quinn, a
former finance minister leader.
</P>
<P>
   Another member shouted ``This is corruption!'' as Speaker Seamus
Pattison tried to gavel the house to order.
</P>
<P>
   Ahern, under a fusillade of hostile questioning, denied any
involvement in the case, adding: ``He is my brother-in-law, but I
had no knowledge about this until I read about it in this morning's
newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition members said Ronan Kelly, the tax official who made
the no-tax ruling, was appointed by Ahern when the prime minister
was finance minister several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nora Owen, a former justice minister and a member of Fine Gael,
the largest opposition party, said, ``The public are outraged by
what they read in the newspapers.'' She called for an investigation
of how the decision was made and demanded to know whether Ahern
would order revenue officials to appeal the decision in court.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation is an embarrassment for Fianna Fail, but it
was barely noticed until Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Most, but by no means all, of the people interviewed on Irish
national radio and television in Dublin, Cork and other areas
Wednesday said Haughey should pay the tax or be sent to prison.
Ireland has one of the highest rates in Europe, with a maximum tax
of 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Haughey's supporters say that as prime minister in the 1980s he
cut excessive state spending and debt, telling people to tighten
their belts.
</P>
<P>
   They noted that the economy improved steadily under him and that
he eliminated income taxes for writers and artists and increased
the number of old people who received free public transportation
passes. His opponents say it is now clear that he was not
tightening his own belt at the time. He owns two large estates, a
yacht and several thoroughbred race horses.
</P>
<P>
   Haughey, 73, who was prime minister for nine years, was already
under investigation for accepting the $2 million from Ben Dunne, a
former chief executive of the country's largest department store.
</P>
<P>
   Haughey himself acknowledged that he had taken the $2 million,
but added that he gave no favors for the money. The former prime
minister has not been charged with any crime. But the investigation
already under way is expected to answer the question on many minds:
How did a man who spent his entire life in politics, at modest
salaries, become a man of ostensible wealth?

EDITORIAL: WAR AND IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Dec. 17:
</P>
<P>
   After hearing for months about Bill Clinton's ability to
compartmentalize issues, the country and the world now have to
match that difficult trick. By attacking Iraq as House members
gathered in the capital to consider his impeachment, Clinton could
not avoid the impression that he is blurring the boundaries that
must separate America's foreign conduct from its domestic political
turbulence. But that accusation would in large part be unfair. The
confrontation with Iraq has played out on its own timetable and
happened to reach a decisive point on the eve of the House
impeachment debate.
</P>
<P>
   No one but Clinton knows all the factors that went into his
decision to order air strikes, and historians may long speculate
whether the threat of impeachment propelled him to exercise his
powers as commander in chief. Trent Lott, the Senate majority
leader, and a handful of other Republicans immediately questioned
Clinton's motives, a startling departure from the unity that
usually accompanies American military action. That is not the only
political custom suspended in Washington this strange and eventful
week.
</P>
<P>
   But viewed outside the prism of impeachment, the decision to
launch cruise missiles against Iraq was fully justified. Just weeks
after Saddam Hussein had yet again promised to give international
inspectors unhindered access, Iraq barred them from sites suspected
of housing chemical and biological arms. Richard Butler, the chief
U.N. inspector, reported Tuesday that effective inspections were
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Given the prospect that Baghdad would rebuild its arsenal of
toxic weapons while U.N. inspectors were handcuffed, Clinton and
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain had no choice but to use
military force to destroy portions of Iraq's arms industry. With
the Islamic holy month of Ramadan beginning this weekend, military
action had to start or be postponed until late January.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise missiles and the bombing runs that will follow cannot
eliminate the threat, but they can severely reduce Iraq's ability
to make new weapons or use its old ones. It is essential for
American and British forces to limit civilian casualties.
Washington and London must also be mindful of the uneven
international support for the attack. There are limits on how long
and how hard Iraq can be hit before foreign support diminishes.
</P>
<P>
   In the likely event that Iraq refuses to allow inspections to
resume after this attack, the Security Council must develop new
ways to restrain Baghdad. Clinton outlined a strategy of
containment, promising to use force again if necessary and to
maintain economic sanctions on Iraq. These measures may not be
popular among all members of the Security Council, but less
forceful policies will not work as long as Saddam remains in power.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made only glancing reference to the gathering storm of
impeachment in his address on Wednesday evening, but the
convergence of events clearly left Republicans disgruntled and
distrustful. The attack on Iraq may delay but will not end the
debate over Clinton's fate or change any votes already committed to
impeachment. Congress needs to resolve that constitutional crisis
as soon as possible.

   MEXICO CITY _ The body of Philip True, Mexico correspondent for
the San Antonio Express-News, was found Wednesday in a remote
ravine in western Mexico, 17 days after True hiked into the
mountains on a reporting trek, authorities said. True, who was 50,
apparently fell to his death.

   ``There has been no autopsy at this point, but it appears that
he died of a fall,'' said Steve Morrisseau, a U.S. embassy

   True, an experienced hiker, entered the mountains on the border
of the Jalisco and Nayarit states on Nov. 29 to photograph and

the communication ended on Dec. 7. His family reported him missing

STOCK, BOND MARKETS REACT WITH CAUTION TO IRAQ BOMBING  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The attack on Iraq Wednesday sent ripples through
world financial markets and was expected to weigh on American
stocks when markets opened Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts, who noted that predicting market reactions is
difficult, said they did not expect a major impact as long the
attack succeeded rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming a quick resolution, markets should go back to trading
on the basis of the other uncertainties worrying investors _ the
impeachment vote looming over President Clinton, slowing corporate
earnings and the deepening recession in much of the rest of the
world. All of these events, analysts believe, could have a much
bigger impact on stocks, bonds, the dollar, oil and other commodity
prices than the Iraq attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Markets, traders and investors really hate uncertainty,'' said
David Blitzer, the chief economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp.
``But,'' he added, referring to the bombing, ``they have been
through it before and will look at what happened then.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 21 percent after
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August of 1990, it soared 18.5
percent in the two months after the war began in January and it
appeared that the United States and its allies would win easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect it to have a gargantuan impact,'' Blitzer said.
``It won't turn the tide.''
</P>
<P>
   As in 1991, the Iraqi situation could turn positive quickly,
which would prevent much reaction at all. That is why forecasting a
market response is so difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also said that the big negative that threatened all
markets in 1991 _ a surge in oil prices that took it quickly to $40
a barrel _ is extremely unlikely today.
</P>
<P>
   Futures contracts on both the Dow Jones industrial average and
the Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks, an indicator of how
prices would likely behave in early trading Thursday, fell after
news reports about the attack on Iraq, which came after the
American markets had closed. During trading, when it was already
clear that an attack was a possibility, stocks were little changed.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 32.70 points to 8,790.60
while the S&AMP;P index of 500 stocks slipped 0.89 points to 1,161.94.
The Nasdaq index fell 3.24 points to 2,009.36.
</P>
<P>
   In foreign stock markets early Thursday, the Nikkei index of 225
stocks was down about 1 percent but the move was small compared
with recent trading.
</P>
<P>
   While the Iraq crisis was a dominant theme on Wall Street
Wednesday, stocks also were affected by profit-warnings of large
blue-chip companies. The latest was 3M, which said its
fourth-quarter results would miss expectations. Its stock dropped 2
3/8 to 71 3/8.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany
Corp., said that the impeachment of the president could be far more
damaging to stocks, especially if it ever seems that Clinton will
actually leave office. ``The stock market expects the House to vote
impeachment but that it will not get through the Senate,'' he said.
Blitzer said just a long trial in the Senate, regardless of the
outcome, could be a problem. ``I could see people getting
distracted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bond market prices rose and yields, which move in the opposite
direction, ended lower just as the official word of the Iraq attack
came at 5 p.m. The price of the 30-year Treasury issue advanced
18/32 to a price of 104 3/32 and its yield eased to 4.99 percent
from 5.02 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But one trader said that may just have been a knee-jerk
reaction. In early trading in the bond futures market Wednesday
night, there was very little reaction, with the price of the
30-year bond up just slightly.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of the possibility of a bombing, oil prices shot
up sharply Wednesday after it was announced that U.N. inspectors
were leaving Iraq because President Saddam Hussein of Iraq would
not cooperate with inspections of the country's weapons programs.
Since an attack on Iraq was avoided at the last minute in November,
both the United States and Britain had threatened to attack without
warning if the inspections program was undermined by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The near-month contract for oil on the New York Mercantile
Exchange jumped 7.2 percent, or 83 cents, to $12.38 a barrel, the
biggest single-day gain in three months.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Rothman, the senior energy analyst at Merrill Lynch,
said ``when this ends, it is very likely oil prices could be under
renewed downward pressure.'' Even with Wednesday's rally, oil
prices are not far above the 12-year lows they hit earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Rothman said the price of oil rose on the anticipation of the
cutoff, if an attack began, of the 1.7 million to 1.8 million
barrels of oil a day that Iraq is allowed to sell under a
humanitarian exemption from the economic embargo in place since
1990.
</P>
<P>
   He estimated that supply could be disrupted for up to a month.
But if sales resumed relatively quickly, he said, the temporary
absence of Iraqi oil on the market would not make a significant
dent in the glut that is depressing prices.
</P>
<P>
   Rothman said that he is not expecting the conflict to result in
a disruption of oil production from any of Iraq's neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar also rallied Wednesday in Europe, as it often does
when there is political or military uncertainty, rising to 1.6728
German marks from 1.6575 marks Tuesday. But it was little changed
against the Japanese yen, inching up to 116.53 yen from 116.35 yen
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But it is possible that the dollar could lose these gains
quickly if it is clear that the attack on Iraq will be successful
and will not lead to wider problems. In trading early in Tokyo
Thursday, the dollar was lower against both the mark and the yen.

BANKS WARNED TO SCRUTINIZE HEDGE FUNDS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind.)   (jw) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY JR.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Federal Reserve official warned Wednesday that
regulators may need to insist that banks scrutinize more closely _
and lend less freely _ to hedge funds to avoid such crises as the
near-failure in September of Long-Term Capital Management.
</P>
<P>
   ``Private market discipline seems to have largely broken down''
in that case, said Patrick Parkinson, associate director of the
Fed's division of research and statistics, forcing the Fed to
organize a $3.5 billion rescue operation by the hedge fund's
creditors to avert any threat to the global financial system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weaknesses in risk management practices clearly need to be
addressed,'' Parkinson told the Senate Agriculture Committee, which
was convened to monitor the progress of an interagency group
studying derivative products, as well as hedge funds. The group is
made up of officials from the Fed, the Treasury, the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also heard suggestions of possible moves to shore
up or impose regulation by the Treasury and the SEC. This was seen
by some as a softening of earlier stances.
</P>
<P>
   ``There now appears to be a willingness among all the players to
look at a number of issues in the over-the-counter market,
particularly in the areas of transparency and disclosure,'' said
John Phillips, a spokesman for the commodities futures group.
</P>
<P>
   Brooksley Born, head of that commission, has angered key members
of Congress, other regulators and some of her fellow commissioners
by refusing to agree to delay possible new regulation of
derivatives until Congress is able to provide direction.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Anderson, a deputy assistant secretary of the Treasury,
said Wednesday that opposition to a commodities futures group
``concept release'' on swaps in May to study the situation was
based on legal analysis, not because the subject did not merit
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always agreed that there were important aspects of the
derivatives market that deserved study, and we are happy to be able
to address those questions in a format that does not increase legal
uncertainty,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   A partial moratorium on any rule-making on swaps has been
imposed by Congress until the end of March.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Lugar, R-Ind., who heads the Agriculture Committee, said
he found little evidence that the collapse of Long-Term Capital
Management was primarily attributable to its use of swaps. Rather,
Lugar contended, the problem was excessive leverage and lax lending
standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The LTCM affair may suggest the need for a regulatory
response,'' he said. ``Additional disclosure of information to
regulators may be appropriate. More prudent practices on the part
of lenders may also need to be encouraged or even required.''
</P>
<P>
   Lugar added, however, that banking agencies might be more
appropriate supervisors for new authority than the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, a tiny agency whose charter will
shortly be coming up for renewal.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his discussion of the Long-Term Capital case, Parkinson of
the Fed said that banks and other ``counterparties'' bore chief
responsibility for designing and carrying out needed improvements
in their lending after having been guilty of being overgenerous
with credit. He added that they failed to understand the hedge
fund's risk profile, which included large positions in illiquid
markets, and had relied too much on the fund's past performance and
the reputation of its partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nevertheless,'' he added, ``prudential overseers have a
responsibility to ensure that the processes that banks and
securities firms utilize to manage risk are commensurate with the
size and complexity of their portfolios and responsive to changes
in financial market conditions.''

GOLDMAN, SACHS TO BUY STAKE IN CHINA-OWNED COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. announced Wednesday that
it would enter a partnership with the government of Guangdong
Province in southern China to help rescue one of the region's
biggest state-owned companies.
</P>
<P>
   Guangdong said it had hired Goldman as a financial adviser. It
is the first instance of a foreign investment bank's working for a
provincial government in China. Goldman also said it would buy a
$20 million stake in Guangdong Enterprises Holdings, a state-owned
investment conglomerate based in Hong Kong, once the restructuring
is complete in six to eight months. The exact financing of a
revamped Guangdong Enterprises is not yet clear.
</P>
<P>
   The deal comes at a critical if muddled time in China's
slow-going financial reform. Frightened by Asia's economic crisis,
leaders in Beijing have lost their enthusiasm for fast reform of
their currency and stock markets. Still, China is proceeding with
an overhaul of its troubled banks and investment companies, seeking
to clear up mountains of bad debt before serious problems, like
those seen elsewhere in Asia, develop.
</P>
<P>
   Guangdong Province, the most affluent and free-wheeling area in
China, has been at the forefront of the nation's market reforms for
nearly 20 years. However, along with a creative interpretation of
socialist ideology has come lax supervision and an abundance of
questionable business dealings with government money, especially in
real estate speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, Beijing sent new political leaders to Guangdong
to try to rectify the situation. A crackdown on the extensive
smuggling operations in Guangdong has also aimed to restore
economic order.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Beijing sent a clear message that it would get
tougher with its investment companies when it closed down Guangdong
International Trust &AMP; Investment Co., which was unable to repay $2
billion in domestic and foreign loans.
</P>
<P>
   The closing signaled a shift away from largely outdated trust
company financing _ created in the days when Chinese banks offered
limited financial services _ and toward a more modern financial
system built around banks and capital markets.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's announcement appears to be another step in that
direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``To restructure so comprehensively a company like this is a
first for China,'' said Wang Qishan, Guangdong's executive vice
governor. A well-connected and aggressive political operator, he is
one of the leaders sent by Beijing to rein in errant financial
practices.
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong trading Wednesday, red-chip Guangdong Investment
Ltd. rose 4 cents to $1.65, or 21 cents (United States) after
Goldman announced it would take an equity stake in its parent,
Guangdong Enterprises Ltd.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the past, Chinese officials have been reluctant to hire
Western financial advisers, in part because of the culture of
secrecy that pervades government operations here.
</P>
<P>
   Investment bankers in Hong Kong noted that in 1995 when Wang was
president of the People's Construction Bank, he engineered China's
first joint-venture investment bank with Morgan Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   Wang also played a role in hiring Goldman to sell shares of
China Telecom on the New York Stock Exchange last year, a deal that
investment bankers said earned Goldman more than $80 million.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Goldman partners have agreed to put $20 million of their
own money into a company that will require an extensive
restructuring before it shows any return on investment. The
company, which operates in real estate, manufacturing and trading,
is deeply in debt and has been borrowing heavily in short-term
markets to stave off its creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman executives effectively admitted that the investment was
based on political as well as commercial intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not doing this to get a specific, targeted return,''
Henry M. Paulson Jr., Goldman's co-chief executive, said at a news
conference in Hong Kong. ``We're investing to signal our confidence
in Guangdong.''
</P>
<P>
   A major problem with state-owned holdings like Guangdong
Enterprises is that they have been managed by political appointees
who are typically more interested in personal gain and in greasing
their political connections than in making the companies
commercially viable.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chinese leaders are now trying to sell many small
unprofitable state-owned companies, current policy is still to keep
most large state-owned companies government-owned.
</P>
<P>
   A joint statement released Wednesday reflected the mix of
political and commercial challenges facing Goldman. It said that
the objective of the restructuring was to remake Guangdong
Enterprises into a financially independent entity, as well as to
demonstrate the Guangdong government's commitment to the
restructuring of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Goldman has been aggressively buying up assets
in several Asian countries, including debt in South Korea and
Thailand. A special unit devoted to buying large stakes in troubled
companies, called Goldman Sachs Merchant Bank, has operated both
for the bank and on behalf of clients.

SURROUNDED BY SUCCESS, VOLS ARE COMING UP SHORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The football team is celebrating a wondrous 12-0 season and
preparing to play for the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   The women's basketball team is coming off its third consecutive
national championship.
</P>
<P>
   So, what the heck's going on with Tennssee's men's basketball
team? The Volunteers were ranked No. 9 in The Associated Press
preseason poll, but they are on the ``early-season disappointment''
list, along with Xavier, Temple, and Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectations probably got to us a little bit,'' sophomore
point guard Tony Harris said. ``We figured teams were going to lay
down to us because we have the No. 9 ranking by our name. We
haven't been in the upper echelon \Rbefore\S. Now that we've got a
taste of how NCAA basketball is going to be, we know what to
expect.''
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers finished 20-9 last season under first-year coach
Jerry Green and made the NCAA Tournament. They returned all five
starters, added top recruit Vincent Yarbrough and welcomed the
return of frontcourt force Charles Hathaway, who missed most of
last season with an injury.
</P>
<P>
   But projecting teams' success in preseason is an inexact science
(and calling it a science gives too much credit to the people
making the predictions). However, it made sense to figure the
Volunteers would be one of this season's top teams. Didn't it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably everyone was looking at the way we were playing the
last eight or 10 games of last year and saying, `You've got a good
freshman coming in and a good post coming back, and you should be
good,' '' Green said. ``The problem is, we're not playing as well
as we were. Expectations are good on paper, but you've got to play
the game. We have a few people not playing as well as \Rthey did
last year\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Green didn't name names. But senior guard Brandon Wharton, in
particular, is struggling. He's averaging 9.3 points while shooting
30 percent from the field and 19 percent from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee is 6-3 and unranked. The Volunteers' three losses have
come against Arizona, Miami (Ohio) and St. Joseph's. All three of
the losses came on the road, which makes Saturday's game at 5-0
South Florida another potential pothole.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have as good a basketball team in terms of personnel as
there is in the country,'' South Florida coach Seth Greenberg said.
``They're one of the top 10 most talented teams, without a doubt.''
IN THE LANE CALHOUN: IT WAS PITT-IFUL
</P>
<P>
   There was more to Connecticut's great escape at Pittsburgh on
Saturday. The top-ranked Huskies scored five points in the final 10
seconds for their 70-69 victory. And that just stirred UConn's
emotions all the more.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun has filed a protest with the Big
East Conference regarding conditions at Fitzgerald Field House,
which is undergoing renovations. Calhoun claims there was no heat
in his team's locker room and that he and his players were pelted
with objects and racial slurs during the game.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut sophomore point guard Khalid El-Amin hit the winning
shot, then appeared to showboat when he jumped on the scorer's
table to taunt the Pitt student section. El-Amin was upset with
comments about his weight, his Muslim religion and his fathering a
second child that was born this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it out of a lot of frustration from the crowd,'' El-Amin
said. ``From them yelling things and throwing stuff. Emotion was
running high.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitt athletic director Steve Pederson disputes Calhoun's claims
about a frigid locker room and said he has not been able to confirm
Connecticut's claims of fan misconduct.
NOT IN GREEN BAY ANYMORE
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin, which held on to beat Texas on Tuesday night, is
ranked No. 23 in this week's Associated Press poll. For Badgers
coach Dick Bennett, it's the first time in 14 seasons he's had a
team ranked.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the best team I've coached,'' said Bennett, who
coached at Wisconsin-Green Bay and Wisconsin-Stevens Point before
coming to Madison. ``I've had a number of teams I felt were
stronger than this one, but they just weren't ranked. They don't
rank you if you're in Green Bay in basketball, no matter how good
you are.''
</P>
<P>
   The 10-1 Badgers have won eight in a row, with road victories
against Rhode Island and Temple in addition to their defeat of the
Longhorns. Wisconsin's only loss came to New Mexico State in the
Top of the World Classic last month.
AN AUBURN MAN
</P>
<P>
   Computer programmer and sports nut Jeff Sagarin got a lot of
attention during the football season. He was the man who crunched
the Bowl Championship Series strength-of-schedule numbers, and his
computer ratings were one of three used by the BCS.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Sagarin's basketball rankings _ which first brought him to
the attention of the sporting public _ are causing a stir. His No.
1 team in this week's rankings isn't Connecticut or Duke or
Kentucky. It's Auburn, which is 9-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't watch that much basketball,'' Sagarin said. ``I
haven't seen Auburn play, but from doing this over the years, I bet
they are a very good team to have such a good rating after nine
games.''
STUDENT OF THE GAME
</P>
<P>
   Arizona reserve guard Josh Pastner is scheduled to graduate
Saturday and then fly to Las Vegas to join the Wildcats for their
game against Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   Pastner, a walk-on from Kingwood High, near Houston, completed
his degree requirements in family studies in just 2 1/2years. He
wants to become a coach, and he zipped through school so he could
``show prospective employers that he is able to accomplish whatever
he set his mind to.''
FREE THROWS QUOTABLE
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State junior point guard Mateen Cleaves, on his
early-season struggles that have been a factor in the Spartans' 6-3
start:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not playing Mateen Cleaves basketball right now. My game
is going to come in time, and when it does, we're going to be an
awfully tough team to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona coach Lute Olson on his team's No. 8 ranking in The
Associated Press poll:
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, in my opinion, we're not in the top 40. To rate us
in the Top 10 is an absolute joke. We're not anywhere close to
that. From the tapes I've seen, I think we're fifth in the
Pac-10.''
</P>
<P>
   Indiana coach Bob Knight, ever the comic when it comes to his
friends in the media, discussing reporters' academic credentials
when asked about the Hoosiers' weeklong break for finals:
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think you ever had to take a final in journalism, did
you? You just had to spell your name and they passed you. I just
wanted to throw that out about finals for those of you who are
unfamiliar with them.''
BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   Coppin State, better known as America's Guest, is again playing
a difficult nonconference schedule. The Eagles ``stopped by'' their
home facility Saturday and Monday for Mid-Eastern Athletic
Conference games. That was after playing _ and losing _ their first
seven games on the road. Coppin State plays at Kansas State on
Monday, the first of five more road games. Coppin's next home game
is Jan. 9.
</P>
<P>
   When George Washington played DePaul on Dec. 6, St. John's coach
Mike Jarvis showed up to watch the team he used to coach. When his
successor, former Texas coach Tom Penders, was ejected with just
over nine minutes remaining, a fan yelled, ``Mike Jarvis, come on
down.''

HAPPY SOLSTICE! ATHEIST TO PUT SIGN NEXT TO COURTHOUSE NATIVITY
SCENE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By EVAN MOORE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEATHERFORD, Texas _ The only recognized atheist in town has
scored a victory with an agreement that allows him to place a pagan
sign next to the Nativity scene in front of the county courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Hogan, a retiree in this town west of Fort Worth, is a
member and former state director of the American Atheists Inc., a
group founded by Madalyn Murray O'Hair prior to her disappearance
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan sued Parker County two years ago over its display of the
Christmas manger scene.
</P>
<P>
   That lawsuit was settled recently with the stipulation that
Hogan be allowed to erect a sign beside the display, stating:
``Happy Winter Solstice, the REAL reason for the season!''
</P>
<P>
   The winter solstice marks the time when the sun travels in its
lowest arc across the horizon and results in the shortest day of
the year. It usually falls on Dec. 21 in the Northern Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   The sign refers to a ritual staged by some ancient religions to
honor sun gods and encourage the sun to return and warm the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan plans to put up the sign Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I guess we'll see how long it stays up there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The county was joined by the Young Business Leaders of Parker
County in efforts to fend off the atheist's lawsuit, which was
filed in federal district court in Fort Worth. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The three parties met in an open forum recently and the county
consented to Hogan's sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something I necessarily agreed with personally and I
expect there will be some folks highly offended by this,'' said
Parker County Judge Dan Long.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, I agreed to uphold the law when I took this position
and he had the law on his side.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogan said he knows of one other supporter in the largely
Christian county, ``but I'm the only one who's out of the closet,
so to speak.''

 &HT;    U.S. LAUNCHES AIR STRIKES AGAINST IRAQ
 &HT;    With US-IRAQ-1217, US-MILITARY-1217-1STLD,
CLINTON-WAGTHEDOG-1217-1STLD.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. and British forces launched massive air
strikes on Iraqi military and communications sites late Wednesday,
as President Clinton said patience had run out on Baghdad's secret
efforts to build chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ''Iraq has abused its final chance,'' Clinton said in a
televised Oval Office address announcing the strikes, as U.S. B-52
bombers, F-16 fighters and warships at sea loosed more than 100
cruise missiles on Iraqi targets.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq responded with sporadic anti-aircraft fire, but as of late
Wednesday U.S. officials reported no American casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the operation, dubbed ''Desert Fox,'' would consist
of ''a strong, sustained series of air strikes,'' expected to
continue day and night at least until the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is to diminish Iraq's weapons production capability and
to strike hard at the heart of the Iraqi military, the backbone of
President Saddam Hussein's two-decade grip on power in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   In response, House Republicans postponed debate that was
scheduled to begin Thursday on whether to impeach Clinton on
charges stemming from the Monica Lewinsky sex-and-deception
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials denied any link between the two events,
and Clinton said the controversy has not divided the nation on
security issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was not a factor in the president's decision,'' White
House National Security Adviser Samuel E. ``Sandy'' Berger told
reporters. ''This is an action taken by the president solely on the
basis of his best judgment of what is in the national security
interest of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Girding Americans against the images of civilian deaths, Clinton
cautioned that ''there will be unintended Iraqi casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar strikes that were planned but not executed against Iraq
last month could have killed several thousand Iraqi civilians,
according to Pentagon estimates, and Berger said the strikes that
began Wednesday night would be ''no less than what we had
contemplated in November.''
</P>
<P>
   Without referring to specific estimates on such deaths, Clinton
said, ''We must be prepared for these realities.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement to the Iraqi people, President Saddam Hussein
said several targets had been struck in Iraq. He also accused the
United States and Britain of cowardice for using long-range
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's strikes were another step in eight years of U.S.
efforts to contain Iraq's military ambitions. The attack capped a
year-long standoff between the Clinton administration and Saddam
over the issue of Iraq's efforts to build and hide weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ''Saddam Hussein must not be allowed to threaten his neighbors,
or the world, with nuclear weapons, poison gas or biological
weapons,'' Clinton said. ''Other countries possess weapons of mass
destruction . . . with Saddam, there is one big difference: he has
used them.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Clinton, ''left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will use these
terrible weapons again.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from Iraq's weapons, Clinton made clear that the military
might that props up Saddam's regime is also being targeted, in the
hope of weakening his ability to retain control.
</P>
<P>
   ''The hard fact is that so long as Saddam remains in power he
threatens the well-being of his people, the peace of his region,
the security of the world,'' Clinton said. ''The best way to end
that threat once and for all is with a new Iraqi government.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of his surrender to U.S.-led coalition forces
following the Persian Gulf War in 1991, Saddam agreed to dismantle
his weapons of mass destruction program and to permit U.N.
inspectors to verify his compliance with that promise.
</P>
<P>
   Twice this year -- in February and again in November -- Clinton
has arrayed massive force against Iraq and threatened air strikes
after Saddam so impeded U.N. inspections teams that they were
unable to effectively do their work.
</P>
<P>
   After the latest showdown, on November 15 and 16, Saddam
promised to cooperate fully with the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, he's continued to obstruct them, according
to a report filed Wednesday with the United Nations by Richard
Butler, chief of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM), charged with
overseeing the inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ''In short, the inspectors are saying that, even if they could
stay in Iraq, their work would be a sham,'' Clinton said. ''Instead
of the inspectors disarming Saddam, Saddam has disarmed the
inspectors.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq disputed that assessment, saying Clinton was determined to
strike Iraq and was trumping up a crisis to justify it.
</P>
<P>
   ''During the last three weeks, there has been about 300
visits,'' by UNSCOM inspectors, Iraq's ambassador to the United
Nations, Nizar Hamdoon, told reporters in New York. ''Iraq has done
its best to try to meet the obligations and try to satisfy both
UNSCOM and the
</P>
<P>
   IAEA,'' referring to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the
U.N. arm that has been inspecting Iraq's alleged efforts to acquire
nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said it was important to strike quickly in the face of
the UNSCOM report, to prevent Iraq from taking evasive and
defensive measures, as it has in the past, to mitigate the effects
of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   While stopping short of condemning the attacks, U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan expressed frustration and grief over them. He
stressed Iraq's humanitarian needs and made no mention of Saddam's
record of UNSCOM impedance.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a sad day for the United Nations, and for the world,''
he told reporters at U.N. headquarters in New York. ''My thoughts
tonight are with the people of Iraq and with the 307 United Nations
humanitarian workers who remain in the country and all others whose
lives are in danger.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the United
States had the support, in the U.N. Security Council and in the
international community at large, it needed to conduct the strikes,
and she dismissed the suggestion that the attack had been launched
with unnecessary haste.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States did no go looking for this fight,'' Albright
told reporters. ''We have explored and exhausted every diplomatic
option.''

MANY WOULD BE GLAD TO SEE CLINTON RESIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At the Resignation.com website, you can chat about
the president's future, read Richard Nixon's resignation speech,
order ``Gore 1998'' T-shirts for $16 apiece, and enter a contest by
predicting the date and time of Bill Clinton's self-imposed
departure from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The winner,'' said Arianna Huffington, the conservative
commentator and resignation advocate who set up the website in
September, ``gets a free trip to wherever Clinton decides to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Games aside, the idea of President Clinton resigning is no joke.
This week, senior House Republicans, including majority whip Tom
DeLay and Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, have called on
the president to step down and spare the nation what they say could
be a protracted and paralyzing Senate trial in the wake of a House
vote to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could really be heroic if he did that,'' Hyde said Sunday
on ``Face the Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, traveling in Israel at the time, immediately rejected
the suggestion. He said he had ``no intention'' of resigning and,
in fact, the notion had not even crossed his mind. But surveys show
that it is on Americans' minds. In a Washington Post poll conducted
over the weekend, 58 percent of respondents said they believed the
president should resign if the House voted to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   Other polls this week have showed weaker public support for
resignation, though in all of them, a majority of Americans
register their fear that putting the president on trial in the
Senate would be bad for the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a great gift for the nation if the president gave
it a Monica-free 1999,'' said Huffington, who has collected more
than 100,000 names on a resignation petition on her website, which
she said has been ``phenomenally busy'' this week.
</P>
<P>
   Huffington said Wednesday's presidential order of US airstrikes
on Iraq, challenged by Republicans as timed to thwart impeachment,
is an example of why Clinton has to do the ``selfless thing'' and
resign. ``We live in too dangerous an international environment to
have decisions of the commander in chief second-guessed,''
Huffington said.
</P>
<P>
   Calls for the president's resignation began in January, after
his extramarital affair with former White House intern Monica S.
Lewinsky became public, and they intensified in newspaper
editorials and political circles after he testified before
independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr's grand jury, and then gave a
much criticized speech to the nation in August.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats see a strategic calculation by Republicans in
raising the volume on resignation now. To woo wavering moderates,
Hyde and other Republicans on the Judiciary Committee downplayed
the House's role in removing the president from office. Now that a
vote in favor of one or more articles of impeachment appears within
reach, House leaders are pressing the president to quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a coup d'etat by impeachment,'' said former
Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis. ``Republicans have been
gunning for this guy, and it drives them crazy that he not only is
president, but that he remains very popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing Clinton should do is resign,'' Dukakis said.
``It's preposterous, just like the charge the president committed
an impeachable offense is preposterous.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who would sit in judgment of the
president in a Senate trial, agrees. ``It's absolutely imperative
that he resist this call and that he remain in office,'' Kennedy
said. ``It's enormously important from a constitutional point of
view and because of the nature of the charges against him.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, President Nixon resigned before the full House voted on
articles of impeachment. In 1868, Andrew Johnson, the only
president impeached by the House, fought against the odds and for
his job, and was acquitted after a Senate trial by one vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a historical perspective, it is possible to fight it out
and change your legacy,'' said Allan Lichtman, a history professor
at American University. ``History may record a process that was
vicious, partisan, and mean-spirited, and Clinton could emerge not
as a disgraced president but as a comeback kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Senator Alan Simpson, a Wyoming Republican, sat through
what he said were two ``numbing'' Senate trials of federal judges
who were impeached. Simpson said a Clinton trial could take months
and prevent the Senate from accomplishing anything else. Yet he
doesn't expect that to carry much weight with the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody who has followed this tragic story knows that this
man is constitutionally incapable of resigning,'' said Simpson, who
now directs the Institute of Politics at Harvard's Kennedy School
of Government. ``They could put him on the rack, they could begin
the tortures of Salem on him, but they should know there is
something in the extraordinarily complex DNA of Bill Clinton that
won't let him resign.''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson recalled it was Republican Senator Barry Goldwater who
visited Nixon and told him that for the good of the country, he had
to quit. Simpson does not believe any Democratic senator has that
kind of relationship or leverage with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton is brilliant and remarkable, but his whole pattern is
never to put his state or his country above himself,'' Simpson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Reich, Clinton's former Labor secretary and now a
professor at Brandeis University, said a significant difference
between Nixon and Clinton is that Nixon had been abandoned not only
by his party but also by the American people. Clinton's approval
rating hasn't wavered in months; it is above 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a terrible precedent for the president to be
hounded out of office when a majority of the public supports what
he is doing,'' said Reich, noting he ``doesn't believe for a
moment'' Clinton will step down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been in tight spots before, and this is definitely his
hardest challenge,'' Reich said. ``But few mortals have managed
like he to wiggle out of or escape more difficult straitjackets.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House has argued against impeachment by warning that a
Senate trial would cause turmoil. Nevertheless, several senators
have suggested the Constitution requires them to carry through with
a trial and not cut a censure deal with the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``All bets are off if this goes to the Senate,'' said pollster
John Zogby, who is tracking public opinion on impeachment. ``I
don't think time is on the president's side. The more people want
this whole thing to go away, the closer we get to reaching the
unthinkable _ that Clinton won't finish his term.''

FATAL BRAIN MALADY NOT `MAD COW DISEASE,' OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A Massachusetts woman who died recently of a brain
malady called Creutzfeld-Jakob disease had the classic form of the
disorder normally seen in North America and not the European
variant popularly known as ``mad cow disease,'' state health
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The family of the deceased patient, a Taunton woman in her
seventies, had asked health officials whether her case might
represent the first case of mad cow disease on this side of the
Atlantic. But officials said the case fits the pattern of classic
Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, or CJD, which results in six to eight
deaths a year in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alfred DeMaria, the state's chief of communicable diseases,
said classic CJD is readily distinguishable from the variant linked
in Britain and France to ingestion of beef from animals with a
similar disorder called bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE.
</P>
<P>
   ``The variant form of CJD has more gradual onset of symptoms, it
involves people under the age of 50, and its course unfolds over a
period of 12 to 14 months rather than the six to eight months of
classic CJD,'' DeMaria said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Classic CJD begins with movement disorders and symptoms of
dementia, such as memory loss and confusion, which worsen rapidly.
The European variant initially causes psychiatric and behavioral
abnormalities with gradual onset.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 30 cases of the European variant have been reported,
most in Britain. Their emergence led to wholesale
government-ordered slaughter of cattle and export restrictions on
British beef to curtail any possible spread.
</P>
<P>
   Classic CJD arises spontaneously in individual patients due to a
mutant protein which builds up in the brain, causing sponge-like
holes in the brain. It is not transmitted from one person to
another except in unusual circumstances, such as from contamination
of surgical instruments used in brain or eye surgery. Some patients
contracted the disease from injections of growth hormone derived
from human pituitary glands, but that form of the hormone has been
supplanted by a genetically engineered drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been monitoring CJD back to 1990, and have found no
trend in terms of age or rate of disease that would be of any
concern,'' DeMaria added.
</P>
<P>
   The US Centers for Disease Control has alerted states to watch
for any cases that might suggest the appearance of variant CJD on
this continent, but so far none have emerged, DeMaria said.
</P>
<P>
   Two research groups since the 1980s have documented CJD among
individuals in Texas and Kentucky who ate squirrel meat, including
brains. Unlike cattle, however, squirrels are not known to suffer a
brain equivalent to human CJD.

ON CAPITOL HILL, ANGER AND SKEPTICISM OVER A CLASH OF 2 CRISES 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By Benjamin Franklin's definition that impeachment
is the political equivalent of assassination, President Clinton's
defenders scrambled for a stay of execution on Wednesday _ a
breathlessly chaotic day on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers arriving back for the special impeachment debate
session found a new crisis logo on the House's perpetually running
cable news screens _ ``Showdown With Iraq'' _ and a Republican
leadership faced with a fresh theme of whether to display patriotic
nonpartisanship in support of the president even as they planned to
impeach him and see him tried in the Senate as a perjurer and a
lawbreaker.
</P>
<P>
   Military rockets deliverable upon Saddam Hussein, not
pro-impeachment votes aimed at Bill Clinton, were suddenly being
accounted for in portentous bulletins across the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you believe this?'' was the question of the day among
veteran political operatives in both parties as the House was
forced to postpone its impeachment debate because of the attack on
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The television screens in congressional offices were lime green
with nightscope views of Baghdad as members moved down to party
conferences whose impeachment agendas were pushed aside by the
strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers bristled with questions, anger, doubt about the
traumatic mixing of the two crises.
</P>
<P>
   The ire of Republicans was clear when, an hour before Clinton's
attack order was announced, Rep. Gerald Solomon of upstate New
York, the Rules Committee chairman, stormed out to the television
broadcast cluster by the East Capitol lawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obvious that he is doing this for political reasons, and
I and others are outraged,'' Solomon boomed furiously in denouncing
the president and his administration. ``They deliberately ignored
the Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Returning lawmakers were stunned at the braiding of the Iraq
attack with the impeachment drive. Republicans were angrily
skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't stop elections even in the face of world wars,'' said
Rep. James Rogan of California, balking at the very idea of
postponing the dis-election process of impeachment because ``some
dictator jerks our chain.''
</P>
<P>
   The Capitol's day was bifurcated, with the Iraq issue descending
like a giant theater scrim on the stage center of impeachment.
Beyond the scrim, returning Republicans continued to hold separate
pro-impeachment news conferences, sounding a domestic drumbeat
through the day in counterpoint to the war anxieties. But their
views seemed to pale, if only momentarily, against the president's
agenda of military action.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican moderate, Sherwood Boehlert of upstate New York,
looked anguished as he announced his ``almost unbearably sad
conclusion'' to turn to impeachment ``as a shield, not a sword''
against Clinton and his misbehavior. ``He has tried repeatedly to
game the judicial system,'' the eight-term congressman declared,
his tone pained, his pace elegiacal as reporters waited to shout
questions about Iraq at him.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Capitol, returning members seem chilled at the
impeachment ordeal's being compounded by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, I don't know,'' one congressman, Michael Pappas,
R-N.J., admitted with a look of stricken candor when asked whether
the nation could handle the two crises side by side.
</P>
<P>
   The focus was blurred for the returning lawmakers. Standing
outside the Capitol in sweater and slacks, Rep. Melvin Watt,
D-N.C., shook his head at the overlapping crises and slowly
observed, ``Nothing about this year can be surprising to me
anymore.'' He vowed to find an ``even keel'' in all this and headed
up the steps into the Capitol, quietly observing, ``This, too,
shall pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans sensed a fresh chess piece in the president's hand,
and cried foul. A new political cliche swept the Capitol _ the
notion of Democrats' somehow ``running out the impeachment clock''
on the waning 105th Congress by lancing one crisis with another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so disappointed at all this,'' Rep. Maxine Waters,
D-Calif., said as she headed up the Capitol's steps, then spotted
some visiting schoolchildren. ``Students, come join me and help
fight impeachment!'' she yelled, commandeering a television camera
in the spirit of the makeshift that haunted the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``What channel? What channel?'' they asked her, crowding about
like mice to the piper as the day waxed frenetic. By the end of the
day, it was every channel.
</P>
<P>
   As the Republicans gathered Wednesday night for a grim meeting
in Room HC-5, impeachment was supposed to be the sole topic. But
the White House was seizing the day with announcements of the
attack and of a presidential address to the nation. Impeachment
seemed to be slipping onto hold as the lawmakers moved past the
glass Capitol doorways looking west down the Mall, where Christmas
lights blinked festively in the crisis-steeped night.

   The New York Times News Service will move the following
entertainment/arts articles this week for release Sunday, Dec. 20,
1998. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS (Moved in `e' category)
</P>
<P>
   FEATURE story &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TAYMOR-TITUS-FILM (Rome) _ The vast white marble piazza before
the Palazzo della Civilta del Lavoro, is a solemn building of
marble arches that looms over EUR, the grandiose exhibition park
Mussolini ordered built in the 1930s to fuse Roman Empire and
Fascist might. And that was what drew the theater director Julie
Taymor to select it as a site for ``Titus,'' her film adaptation of
Shakespeare's tragedy ``Titus Andronicus.'' Whatever its quality is
eventually judged to be, this is no ordinary venture. It is Ms.
Taymor's first feature film, with a starry cast headed by Anthony
Hopkins in the title role, Jessica Lange and Alan Cumming. This is
Ms. Taymor's first major venture since her extraordinary success
last year with Disney's ``Lion King'' _ a show that she transformed
with her direction, design and musical choices from a potentially
potted theatricalization of a cartoon movie into Broadway's biggest
hit. By Alessandra Stanley. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-UNDERSTANDING (Undated) _ Present an unfamiliar piece of
music to a randomly chosen audience member, ask an opinion, and I
challenge you to get a simple expository sentence in response. The
body language will be one of retreat; the words will be quick to
equivocate. ``That was interesting,'' or ``I didn't understand it,
but maybe I will next time,'' or ``I should know more about it
before I tell you what I think.'' One longs to hear, ``That was
beautiful,'' or ``I hated it,'' or ``It bored me to death,'' for
this is what those answers really mean. The crucial word here is
``understand,'' for the fear of not understanding is great. Failing
to understand marks the unhappy listener as dense, out of the loop,
ill educated. By Bernard Holland. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   FILM AND VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   GEENA-DAVIS-FILMS (Los Angeles) _ The Academy Award-winning
actress Geena Davis is back, or at least working at a comeback
after a two-year hiatus and a divorce. And she has made it clear
that she is willing to play just about anything _ except a
weakling. Her new movie ``Stuart Little,'' based on E.B. White's
classic 1945 children's book about a family whose new son turns out
to be a mouse, symbolizes the critical juncture where Ms. Davis,
who is 41, stands. By James Sterngold. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BRITISH-FILMS (Undated) _ This week, five films that can
legitimately be described as British will be showing in American
theaters. Given the anxiety of holiday marketers, that number is in
itself an eye-popper. What's more surprising, though, is that not
one of these British films is about expendable laborers trying to
salvage self-regard in a renovated upland city, or about young
professionals contemplating themselves in the sleek surfaces of the
new London. These films _ ``Elizabeth,'' ``Little Voice,''
``Shakespeare in Love,'' ``The General'' and ``The Theory of
Flight'' _ don't represent anything as grand as the renaissance of
a national industry that looked so healthy in the 1960s and then
again in the 1980s. By Will Joyner. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   GLEESON-GENERAL-FILM (Dublin, Ireland) _ Brendan Gleeson bears
an uncanny resemblance to Martin Cahill, the maverick Dublin
gangland boss whom he plays in John Boorman's new movie, ``The
General,'' which opened Friday in New York. Yet there was another,
more subtle, reason for casting the burly Irish actor as the
mobster. In order to convey why Dubliners came to admire this
hardened criminal, murdered by the IRA in 1994, Boorman needed a
likable Cahill. And Gleeson is very likable. But he also has what
the veteran director calls ``essential goodness,'' which is why he
almost turned down his biggest movie role to date. By Alan Riding.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   DANCE
</P>
<P>
   ISADORA-DUNCAN-BOOK (Undated) _ Earlier this year, a conference
of dance scholars retired from a long day's meeting to an oyster
house, where the oyster lovers set out to seduce the skeptics into
sampling the delicacy. A quotation from the modern dancer Isadora
Duncan's autobiography, ``My Life,'' persuaded the final holdout.
``You know what Isadora wrote, don't you?'' said a clever
historian. ``That she began to dance in her mother's womb, in
response to her mother's diet of oysters and champagne, the food of
Aphrodite.'' ``My Life'' turns 71 this month, a lifetime much
longer than that of its author. By Ann Daly. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   CLASSICAL
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIAN-SINGERS (Undated) _ Not since the czarist era have
Russian singers attained the unfettered mainstream exposure they
currently enjoy, once more regularly appearing in Western opera
houses and signing contracts with major record labels. Perhaps the
most conspicuous example of their resurgence can be found on the
Philips label, on which the indefatigable conductor Valery Gergiev
spearheads a seemingly endless series of Russian operas, including
many obscure works. Largely as a result of his efforts, several
soloists have emerged as stars in their own right, including the
soprano Galina Gorchakova, the mezzo-soprano Olga Borodina and, to
a lesser extent, the baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky. By David
Mermelstein. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MAHLER-MUSIC (Undated) _ The Philharmonic, the answer came back,
was holding the big gun in reserve, hoping to follow with a set
consisting entirely of Mahler's music. Now that release has
impressively materialized on 12 CDs as ``The Mahler Broadcasts,
1948-82'' (NYP 9801/12), and the obvious question becomes: Among
the 10 conductors represented, why no Bernstein? Leonard Bernstein,
after all, though he did not single-handedly revive the
Philharmonic's Mahler tradition, as is often supposed, certainly
took it to its loftiest heights in a series of performances
throughout his tenure as music director, from 1958 to 1969, and
beyond. Again, the Philharmonic is quick to reply. Bernstein's
omission, it turns out, is not for lack of trying. Sedgwick Clark,
the set's producer, explains in booklet notes that of all the
Mahler works the maestro performed with the Philharmonic, all but
two are represented among Bernstein's commercial recordings with
the orchestra, which remain in more or less continual circulation.
By James R. Oestreich. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   DVORAK-MUSIC (Undated) _ Big and powerful are adjectives that
spring to mind when listening to the Eroica Trio, but a more pithy
description might be intelligent. The group's second recording,
``Dvorak: Piano Trio Dumky'' (EMI 7243 5 56673 2), represents
thoughtful music making of a high caliber. By Anne Midgette.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ART
</P>
<P>
   SUBWAY-ART (Los Angeles) _ When the Red Line subway station on
the corner of Beverly Boulevard and Vermont Avenue opens here next
year, the first thing commuters will see is a giant escarpment of
sandy-colored rock that straddles the entrance tunnel. The
sculpture, by George Stone, was commissioned by the Metropolitan
Transit Authority to enliven this station. What Stone calls his
``art rocks'' _ three more hang from the roof of the pristine,
marble-floored station below _ are part of one of the most
imaginative public art programs in the country. By David Hay.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BODY-XRAYS-ART (Undated) _ The Julie Saul Gallery in Manhattan
has had the piquant idea of displaying together early medical
X-rays and more recent works of art that borrow from X-rays and
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The exhibition, ``Skin/Deep: A
Survey of Interior Imaging From X-Ray to MRI'' (through Jan. 16),
assembles approximately 40 images from 1896 to the 1990s _ not
exactly a survey but proof once more of how eager art has been to
pilfer from the treasury of science and how readily scientific
images seen in an art context assume some of the characteristics of
art. By Vicki Goldberg. (Moved).

   CHINA-CHU-ART (Paris) _ In the fifth century B.C., Confucius
questioned the practice of burying people alive alongside the dead
in funerary rituals, calling it a waste of human life. But it was
not until 100 years later that the Chu people of Southern China
abandoned human sacrifice, replacing the living in such rituals
with carved and lacquered wooden figures. Chu artists produced
haunting effigies of concubines, slaves, deer and tigers, all
common in the retinues of Chinese rulers during the late Warring
States period (fourth century to third century B.C.) and the Han
Dynasty (206 B.C. to 220 A.D.). A large number of Chu works have
been excavated over the past 20 years, and recently such works have
become more visible in the market. The Chu figures are now both the
subject of scholarly study and are being actively collected by
museums. By Rita Reif. (Moved).

NETANYAHU GOES ON THE OFFENSIVE IN CALLING FOR EARLY ELECTIONS 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu endorsed
early elections Wednesday in a bid to escape the prospect that he
would lose a crucial vote of no confidence next week in the
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's bold move put him on the offensive against his
political foes. It also effectively put the U.S.-brokered Wye River
peace agreement, which mandates more transfers of West Bank land to
the Palestinians, on hold for an election campaign that could last
several months.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials were angered by the move. ``He had to
choose between maintaining himself as the prime minister,
maintaining his coalition or maintaining the peace process,''
Palestinian senior negotiator Saeb Erekat told Reuters.
``Unfortunately, he chose to sacrifice the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite frantic back-room negotiations, it appeared that
Netanyahu was having difficulty mustering the 61 votes needed in
the 120-seat Parliament both to defeat the no-confidence motion and
to kill an opposition bill for new elections.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition Labor Party officials said they had enough votes to
win either motion.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu presented what he called principals for peace, which
included past demands. Palestinians, he said, must renounce
aspirations for statehood and a capital in east Jerusalem. They
must also accept the prisoners Israel releases, stop inciting
violence against Israelis, seize all illegal weapons in
Palestinian-controlled areas and reduce the ranks of the
Palestinian police force.
</P>
<P>
   Any politician who accepted these principles, he said, was
welcome to join his government.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that by setting out a list of principles likely to
please right-wing members of his government, Netanyahu may be able
to keep his disintegrating coalition together for the no-confidence
vote. Those members have threatened to withdraw support if
Netanyahu complies with the Wye River accord and transfers more
West Bank land to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say now from the start, if there isn't the necessary
majority to support these principles, I will call for early
elections in order to get from the people the necessary mandate to
achieve a real peace,'' Netanyahu said. ``We are walking this road
with deep conviction that there is no other way to reach peace with
security and reciprocity.''
</P>
<P>
   Ehud Barak, leader of the opposition Labor Party, which had been
supporting Netanyahu on votes crucial to furthering peacemaking
with the Palestinians, said his party had no plans to join
Netanyahu's government in a unity coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of a (coalition) can be created with a government
that gives in to extremists, ruins the economy and ruins the
society?'' Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu said that he would present the list of principles to
his coalition Sunday and to the Parliament on Monday, the day on
which the motion of no-confidence was expected to be debated.
</P>
<P>
   His problems worsened Wednesday when his finance minister,
Yaakov Neeman, resigned. Neeman said the ruling coalition had
ceased functioning, ``the public coffers are no longer guarded, and
every legislator, faction or party acts as if they are his own.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, at least three members of Netanyahu's own Likud Party _
former Science Minister Benny Begin, former Finance Minister Dan
Meridor and Michael Kleiner, who heads a extra-parliamentary group
called the Land of Israel Front _ said they favored holding early
elections. And the leadership of a centrist coalition party, the
Third Way, said its members were also likely to vote for new
elections.
</P>
<P>
   By calling for new elections, Netanyahu can avoid an appearance
of weakness, analysts said. Moreover, he, not his political foes,
would be able to decide the date for the elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``This way, he's setting the time, he's in control,'' said
Reuven Hazan, a political analyst at Jerusalem's Hebrew University.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quicker he calls for elections, the more he catches them
off guard,`` Hazan said. ``He doesn't want to look like elections
were thrust upon him at a time that was quite uncomfortable for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   If Netanyahu can make a deal with Labor, together they can
choose the election date, possibly as early as the end of April.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, by setting out principles for peacemaking with the
Palestinians, he might be able to pull disgruntled right-wingers
back into the fold. And, if elections do take place, he has set out
a platform of ``tough peacemaking'' that could appeal to the
political center, the analysts said. And, he shifts blame for the
failure of the peace agreement to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Yet by going to new elections, Netanyahu is taking a risk. The
latest opinion polls suggest Netanyahu is trailing Barak by 44
percent to 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Against another politician, former army chief of staff Amnon
Lipkin-Shahak, Netanyahu trailed 52 percent to 35 percent

IRAQ ATTACK SHIFTS COVERAGE   OFF IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A nation anticipating, or resigned to, an
additional burst of impeachment stories Wednesday instead saw TV
screens awash with reports about the US military strike on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   For viewers, the sudden switch in focus may have evoked memories
of Jan. 22, the day the White House sex scandal broke. Amid much
advance ballyhoo, major network news anchors had gathered in Cuba
to cover the pope's unprecedented visit, but when the scandal
broke, the anchors quickly redeployed to Washington. That began a
year of unrelenting media focus on the Monica Lewinsky case that
Wednesday gave way to the reality of combat.
</P>
<P>
   For TV and newspaper reporters already scrambling to keep up
with the fast-moving story of a possible presidential impeachment,
the military action meant a swift change in plans. ``We're on a
dual track now, covering both,'' said NBC News reporter Gwen Ifill.
``The reporters are just trying to keep all the balls in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Many out-of-town reporters and camera crews had arrived here to
cover the House impeachment debate, but found themselves reporting
instead about the military action to their viewers back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, it's two stories, and reporters have double-duty,'' said
Keith Plummer, chief photographer for Hearst-Argyll Television, as
he unloaded cameras from the back of a van outside the Capitol.
``There's just so much going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer set up extra cameras at sites near the House and Senate
sides of the Capitol, gathering live-shots for the evening news
packages of local newscasts in the Hearst-Argyll chain. NBC Senate
producer Roberta Hornig, who makes daily calls to congressional
leaders and key members to gauge the prospects for impeachment,
Wednesday expanded her must-call list to include members of the
Foreign Relations and Intelligence committees. To each member of
Congress she reached, she asked questions about impeachment and the
hostilities in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's two stories now,'' said Hornig. ``You have to cover
them both, and see how they relate.''
</P>
<P>
   A news conference held by Senator John F. Kerry illustrated the
new duality. Kerry announced his support for the Clinton
administration's decision to use force in Iraq, but reporters also
peppered him with questions on whether the military action was
related to the threat of impeachment hanging over President
Clinton's head, and whether Kerry believes there might be 67 votes
in the Senate to convict Clinton if the House votes to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike during the beginning of the Gulf War in 1991, CNN was not
the only network in Baghdad Wednesday. CNN military affairs
reporter Jamie McIntyre reported details of the military strike
Wednesday at 5:02 p.m., shortly before it occurred. A spokeswoman
Wednesday night indicated the network did so only after concluding
it would not jeopardize the mission. ``We have a policy of total
prohibition against going on the air with anything that could
jeopardize people's lives,'' said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   If the public is weary of the impeachment saga, as poll after
poll suggests, the same is true of some reporters on Capitol Hill
who came to work Wednesday expecting to see at least the beginning
of the end of the story that has dominated their work lives all
year.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted a twinge of sympathy from one Capitol Hill staff
member as she watched reporters scurrying around. ``You work and
work and work, and you think the story is going to come to some
resolution, but it just goes on and on,'' she said.

CONGRESS SUPPORTS ATTACK, BUT TIMING DIVIDES REPUBLICANS
</HEADLINE>
   (htv) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans in Congress were bitterly divided
Wednesday night over the timing of the air strikes against Iraq,
and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott fiercely attacked President
Clinton's policy.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After a meeting with House Republicans, Rep. Bob Livingston of
Louisiana, the speaker-designate, called on Republicans and
Democrats ``to support our troops now that they're deployed.'' But
clearly skeptical of the timing of the attack, Livingston said,
``we'll leave that to the best judgment of the American people.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who is on the Armed Services
Committee, said if Clinton acts decisively, he will win public
support.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there will be those who will question his motives
and timing,'' said McCain. ``He will receive significant support
because it's pretty obvious that Saddam Hussein is neither
complying nor cooperating'' with international arms inspectors.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But in an extraordinary rebuke of the president's foreign
policy, Lott, stood virtually alone in opposing the air assault on
suspected Iraqi chemical, nuclear and biological weapons sites,
arguing that the attacks were ineffective. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot support this military action in the Persian Gulf at
this time,'' Lott said in a statement, infuriating the White House.
``Both the timing and the policy are subject to question.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For months, Lott has criticized the administration for failing
to take more aggressive steps to topple Saddam. Under pressure from
Congress, Clinton enacted the Iraq Liberation Act in October, which
earmarked $8 million to support Iraqi political opposition. But in
a letter to Clinton on Wednesday, Lott and five other Senate
Republicans said only $58,000 of that money has been spent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I will support serious and sustained action but will oppose
action that does not accomplish our larger strategic goal,'' Lott
said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But even as Lott raised objections, House Republicans were
planning to vote Thursday on a resolution of support for the troops
in the Persian Gulf.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The core of the debate among Republicans, who were suddenly
chastened by the spectacle of impeaching the commander-in-chief
while he launched one of the biggest military strikes since the
1991 Persian Gulf War, was over the timing and motivations behind
the aerial bombardment that began on Wednesday night.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious they're trying to do everything they can to
postpone the vote in order to get as much leverage as they can,''
said Rep. Gerald Solomon of New York, a former marine who is
chairman of the House Rules Committee, said on CNN. ``For him to do
this at this unbelievable time is just outrageous.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Solomon, who is retiring this year, issued a press release
entitled, ``Bombs Away _ Save Impeachment for Another Day?''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tillie Fowler of Florida, the fifth-ranking Republican and
a member of the House National Security Committee, said: ``I'm very
suspicious of the timing.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans accused the president of bombing rogue nations
or terrorists when he was in political binds in the past. The last
time the United States launched air strikes, said Rep. Spencer
Bachus of Alabama, they ``destroyed a drug store in the Sudan and
two camels in Afghanistan.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina put it bluntly: ``The
trust level is low.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But several other Republicans, many of whom are vocal critics of
the White House, set aside partisan differences, and defended the
president.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He has our full support as long as he's president to take any
action he deems necessary,'' said Rep. John Mica of Florida. ``I
don't think they conflict at all.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sherwood Boehlert of New York, who announced Wednesday that
he would vote for impeachment, said: ``I really do believe that in
sensitive foreign policy issues, partisanship does stop at the
water's edge.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Edward Porter of Illinois, another moderate
Republican, echoed similar sentiments: ``The president is the
president. I respect the office and I respect the judgments that
have to be made in regards to Iraq and the situation there.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Democrats quickly threw their support to the president. Rep.
Dick Gephardt of Missouri and Sen. Thomas Daschle of South Dakota,
the House and Senate Democratic leaders, said in a joint statement:
``The president has made the correct decision to undertake military
action against Iraq at this time. Any delay would have given Saddam
Hussein time to reconstitute his arsenal of weapons of mass
destruction and undermine support for our efforts.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., a decorated Vietnam veteran, said
Wednesday that no one should question the ``legitimacy'' of
Clinton's decision to bomb Iraq. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident that every reasonable member of the United
States Congress and reasonable people of this country will
understand the legitimacy of this moment. And no one will question
that once again, once too many times, it is Hussein who has
precipitated this confrontation and no one else.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam Hussein is responsible for the coincidence,'' said
Kerry. ``Saddam Hussein is responsible for the timing.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, criticized Lott for violating
an unwritten rule of backing a president's foreign policy decision
once U.S. troops are in action.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed and surprised,'' said Biden. ``Senator Lott
doesn't do foreign policy.''

SPEED OF CLONING PROGRESS SURPRISES ETHICS PANEL

<P>
   Just 18 months ago, a national ethics commission recommended a
three- to five-year moratorium on human cloning research. The
members, who issued their recommendation to President Clinton,
argued that nothing would be lost by such a ban, because it most
likely would take at least that long to know whether cloning could
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   But a ban was not approved, and events seem to have proved the
commission wrong.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, just one animal, a sheep, had been cloned, after
about 400 tries. Now, not only have mice and cows been cloned with
seeming ease but doctors at a South Korean fertility clinic report
that they have taken the first step toward cloning a human. With
that, some say, cloning has moved to a new frontier.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the other cloning announcements were from biotech
companies or agricultural scientists,'' said Dr. Lee Silver, a
molecular geneticist at Princeton University. But the Korean
announcement, he said, is clear on the motives: ``It is in order to
have human clones born.''
</P>
<P>
   The Koreans say they made a four-celled embryo that was a clone
of an infertile woman. They did not implant the embryo in a woman's
uterus to see if it would grow, nor did they provide evidence that
the embryo was a clone. But fertility experts in the United States
said it was only a matter of time before humans were cloned.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Rawlins, who directs the in vitro fertilization
laboratory for the Rush Health System in Chicago, said people
outside the field misjudged ``from Day 1'' the magnitude of the
forces that would push cloning research forward. ``It is a
business, not a science,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harold Shapiro, president of Princeton University and
chairman of the National Bioethics Advisory Commission, which
advised the president, said, ``The main point of our recommendation
was not whether it would be three to five years or one to two years
or seven to eight years, but it was moral prudence.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Dolly the lamb, the first clone, was born, it was a
scientific truism that the cloning of adults was biologically
impossible. Scientists reasoned that even though every cell in an
animal's body has the same genetic material, adult cells are the
result of a process of differentiation that begins in the womb.
After that, the theory went, a brain cell stays a brain cell, a
heart cell remains a heart cell. To clone, scientists would have to
take such a developed cell and reverse its genetic program so that
it could direct the development of a new animal, an identical twin
of the adult.
</P>
<P>
   That is what scientists achieved, first with Dolly and now with
other animals. But with Dolly, cloning seemed almost impossibly
arduous. Scientists at the Roslin Institute in Scotland started
with about 400 unfertilized sheep eggs. Out of those eggs, they got
one lamb.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, however, scientists in Hawaii announced that they
had created dozens of clones of adult mice. Last week, scientists
in Japan announced that they had cloned an adult cow, creating
eight calves. They said they were about as efficient in cloning as
fertility clinics were in creating human babies by mixing sperm and
eggs in the laboratory. What happened in Korea, said Dr. Randall
Prather, a cloning expert at the University of Missouri in
Columbia, ``is the obvious next step'' in cloning.
</P>
<P>
   Some say that public opinion is having a chilling effect on
fertility clinics in the United States that might want to clone
humans. If anyone tried it, said Dr. Alan DeCherney, chairman of
the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of
California in Los Angeles School of Medicine, ``you'd become the
Dr. Kevorkian of reproduction.''
</P>
<P>
   But, said Dr. Steen Willadsen, at St. Barnabas Medical Center in
Livingston, N.J., ``there are literally thousands of people around
the world who could try that experiment.''
</P>
<P>
   The obvious message, Prather said, is that human cloning ``is
going to happen sooner or later.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he added, ``You'd better get used to it.''

POLAROID CONFIRMS WARNINGS OF WEAK PERFORMANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Polaroid Corp. Wednesday provided yet another quarterly snapshot
of bleak images: nearly 700 jobs cuts, $90 million in one-time
charges, the loss of Serafino ``Sandy'' Posa, its top marketing
executive, and indications of lower revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Investor reaction was instant as Polaroid shares reached a
52-week low of 17 7/16, before closing at 18 1/4, down 5/8. That's
more than 30 points below its 1998 high of nearly 50 in January and
less than half the 40 a share that the Cambridge, Mass. photography
company commanded three years ago when it recruited Gary T.
DiCamillo as chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts shrugged off the latest moves, noting that in
October the company warned that fourth-quarter results would be
worse than those for the third quarter. The company's also said
Wednesday that it had won a two-year extension on a $350 million
credit line, which analysts said would help it buy time to
stimulate sales while reducing inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most important news, at least locally, was that
Polaroid would cut its work force again. The elimination of 600 to
700 jobs, or up to 7.6 percent of its payroll, is expected to take
12 to 18 months. It follows January's announcement of a reduction
of 1,800 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The combined cuts will leave the pioneer of instant photography
with about 9,000 employees at the end of this year _ down more than
3,000 from 12,000 five years ago and significantly below the 21,000
employees Polaroid had in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early going, DiCamillo was taking decisive action and
doing the right kinds of things at a seemily rapid pace,'' said
Michael W. Ellmann, vice president of research at Schroder &AMP; Co.
``But at this juncture whether the company difficulties are due to
DiCamillo dropping the ball or if the structural challenges facing
Polaroid are essentially overwhelming is still not clear,''
</P>
<P>
   The company blamed the collapse of the Russian market for part
of the write-down, as well as lackluster overseas sales, which
account for about half its revenue, and the need to further reduce
dealer inventories. But most Wall Street analysts said the heart of
the company's problems was the lack of significant new consumer
products for this holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   Ellmann and other analysts maintain that DiCamillo is under
pressure to show improved results in 1999. So far, only one
promising new camera product for the consumer market, a disposable
instant camera, is being test marketed in Atlanta with plans to be
sold nationwide early next year. It will be the first of 20 new
products Polaroid plans to introduce next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's announcement puts Polaroid on a more solid footing to
enter 1999 poised for profitable growth,'' said DiCamillo, who has
recruited a senior management team from other consumer products
companies to sell the new cameras and film.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, one key player, Sandy Posa, Polaroid's senior
vice president for worldwide marketing and new product development,
abruptly resigned, citing ``personal reasons.'' His departure
surprised Polaroid observers since DiCamillo picked him just three
months ago to run all marketing ahead of Carole J. Uhrich, a
32-year veteran of Polaroid. She returned to running manufacturing
and logistics as part of a corporate reorganization that merged the
consumer and commerical imaging divisions.
</P>
<P>
   The change in management prompted B. Alex Henderson, a
Prudential Securities analyst who has been critical of the company,
to question whether Polaroid has difficulties getting new products
ready for next year.
</P>
<P>
   Posa, 44, a former senior vice president of business development
at Kraft Foods North America, was replaced by Jerry Noonan, 39, who
came to Polaroid two years ago to manage consumer products from
Nabsico Biscuit Co., where he was senior vice president of
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts have been critical of DiCamillo's tenure
because the company has largely developed product extensions or
repackaging of existing consumer products. Newer products are aimed
at niche markets, such as a low-cost thin flashlight that uses the
same batteries as its instant film packs and a line of high-priced
sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   And while the company has revamped its bread-and-butter instant
film line and expanded into digital photo printers, several new
products, such as a digital camera, called PhotoMax, have had
difficulty competing against similar filmless equipment from
Eastman Kodak and Japanese camera makers.
</P>
<P>
   If digital cameras pose a major challenge, Polaroid faces an
even bigger competitive threat in what it knows best. Barely 6 1/2
weeks ago Fuji Photo Film Co., the world's second largest
photography company, said it was considering selling instant film
and cameras in the United States. Fuji's reason for entering the
instant film market: Some of Polaroid's key patents are expiring.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid will take fourth-quarter charges of $50 million for the
job cuts and $40 million to write off Russian assets. The company
said the Russian assets include receivables, inventories, fixed
assets and prepaid expenses. In addition, the company expects to
take a pretax gain of about $22 million in the quarter from the
sale of some buildings in Cambridge for $27 million, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid expects the moves to save it $20 million to $30 million
in the next two years, offsetting a similar increase in interest
costs from the new loan, analysts said.

ALLIES TOUGHEN POLICY TO REWARD AND PUNISH BOSNIAN LEADERS 
</HEADLINE>

 By AL GOODMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, &UR;  &LR; Spain _ In a move intended to strengthen the Bosnian
peace accord, the United States and other countries agreed here
Wednesday to more aggressively reward those Bosnian leaders who
comply with the pact and punish those who do not.
</P>
<P>
   The carrot-and-stick policy will still be under the control of
the top civilian international official in Bosnia, Carlos
Westendorp. Westendorp was given added authority to remove Bosnian
leaders from political posts if they obstructed the 1995 peace
accord, especially a provision that lets war refugees return home
to areas that other ethnic groups control. And he was given added
input over allocating the $1.5 billion in annual foreign aid to
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The accord was reached among the 46 donor nations at the Bosnian
Peace Implementation Council here, the third such meeting since the
three-year war ended in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's special representative for carrying out the
Bosnian peace plan, Robert Gelbard, said Westendorp's expanded
authority should be wielded only on rare occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're caught in somewhat of a bind,'' Gelbard said. ``It's
essential for the Bosnian parties to assume responsibility for
their future. But there are times, when to break an impasse, it is
important to be able to cut through the political tangles that
exist.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-day meeting ended Wednesday with the approval of a
document that lays out the most detailed plan yet for the return of
an estimated one million refugees and for economic changes to
create jobs and compete financially without relying on foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   The donor nations warned that they would soon reduce aid,
although an immediate pullout of the 34,000 foreign troops is not
widely expected.
</P>
<P>
   The 39-page document lists a two-year timetable for broad
changes, including creating an independent judiciary and
multiethnic police forces, a program that Westendorp said should
``make the peace irreversible.''
</P>
<P>
   One dissenting voice, Western officials said, was Nikola
Poplasen, recently elected leader of the Bosnian Serb republic.
Considered a hard-liner by the United States, Poplasen worried at a
news conference here on Tuesday that Westendorp was growing too
powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Another Bosnian Serb leader, Milorad Dodik, told reporters here
Wednesday about a new atmosphere of cooperation in Bosnia. Dodik
praised Westendorp's authority to ``impose a solution when a mutual
accord cannot be found.''
</P>
<P>
   Westendorp has dismissed seven Bosnian officials who he thought
opposed the peace plan. But some of the officials stayed active and
influential in their political parties, a practice that Westendorp
will have added authority to prohibit.

 By BRENDAN M. CASE, with JOACHIM BAMRUD and DOUGLASS STINSON 
 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MEXICO CITY _ In Mexico, NAFTA stands for change. Five years
after it took effect, NAFTA has become the leading impetus for the
far-reaching transformations sweeping the world of Mexican
business. Open markets and competition have obliged executives to
rethink their companies, pushing them to face up to the challenge
of free trade. And, during the economic crisis of 1995, NAFTA threw
a life-line to hundreds of Mexican companies, even as unfettered
foreign competition helped push weaker firms out of business.
 &HT;    The North American Free Trade Agreement has given a turbo boost
to commerce between Mexico and the United States, and turned Canada
into Mexico's second-largest trade partner, with interregional
trade growing at double-digit rates and causing huge traffic jams
at border highway crossings and rail yards. ``NAFTA constitutes one
of Mexico's greatest competitive advantages,'' says Luis Rubio, a
noted economist who is director of Mexico's Center for Development.
``It is an exceptional tool for the development of the Mexican
economy, attracting much foreign investment that translates into
jobs, technology transfer, indirect export opportunities through
supply chains, and training for workers and executives. In
addition, it generates secure access to the U.S. market.''
 &HT;    The effects on companies in the United States and Canada have
been positive as well, though more modest in scope. In many ways,
the trade accord simply ratified and codified trends in
manufacturing sectors such as textiles and automotive trades. But
for companies in other industries, and for smaller companies that
had not previously considered exporting, NAFTA has provided a
window of opportunity to increase sales and rationalize costs.
While the macroeconomic effect on the two larger countries has been
minimal, for companies that have directly benefited from the new
markets, NAFTA is exciting and successful.
 &HT;    Indeed, on a company-by-company level, some patterns are
emerging as to how NAFTA is affecting the way companies do business
in North America. The last five years have seen a major increase in
cross-border joint ventures and foreign direct investment,
especially in Mexico. Relocation of labor-intensive manufacturing
processes to Mexico _ not only from Canada and the United States,
but from Central America, the Caribbean region and even as far away
as Asia _ has occurred, especially in automotive, electronic and
textile work, the three leading trade segments under NAFTA. ``NAFTA
has made it possible for manufacturing companies to make decisions
based purely on manufacturing costs,'' says Chris Padilla, director
of international trade relations for U.S. imaging company Eastman
Kodak, which recently announced that it hopes to save US$1 billion
over two years by shifting production of its X-ray film processors
to Mexico, to add to assembly operations of one-use cameras and
printed circuit boards. Film production, a capital-intense process,
has been centralized at one U.S. plant for all North American
sales.
 &HT;    Any Mexican consumer with money to buy U.S. imports profits from
low tariffs. But most Mexicans, many of whom have seen their
purchasing power decline just as free trade rose in influence, are
not celebrating NAFTA. To millions of Mexicans, direct benefits
from the accord have been scarce.
 &HT;    Even from a corporate viewpoint, the benefits of open borders
are concentrated in several hundred world-class large companies and
a limited number of smaller ones with the pluck, luck and know-how
to crack export markets.
 &HT;    Mexico's overall exports have doubled since 1994, from US$60
billion annually to an expected $120 billion for 1998. Exports to
the U.S. have grown to nearly $100 billion, making Mexico the third
largest supplier of goods and services to the U.S. market after
Canada and Japan. With U.S. exports to Mexico at about the same
level, Mexico is the second-largest market in the world for U.S.
products.
 &HT;    Big Mexican companies have been clear winners. Grupo Alfa, a
$3.9 billion conglomerate, exports a quarter of its sales. Grupo
Desc and San Luis Corporaci have become major autoparts suppliers
to the U.S. market. Grupo Industrial Bimbo, a breadmaker, and Isaac
Saba, a textile magnate, both made multimillion-dollar acquisitions
in the United States in their respective fields during 1998.
 &HT;    Most small companies that make up the backbone of Mexico's
employment, if not its production, have been left out of the party,
lacking the resources to mount the market research and seek foreign
buyers, or _ due to diverse factors _ simply fail to compete in
global markets. Take Alejandro Hernandez, a metal stamper in Mexico
City. Back in the early 1990s, he was one of thousands who believed
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's pledge that free trade would
vault Mexico out of chronic poverty. So he took action, borrowing
about $90,000 in bank loans. With the money, he opened a small
metal-stamping shop to supply large industrial companies. But
Hernandez's dream turned sour. ``The competition was tough, really
tough. Little by little, we just couldn't keep up, even before the
peso devaluation,'' says Hernandez, who closed the shop in 1995 and
released 35 employees. ``Once the crisis struck, our interest
payments doubled and there was nothing to do but close. The loans
were too expensive and the market was too difficult. Our mistake
was believing the line that only by investing would we develop.''
Economists say that NAFTA is just one of many factors _ the Tequila
Crisis and the relentless pace of globalization among others _ that
have affected Mexico. Nonetheless, countless others found
themselves in similar situations, and as their companies turned
into the losers of free trade, they blamed NAFTA. Some free-trade
critics blamed the Mexican government's liberalization policies for
undermining the country's industrial base and paving the way for a
severe crisis. But others see things a bit differently. ``I think
NAFTA saved the Mexican economy during the crisis,'' says Alberto
Covarrubias, the director general of Walmi Transformer, a
450-employee company in the northern city of Saltillo that exports
air filters for automobile engines and specialty applications. ``I
don't know what the country would look like now without NAFTA.''
 &HT;    Walmi Transformer is one of an elite group of small and
medium-sized companies who saw free trade as inevitable and decided
to do something about it. The company once served the domestic
market from a plant in Lermo, an industrial town in central Mexico.
But several years before NAFTA was signed, Walmi executives decided
their future was in exports, so they moved to Saltillo, a day's
drive from the Texas border. And they launched a massive makeover
of the company's production techniques, management methods and
sales practices. ``It's a long process and you have to involve all
your people,'' says Covarrubias. ``But now, the companies that
transformed themselves can take advantage of all these changes,
while the companies that believed that things would never really
change are paying the price.''
 &HT;    Today, Walmi sells air filters to several automakers and the
auto aftermarket, as well as specialty filters to companies like
Ingersoll Rand. It won Mexico's National Export Prize in 1997 for
its market performance in the United States and Canada, and
recently signed a contract with a German company after attending a
trade fair in Hamburg. Covarrubias even closed the company's
warehouse in Laredo, Texas, realizing that with NAFTA, regular
bureaucratic delays at customs were a thing of the past.
 &HT;    A few large companies were able to turn operations geared to the
domestic market into export production in a short time: Goodyear de
Mexico and most automakers did so by 1995. But Walmi is typical of
smaller companies that needed several years to do it.
 &HT;    Techtube de Mexico, an independent, cutting-edge steel company
in Mexico City with 150 employees, was founded in 1990, and started
to export in 1995. But that was two years after it first decided to
buy several million dollars' worth of capital equipment from
specialized suppliers in France, Italy and Germany to produce the
technology to make top-grade stainless-steel pipes and joints.
``NAFTA was a detonator for our entire investment, because we saw a
big opportunity to export to the United States and we were able to
recalculate our return on investment because of the treaty,'' says
Sergio Espinoza, the company's export manager. ``We wanted to
compete against the big guys. You find out what you know, and you
learn faster.''
 &HT;    Today, Techtube sells about half its production in Mexico,
supplying tons of steel pipes for beer giant Grupo Modelo's new
plant in Zacatecas, and other large companies. It exports the other
half to the United States and Canada, and to the rest of Latin
America.
 &HT;    NAFTA has also attracted foreign firms interested not just in
serving the Mexican market, but also in using Mexico as an export
platform to the United States. Mexico received $12 billion in
foreign direct investment in 1997, more than any Latin American
country after Brazil, which is still in the process of selling off
huge state-owned companies.
 &HT;    Mexico overtook China as the single-largest supplier of textiles
to the United States in 1998, spearheaded by foreign firms'
maquiladora assembly-for-export plants. U.S. automobile maker
General Motors and Bombardier, the Canadian transportation and
finance giant, have joined forces to assemble locomotives in
Mexico. Major parts will be shipped from GM plants in the United
States to Bombardier's Mexico facility for assembly and then sold
throughout Latin America. GM's Delphi parts subsidiary is already
the largest private employer in Mexico, with over 27,000 workers.
``We believe that Mexico will continue to get stronger and
stronger,'' says Tom Glaser, an executive at U.S. trucking firm
Contract Freighters, Inc. ``More U.S. manufacturing plants will
relocate there and more parts and components will need to be hauled
from the U.S.''
 &HT;    Sara Lee, the giant U.S. apparel company, while not adding new
plant capacity to its existing Mexico operations, has seen a shift
in production as duty free goods under NAFTA reduce overall costs.
``We have not been as dependent on the Far East for our sourcing
needs,'' says Sara Lee spokeswoman Peggy Carter, who added that
Mexican plants have increased their competitiveness under NAFTA.
 &HT;    Textiles are a prime example of how the complementary aspects of
Mexico's economy with those of Canada and the United States fit
together and benefit companies' bottom lines and their ability to
compete in other markets. Before the trade accord took effect,
Quaker Fabric Corp., a U.S. textile company with $200 million in
annual sales, was unsuccessful in gaining a license to import its
products into Mexico. But since NAFTA, the company has opened
offices in Mexico City and Guadalajara, while 150 of the company's
2,300 U.S.-based workers owe their jobs to the new export revenue
stream.
 &HT;    ``What you are finding is a natural partnership,'' says Quaker
Fabric CEO Larry Liebenow. ``More sophisticated products like yarns
and upholstery, are being made in the United States.
Apparel-cutting and sewing is moving to Mexico. For years that is a
business that has moved out of the United States. But with NAFTA,
apparel is moving to Mexico from Asia, and that is important
because Mexican apparel makers buy a lot of U.S. fabric as raw
materials.''
 &HT;    In addition to NAFTA and Mexico's location, Canadian companies
have been drawn to set up manufacturing operations in Mexico due to
a highly qualified and productive workforce, says Andres Darvasi,
president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce in Mexico and
director of marketing and sales for the Mexico operations of
Bombardier.
 &HT;    At the same time, NAFTA has helped increase awareness in Canada
for the opportunities in Mexico, he says.
 &HT;    ``NAFTA has brought considerable benefits to Canadian
companies,'' adds Katherine Funtek, commercial secretary at the
Canadian Embassy in Mexico. ``Among the many positive aspects are
better access to the Mexican market, particularly in areas that
were previously highly protected, including automotive parts,
transportation equipment and services, natural gas [and textiles.''
 &HT;    Other benefits include the creation of effective trade dispute
settlement mechanisms and greater transparency in, and access to,
government procurement, she says. And, Canada's economy itself has
also benefited by the increased competitiveness, according to
Funtek. As a result of all this NAFTA-spurred change, foreign
investment from U.S. and Canadian companies far outstrips funds
coming from other parts of the world and is growing in importance.
Indeed, the perceived stability that a multilateral treaty provides
has persuaded companies to divert investment from other traditional
manufacturing centers to Mexico.
 &HT;    And companies expect to leverage their Mexican investment far
beyond the NAFTA region. The Mexican plants of automakers like
General Motors, Ford and Chrysler (all from the United States),
Nissan (Japan) and Volkswagen (Germany) have increased their
presence, and in 1997, shipped nearly a million vehicles around the
world. Samsung (Korea), Sony (Japan) and other electronics firms
have turned Tijuana into the world capital of television
production. ``NAFTA is fueling all this growth,'' says Horacio
Ojeda, the director of business planning at the fibers department
of the Mexico operations of U.S.-based energy and chemicals company
DuPont. ``But it's broader than that. We also want to export to
Europe, Latin America and Asia.''
 &HT;    Other indirect effects from NAFTA are still being played out.
Demand for top-quality real estate is rising in Mexico City, in
large part from foreign firms looking for expanded space. And with
industrial companies flocking here, law firms, accountants,
consultants and other service companies are racing to compete for
new business. Behind the success, though, skeptics worry that
Mexico is not doing enough to take advantage of NAFTA. After all,
its competitive advantage of privileged access to the U.S. market
will disappear if the U.S. signs similar trade agreements _ such as
the Free Trade Area of the Americas _ in the future with other
developing countries in Latin America or elsewhere. ``In practice,
we're leaving the country's development to the initiative of each
individual,'' says Rubio, the economist. ``There's nothing wrong
with that, but it's insufficient. The fact is that those who reap
the rewards of NAFTA are a small portion of Mexicans.'' Mexico
still needs to make internal improvements to cement its
competitiveness, particularly in education and financial services.
To consolidate Mexico's advantage and spread the gains among larger
segments of the population, says Rubio, Mexico must address these
pressing weaknesses.
 &HT;    Public and private sector officials are already seeking ways to
upgrade labor-intensive industries. True, Mexico needed and needs
the low-tech jobs, but as the trade accord enters into its second
five-year period, they hope to raise wages and earnings by
producing more complex products. NAFTA has already made U.S.-Mexico
commerce into one of the world's fastest-growing trade zones,
speeding trends that were already underway in the 1980s. But in
Mexico, NAFTA means change, and the ongoing change of NAFTA is best
thought of as evolution.

   Solomon, a former Marine, said the American people should be
``outraged'' and charged that Clinton launched the attack for
``political reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly rather suspicious timing,'' agreed Rep. Tillie
Fowler, R-Fla., a member of the House majority leadership team. ``I
think the president is shameless in what he would do to stay in
office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot support this military action in the Persian Gulf at
this time, `` said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
``Both the timing and the policy are in question.''
</P>
<P>
   The skepticism was extraordinary in that such missions almost
always receive bipartisan backing, at least while the attack is
actually taking place.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP critics took care to declare their support for the
American military forces. Speaker-elect Bob Livingston, R-La., said
the House would convene Thursday to pass a resolution of bipartisan
backing of the troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``As to the matter of timing, we just would leave that to the
best judgment of the American people,'' said Livingston. ``We
support the troops.''
</P>
<P>
   While conceding that he doesn't ``blame anyone for being a
little cynical'' about the timing, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said
``regardless of any cynicism anybody has, we ought to get behind
the president at this particular time.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, a former Republican senator from Maine, was questioned at
a Pentagon briefing before his trip to Capitol Hill about the
suspicions of his former colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that every member of Congress and every member of this
country will have to make his or her own judgment based upon the
facts,'' he said. ``I am prepared to place 30 years of public
service on the line to say the only factor that was important in
this decision is what is in the American people's best interest.
There were no other factors.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic congressional leaders defended the mission and
predicted that most members from both parties would end up
supporting the mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake about it. The American people and the American
Congress will stand behind our troops and stand behind our
president as we go into these next few days,'' said House Minority
Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a time for our country to be united, even though we
are divided on other matters,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom
Daschle, D-S.D. ``We need to stand united, Republicans and
Democrats alike, in ensuring that our troops are completely
successful in the dangerous mission that they are undertaking
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Clinton was flying back from Israel on Tuesday, ``there
was obvious concern'' aboard Air Force One that military action
would be viewed as a cynical effort to dodge impeachment, said Rep.
Alcee Hastings, D-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings said the president agonized over the political
implications of his decision after they were raised by Rep. Rick
Lazio, D-N.Y., a member of the congressional delegation who met
with Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings said he told Clinton: ``You have to do what you have to
do as if there were no impeachment. He said he felt that is what he
must do.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of how the strike would be perceived was also
discussed Wednesday aboard Air Force Two as Vice President Al Gore
returned to Washington from Gov. Lawton Chiles's funeral in
Florida, said Rep. Mark Foley, a Republican from West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president made note that people would second-guess
this decision,'' Foley said. Gore would not comment on the timing
of the strike Foley said, but ``merely made the comment that there
would be cynics among us.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats said the timing of the attack was awkward but was
forced by the Iraqi leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not contrived, and it has nothing to do with
impeachment,'' said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass. ``I think that the
reason I wanted to make this statement today is that I think
Americans need to really understand the gravity and legitimacy of
what is happening with Saddam Hussein,'' Iraq's president.
</P>
<P>
   And some Republicans said the bombing is long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam Hussein has thwarted the will of the international
community for far too long,'' said Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan. ``The
U.S. must have the will to bring this to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   The military action was an unexpected climax to a long day of
anticipation as House members returned from holiday recess for the
impeachment debate and possible votes that had been scheduled for
Thursday.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Furious and bitterly divided, House Republicans on
Wednesday night postponed the impeachment vote against President
Clinton for several days because of the bombing campaign against
Iraq, even as more Republicans came out for impeachment, making the
odds against the president look insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   As the lameduck 105th Congress returned to the Capitol for
evening party caucuses on impeachment, the House was left reeling
at the almost surreal clash of crises. The first wave of bombs fell
in Baghdad just minutes before the Republicans began their
closed-door strategy session on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   After more than three hours of raucous, angry and passionate
debate on Wednesday night, Republicans, despite expressing deep
suspicions of Clinton, finally heeded the call from the incoming
House speaker, Robert Livingston of Louisiana, that the impeachment
debate _ which had been scheduled for Thursday _ be postponed for a
few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to defer,'' Livingston said after the caucus.
However, he instructed members to stay in Washington on standby,
for debate to resume ``possibly Friday, possibly Saturday, but
within the near future.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, at least another eight Republicans declared
they would vote to impeach Clinton, many of them the moderates whom
Clinton most desperately needed to bring to his side. Their
defection left any White House strategy to protect the president in
shambles.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said that even though it was still mathematically
possible, they could no longer see how the president could avoid
impeachment unless military action somehow shifted the mood.
``Unless this action has an unexpected effect, he's done,'' said a
Democrat close to the effort to spare Clinton impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   But several Republicans said that the military action had only
hardened the resolve in their party to impeach the president. ``If
anything, suspicions around the timing of the action of Iraq has
solidified support against the president,'' said Rep. Spencer
Bachus, an Alabama Republican.
</P>
<P>
   THe Democrats, who are almost united against impeachment,
rallied behind the president. Some even called for impeachment to
be put off into the next Congress, when the Democrats will have
five more seats in the House and Clinton might have more of a
chance of avoiding being only the second president to be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don 't understand why this can't go over to the next
Congress,'' said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt, the House minority leader, said, ''There was
a unanimous feeling in our caucus that it should not come up as
long as our troops are in harm's way.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Republicans, suspicions ran deep that Clinton had timed
the military action as a tactic to save his presidency, and perhaps
try to throw the vote into the next Congress. Rep. Roscoe Bartlett,
R-Md., said of the Republican caucus, ''some people were
incredulous'' about the motivation for the bombing. ``Emotion ran
all the way from disgust to anger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a legitimate question in my mind about whether this is
all planned,'' said Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J. ``You know, the Wag
the Dog scenario so it could be postponed into the next Congress,''
she said referring to the 1997 movie.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, said he could not support
''this military action in the Persian Gulf at this time'' despite
assurances that the strike was not connected to the looming
impeachment vote. ``The timing and the policy are subject to
question,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Armey, the House majority leader, said the fact that
Republicans had doubts about the legitimacy of the military action
showed Clinton was losing his ability to lead. ``If th president
refuses to resign for the sake of the nation, I believe he should
be impeached and face Senate trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston and Gephardt sought to strike _ for a fleeting moment
_ a bipartisan note. They issued a joint statement supporting
Clinton's decision to take military action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Both political parties went straight from their respective
meetings to the House floor for a briefing by the president's
entire national security team. The outgoing speaker, Newt Gingrich,
coordinated with Cabinet officials to organize that session while
Livingston helped conduct the Republican caucus on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Joe Lockhart, the press secretary, dismissed
any suggestion that Clinton was using his powers as commander in
chief to avoid becoming the first president to be impeached in 130
years. ``The president of the United States makes national security
decisions based on the best interest of the United States,'' he
said.

 EX-U.S. ATTORNEY ADMITS INVESTOR FRAUD; 8 PLEAD GUILTY AFTER STING
OPERATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ A former U.S. Attorney in West Virginia, who also
served as the top enforcement officer of the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, and a second man who the authorities said made
his career devising fraudulent investment schemes, have pleaded
guilty to racketeering and conspiracy charges for their roles in a
telemarketing plot that cheated would-be investors of more than $80
million, federal law-enforcement officials announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   As part of their plea bargains, John Field III, the former U.S.
Attorney, who now lives in North Carolina, and Marcus Dalton of
Colts Neck, N.J., the man described as a professional con artist
and telemarketing expert, helped the authorities conduct a sting
operation in which federal agents created a fake mutual fund,
purportedly dealing in foreign currencies, and used it to
infiltrate operations known as boiler rooms that sell fraudulent
investments to the public.
</P>
<P>
   A main goal of the operation was to search the boiler rooms that
agreed to sell the fake mutual fund for information about other
fraudulent investment schemes and the people who created them.
Investigators said they expected the investigation to lead to
dozens of arrests. Nine telemarketers and one boiler-room
wholesaler agreed to sell the fake fund, which was called UNEX
2100, and their offices were raided on Tuesday, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Field and Dalton, six other defendants pleaded
guilty in U.S. District Court in Newark to charges of conspiracy
and mail, securities and wire fraud related to telemarketing
schemes, including several that involved selling millions of
dollars in worthless investments in wireless cable television
licenses. The defendants acknowledged taking enormous sales
commissions on the bad investments, and some acknowledged that they
simply stole the investors' money.
</P>
<P>
   The guilty plea by Field, who was U.S. attorney for the Southern
District of West Virginia from 1972 to 1977 and the director of
enforcement for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission from 1977
to 1980, represented a disgrace for a highly regarded prosecutor
who won national attention and a reputation for integrity in 1975
when he obtained an indictment of Arch A. Moore Jr., the governor
of West Virginia, on conspiracy and corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
   Field, 60, pleaded guilty to racketeering on Dec. 4 in U.S.
District Court in Concord, N.H. The racketeering charge stemmed
from his work as a lawyer for a boiler-room operator who had been
arrested and convicted in New Hampshire. Field's guilty plea in New
Hampshire was sealed until today while federal authorities
completed the undercover operation.
</P>
<P>
   At the time he came to the attention of federal investigators in
New Hampshire, Field had already been under scrutiny by
law-enforcement officials investigating fraudulent investment deals
elsewhere, including in New Jersey and Nevada. Federal prosecutors
in New Hampshire and New Jersey joined together, and in early 1996
Field agreed to assist their investigation by working undercover
and using his contacts.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the racketeering charge, Field pleaded guilty
Wednesday in Newark to one charge of conspiracy to commit
securities, mail and wire fraud. The plea was accepted by Judge
Katharine Hayden, who also accepted guilty pleas from the other
suspects in the case. Field faces a maximum prison term of 20 years
on the racketeering charge, a maximum of five years for the
conspiracy charge and fines of $250,000 or more. Because of his
cooperation, he is not expected to get the maximum.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney in Newark, Faith Hochberg, announced the
guilty pleas and the undercover operation at a news conference
Wednesday afternoon with Paul Gagnon, the U.S. in New Hampshire,
and other officials. Ms. Hochberg called Field's admission of guilt
``the rock bottom of his slide from protector of the public to
predator on the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Dalton, 45, who was the subject of a September 1995 article in
Forbes magazine that described him as a ruthless grifter and
telemarketing genius who preyed on the elderly, pleaded guilty on
Tuesday to conspiracy to commit racketeering. He faces a maximum
sentence of 20 years in prison and fines of $250,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Dalton concocted fraudulent investment products
in commodities, wireless cable systems, specialized mobile radio
systems, cellular telephone systems and children's television
programming.
</P>
<P>
   Other suspects who pleaded guilty to fraud charges were Barry
Lichtenthal, 54, of Colts Neck, N.J.; Mark Prager, 41, of Solana
Beach, Calif.; Robin Clark, 57, of Atlanta; Drew Bagarozy, 38, of
Wall Township, N.J.; Howard Wunderlich, 51, of Somerset, N.J., and
Thomas Umar, 40, of Belle Mead, N.J. They each face maximum
sentences of five years in prison and fines.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the more outlandish uses of the money stolen from
investors, Lichtenthal, who used the alias Michael Taylor,
acknowledged in a court hearing today that he took $265,000 that he
collected from investors for a fraudulent venture called Northeast
Telecom and used the money to buy toy trains.

 Por BRENDAN M. CASE, con JOACHIM BAMRUD y DOUGLASS STINSON 
 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MEXICO, D.F. _ En Mexico, el Tratado de Libre Comercio (NAFTA)
significa cambio. Cinco anos despues de entrar en vigor, el TLC se
ha convertido en el motor de grandes transformaciones en el sector
empresarial. Los mercados abiertos y la libre competencia han
obligado a los ejecutivos a transformar sus companias para
enfrentar los retos del comercio libre. Y durante la crisis
economica de 1995, el TLC fue un salvavidas para cientos de
empresas mexicanas, aunque la competencia extranjera saco del
negocio a las mas debiles.
 &HT;    El TLC dio un gran impulso al comercio entre Mexico y Estados
Unidos, y convirtio a Canada en el segundo socio comercial de
Mexico. El comercio interregional crecio en mas del 10 por ciento y
causo enormes embotellamientos de trafico en los cruces
fronterizos. ``El TLC es una de las mayores ventajas competitivas
de Mexico,'' dice Luis Rubio, destacado economista y director del
Centro de Desarrollo de Mexico. ``Es una herramienta excepcional
para el desarrollo de la economia mexicana porque atrae un gran
volumen de inversion extranjera que genera empleos, transferencia
de tecnologia, oportunidades indirectas de exportacion a traves de
cadenas de suministro, y capacitacion para trabajadores y
ejecutivos. Ademas, genera un acceso seguro al mercado
estadounidense.''
 &HT;    El efecto sobre las companias en Estados Unidos y Canada tambien
ha sido positivo, aunque su alcance ha sido mas modesto. En muchos
sentidos, el pacto comercial simplemente ratifico y codifico
tendencias en sectores manufactureros como el textil y el
automotriz. Pero a las companias de otros sectores, y a las
empresas menores que antes no consideraban la posibilidad de
exportar, el TLC allano el camino al hacer aumentar las ventas y
racionalizar los costos. Aunque el efecto macroeconomico en los dos
paises mayores ha sido minimo, para las empresas que se han
beneficiado directamente de los nuevos mercados el TLC es
emocionante y exitoso.
 &HT;    De hecho,ya se observan nuevas tendencias en como las empresas
funcionan en Norteamerica. En los cinco ultimos anos ha habido un
gran aumento en el numero de empresas conjuntas y la inversion
extranjera directa, sobre todo en Mexico. Numerosas operaciones
fabriles con gran volumen de mano de obra se han desplazado hacia
Mexico, especialmente en los sectores textil, automotriz y la
electronica, los tres principales segmentos comerciales bajo el
pacto regional. ``El TLC ha posibilitado que las empresas
manufactureras tomen decisiones basandose solamente en los costos
de manufactura,'' explica Chris Padilla, director de relaciones
comerciales internacionales de la empresa estadounidense Eastman
Kodak, que anuncio recientemente que espera ahorrar US$1.000
millones en dos anos trasladando la produccion de sus procesadores
de peliculas radiograficas a Mexico, donde ya tiene operaciones de
ensamblaje de camaras desechables y tarjetas de circuitos impresos.
La produccion de pelicula para toda Norteamerica, proceso que
requiere un gran volumen de capital, se ha centralizado en una
planta en Estados Unidos.
 &HT;    Cualquier consumidor mexicano con dinero para comprar productos
importados de Estados Unidos tiene la ventaja de los bajos
aranceles. Para millones de mexicanos, los beneficios directos del
pacto han sido escasos.
 &HT;    Incluso desde el punto de vista empresarial, las ventajas de las
fronteras abiertas se concentran en unos centenares de grandes
empresas internacionales y en una cantidad limitada de empresas
menores con el valor, la suerte y el conocimiento para aprovechar
los mercados de exportacion.
 &HT;    Las exportaciones de Mexico se han duplicado desde 1994, de
US$60.000 millones al ano a una cifra esperada de US$120.000
millones en 1998. Las exportaciones a Estados Unidos han crecido a
casi US$100.000 millones, convirtiendo a Mexico en el tercer
suministrador de productos y servicios al mercado estadounidense,
despues de Canada y Japon. Con las exportaciones estadounidenses a
Mexico mas o menos al mismo nivel, el vecino del sur es el segundo
mercado del mundo para los productos de Estados Unidos.
 &HT;    Las grandes empresas mexicanas han sido, evidentemente, los
ganadores. El Grupo Alfa, un conglomerado de US$3.900 millones,
exporta la cuarta parte de sus ventas. El Grupo Desc y San Luis
Corporacion se han convertido en importantes suministradores de
piezas para automoviles al mercado estadounidense. El Grupo
Industrial Bimbo, fabricante de pan, e Isaac Saba, magnate del
sector textil, hicieron adquisiciones multimillonarias en Estados
Unidos en sus respectivos giros en 1998.
 &HT;    La mayoria de las empresas pequenas, que constituyen el grueso
de los empleos en Mexico, cuando no tambien su produccion, han
quedado fuera de la fiesta al carecer de los recursos para realizar
investigaciones de mercado y buscar compradores extranjeros, o
sencillamente porque debido a diversos factores no lograron
competir en el mercado internacional.
 &HT;    Alejandro Hernandez, tecnico en estampado de metales de la
capital mexicana, es un ejemplo. A principios de los anos 90, fue
uno de los muchos que creyeron al presidente Carlos Salinas de
Gortari cuando prometio que el libre comercio libraria a Mexico de
la pobreza cronica. Asi las cosas, tomo US$90.000 en prestamos y
abrio un taller de estampado para abastecer a grandes empresas
industriales. Pero el sueno de Hernandez se convirtio en una
pesadilla. ``La competencia fue muy dura. Poco a poco nos fuimos
quedando atras, incluso antes de la devaluacion del peso,'' relata
Hernandez, que cerro el taller en 1995 y dejo en la calle a 35
empleados. ``Cuando la crisis llego, los pagos de los intereses se
duplicaron y no hubo mas remedio que cerrar. Los prestamos eran
demasiado caros y el mercado estaba muy dificil. Nos equivocamos al
creer que solo invirtiendo podiamos desarrollarnos.''
 &HT;    Los economistas dicen que el TLC es solo uno de muchos factores
(el efecto tequila y el ritmo inexorable de la globalizacion, entre
otros) que han afectado a Mexico. Sin embargo, muchos otros se
hallaron en situaciones similares, y cuando sus companias salieron
perdiendo culparon al TLC. Algunos criticos del libre comercio
afirman que la politica de liberalizacion del gobierno mexicano
socava la base industrial del pais y allana el camino hacia una
crisis aguda. Pero otros tienen una opinion distinta. ``Creo que el
TLC salvo la economia mexicana durante la crisis,'' dice Alberto
Covarrubias, director general de Walmi Transformer, una compania de
450 empleados en la ciudad nortena de Saltillo, que exporta filtros
de aire para motores de automoviles y otros usos. ``No me imagino
como estaria ahora el pais sin el TLC.''
 &HT;    Walmi Transformer forma parte de un grupo exclusivo de empresas
pequenas y medianas que consideraron que el libre comercio era
inevitable y decidieron actuar en consecuencia. La compania
abastecia al mercado nacional desde una planta en Lermo, un pueblo
industrial en el centro de Mexico. Pero varios anos antes de
firmarse el TLC, los ejecutivos de Walmi decidieron que el futuro
estaba en las exportaciones y se trasladaron a Saltillo, a un dia
en auto de la frontera con Texas, donde modernizaron sus tecnicas
de produccion, los metodos administrativos y las practicas de
ventas. ``Es un proceso largo y todos tienen que participar,'' dice
Covarrubias. ``Las companias que se modernizaron pueden aprovechar
todos esos cambios, pero las que creyeron que las cosas en realidad
nunca cambiarian lo pagan caro.''
 &HT;    Hoy, Walmi vende filtros de aire tanto a fabricantes de autos
como al mercado de piezas de repuestos, asi como filtros especiales
a companias como Ingersoll Rand. La empresa gano el Premio Nacional
de Exportacion de Mexico en 1997 por su desempeno en los mercados
en Estados Unidos y Canada, y recientemente firmo un contrato con
una compania alemana tras asistir a una feria comercial en
Hamburgo. Covarrubias cerro el almacen de la empresa en Laredo,
Texas, al darse cuenta de que con el TLC, las habituales demoras
burocraticas en la aduana eran c osa del pasado.
 &HT;    Algunas empresas grandes lograron convertir rapidamente sus
operaciones dirigidas al mercado interno en operaciones
exportadoras: Goodyear de Mexico y la mayor parte de los
fabricantes de autos asi lo hicieron en 1995. Pero Walmi es un caso
tipico de las companias pequenas que necesitaron varios anos para
dar ese paso.
 &HT;    Techtube de Mexico, una aceria independiente de alta tecnologia
de Mexico D.F., con 150 empleados, se fundo en 1990 y comenzo a
exportar en 1995. Pero eso ocurrio dos anos despues que la empresa
decidio comprar equipos por varios millones de dolares a
suministradores especializados de Francia, Italia y Alemania para
producir tubos y juntas de acero inoxidable de gran calidad. ``El
TLC fue un detonador de toda nuestra inversion, porque vimos una
gran oportunidad de exportar a Estados Unidos y logramos calcular
el rendimiento de nuestras inversiones debido al tratado,'' dice
Sergio Espinoza, gerente de exportaciones de la compania.
``Queriamos competir contra los grandes. Es ahi cuando uno descubre
lo que sabe, y aprende mas rapido.''
 &HT;    Hoy, Techtube vende aproximadamente la mitad de su produccion en
Mexico: suministra tubos de acero para la nueva planta del coloso
cervecero Grupo Modelo en Zacatecas y para otras grandes empresas.
Exporta la otra mitad a Estados Unidos y Canada, y el resto a
America Latina.
 &HT;    El TLC tambien ha atraido a firmas extranjeras interesadas no
solo en atender el mercado mexicano, sino tambien en utilizar a
Mexico como plataforma de exportaciones a Estados Unidos. Mexico
recibio US$12 millones en inversion extranjera directa en 1997, mas
que cualquier pais latinoamericano excepto Brasil, que todavia no
ha terminado de privatizar enormes empresas estatales.
 &HT;    Mexico supero a China como mayor exportador de productos
textiles a Estados Unidos en 1998, impulsado por el auge de las
maquiladoras. General Motors y el gigante canadiense del transporte
y las finanzas Bombardier unieron fuerzas para ensamblar
locomotoras en Mexico. Las piezas grandes se envian desde las
plantas de GM en Estados Unidos a la instalacion de Bombardier en
Mexico para el ensamblaje, y luego se venden en toda Latinoamerica.
Delphi, filial de piezas de repuesto de GM, ya es la mayor fuente
privada de empleos en Mexico, con mas de 27.000 trabajadores.
``Creemos que Mexico se fortalecera cada vez mas,'' dice Tom
Glaser, ejecutivo de la firma norteamericana de camiones Contract
Freighters, Inc. ``Mas fabricas estadounidenses se trasladaran a
Mexico y hara falta llevar mas piezas y componentes de Estados
Unidos.''
 &HT;    Sara Lee, la gran empresa norteamericana diversificada, aunque
no ha abierto nuevas plantas en Mexico, ha visto un cambio en la
produccion al reducirse los costos generales de los productos
libres de aranceles bajo el TLC. ``No hemos dependido tanto del
Lejano Oriente para nuestras necesidades de abastecimiento,'' dice
Peggy Carter, portavoz de Sara Lee. Carter agrego que las plantas
mexicanas han aumentado su capacidad de competencia bajo el TLC.
 &HT;    Los productos textiles son un buen ejemplo de la correspondencia
entre los aspectos complementarios de la economia de Mexico con los
de Canada y Estados Unidos y como han beneficiado a las companias y
su capacidad de competir en otros mercados. Antes de que el pacto
comercial entrara en vigor, Quaker Fabric Corp., una empresa textil
estadounidense con ventas anuales de US$200 millones, no consiguio
una licencia para exportar sus productos a Mexico. Pero desde que
se implemento el TLC, la compania ha abierto oficinas en Mexico
D.F. y en Guadalajara, donde 150 de los 2.300 empleados de la
compania en Estados Unidos deben sus trabajos a la nueva corriente
de ingresos por concepto de exportacion.
 &HT;    ``Es una asociacion natural,'' dice Larry Liebenow, presidente
ejecutivo de Quaker Fabric. ``En Estados Unidos se hacen productos
mas complejos, como hilazas y telas para tapizado. Las operaciones
de corte y costura se trasladan a Mexico. Ya hace varios anos que
ese negocio se saca de Estados Unidos. Pero con el TLC, la ropa se
mueve de Asia a Mexico, y eso es importante porque los fabricantes
mexicanos de ropa compran mucha tela estadounidense como materia
prima.''
 &HT;    Ademas del TLC y la ubicacion en Mexico, las companias
canadienses han establecido operaciones de manufactura en Mexico
debido a la fuerza laboral productiva y calificada, explica Andres
Darvasi, presidente de la Camara Canadiense de Comercio en Mexico y
director de mercadeo y ventas de las operaciones de Bombardier en
Mexico.
 &HT;    Al mismo tiempo, el TLC ha divulgado en Canada las oportunidades
existentes en Mexico, agrega.
 &HT;    ``El TLC ha aportado beneficios considerables a las empresas
canadienses,'' dice Katherine Funtek, secretaria comercial de la
embajada de Canada en Mexico. ``Entre los numerosos aspectos
positivos estan un mejor acceso al mercado mexicano, especialmente
en areas que antes tenian un gran proteccionismo, como las piezas
automotrices, los equipos y los servicios de transporte, el gas
natural y los productos textiles.''
 &HT;    Otras ventajas son la creacion de mecanismos eficaces para
solucionar disputas y una mayor transparencia y acceso a las
adquisiciones gubernamentales, dice Funtek.
 &HT;    La economia canadiense tambien se ha beneficiado de un
incremento de su capacidad competitiva, agrega.
 &HT;    Como resultado de todos estos cambios causados por el TLC, la
inversion extrajera de empresas de Estados Unidos y Canada supera
con creces los fondos que provienen de otras partes del mundo y su
importancia crece. En efecto, la estabilidad que da un tratado
multilateral ha persuadido a las empresas a desviar la inversion
destinada a otros centros manufactureros tradicionales hacia
Mexico.
 &HT;    Las empresas esperan aprovechar sus inversiones en Mexico mas
alla de las fronteras del TLC. Las plantas mexicanas de fabricantes
de autos como General Motors, Ford y Chrysler, Nissan (Japon) y
Volkswagen (Alemania) han aumentado su presencia, y en 1997,
enviaron casi un millon de vehiculos a distintas partes del
planeta. Samsung (Corea), Sony (Japon) y otras empresas de
electronica han convertido a Tijuana en la capital mundial de la
produccion de televisores. ``El TLC es el motor de todo este
crecimiento,'' dice Horacio Ojeda, director de planeamiento de
negocios en el departamento de fibras de las operaciones mexicanas
de DuPont. ``Pero es mas que eso. Tambien queremos exportar a
Europa, America Latina y Asia.''
 &HT;    Aun no se han determinado con exactitud otros efectos indirectos
del TLC. En Mexico D.F. crece la demanda de buenos inmuebles por
parte de firmas extranjeras. Y con la invasion de empresas
industriales, hay una gran competencia entre bufetes, contables,
consultores y otras firmas de servicios.
 &HT;    Sin embargo, al margen de este exito, a los escepticos les
preocupa que Mexico no este haciendo lo suficiente para aprovechar
el TLC. Despues de todo, la ventaja competitiva que le da el acceso
privilegiado al mercado estadounidense desaparecera si Estados
Unidos firma pactos comerciales similares (como el ALCA) con otros
paises de America Latina o en otras regiones. ``En la practica,
dejamos el desarrollo del pais a la iniciativa de cada individuo,''
comenta el economista Rubio. ``No hay nada malo en eso, pero no es
suficiente. La realidad es que solo una pequena parte de los
mexicanos recogen los frutos del TLC.''
 &HT;    Mexico aun necesita mejoras internas para cimentar su capacidad
de competencia, sobre todo en la educacion y los servicios
financieros. Para consolidar su ventaja y distribuir las ganancias
entre segmentos mayores de la poblacion, Mexico debe resolver estas
apremiantes debilidades, senala Rubio.
 &HT;    Es cierto que Mexico necesitaba y necesita empleos de bajo
nivel, pero al entrar el TLC en su segundo quinquenio, esperan
aumentar los salarios y las ganancias con productos mas complejos.
El TLC ya ha creado una de las zonas comerciales de crecimiento mas
rapido de todo el mundo con el comercio entre Mexico y EU. Pero en
Mexico, el TLC significa cambio, y el cambio que tiene lugar bajo
el TLC debe verse mas bien como una evolucion.

 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MEXICO CITY _ In Mexico, NAFTA stands for change. Five years
after it took effect, NAFTA has become the leading impetus for the
far-reaching transformations sweeping the world of Mexican
business. Open markets and competition have obliged executives to
rethink their companies, pushing them to face up to the challenge
of free trade. And, during the economic crisis of 1995, NAFTA threw
a life-line to hundreds of Mexican companies, even as unfettered
foreign competition helped push weaker firms out of business.
 &HT;    The North American Free Trade Agreement has given a turbo boost
to commerce between Mexico and the United States, and turned Canada
into Mexico's second-largest trade partner, with interregional
trade growing at double-digit rates and causing huge traffic jams
at border highway crossings and rail yards. ``NAFTA constitutes one
of Mexico's greatest competitive advantages,'' says Luis Rubio, a
noted economist who is director of Mexico's Center for Development.
``It is an exceptional tool for the development of the Mexican
economy, attracting much foreign investment that translates into
jobs, technology transfer, indirect export opportunities through
supply chains, and training for workers and executives. In
addition, it generates secure access to the U.S. market.''
 &HT;    The effects on companies in the United States and Canada have
been positive as well, though more modest in scope. In many ways,
the trade accord simply ratified and codified trends in
manufacturing sectors such as textiles and automotive trades. But
for companies in other industries, and for smaller companies that
had not previously considered exporting, NAFTA has provided a
window of opportunity to increase sales and rationalize costs.
While the macroeconomic effect on the two larger countries has been
minimal, for companies that have directly benefited from the new
markets, NAFTA is exciting and successful.
 &HT;    Indeed, on a company-by-company level, some patterns are
emerging as to how NAFTA is affecting the way companies do business
in North America. The last five years have seen a major increase in
cross-border joint ventures and foreign direct investment,
especially in Mexico. Relocation of labor-intensive manufacturing
processes to Mexico _ not only from Canada and the United States,
but from Central America, the Caribbean region and even as far away
as Asia _ has occurred, especially in automotive, electronic and
textile work, the three leading trade segments under NAFTA. ``NAFTA
has made it possible for manufacturing companies to make decisions
based purely on manufacturing costs,'' says Chris Padilla, director
of international trade relations for U.S. imaging company Eastman
Kodak, which recently announced that it hopes to save US$1 billion
over two years by shifting production of its X-ray film processors
to Mexico, to add to assembly operations of one-use cameras and
printed circuit boards. Film production, a capital-intense process,
has been centralized at one U.S. plant for all North American
sales.
 &HT;    Any Mexican consumer with money to buy U.S. imports profits from
low tariffs. But most Mexicans, many of whom have seen their
purchasing power decline just as free trade rose in influence, are
not celebrating NAFTA. To millions of Mexicans, direct benefits
from the accord have been scarce.
 &HT;    Even from a corporate viewpoint, the benefits of open borders
are concentrated in several hundred world-class large companies and
a limited number of smaller ones with the pluck, luck and know-how
to crack export markets.
 &HT;    Mexico's overall exports have doubled since 1994, from US$60
billion annually to an expected $120 billion for 1998. Exports to
the U.S. have grown to nearly $100 billion, making Mexico the third
largest supplier of goods and services to the U.S. market after
Canada and Japan. With U.S. exports to Mexico at about the same
level, Mexico is the second-largest market in the world for U.S.
products.
 &HT;    Big Mexican companies have been clear winners. Grupo Alfa, a
$3.9 billion conglomerate, exports a quarter of its sales. Grupo
Desc and San Luis Corporaci have become major autoparts suppliers
to the U.S. market. Grupo Industrial Bimbo, a breadmaker, and Isaac
Saba, a textile magnate, both made multimillion-dollar acquisitions
in the United States in their respective fields during 1998.
 &HT;    Most small companies that make up the backbone of Mexico's
employment, if not its production, have been left out of the party,
lacking the resources to mount the market research and seek foreign
buyers, or _ due to diverse factors _ simply fail to compete in
global markets. Take Alejandro Hernandez, a metal stamper in Mexico
City. Back in the early 1990s, he was one of thousands who believed
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's pledge that free trade would
vault Mexico out of chronic poverty. So he took action, borrowing
about $90,000 in bank loans. With the money, he opened a small
metal-stamping shop to supply large industrial companies. But
Hernandez's dream turned sour. ``The competition was tough, really
tough. Little by little, we just couldn't keep up, even before the
peso devaluation,'' says Hernandez, who closed the shop in 1995 and
released 35 employees. ``Once the crisis struck, our interest
payments doubled and there was nothing to do but close. The loans
were too expensive and the market was too difficult. Our mistake
was believing the line that only by investing would we develop.''
Economists say that NAFTA is just one of many factors _ the Tequila
Crisis and the relentless pace of globalization among others _ that
have affected Mexico. Nonetheless, countless others found
themselves in similar situations, and as their companies turned
into the losers of free trade, they blamed NAFTA. Some free-trade
critics blamed the Mexican government's liberalization policies for
undermining the country's industrial base and paving the way for a
severe crisis. But others see things a bit differently. ``I think
NAFTA saved the Mexican economy during the crisis,'' says Alberto
Covarrubias, the director general of Walmi Transformer, a
450-employee company in the northern city of Saltillo that exports
air filters for automobile engines and specialty applications. ``I
don't know what the country would look like now without NAFTA.''
 &HT;    Walmi Transformer is one of an elite group of small and
medium-sized companies who saw free trade as inevitable and decided
to do something about it. The company once served the domestic
market from a plant in Lermo, an industrial town in central Mexico.
But several years before NAFTA was signed, Walmi executives decided
their future was in exports, so they moved to Saltillo, a day's
drive from the Texas border. And they launched a massive makeover
of the company's production techniques, management methods and
sales practices. ``It's a long process and you have to involve all
your people,'' says Covarrubias. ``But now, the companies that
transformed themselves can take advantage of all these changes,
while the companies that believed that things would never really
change are paying the price.''
 &HT;    Today, Walmi sells air filters to several automakers and the
auto aftermarket, as well as specialty filters to companies like
Ingersoll Rand. It won Mexico's National Export Prize in 1997 for
its market performance in the United States and Canada, and
recently signed a contract with a German company after attending a
trade fair in Hamburg. Covarrubias even closed the company's
warehouse in Laredo, Texas, realizing that with NAFTA, regular
bureaucratic delays at customs were a thing of the past.
 &HT;    A few large companies were able to turn operations geared to the
domestic market into export production in a short time: Goodyear de
Mexico and most automakers did so by 1995. But Walmi is typical of
smaller companies that needed several years to do it.
 &HT;    Techtube de Mexico, an independent, cutting-edge steel company
in Mexico City with 150 employees, was founded in 1990, and started
to export in 1995. But that was two years after it first decided to
buy several million dollars' worth of capital equipment from
specialized suppliers in France, Italy and Germany to produce the
technology to make top-grade stainless-steel pipes and joints.
``NAFTA was a detonator for our entire investment, because we saw a
big opportunity to export to the United States and we were able to
recalculate our return on investment because of the treaty,'' says
Sergio Espinoza, the company's export manager. ``We wanted to
compete against the big guys. You find out what you know, and you
learn faster.''
 &HT;    Today, Techtube sells about half its production in Mexico,
supplying tons of steel pipes for beer giant Grupo Modelo's new
plant in Zacatecas, and other large companies. It exports the other
half to the United States and Canada, and to the rest of Latin
America.
 &HT;    NAFTA has also attracted foreign firms interested not just in
serving the Mexican market, but also in using Mexico as an export
platform to the United States. Mexico received $12 billion in
foreign direct investment in 1997, more than any Latin American
country after Brazil, which is still in the process of selling off
huge state-owned companies.
 &HT;    Mexico overtook China as the single-largest supplier of textiles
to the United States in 1998, spearheaded by foreign firms'
maquiladora assembly-for-export plants. U.S. automobile maker
General Motors and Bombardier, the Canadian transportation and
finance giant, have joined forces to assemble locomotives in
Mexico. Major parts will be shipped from GM plants in the United
States to Bombardier's Mexico facility for assembly and then sold
throughout Latin America. GM's Delphi parts subsidiary is already
the largest private employer in Mexico, with over 27,000 workers.
``We believe that Mexico will continue to get stronger and
stronger,'' says Tom Glaser, an executive at U.S. trucking firm
Contract Freighters, Inc. ``More U.S. manufacturing plants will
relocate there and more parts and components will need to be hauled
from the U.S.''
 &HT;    Sara Lee, the giant U.S. apparel company, while not adding new
plant capacity to its existing Mexico operations, has seen a shift
in production as duty free goods under NAFTA reduce overall costs.
``We have not been as dependent on the Far East for our sourcing
needs,'' says Sara Lee spokeswoman Peggy Carter, who added that
Mexican plants have increased their competitiveness under NAFTA.
 &HT;    Textiles are a prime example of how the complementary aspects of
Mexico's economy with those of Canada and the United States fit
together and benefit companies' bottom lines and their ability to
compete in other markets. Before the trade accord took effect,
Quaker Fabric Corp., a U.S. textile company with $200 million in
annual sales, was unsuccessful in gaining a license to import its
products into Mexico. But since NAFTA, the company has opened
offices in Mexico City and Guadalajara, while 150 of the company's
2,300 U.S.-based workers owe their jobs to the new export revenue
stream.
 &HT;    ``What you are finding is a natural partnership,'' says Quaker
Fabric CEO Larry Liebenow. ``More sophisticated products like yarns
and upholstery, are being made in the United States.
Apparel-cutting and sewing is moving to Mexico. For years that is a
business that has moved out of the United States. But with NAFTA,
apparel is moving to Mexico from Asia, and that is important
because Mexican apparel makers buy a lot of U.S. fabric as raw
materials.''
 &HT;    In addition to NAFTA and Mexico's location, Canadian companies
have been drawn to set up manufacturing operations in Mexico due to
a highly qualified and productive workforce, says Andres Darvasi,
president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce in Mexico and
director of marketing and sales for the Mexico operations of
Bombardier.
 &HT;    At the same time, NAFTA has helped increase awareness in Canada
for the opportunities in Mexico, he says.
 &HT;    ``NAFTA has brought considerable benefits to Canadian
companies,'' adds Katherine Funtek, commercial secretary at the
Canadian Embassy in Mexico. ``Among the many positive aspects are
better access to the Mexican market, particularly in areas that
were previously highly protected, including automotive parts,
transportation equipment and services, natural gas [and textiles.''
 &HT;    Other benefits include the creation of effective trade dispute
settlement mechanisms and greater transparency in, and access to,
government procurement, she says. And, Canada's economy itself has
also benefited by the increased competitiveness, according to
Funtek. As a result of all this NAFTA-spurred change, foreign
investment from U.S. and Canadian companies far outstrips funds
coming from other parts of the world and is growing in importance.
Indeed, the perceived stability that a multilateral treaty provides
has persuaded companies to divert investment from other traditional
manufacturing centers to Mexico.
 &HT;    And companies expect to leverage their Mexican investment far
beyond the NAFTA region. The Mexican plants of automakers like
General Motors, Ford and Chrysler (all from the United States),
Nissan (Japan) and Volkswagen (Germany) have increased their
presence, and in 1997, shipped nearly a million vehicles around the
world. Samsung (Korea), Sony (Japan) and other electronics firms
have turned Tijuana into the world capital of television
production. ``NAFTA is fueling all this growth,'' says Horacio
Ojeda, the director of business planning at the fibers department
of the Mexico operations of U.S.-based energy and chemicals company
DuPont. ``But it's broader than that. We also want to export to
Europe, Latin America and Asia.''
 &HT;    Other indirect effects from NAFTA are still being played out.
Demand for top-quality real estate is rising in Mexico City, in
large part from foreign firms looking for expanded space. And with
industrial companies flocking here, law firms, accountants,
consultants and other service companies are racing to compete for
new business. Behind the success, though, skeptics worry that
Mexico is not doing enough to take advantage of NAFTA. After all,
its competitive advantage of privileged access to the U.S. market
will disappear if the U.S. signs similar trade agreements _ such as
the Free Trade Area of the Americas _ in the future with other
developing countries in Latin America or elsewhere. ``In practice,
we're leaving the country's development to the initiative of each
individual,'' says Rubio, the economist. ``There's nothing wrong
with that, but it's insufficient. The fact is that those who reap
the rewards of NAFTA are a small portion of Mexicans.'' Mexico
still needs to make internal improvements to cement its
competitiveness, particularly in education and financial services.
To consolidate Mexico's advantage and spread the gains among larger
segments of the population, says Rubio, Mexico must address these
pressing weaknesses.
 &HT;    Public and private sector officials are already seeking ways to
upgrade labor-intensive industries. True, Mexico needed and needs
the low-tech jobs, but as the trade accord enters into its second
five-year period, they hope to raise wages and earnings by
producing more complex products. NAFTA has already made U.S.-Mexico
commerce into one of the world's fastest-growing trade zones,
speeding trends that were already underway in the 1980s. But in
Mexico, NAFTA means change, and the ongoing change of NAFTA is best
thought of as evolution.

CLINTON DEFENDS TIMING OF ATTACK ON IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS AND ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton declared Wednesday night that the
timing of Wednesday's attack on Baghdad was determined by Iraq's
flouting of UN weapons inspectors and the coming of the holy month
of Ramadan _ not by impeachment hearings at home.
</P>
<P>
   After a surrealistic day that included calling out troops and
plotting strategy to avoid impeachment, Clinton defended the strike
against Iraq while briefly alluding to his troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam Hussein and the other enemies of peace may have thought
that the serious debate currently before the House of
Representatives would distract Americans or weaken our resolve to
face him down,'' the president said on the eve of a scheduled House
impeachment vote. ``But once more, the United States has proven
that although we are never eager to use force, when we must act in
America's vital interests, we will do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's 15-minute speech came about an hour after the strike
started _ and after Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott issued a
statement questioning the timing.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Clinton's national security team said they had been
preparing for the strike for a month and unanimously recommended
the strike Wednesday. In separate remarks, Defense Secretary
William Cohen, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, National
Security Adviser Sandy Berger, and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff General Hugh Shelton said the president's domestic troubles
never entered into consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am prepared to place 30 years of public service on the line
to say the only factor that was imnportant in this decision is what
is in America's national security interest,'' said Cohen, a former
Republican senator from Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The move to attack Iraq was in the works from Nov. 15 and a
tentative decision was made Tuesday night, when Clinton, Albright
and Berger, flying back from Israel, received a scathing report
from the UN weapons inspections chief about Iraq's efforts to
thwart inspections. In a conference call from the plane with Vice
President Al Gore, CIA chief George Tenet and other officials in
Washington, the president discussed the need for an attack, Berger
said.
</P>
<P>
   Late that night, he said, Cohen called Republican leaders to
tell them that an attack was likely, and Clinton called Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force One landed outside Washington at 1 a.m. Wednesday, and
by 3 a.m., Berger was briefing UN Secretary General Kofi Annan on
the president's preliminary decision to attack Baghdad. At 7 a.m.,
top US national security officials gathered in the White House
Situation Room while the Democrats and Republicans in Congress
prepared for afternoon party caucuses to discuss impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   After the morning meeting, Clinton met with his chief of staff,
John Podesta, to discuss impeachment and stopped by the regular
senior staff meeting to give his aides a pep talk. The president
admonished his aides to ``concentrate on the jobs we were sent here
to do (and) that ultimately the American people get it right, and
he believes that they will,'' according to White House press
secretary Joseph Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also met with Representative Amo Houghton of New York,
who is among a small group of Republican lawmakers who have said
they will vote no on impeachment. To work on his speech, the
president canceled an afternoon session with Representative
Christopher Shays, a Connecticut Republican who had opposed
impeachment but started wavering in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department and the White House had the nervous air of
households biding time while waiting for a storm to approach. At 1
pm, Albright and two aides, Elaine Shocus and Wendy Sherman, sat in
the middle of the State Department cafeteria, looking studiously
casual. Albright ate a piece of carrot cake and made small talk
with a couple of reporters who passed by.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, spokesmen for the White House, the State
Department and the Pentagon gave carefully choreographed remarks
about Hussein's violation. Other officials dropped broad hints that
an attack was imminent, and even joked about a long night ahead
with pizza dinners at the office.
</P>
<P>
   The first high-level remarks about the bombing came not from an
American, but from British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who set the
stage for his friend Clinton. Speaking in London, Blair denounced
Saddam Hussein as a ``a serial breaker of promises.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of a report by Richard Butler, the chief of the United
Nations weapons inspection team, Blair said, ``It is damning, it is
a catalogue of destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair, not Clinton, disclosed the Pentagon's name of the strike:
``Operation Desert Fox.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Clinton defended his timing, saying, ``The
situation presents a clear and present danger to the stability of
the Persian Gulf and the safety of people everywhere. The
international community gave Saddam one last chance to resume
cooperation with the weapons inspectors. Saddam has failed to seize
the chance. And so we had to act and to act now.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said the end of inspections would allow Iraq to
rebuild chemical, biological and nuclear weapons programs ``in
months, not years.''
</P>
<P>
   The president added, ``We acted  &UR; today &LR;  because in the judgment
of my military advisers, a swift response would provide the most
surprise and the least opportunity for Saddam to prepare.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's national security advisers said that the die was cast
for an attack in mid-November when the president pulled back on a
US missile strike, but vowed swift and decisive action if Hussein
broke his promise to cooperate with weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ``A failure to take action under those circumstances, I think,
would in fact impair our national security intersts for some time
to come,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   General Shelton said, ``We started planning, as we do in our
business, for the worst case. And we started looking at what the
windows of opportunity might be available.'' The exact timing, he
said, was driven by Butler's report and for the purpose of
achieving a tactical surprise.
</P>
<P>
   One official said Clinton and his advisers felt that the White
House should take advantage of good feeling in the Arab world
following Clinton's four-day trip to Israel, Gaza and the West
Bank. The White House felt that Clinton gave an uplifting speech in
Gaza, winning points with Arab countries by speaking emphatically
about Palestinians' frustrations, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the United States felt justified in the attack
because of a statement made last month by eight Arab nations _
including Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia _ that rebuffed Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   This year, like last year, Ramadan was a consideration. The
monthlong holy period starts when a new moon is spotted over Saudi
Arabia, probably Friday or Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to initiate military action during Ramadan would be
profoundly offensive to the Muslim world and therefore would damage
our relations with Arab countries and the progress we have made in
the Middle East. That is something we wanted very much much to
avoid, without giving Iraq a month's head start to prepare for
potential action against it.''
</P>
<P>
   Such explanations failed to convince several critics in
Congress. ``Never underestimate a desperate president,'' said
Representative Gerald B.H. Solomon, a New York Republican and
former Marine. ``The American people ought to be as outraged as I
am about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Bob Barr, a Georgia Republican who has led the
impeachment drive, called the timing ``highly suspicious.'' And
Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, noted
``cynicism'' about the timing.
</P>
<P>
   Those words echoed comments made by Representative Tom Delay,
the House majority whip, who said Clinton could not be trusted,
even when announcing the start of an attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm suggesting that the president of the United States cannot
be believed, and I think it's reflective in his foreign policy...
Saddam Hussein knows it, and that's why he jerks his chain all the
time,'' Delay said Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on CNN soon after the first missiles were launched,
former Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleberger said the timing
``smells to high heaven.'' Stepping up the criticism,
Representative Porter Goss, a Florida Republican who heads the
House Intelligence Committee, said he had arrived in Washington to
be ``totally blindsided'' by news reports that an attack was
already under way.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials all day vigorously defended Clinton's
timing on the military action, calling merely coincidental that
Butler's report would come just two days before the House was set
to vote on impeaching the president. But they firmly denied that
the president's decision-making was influenced by the upcoming
vote, which was delayed Wednesday night.

 &HT;    IMPEACHMENT DEBATE PLANS KNOCKED ASKEW BY IRAQ RAID
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans on Wednesday night delayed not
only impeachment proceedings against President Clinton, but also
final decisions on the procedure for conducting their historic
floor debate.
</P>
<P>
   While House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri insisted
that any impeachment debate should be postponed until military
hostilities with Iraq have ``completely ended,'' Speaker-designate
Bob Livingston of Louisiana said the historic debate would begin
``within the near future,'' possibly as early as Friday.
</P>
<P>
   When it convenes Thursday for what was expected to be the first
impeachment debate in 130 years, the House instead will approve a
resolution supporting the U.S. military forces the president
ordered into battle against Iraq on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Such a resolution could give both parties a somber forum for
airing their views. Some Republicans may repeat their suspicions
that the president ordered air strikes to derail the impeachment
proceedings, and Democrats may argue that the impeachment effort
should be shelved until the conflict with Iraq is over.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the House does begin the impeachment debate, much of
what happens will follow carefully scripted parliamentary
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The rules are simple, however. And while it appears unlikely
that Clinton can avoid becoming only the second president in
history to be impeached, the rules offer Clinton's allies plenty of
opportunities to defeat or to delay the four articles of
impeachment to be debated.
</P>
<P>
   The four articles of impeachment approved by the Judiciary
Committee came to the House bundled as one ``highly privileged''
resolution. The Republican leaders chose such parliamentary
packaging in order to make it more difficult for Democrats to
present censure as an alternative to impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Privileged resolutions are not subject to amendments. They
require an up-or-down vote, normally after only one hour of debate.
In view of the gravity of impeachment, though, it was expected that
the Republicans and Democrats would agree to expand this limit.
</P>
<P>
   But even the length of debate has been a matter of contention
between the two parties. Democrats want 36 hours of
around-the-clock debate, enough for all 435 members to speak five
minutes each _ the procedure used for the Persian Gulf war debate.
Republicans have offered six hours.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats could delay a final vote on impeachment well beyond
any time limit set by the Republicans, however, by making motions
to adjourn or to kill the resolution, which would require
time-consuming votes.
</P>
<P>
   But first, they are expected to make a final attempt to get a
censure resolution to the floor of the House over the steadfast
objections of the Republican leaders. It probably will happen this
way:
</P>
<P>
   _ A Democrat, probably Gephardt, will ask to be recognized by
the presiding officer, Rep. Ray LaHood, R-Ill. Gephardt will then
move that the privileged resolution containing the impeachment
articles be sent back to the Judiciary Committee with instructions
to replace it with a resolution of censure.
</P>
<P>
   _ A Republican will then challenge Gephardt's motion on the
grounds that censure is not germane to impeachment and is,
therefore, in violation of House rules. It will then fall to the
House parliamentarian, Charles Johnson, who is not affiliated with
either party, to rule on the motion.
</P>
<P>
   _ If Johnson rules that the motion is not germane, the
Democrats' last-ditch effort to avert Clinton's impeachment is
probably over. His ruling could be appealed by the Democrats and
overturned by a majority vote of the House, but in the past 60
years, the ruling of the House parliamentarian has been overturned
only four times.
</P>
<P>
   If the Republicans prevail on censure, the House would then
begin debate on the impeachment resolution. Each party would name a
floor manager to keep track of their debate time. At the end of the
debate, the vote would be taken. A simple majority of at least 218
of the 435 House members would send the matter to the Senate for
trial.
</P>
<P>
   A final matter would be another privileged resolution to appoint
``managers'' who would handle the Senate trial, and to determine
what authority the managers have, such as subpoena power.
</P>
<P>
   If the impeachment vote is delayed until the new Congress takes
office in January, another resolution appointing managers will have
to be considered by the new Congress. Since the Republican majority
shrinks by five seats in the new Congress, Democrats will have a
chance to resurrect their motion to recommit the impeachment
resolution to the Judiciary Committee.

CRITICS GIVE `PRIVATE RYAN' THEIR TOP AWARD 
</HEADLINE>
 (js) 
 By JANET MASLIN

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ War won out among the New York Film Critics Circle
Thursday as that group chose Steven Spielberg's fiercely immediate
World War II epic ``Saving Private Ryan'' as the best film of 1998.
``The Thin Red Line,'' the year's other, prettier and more
contemplative World War II film, was another winner, for both John
Toll's cinematography and for direction by Terrence Malick, the
maverick 1970s filmmaker who had been AWOL for two decades. The
split between these dueling battle dramas might have been the
biggest surprise of this year's voting had the group not also _ to
the astonishment of some of its 31 members _ chosen Cameron Diaz as
best actress for her performance in ``There's Something About
Mary.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick Nolte was voted best actor for his volcanic performance in
``Affliction,'' as a man struggling with mounting pressures and
coming to terms with his violently abusive father. On a
considerably lighter note, Bill Murray was named best supporting
actor for his role as a quixotic tycoon in ``Rushmore.'' And Lisa
Kudrow, the first member of the ``Friends'' cast to win such an
accolade for film work, was voted best supporting actress for her
role as a wisecracking, lonely cynic in ``The Opposite of Sex.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare in Love'' was cited for its sparkling screenplay
by Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard, imagining an Elizabethan theater
filled with present-day chicanery and a young playwright spinning
``Romeo and Juliet'' out of his own thwarted romance. And the group
gave its best first feature award to Richard Kwietniowski's ``Love
and Death on Long Island,'' in which John Hurt plays a scholarly
Englishman obsessed with a Hollywood teen-movie hunk.
</P>
<P>
   As best foreign film, group members chose the Danish film ``The
Celebration,'' a rollicking stylistic experiment that depicts a
fractious family reunion, avoiding such conventional niceties as
lighting, makeup and props. The winning nonfiction was ``The Farm:
Angola U.S.A.,'' a galvanizing documentary about the lives of black
inmates serving long sentences in a Louisiana prison.
</P>
<P>
   Voting was most heated in the best actress category, where
Fernanda Montenegro and Renee Zellweger tied as runners-up to Ms.
Diaz. Ms. Montenegro is the Brazilian actress whose performance in
``Central Station'' evokes the great work of Giulietta Massina. Ms.
Zellweger played central roles in both ``A Price Above Rubies'' and
``One True Thing.'' In the best film category, Paul Schrader's
``Affliction'' was a close second, followed by Todd Solondz's
``Happiness.'' Solondz and Schrader were among those receiving
votes as best director, where Spielberg and John Boorman (``The
General'') also figured prominently in the voting. A strong
runner-up in the supporting actor category was Dylan Baker, who
plays a psychiatrist with a painful secret in Solondz's film.
</P>
<P>
   The awards will be presented in New York on Jan. 10. The group's
current chairman is Godfrey Cheshire of The New York Press.

MINNESOTA MINING WARNS OF 10% EARNINGS DECLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, one of the
nation's industrial and manufacturing giants, warned Wednesday that
slumping global sales and a slowdown at home would probably cut
fourth-quarter earnings 10 percent from the comparable year-earlier
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by 3M, which makes Post-it notes, Scotch tapes
and consumer health products, which sent the company's shares down
$2.375 each, to $71.375, is just the latest jolt to hit some of the
nation's largest corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Since late November, share prices have been sliding after a
sharp run-up in October, and that sell-off has been intensified by
unnerving news from Washington and the onset of the season when
U.S. companies traditionally warn Wall Street that they may not
meet expectations in their next quarterly report.
</P>
<P>
   The 3M announcement, which encouraged Wall Street to lower its
already bleak expectations, lengthens the list of ailing companies
that constitute the widely followed Dow Jones industrial average.
Of the 30 companies in that stock average, at least eight have
issued earnings warnings this month, and several others have
announced reorganization plans or huge layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The list, of course, is a Who's Who in corporate America:
Boeing; Coca-Cola; Merck; Sears, Roebuck; Union Carbide, and
Caterpillar. Boeing will cut 20,000 jobs in the next year;
Citigroup _ another Dow component _ also issued bad news on
Tuesday, saying it would cut 10,400 jobs, or about 6 percent of its
work force. The stock of a ninth company, Procter &AMP; Gamble, fell
sharply last week after it said growth in the number of products
sold would not meet expectations in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Those announcements have caused the Dow to fall 5 percent from
its all-time high over the last few weeks and, for a broader group
of investors, the parade of warnings has heightened concerns that
the nation's best and brightest companies continue to suffer from
the global economic turmoil that has swept Asia, Russia and Latin
America and even threatened to topple a seven-year-long bull market
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going through the same thing we've gone through in the
last few quarters: management is saying things aren't as good as
they used to be,'' said Marshall Acuff, the chief market strategist
at Salomon Smith Barney. ``There are increasing pressures on profit
margins for more and more companies; and that pressure is
intensifying.''
</P>
<P>
   The 3M warning _ which comes a day after Caterpillar advised of
earnings trouble _ is the third time the company has issued a
warning in the last five quarters and signals what could be the
company's first profit-growth retreat in seven years. It also comes
on the same day that shares of Dow Chemical and other chemical
companies plunged after Eastman Chemical, one of the largest
producers of plastic bottles, forecast sharply lower earnings
because of falling demand and prices in Asia and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Although 3M, which is based in St. Paul, will see earnings
growth this year, sales growth is slowing around the globe and the
company is continuing with a plan announced earlier this year to
cut 4,500 jobs, about 2,000 by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 percent of 3M's business comes from overseas, and in
Latin America and Asia, excluding Japan, sales are down sharply. In
Japan and Europe, sales growth continues, but moderately. But
currency translation is hitting the company hard, a spokesman said,
and will reduce per-share earnings about 7 percent in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Because global manufacturing is slumping, along with commodity
prices, demand for 3M products, including even highway reflector
signs in the United States, are slumping.
</P>
<P>
   But 3M's predicament is overshadowing much of the manufacturing
sector in America. A glut of steel is hurting the steel industry
and slackening demand for construction and farm equipment is
hurting companies like Deere and Caterpillar.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts say that although many large companies are
facing pricing pressure or the inability to raise prices in a
competitive environment, the hardest hit companies appear to be in
the manufacturing sector, which may be why the Dow average, which
is more heavily weighted with industrial companies, is lagging
behind other indexes that are more technology heavy.

NETANYAHU GOES ON THE OFFENSIVE IN CALLING FOR EARLY ELECTIONS 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu endorsed
early elections Wednesday in a bid to escape the prospect that he
would lose a crucial vote of no confidence next week in the
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's bold move put him on the offensive against his
political foes. It also effectively put the U.S.-brokered Wye River
peace agreement, which mandates more transfers of West Bank land to
the Palestinians, on hold for an election campaign that could last
several months.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials were angered by the move. ``He had to
choose between maintaining himself as the prime minister,
maintaining his coalition or maintaining the peace process,''
Palestinian senior negotiator Saeb Erekat told Reuters.
``Unfortunately, he chose to sacrifice the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite frantic back-room negotiations, it appeared that
Netanyahu was having difficulty mustering the 61 votes needed in
the 120-seat Parliament both to defeat the no-confidence motion and
to kill an opposition bill for new elections.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition Labor Party officials said they had enough votes to
win either motion.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu presented what he called principals for peace, which
included past demands. Palestinians, he said, must renounce
aspirations for statehood and a capital in east Jerusalem. They
must also accept the prisoners Israel releases, stop inciting
violence against Israelis, seize all illegal weapons in
Palestinian-controlled areas and reduce the ranks of the
Palestinian police force.
</P>
<P>
   Any politician who accepted these principles, he said, was
welcome to join his government.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that by setting out a list of principles likely to
please right-wing members of his government, Netanyahu may be able
to keep his disintegrating coalition together for the no-confidence
vote. Those members have threatened to withdraw support if
Netanyahu complies with the Wye River accord and transfers more
West Bank land to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say now from the start, if there isn't the necessary
majority to support these principles, I will call for early
elections in order to get from the people the necessary mandate to
achieve a real peace,'' Netanyahu said. ``We are walking this road
with deep conviction that there is no other way to reach peace with
security and reciprocity.''
</P>
<P>
   Ehud Barak, leader of the opposition Labor Party, which had been
supporting Netanyahu on votes crucial to furthering peacemaking
with the Palestinians, said his party had no plans to join
Netanyahu's government in a unity coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of a (coalition) can be created with a government
that gives in to extremists, ruins the economy and ruins the
society?'' Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu said that he would present the list of principles to
his coalition Sunday and to the Parliament on Monday, the day on
which the motion of no-confidence was expected to be debated.
</P>
<P>
   His problems worsened Wednesday when his finance minister,
Yaakov Neeman, resigned. Neeman said the ruling coalition had
ceased functioning, ``the public coffers are no longer guarded, and
every legislator, faction or party acts as if they are his own.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, at least three members of Netanyahu's own Likud Party _
former Science Minister Benny Begin, former Finance Minister Dan
Meridor and Michael Kleiner, who heads a extra-parliamentary group
called the Land of Israel Front _ said they favored holding early
elections. And the leadership of a centrist coalition party, the
Third Way, said its members were also likely to vote for new
elections.
</P>
<P>
   By calling for new elections, Netanyahu can avoid an appearance
of weakness, analysts said. Moreover, he, not his political foes,
would be able to decide the date for the elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``This way, he's setting the time, he's in control,'' said
Reuven Hazan, a political analyst at Jerusalem's Hebrew University.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quicker he calls for elections, the more he catches them
off guard,`` Hazan said. ``He doesn't want to look like elections
were thrust upon him at a time that was quite uncomfortable for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   If Netanyahu can make a deal with Labor, together they can
choose the election date, possibly as early as the end of April.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, by setting out principles for peacemaking with the
Palestinians, he might be able to pull disgruntled right-wingers
back into the fold. And, if elections do take place, he has set out
a platform of ``tough peacemaking'' that could appeal to the
political center, the analysts said. And, he shifts blame for the
failure of the peace agreement to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Yet by going to new elections, Netanyahu is taking a risk. The
latest opinion polls suggest Netanyahu is trailing Barak by 44
percent to 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Against another politician, former army chief of staff Amnon
Lipkin-Shahak, Netanyahu trailed 52 percent to 35 percent

SUIT WILL DEMAND END TO LOGGING IN NATIONAL FORESTS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr .   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A coalition of environmentalists plans to sue the
Forest Service on Thursday, demanding an end to logging in national
forests on grounds that the federal timber program causes more
economic harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental groups, led by Friends of the Earth and Forest
Guardians, assert that the Forest Service routinely ignores laws
and regulations that require it to calculate the economic costs of
logging, such as damage to water resources or tourism, and to weigh
them against the benefits, such as the value of the timber that is
sold.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, the lawsuit upends the typical dispute between
business groups who say that environmental regulations cost more
than they are worth, and environmentalists who usually argue that
the benefits of strict environmental rules cannot be expressed in
dollars. For years, the environmentalists have been fighting
attempts in Congress to require cost-benefit tests. Now they are in
court seeking exactly that.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit has been joined by recreation, hunting and fishing
organizations, owners of small forest lots, tourism enterprises and
others who say they have been harmed economically by the logging
program.
</P>
<P>
   It is supported by some prominent natural resource economists
who contend that is is possible to measure the worth of forests
that are not logged _ and indeed that these values probably far
exceed the worth of the timber they hold and the jobs that are
created by logging.
</P>
<P>
   The suit is to be filed in federal district court for Vermont,
in Burlington, said Brian Dunkiel, a staff lawyer for Friends of
the Earth. It follows a year-long campaign in which the
environmentalists filed administrative appeals with the Forest
Service challenging hundreds of individual timber sales by the
service, including in the Green Mountains National Forest in
Vermont, on similar grounds, only to be rebuffed repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law requires the Forest Service to account for net
economic and social values,'' Dunkiel said. ``It is almost as
though the Congress had hired the Forest Service to serve as the
public's accountant, to manage these assets. What has become clear
is that the Forest Service has failed terribly.''
</P>
<P>
   James Lyons, the undersecretary of agriculture for natural
resources, said he had not seen the complaint and could not address
its specifics.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an organization we are certainly moving in a direction that
takes into account all the resources,'' Lyons said. ``We are
seeking to improve, if not maximize, net public benefits. Our
analysis is not focused solely on timber production.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not what we take out of the woods, it's what we leave
behind that really matters.''
</P>
<P>
   The coalition's lawsuit relies on a new but increasingly
influential theory among ecologists that it is possible to put a
monetary price on the public benefits that flow from healthy
ecosystems, such as providing habitat for commercial species,
protecting drinking water reserves, providing recreation and
helping control global warming.
</P>
<P>
   It comes at a time when the federal timber program, in which the
Forest Service auctions off its trees to commercial companies, is
under challenge on many fronts. The Clinton administration is
considering sweeping new forest policies aimed at protecting the
last pristine stands of trees in roadless areas, and anti-logging
forces have proposed legislation in Congress that would restrict
logging and road construction in tens of millions of acres in
national forests.
</P>
<P>
   But some conservationists have complained that the
administration's approach exempts major forests from protection,
and the legislation has virtually no chance of being enacted
because pro-logging lawmakers control committees in the House and
Senate that have jurisdiction over forests.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the plaintiffs in the suit are seeking to force the
Forest Service to stop logging until it obeys what they say are the
requirements of existing laws and rules.
</P>
<P>
   In documents prepared for the lawsuit, John Talberth, the
executive director of Forest Guardians, presents the results of a
broad review he conducted of the professional literature describing
what he called generally accepted standards for measuring the
values of forests and the costs of logging them.
</P>
<P>
   He also presents results of a survey of hundreds of timber sale
documents obtained from the Forest Service, which he said
demonstrated that the agency ``has failed to incorporate
significant information about the socio-economic values of unlogged
national forests into timber sale program decisions.''

 &HT;    Hunter sees no quick fix for NBA
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Union chief Billy Hunter on Wednesday dismissed any
chance of a resolution of the NBA labor situation by Christmas and
suggested Feb. 1 as a start for the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're gonna (negotiate next), it will be between Christmas
and New Year's,'' Hunter said in a telephone conference call with
the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Sarcasm dripping, Hunter said he was not ``overly concerned''
about reaching an agreement that will end the NBA lockout and
provide for a ``42, 44 to 50, 55-game season.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at (NBA commissioner David Stern), and he will be the
one who will decide when we get a deal. Obviously, his timeline
isn't affected by getting a deal before Christmas, not if he's
going to Aspen, Colo.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern is scheduled to leave on a skiing vacation Friday, but the
league pointed out that he will be in telephone contact and can
return to New York in a matter of few hours.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, however, refused to take issue with a Tuesday Associated
Press story that said a resolution could be achieved with about 24
hours of hard bargaining. ``We're prepared to compromise. I think
that can be done in a few days. First, they have to come to the
table with that mind-set.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter listed five points as most contentious: restoration of
the middle class in salaries, increase in minimum salaries,
percentage of basketball-related income, duration of rookie
contracts and details of an escrow clause.
</P>
<P>
   He said he already has made substantial concessions in agreeing
to limits on contracts for players in their first six seasons in
the league and on high-end salaries but said they had not been
enough to satisfy the league.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter also said that the NBA had demanded preconditions for an
agreement and that he would not go along with such a demand. He
also asserted that he is the one who makes the call that starts
each negotiating session and that now he will wait for the league
to call.
</P>
<P>
   Stern disputed that assertion, stating that he initiated last
week's two negotiating sessions.
</P>
<P>
   On a related topic, Hunter disagreed with a news magazine report
that indicated racial tensions have contributed to the impasse.
``It's all about dollars, hard economics,'' Hunter said. ``If
things don't go right or tempers flare, the first reaction is it
has to be racial.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks' Steve Smith agreed. ``This is a financial issue,''
Smith said, ``and nothing more than that.

 &HT;    5 Falcons in Pro Bowl, but not Archambeau
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Five Atlanta Falcons made the NFC's Pro Bowl roster
Wednesday, as middle linebacker Jessie Tuggle, free safety Eugene
Robinson, cornerback Ray Buchanan and running back Jamal Anderson
got starting nods. Quarterback Chris Chandler will be a reserve.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the fifth Pro Bowl for Tuggle, 33, the third for
Robinson, 35, the second for Chandler, 33, and the first for
Buchanan, 27, and Anderson, 26.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler, whose 96.2 passer rating is fourth-highest in the NFL,
has completed 176 of 305 passes (57.7 percent) for a career-high
2,890 yards and a Falcons-record 21 touchdowns with 12
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says a lot about the Falcons, and the recognition we've
gotten. I think we can look at it and feel like there should be
more (Falcons),'' said Chandler, who last year went to the game as
an alternate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very satisfying personally, especially in this
conference, when you have Brett Favre and Troy Aikman, and they're
playing well. It's kind of a reward for two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Chuck Smith and left tackle Bob Whitfield are
first alternates, but the most glaring omission was left defensive
end Lester Archambeau, who was not listed among the first four
alternates at his position.
</P>
<P>
   Archambeau is fourth on the team with 74 tackles on a defense
that is ranked No. 7 overall in the NFL and No. 2 against the run.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the numbers ... and for Lester Archambeau to not
even get mentioned is a crying shame. It's ridiculous, really,''
said Rich Brooks, interim head coach and defensive coordinator.
``He's got (a team- and carer-high) 10 sacks, following 8.5 last
year, he's caused (a team- and career-high) seven fumbles. ... All
he does is play at a Pro Bowl level.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuggle, who has led the team in tackles nine years in a row, is
tied with linebacker Cornelius Bennett, a third alternate, for the
team lead with 105. He made Pro Bowls in 1992, '94, '95 and '97.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson is third with 81 tackles, has three interceptions, one
returned for a touchdown, two fumbles forced and one recovered. He
made the AFC team while playing for Seattle in '92 and '93.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan leads the NFC with seven interceptions, has 53 tackles
and has broken up a team-high 15 passes.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is second in the NFL with 1,596 rushing yards, has a
franchise-record 10 games with 100 or more rushing yards, and is on
pace to carry the ball 414 times, which would be an NFL record. He
also has scored 13 touchdowns, second in the NFC.
</P>
<P>
   Pro Bowl voting is done by players, fans and coaches, each
counting one-third.

 &HT;    Duties shuffled with Reeves out
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Falcons' first practice without coach Dan Reeves
looked pretty much like any other, except that he was nowhere to be
found.
</P>
<P>
   But while he recovers in Piedmont Hospital from Monday's bypass
surgery, there were subtle differences at team headquarters in
Suwanee.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant head coach/defensive coordinator Rich Brooks, serving
as interim head coach, conducted the morning news conference.
</P>
<P>
   And when trainer Ron Medlin and team physician Andrew Bishop got
a second opinion from orthopedist James Andrews on the condition of
linebacker Cornelius Bennett's sprained left knee, the news was
relayed first to Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   Also, where Reeves normally wears the headset at practice and
radios plays to quarterback Chris Chandler, on Wednesday backup
quarterback Steve DeBerg was on the headset.
</P>
<P>
   The original plan for Sunday's game at Detroit (5-9) was to have
quarterbacks coach Jack Burns continue calling plays from the
coaches' box, with running backs coach George Sefcik relaying them
via radio headset to Chandler. Reeves normally calls in plays after
getting them from Burns. Sometimes, Reeves changes them.
</P>
<P>
   It appears now that DeBerg will be involved in that role.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little bit different not seeing Dan out there and not
hearing his input,'' Chandler said. ``But I feel good working with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns said, ``We may put Steve on the headset sometimes to
communicate with Chris because we all work together so much in
meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks will continue calling defenses from the coaches' box, and
will talk to several people on the sideline via radio Sunday,
including general manager Harold Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than watch from the press box, Richardson, who has 12
years of college coaching and nine years of pro coaching experience
(New Orleans and Denver), will be Brooks' connection with game
officials. He'll also instruct Falcon captains what to do when they
have decisions to make regarding penalties _ after Brooks makes the
command decision and relays it to Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to keep everybody's role as close to normal as
possible,'' Brooks said. ``I'll have Harold Richardson on the phone
with me ... so we can keep defensive and offensive coaches doing
what they were doing before.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves update
</P>
<P>
   Reeves continues to improve, and still looks to get out of the
hospital Friday. He might be involved in a limited role in
game-planning for the Dec. 27 home game against the Miami Dolphins.
He's trying to get involved before that, but his wife, Pam, has
other ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Reeves appears to be doing very well,'' Brooks said.
``He called in this morning, and he was up walking (Monday). I
think he wanted to get the offensive gameplan. He said he might get
out (today) or Friday, but I imagine they're trying to tie him to
his bed right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Special teams coach Joe DeCamillis, Reeves' son-in-law, said his
wife, Reeves' daughter Dana, said Reeves is trying to work from his
hospital bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``She made the comment (Tuesday) that he said yesterday morning
that he was already worried about who I was going to replace
(injured) Bob Christian with on the punt team,'' said DeCamillis.
</P>
<P>
   Answer man
</P>
<P>
   DeCamillis said Christian will be replaced as the up back on the
punting team by either cornerback Ronnie Bradford or linebacker
Craig Sauer. That player calls the blocking schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett report
</P>
<P>
   Bennett's trip to the Alabama Sports Medicine Clinic in his
hometown of Birmingham revealed nothing more than the MRI showed
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The left knee he sprained Sunday at New Orleans has small tears
to the anterior cruciate ligament but probably not enough to
prevent him from playing. He also has some bone bruises in the
joint.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, who is tied with middle linebacker Jessie Tuggle for
the team lead with 105 tackles, was not at practice Wednesday, but
stands a very good chance of practicing today, when he will test
the knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had some fluid taken off the knee (Tuesday),'' Brooks said.
``The knee is stable; it's not loose. It's not clear how much of
the damage is new, and how much is old. He went ahead and played
after the injury (Sunday) ... and played very well. We anticipate
him playing.'' If he doesn't play, rookie Keith Brooking, the
team's first-round draft choice, will start.
</P>
<P>
   Pro Bowl follow up
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the five Falcons named to the Feb. 7 Pro Bowl in
Honolulu, and first alternates in left tackle Bob Whitfield and
defensive end Chuck Smith, here are the other Falcon alternates:
Second alternates _ wide receiver Terance Mathis and kicker Morten
Andersen; third alternates _ Bennett, Christian, tight end O.J.
Santiago; fourth alternate _ defensive tackle Travis Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket talk
</P>
<P>
   Playoff tickets will go on sale to the general public at 9 a.m.
Saturday. They can be purchased at Ticketmaster outlets, or through
Ticketmaster by phone (404-249-6400), or at the Georgia Dome ticket
office. There will be about 27,000 available for a home game Jan. 2
or 3, or Jan. 9 or 10.
</P>
<P>
   Pro Bowl regular
</P>
<P>
   Tuggle is the fifth Falcon to be picked for five or more Pro
Bowls, joining defensive end Claude Humphrey and center Jeff Van
Note (six each), and linebacker Tommy Nobis and tackle Mike Kenn
(five each).
</P>
<P>
   Big numbers
</P>
<P>
   Mathis and wide receiver Tony Martin (59 catches, 1,034 yards,
five touchdowns) lead all NFL receiving tandems with 2,119 yards.
That's ahead of Minnesota's Randy Moss and Cris Carter, who total
2,115.
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Lester Archambeau did not practice Wednesday as he
rested his broken thumb, but he likely will practice today and is
sure to play Sunday. ... On the final Sunday of the regular season,
the Fox network's Terry Bradshaw will give out his ``Terry Awards,_
and running back Jamal Anderson will be honored for best dance _
``The Dirty Bird.

 &HT;    State environmental commissioners propose new air pollution
regulations
 &HT;    By Ralph K.M. Haurwitz
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Cleaner-burning and more expensive gasoline
would be required in Austin, San Antonio and the eastern half of
the state under air pollution rules the state's environmental
agency is likely to propose today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're proud to be a clean city, but we're coming up very close
to the limits,'' Austin City Council Member Gus Garcia told
commissioners for the Texas Natural Resource Conservation
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Austin and San Antonio are running just under the federal
standard for ozone, a gaseous pollutant formed from tailpipe
emissions and from vapors released during refueling.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals would require reduced levels of sulfur and vapor
pressure in gasoline sold in 110 counties. The vapor pressure
requirement would go into effect in May 2000 and the sulfur rule in
May 2003. Austin and San Antonio requested that the sulfur rule to
go into effect three years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline with lower vapor pressure and lower sulfur would cost
two to four cents more at the pump.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio Mayor Howard Peak said San Antonio wants to preserve
its status as the largest clean-air city in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The oil industry wants to market cleaner-burning gasoline but
does not favor a piecemeal approach with different formulas and
deadlines for various localities, said Cindy Morphew, vice
president of environmental affairs for the Texas Oil and Gas
Association.
</P>
<P>
   But Barry McBee, chairman of the conservation commission, said
Austin and San Antonio should have the option of moving as quickly
as possible. Complying with the ozone standard will be a tall order
for both cities even with cleaner gasoline, he said. Growing
populations, urban sprawl, industrial emissions and pollution
blowing in from other areas all are factors.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the effort is worthwhile not only for public health
reasons but also because cities in violation of the ozone standard
must undertake various burdensome clean-up measures, McBee said.
These include new regulations governing dry cleaners, painting
shops and other small businesses, as well as tough new restrictions
on industrial expansion. For example, a factory that wanted to
expand would have to ensure that emissions after the expansion were
lower than emissions before the expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental and consumer groups support cleaner-burning
gasoline. But some activists and three cities in East Texas urged
the conservation commission to ban the use of an additive, called
MTBE, to produce cleaner fuels. Some studies have found MTBE
contamination in drinking-water supplies. Jim Mathews, a lawyer
representing the cities of Tyler, Longview and Marshall, noted that
Maine is moving to end the use of the additive after traces were
found in 15 percent of its water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's proposal is expected to be silent on MTBE.
McBee said he would not support a ban on the additive because there
is great uncertainty on whether it poses a health threat.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioners initially voted Wednesday to propose the rules
on vapor pressure and sulfur but later rescinded that action to
fine tune an amendment by Commissioner Ralph Marquez. The amendment
would split the rules into two parts, one dealing with vapor
pressure and the other dealing with sulfur.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioners are expected to issue the proposal at a work
session today, said Andy Saenz, a spokesman for the agency.
Hearings will be held on the proposal, and public comments will be
accepted through Feb. 1. Final rules are expected to be adopted
later next year.

US, BRITAIN UNLEASH MISSILES ON RECALCITRANT IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH AND MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The United States and Britain struck Baghdad at
about 1 a.m. local time with a barrage of cruise missiles to punish
Iraq for blocking UN Nations weapons inspectors seeking to rid Iraq
of its most lethal weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The military attack, by far the largest strike against Iraq
during the Clinton presidency, came as congressional leaders agreed
to postpone a vote on impeachment scheduled for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In a televised address to the nation from the White House,
President Clinton said he had ordered a ``strong, sustained series
of air strikes against Iraq'' to ``degrade'' its capacity to
rebuild its nuclear, chemical and biological arsenals and to
destroy its capacity to threaten its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Warning that the operation could kill innocent Iraqis, Clinton
said he had exhausted all diplomatic options before making the
decision to use military force to punish Baghdad for not meeting is
obligations to scrap its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The costs of action must be weighed against the price of
inaction. If Saddam defies the world, and we failed to respond, we
will face a far greater threat in the future,'' Clinton said. ``The
hard fact is that so long as Saddam remains in power, he threatens
the well-being of his people, the peace of his region, the security
of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement carried Wednesday night by the official Iraqi
news agency, an unharmed Iraqi President Saddam Hussein defiantly
called on Iraq's armed forces and people to fight a U.S. and
British air assault. ``Our great people and our brave armed
forces...resist and fight them. Fight the enemies of God, the Arab
nation and humanity. God willing, you will be the victors.''
</P>
<P>
   At a Pentagon briefing, Secretary of Defense William Cohen
described a three-pronged attack against Iraq which includes: US
Navy aircraft flying from the decks of the U.S.S. Enterprise; US
Air Force and Royal Air Force aircraft flying from land bases; and
cruise missiles launched from Navy ships and B-52 bombers.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the military operation, dubbed Operation Desert Fox,
would continue until the United States had accomplished the goals
set by the president. He said he had decided to strengthen the
American military presence in the region in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the military assault included 36 combat aircraft,
including fighters, bombers and F-117 Stealth aircraft. He added
that there were already enough forces in the region to start an
attack without a further buildup.
</P>
<P>
   The strike began about five p.m. Wednesday afternoon, New York
time, as the UN Security Council was debating the fate of Iraq.
Council members emerged from the meeting to watch a CNN screen
showing the night sky above downtown Baghdad studded with explosive
light as Iraqi anti-aircraft guns fired at incoming American
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The military action prompted a strong reaction from Iraq's
allies on the council.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely no excuse or pretext to use force against
Iraq,'' Chinese ambassador Qin Huasun said as the council suspended
its closed door consultation. The action ``poses a threat to
international peace as well as regional security.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sad day for the United Nations and for the world,''
added UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, who undertook a number of
diplomatic efforts to secure Iraq's cooperation. ``My hopes are
with the people of Iraq and with the 307 united nations
humanitarian workers who remain in the country and with all others
whose lives are in danger.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the United Nations would be on hand to respond to the
humanitarian and diplomatic aid needed to heal the damage from the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   In London, Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair said the joint
US-British military action would hit military targets dearest to
Saddam Hussin. ``We have no option but to act,'' Blair said
Wednesday evening. ``We are taking every possible care to avoid
civilian casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   The President's top aides sought to portray the action as
necessary step to averting a more costly war with Baghdad in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   National Security Advisor Sandy Berger said that the president
acted with the unanimous backing of his national security advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have absolutely no doubt this is the right decision, this
is the right time,'' Cohen added.
</P>
<P>
   US and British officials said the United States decided to act
now to avoid offending its allies in the Arab world by beginning a
military strike during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which
begins Thursday evening and lasts for 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had delayed for even a matter of days from Chairman
Butler's report, we would have given Saddam more time to disperse
his forces and protect his weapons,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have tried to maximize our ability to strike quickly,
without any further warning,'' Cohen said. ``From a security point
of view, we decided that we had enough in place and could carry out
this operation with minimal notice and with minimal compromise of
the surprise element.''
</P>
<P>
   Military analysts estimated that the United States has 22 ships
in the theater of operations, including the lone US aircraft
carrier in the region, the Enterprise. The sea force will be joined
on Friday by another aircraft carrier, the Carl Vinson, and its
accompanying battle group, Cohen said. Additional ground troops are
also heading to the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will give General Zinni additional flexibility'' and
``increase the intensity and tempo of our strike operation if
necessary,'' said General Hugh Shelton, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen declined to provide any specific numbers about the force,
but independent military analysts said they believed the United
States had 25,000 troops and 220 planes in the region and available
for a protracted attack.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said the President made his decision after
receiving a damning report from Richard Butler, the chairman of the
UN Special Commission (UNSCOM) tasked with ridding Iraq of its most
deadly arms, on Iraq's failure to cooperate with the United Nations
team.
</P>
<P>
   The UN chief said Wednesday that Iraq has long engaged in a
systematic pattern of obstruction that has thwarted the UN's
ability to give Iraq a clean bill of health. ``From the inception
of the Commission's work in Iraq, in 1991, Iraq's cooperation has
been limited,'' Butler wrote in his 10-page report that served as a
green light for US military action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that UNSCOM has been ineffective for some time,''
said Berger at a briefing Wednesday night. `It can stay in Baghdad,
but it's a sham. To have a Potemkin UNSCOM in Iraq doesn't make
much sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Baghdad agreed to scrap all of its long-range missile and
nuclear, chemical and biological capabilities as part of a 1991
cease fire agreement ending the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   UNSCOM has already destroyed thousands of chemical and
biological warheads. But it continues to suspect that Baghdad still
possesses deadly nerve agents and missiles capable of striking
Israel or Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Since the United States called off a bombing raid on Nov 14,
Butler accused Iraq of routinely obstructing the inspectors. He
charged Baghdad of blocking at least three inspections by the
United Nations, refusing to hand over documents on its weapons
program, prohibiting photographs of warheads and harassing UN
inspectors, among other violations.
</P>
<P>
   Butler's highly critical report elicited charges from Russia
that the UN chief was looking for a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Russian UN Ambassador Sergei Lavrov called the Butler report
``outrageous'' and urged him to resign. During an emergency council
meeting, Lavrov said, ``If Butler thinks he cannot work in Iraq, he
should start looking for another job.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia's anger stemmed in part from Butler's decision to
withdraw more than 140 UN weapons inspectors from Iraq without
consulting Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   US ambassador Peter Burleigh warned Annan, Butler, and Benon
Sevan, the chief of the UN humanitarian aid workers, late Tuesday
night that the United States was urging non-essential American
diplomatic personnel to leave the region. And he urged them to
``consider prudent measures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no time,'' Butler said Wednesday. ``The Secretary
General was consulted, I talked to him and he agreed.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan's aides disputed Butler's claim. A senior UN official
said, ``The Secretary General was informed not consulted,'' on
Butler's decision to withdraw the UN inspectors. He added that
Annan would have preferred that the inspectors remain.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi UN Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon concluded Wednesday afternoon:
``We have done everything in our capacity. There is nothing else we
can do.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration's eagerness to strike
immediately after this latest challenge by Saddam Hussein to the
U.N. weapons inspectors marked a sharp break with past U.S.
practice, some senior administration officials said Wednesday, and
while Secretary of State Madeleine Albright talked to some 16
foreign ministers of the Security Council and European and Arab
allies, she did more informing than consulting.
</P>
<P>
   Her most heated conversation was with Russian Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov and only took place after the air strikes began,
officials said. The Russians have criticized the quick attack on
Iraq all day, and Albright rejected Ivanov's contention that the
main faults lie with U.N. inspectors and their chairman, Richard
Butler, and not Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she urged Ivanov to look beyond Iraq to more important
common interests Washington and Moscow share, including Russia's
own economic survival.
</P>
<P>
   France was also annoyed with Washington for getting Butler to
pull out his inspectors from Iraq without discussion with the
Security Council, for whom UNSCOM works. But Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine told the Americans that while France would not
oppose the strikes, given Baghdad's record, it would not publicly
endorse them.
</P>
<P>
   The United States won public support from its reliable allies
Japan and Canada while China joined Russia in angrily denouncing
the U.S. strike.
</P>
<P>
   And U.S. officials at the Pentagon and State Department were in
close touch all day with top Saudi officials, given the Saudi
willingness to let U.S. and British planes refuel from Saudi bases.
</P>
<P>
   But Albright did not speak with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, officials said. He issued a personal statement in New York
on Wednesday, calling this ``a sad day'' for the United Nations,
the world, and ``me personally,'' because of his failure to avert
the use of force despite great efforts.
</P>
<P>
   His sadness was justified, U.S. officials said, because
Wednesday's strikes also marked the end of a nearly eight-year
effort to police and disarm Iraq through the United Nations itself,
rather than through powerful Security Council members.
</P>
<P>
   The inspection regime of UNSCOM is largely dead, U.S. officials
say. Those inspectors are unlikely to be able to return to Iraq and
work freely, senior officials say. Instead, Washington will use
other forms of traditional containment, including continued
economic sanctions, threats, support for opposition forces and the
intermittent use of force to try to restrain Saddam. But few
officials believe that air power alone can eliminate the threat
posed by Iraq or its nuclear, biological and chemical programs.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the criticism Wednesday was America's timing and
lack of new consultation, and the fear that Clinton would be
perceived abroad, especially by Arab countries, for acting in his
own benefit to avoid rapid impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts, including some Western diplomats from NATO
countries, pointed to evidence that U.S. officials were working
closely with Butler, the UNSCOM chairman, and appear to have forced
the pace.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and allied officials said that Butler had coordinated some
of the terms of his report with U.S. officials in confidential
conversations on Monday. UNSCOM officials say they often consult
with Security Council members but are responsible for their own
conclusions and judgments.
</P>
<P>
   Senior U.S. officials argued that the surprise factor and the
imminence of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month that begins Saturday
night _ not the impeachment vote _ was forcing the schedule, but
analysts were not convinced, and did not think the world would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``When other confrontations with Iraq have dragged out for days
and weeks while the administration geared up for a possible
response, checked off all the diplomatic boxes and then usually did
not act, how is it possible that the bombing had to happen today?''
asked Robert Kagan of the Carnegie Endowment. ``A reasonable person
is logically forced to view this with a degree of cynicism.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Kagan acknowledged, Clinton had authorized similar
air strikes a month ago, then called them off when Saddam appeared
to capitulate and promise full compliance with the United Nations.
And U.S. officials emphasized at the time that they expected Saddam
to renege on his promises, because he always intended to keep a
core of biological and chemical weapons, and they would be able to
use force later with less international criticism.
</P>
<P>
   And analysts said they had considerable concerns, both about how
effective the bombing campaign will be to rid Iraq of the weapons
of mass destruction Unscom inspectors were prevented from
uncovering, and about how the bombing may or may not fit into the
larger strategy of ridding the world of Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Even presuming that Clinton and his foreign-policy team had no
political reasons to bomb Wednesday, said William Quandt, a former
National Security Council official under Presidents Nixon and
Carter, ``my qualms are about what happens the day after the
bombing stops.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam's a disaster, but will this get rid of him?'' Quandt
asked. ``We know what we want but we're not prepared to pay the
price to do it. Bombing is the compromise choice that makes us feel
better, that we're somehow punishing Iraq, though not necessarily
Saddam, and we won't take any significant risks of casualties
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, one senior official said, using force now is also an
important signal to the world that Clinton will act when he needs
to, despite his domestic difficulties.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday evening, Clinton defended the joint American-British
strikes, which he described as ``strong and sustained,'' and
intended to repress and degrade Iraq's ability to produce weapons
of mass destruction and use them against its neighbors. And
American officials said more explicitly that the attacks were also
designed ``to shake the regime'' by also targeting Saddam's
structure of power, including the Revolutionary Guard, his
communications facilities, his palaces and strongholds.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials also conceded that it is unlikely that the
Unscom inspectors will be able to return to Iraq and work freely,
and that in effect, the United States and Britain, acting on behalf
of the U.N. Security Council, had moved to a more traditional
containment policy. Rather than relying on Iraq, monitored by
Unscom, to disarm itself, Washington will now try to degrade Iraq's
capacities, rather than eliminate them, and to deter Saddam from
daring to use the terror weapons he may have.
</P>
<P>
   That policy includes an intention to strike later, again without
warning, if Iraq attempts to reconstitute its weapons of mass
destruction. It includes warnings to Saddam that he will be
obliterated if he uses such weapons, and attempts to keep harsh
economic sanctions on Saddam's regime, to limit its income.
</P>
<P>
   It also will include, Clinton said, more U.S. support for the
badly divided Iraqi opposition. That support was pressed on the
administration by the Congress this year in the $97-million Iraqi
Liberation Act.
</P>
<P>
   But senior U.S. officials say that efforts to replace Saddam
have failed badly in the past, and must be viewed as a long-term
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Officials joke that the money will provide the Iraqi opposition,
whose leaders live in London, with used American armored personnel
carriers in which to ride through Mayfair.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department announced that it is ordering the departure
of dependents and some other personnel from diplomatic posts in Tel
Aviv, Jerusalem and Kuwait because of military action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The order is an upgrade of earlier warnings. A general travel
advisory to Americans to use caution and review their security
practices was also updated from November to mention the new
military strikes.
</P>
<P>
   But officials said there was no specific threat that prompted
the warning.

ZIFF-DAVIS SEEKS OUT NEW REVENUE SOURCES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y., Ore, Pa.)  (dal) 
 By JANE L. LEVERE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Faced with a significant drop in computer and
software advertising, Ziff-Davis Inc., the publisher of
high-technology magazines, is pursuing new sources of ad income
from car, electronic commerce and other companies.
</P>
<P>
   According to Adscope, of Eugene, Ore., which tracks technology
advertising in 400 computer, telecommunications, special interest
and consumer publications, technology ad expenditures fell 4
percent in the third quarter compared with figures in the period a
year earlier. Revenue dropped 10 percent for computer and
telecommunications titles in particular. Adscope also said
third-quarter technology advertising revenues were down 8.7 percent
for Ziff-Davis and down 7 percent and 11.8 percent, respectively,
for its competitors IDG and CMP Media Inc. For the first nine
months of the year, compared with the period a year earlier, this
spending was down 6.9 percent for Ziff-Davis, down 1 percent for
CMP and up 5.2 percent for IDG, Adscope said.
</P>
<P>
   Claude Sheer, the former president of Ziff-Davis Publishing who
was recently named the company's chief Internet strategist,
attributed the decline in technology advertising to four factors:
computer companies diverting advertising money to solving the Year
2000 problem; the downturn in the Asian economy, which has
depressed computer sales in the region; consolidation within the
computer industry, which has cut into ad budgets, and fewer
introductions of new computer products, which has also diminished
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``If any one of these happened by itself, it would have been a
minor speed bump, but for all four to occur in one year, it's
gotten to be a pretty big deal pretty quickly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the decline, Ziff-Davis, which is 70 percent
owned by Softbank, a Japanese distributor of software, shut down
three of its 15 magazines, Internet Business, Equip and Windows
Pro, in October and laid off 10 percent of its work force of 3,500.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, it is revising its advertising strategy, going
after categories that have not traditionally promoted their
products or services in Ziff-Davis' titles.
</P>
<P>
   The largest of these categories is automotive advertisers, which
the publisher has pursued for the last several years, stepping up
its efforts during the summer. To reach this group, Ziff-Davis set
up an ad sales office in Detroit in June. It also commissioned a
study by ICR, a market research firm in Media, Pa., which it said
found that 10 million of the 71 million U.S. consumers who went
online in the third quarter researched a car or light-truck
purchase. According to Ziff-Davis, the survey also found that
online car researchers were twice as likely as the general
population to read a computer publication. And it said the
demographics of its readers, mostly college-educated males with
high household incomes, closely matched the demographics of online
auto shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Ziff-Davis said automotive advertising in its four titles that
carry car ads _ PC Magazine, PC Computing, Yahoo! Internet Life and
Family PC _ rose to 98.5 pages in the first nine months of this
year from 60 in the period a year earlier. New advertisers included
Volkswagen, Isuzu and Nissan; Ford, General Motors and Suburu
increased their buys.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic commerce companies are another category Ziff-Davis is
eager to cultivate. Companies that have already bought space
include Playboy.com, Cyberian Outpost and Catalogcity.com.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade Group Inc., the online investment company based in Palo
Alto, Calif., is about to sign an agreement with Ziff-Davis, worth
more than $5 million, to promote its services through Ziff-Davis'
magazines and on ZDTV and ZDTV.com, its cable television channel
and the channel's Web site. Officials of both companies declined to
specify the length of the agreement. In addition,
Computershopper.com, the electronic commerce channel on ZDNet.com,
Ziff-Davis' Web site, is participating in the electronic
marketplace on E-Trade's Web site, Etrade.com.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Gramaglia, E-Trade's senior vice president for marketing,
said the wide range of programs involved in the agreement would
allow E-Trade ``to hit the bull's-eye of our target,'' investors
who are 35 and older, computer savvy and mostly male. ``We will be
able to shift in and out of the programs to maximize efficiency,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Giller, senior vice president and group media director of
Young &AMP; Rubicam in San Francisco, said that the circulation of
Ziff-Davis' two most popular computer magazines _ PC Magazine and
PC Computing _ and of IDG's PC World ``puts them in the broader
category for consumer advertising capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole category is changing, broadening out,'' she said.
``People who use computers are not as niched as they used to be.
That's why these magazines' circulations are growing, and that's
why they're viewed as consumer titles, not computer niche trade
publications.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Giller also said that computer magazine readers who were
eager to stay in the forefront of technology might have similar
feelings about cars, which could make these publications attractive
to advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Whitmore, a former editor in chief of PC Week and the
publisher of an online newsletter that analyzes technology media,
commended Ziff-Davis' efforts to promote all of its products in one
package to E-Trade, something he said the competitors IDG or CMP
could not offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very new direction for computer publishers,''
Whitmore said. ``Ziff-Davis is trying to get out from under being a
trade publisher. If they stay a trade publisher, they'll wither.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mike Perlis, who succeeded Sheer as president of
Ziff-Davis Publishing in November, said the magazines would also
pursue other nontechnology advertisers, including financial
services companies and those in the fashion, credit card, liquor,
consumer electronics and telecommunications industries that are
beginning to market their products online.
</P>
<P>
   ``As companies start making selling on the Web a big piece of
their strategy, reaching people with knowledge of this will be
important,'' he said. ``If they put together our raw demographics,
and the fact that our readers are more likely to participate in the
Web, they're buying a good one-two punch.''

 WASHINGTON: he said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Throughout the extraordinary day, Republicans tried to assure
the nation of the stability of foreign policy even as one after
another they announced their decisions to vote for the president's
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am comforted by the fact that the president is in contact
with the bipartisan leadership,'' said Rep. Sherwood Boehlert,
R-N.Y., as he announced that he had decided to vote for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been by far the most difficult, even tormenting
decision I have had to make in my 16 years in Congress,'' Boehlert
said speaking softly before television cameras. ``I simply have not
found the means to rationalize away the fact that our president
lied under oath, that he has tried repeatedly to game the judicial
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans spoke in similar uncompromising terms. `I get
the impression that the president considers himself above the
law,'' said Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., who had once said he would
oppose impeachment, but now said he would support it on the House
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Rep. Rick Lazio of New York on Wednesday night
contrasted the president's statements on Moncia Lewinsky with the
sacrifice American soldiers make in battle, saying ``It should not
be difficult now to tell the truth or vote according to the
dictates of conscience even if it means the end of one's career.''
</P>
<P>
   The others who cam out against Clinton on Wednesday read like
the very roster of Republicans he had hoped to sway, including
Reps. Brian Bilbray of California, Jim Leach of Iowa and Bob Ney of
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Before the impeachment debate became interwoven with the Iraq
actions, the battle lines seemed to be forming for how the two
parties were going to fight on after the House vote on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The White House did get one message of support on Wednesday from
Republicans. Rep. Jay Kim of California, who pleaded guilty to
accepting illegal donations in 1997, said he was leaning toward
opposing impeachment. A Senate trial ``is going to be an
international embarrassment,'' Kim told the Inland Valley Daily
Bulletin in California.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, who canceled a trip to New Hampshire to
stay in Washington, began sounding what is expected to be the White
House theme in the weeks ahead _ that Republicans were embarked on
a partisan, divisive course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe on Capitol Hill there is still time for Democrats
and Republicans to come together and embrace a bipartisan
compromise to seek a resolution that is both quick and fair and try
to turn away from the bitter partisanship that we have seen so
far,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mike Pappas, R-N.J., one of the lame-duck members of
Congress who put his support behind impeachment on Wednesday, by
contrast renewed the call for Clinton to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``His actions were the cause that brought us to this point,'' he
said. ``He can resign and keep us from having to move forward to go
to the time and expense and diversion this would cause the Congress
or the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats _ nearly unanimous against the impeachment of the
president _ argued for a pause. ``I think that if we are at war it
would be appropriate to postpone the proceedings,'' said Rep. Lee
Hamilton of Indiana, who is retiring from Congress.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After meeting with his top military advisers in the
Situation Room at the White House Wednesday, President Clinton made
a rare appearance just after 8 a.m. at the daily meeting of his top
aides, in the corner office of John Podesta, the chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Only three or four of the 30 staff members in the room knew
that, within hours, American missiles would strike Iraq. But they
all knew that the House would probably vote soon to impeach the
tired-looking man in the doorway, and they stood to applaud him.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton thanked them for their hard work, according to people
who were present, and he assured them that if they kept at it, the
American people would support them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll figure it out,'' he said. ``They always get it
right.``
</P>
<P>
   For the last 24 hours, from the time he left Israel until he
addressed the nation Wednesday night, Clinton worked feverishly on
two momentous matters that he insisted Wednesday night were wholly
unrelated: the pending impeachment vote in the House of
Representatives and the air assault on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made the initial decision to strike Iraq Tuesday night,
as he flew back from a four-day trip to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   But first, he spent some time chatting with the members of the
congressional delegation he had taken with him. They talked about
the Middle East and about the international economy.
</P>
<P>
   But for the first time, Clinton spoke directly to one member of
the delegation about the impeachment vote. White House aides said
that Clinton spent about ten minutes talking one-on-one with John
Fox, a Pennsylvania Republican who has said he is undecided about
his vote.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was clearly enjoying his talks with his fellow
politicians, but his aides were anxious that he turn his attention
to Iraq. They also wanted to make sure that he slept on the flight,
since three days of high-stakes diplomacy had clearly exhausted
him.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing with the congressmen, the president received a
briefing on the report from Richard Butler, chairman of the United
Nations group overseeing the disarmament of Iraq. Clinton quickly
concluded, aides said, that Iraq was flouting the rules of the
international weapons inspection program imposed after the end of
the 1991 Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Samuel
Berger, the national security adviser _ all aboard the plane _
conducted a secure telephone conference call with Vice President
Gore, Secretary of Defense William Cohen, George Tenet, the
director of central intelligence, and General Henry Shelton,
chairman of the joint chiefs and other officials in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went around the horn and asked everybody what their
recommendation was,'' Berger said Wednesday night, ``and the
recommendation was unanimous that the president should go
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton finally went to sleep, but only briefly, because he had
to make some more telephone calls. He then wandered into a
conference room on the airplane to watch his aides playing hearts,
before returning to his cabin and sleeping for about five hours
until the plane reached Andrews Air Force base.
</P>
<P>
   On reaching the White House about midnight, he sat down with
Berger and Podesta. And from his private study in the White House
residence, he telephoned Rep. Dick Gephardt, the House minority
leader, and Sen. Tom Daschle, the Senate minority leader, to tell
them about the decision. Cohen, a former Republican senator from
Maine, called Republican leaders on Tuesday night with the same
news.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was confirmed Wednesday morning at the Situation
Room meeting, which began at about 7:15. The unanimity of the
decision was confirmed again, according to Berger.
</P>
<P>
   But after stopping by the staff meeting, Clinton was not done
with the question of impeachment. He spent about 50 minutes in the
Oval Office early Wednesday afternoon with Rep. Amo Houghton, a New
York Republican who opposes impeachment. Gregory Craig, the special
White House counsel, also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton then set to work on the 15-minute speech that he
delivered from the Oval Office Wednesday night. He made several
telephone calls to foreign leaders as well, though White House
officials refused to identify them.
</P>
<P>
   The White House was in for a couple of shocks Wednesday
afternoon before the assault began. After the president told Sen.
Trent Lott, the majority leader, of his planned strike, White House
advisers were astonished to hear Lott criticize it publicly as a
political move.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules we've always had is that politics stop at the
shore,'' said one senior White House official, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``Somebody changed the rules and it wasn't
us.'' But Clinton advisers said that they expected Lott's comments
to backfire.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton, prepared to give his speech Wednesday night, his
aides were alarmed by one final detail: The tie he was wearing.
They insisted that he trade it for the bright blue one worn
Wednesday by Paul Begala, his counselor.
</P>
<P>
   Then Clinton took a sip of water, and began. It was only at the
very end of his remarks that he brought the two tracks of his day
together. ``Saddam Hussein and the other enemies of peace may have
thought that the serious debate currently before the House of
Representatives would distract Americans or weaken our resolve to
face him down,'' he said. But, he said, Wednesday proved that
``when we must act in America's vital interests, we will do so.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It became startlingly clear Wednesday how much the
long months of evasion and legalisms, how much his enemies'
unceasing denunciations of him as a liar, have cost Bill Clinton
and the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Gripped by crisis on two fronts, in Congress and the Middle
East, the president came face to face with the stinging reality
that his credibility is crumbling, especially but not exclusively
among Republicans on Capitol Hill. Some sober, experienced leaders
no longer take him at his word. It is a situation he must remedy,
and quickly, but it is not clear he can do so.
</P>
<P>
   On a day of truly explosive drama in this politically
punch-drunk capital, two of the long-running conflicts of these
final years of the old millennium collided with a bang: the Western
allies' struggle to contain and disarm resilient President Saddam
Hussein of Iraq, and Clinton's struggle to govern effectively in
the face of the assaults of his political foes.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader, went so far as to
publicly question Clinton's motives in ordering attacks on Iraq _ a
violation of Washington's long-standing political code. You don't
criticize the president, that code says, when American forces stand
in harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Schwarzkopf, the retired general who commanded American
troops in the Gulf War, joined prominent Democrats in firing back.
He said on NBC, ``By golly, troops are committed, and we can't have
people second-guessing the way they did in Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans were a bit more cautious. The incoming House
speaker, Rep. Bob Livingston of Louisiana said he would leave
questions of presidential motive and timing to the American people.
But he pointedly said several times that he supported ``the
troops,'' without saying he supported the president.
</P>
<P>
   This was the climax, in a way, of years of deterioration in this
city's political civility. The habit of refusing to give one's
adversaries the benefit of the doubt, of viewing them as enemies
rather than opponents, increasingly ingrained in the congressional
culture, has now seized a beachhead in foreign-policy debate.
</P>
<P>
   As the hours passed, on the eve of the scheduled start of the
House's first impeachment debate in 130 years, one previously
uncommitted Republican after another announced plans to vote
against the president. With Clinton's strategy of courting the
moderates in ruin, gloom enveloped the White House, and a top
Clinton strategist said, ``It's time to think about the Senate and
the trial.'' A trial would follow a House vote to impeach the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., who had announced plans to vote
against impeachment, switched sides, and he was joined on the
anti-Clinton list by Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa. Exaggerating only
slightly, a White House aide said, ``If we can't get Leach, we
can't get anybody.'' But even as he was speaking, missiles were
being readied for launch against Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   When they struck, and when Clinton made a broadcast justifying
his decision to order ``a strong, sustained series of air strikes''
against Iraq, the Washington political establishment might have
been expected to rally behind him. Some spoke out in support, but
there was harsh criticism as well, tinged with the suspicion that
this was just a ploy to buy time on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   It was not so much the words but the men who spoke them that
rattled the president's inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, who has been the prime mover behind
impeachment, declared on a television show last Sunday that he did
not believe anything Clinton said. A few heads snapped back. But
DeLay is one of the most partisan and most ideological of the House
Republicans, a bit of an outsider, so allowances were made. But
Lott and Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., the House Rules Committee
chairman, are major establishment figures.
</P>
<P>
   When they expressed doubts about the president's policy itself
and about its timing, in full knowledge that the decision to attack
had been made, the Washington political community was astonished.
Then, not long after the first missile strikes, Lawrence
Eagleburger, a career foreign service officer and former secretary
of state, said on CNN that he understood why attacks had to be made
eventually but thought the timing ``smells to high heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott all but said he did not believe the administration
officials who briefed him. Despite their assurances that
impeachment had nothing to do with the decision to attack, he
declared in a statement, ``Both the timing and the policy are
subject to question.''
</P>
<P>
   Solomon said, ``Never underestimate a desperate president.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how long the attacks on Iraq would continue.
Both Defense Secretary William Cohen and National Security Adviser
Sandy Berger declined to answer the question Wednesday night, and
Clinton himself said only that it would have been a mistake to
begin the bombing campaign during the Islamic holy month, Ramadan,
which begins this weekend. He did not say it could not continue
during Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
   If the bombing lasts for only three or four days, Clinton will
be accused of making an empty gesture; during the Gulf War, weeks
of attacks were required to make limited gains. If it lasts
indefinitely, Clinton will be accused of trying to delay the
impeachment vote as long as he can.
</P>
<P>
   Buying time might be the president's best hope, if only a very
slim one. Pro-impeachment sentiment has reached a peak this week,
but it could conceivably dissipate if the roll-call is
significantly postponed.
</P>
<P>
   But not since Harry Truman and the Korean War has a president
been subjected to quite the same questioning of motive that Clinton
was subjected to Wednesday. The fact that Lott released his
statement moments before the attack increased the sense that he was
undercutting the president.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans did, in fact, rally to the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Kolbe of Arizona was in the midst of a press conference
in Tucson lambasting Clinton for ``impeachable offenses'' when
handed a note about the air raids, and he changed course
immediately, voicing support for the attack.
</P>
<P>
   But many others, while not willing to speak as bluntly or as
publicly as Solomon and Lott, gave voice privately to deep
suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton tried his best to allay them, quoting American military
planners as saying that waiting would give Hussein time to conceal
and protect elements of his suspected nuclear and chemical
arsenals. But he did not address a report in Wednesday's Washington
Post that suggested that the administration had orchestrated the
timing and content of the report by Richard Butler, the chief
United Nations inspector, that preceded the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, British Prime Minister Tony Blair proved himself a
friend in need. By agreeing to join in the attacks, and by
defending his decision in an eloquent statement carried on
international television, Blair gave Clinton political cover
against his partisan critics. That was especially welcome in view
of the opposition voiced by China, Russia and France.
</P>
<P>
   The president did all he could to make Wednesday night's
television appearance look like business as usual _ a calm, serious
report about a threat to the national interest, with only a quick,
glancing reference to his own troubles. But he delivered it in a
setting he has recently avoided, the Oval Office, near which many
of his fateful meetings with Monica S. Lewinsky took place.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Defense Secretary William Cohen rushed to the
Capitol on Wednesday night to explain the military mission against
Iraq after Republican leaders openly questioned whether President
Clinton had launched the attacks to delay the day of reckoning on
his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Many GOP members of both the House and Senate voiced suspicions
about Clinton's decision to attack on the eve of a scheduled debate
and possible vote on his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never underestimate a desperate president,'' said Rep. Jerry
Solomon, R-N.Y., the retiring chairman of the House Rules
Committee. ``They're doing everything they can to avoid
impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Solomon, a former Marine, said the American people should be
``outraged'' and charged that Clinton launched the attack for
``political reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly rather suspicious timing,'' agreed Rep. Tillie
Fowler, R-Fla., a member of the House majority leadership team. ``I
think the president is shameless in what he would do to stay in
office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot support this military action in the Persian Gulf at
this time, `` said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
``Both the timing and the policy are in question.''
</P>
<P>
   The skepticism was extraordinary in that such missions almost
always receive bipartisan backing, at least while the attack is
actually taking place.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP critics took care to declare their support for the
American military forces. Speaker-elect Bob Livingston, R-La., said
the House would convene Thursday to pass a resolution of bipartisan
backing of the troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``As to the matter of timing, we just would leave that to the
best judgment of the American people,'' said Livingston. ``We
support the troops.''
</P>
<P>
   While conceding that he doesn't ``blame anyone for being a
little cynical'' about the timing, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said
``regardless of any cynicism anybody has, we ought to get behind
the president at this particular time.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, a former Republican senator from Maine, was questioned at
a Pentagon briefing before his trip to Capitol Hill about the
suspicions of his former colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that every member of Congress and every member of this
country will have to make his or her own judgment based upon the
facts,'' he said. ``I am prepared to place 30 years of public
service on the line to say the only factor that was important in
this decision is what is in the American people's best interest.
There were no other factors.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic congressional leaders defended the mission and
predicted that most members from both parties would end up
supporting the mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake about it. The American people and the American
Congress will stand behind our troops and stand behind our
president as we go into these next few days,'' said House Minority
Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a time for our country to be united, even though we
are divided on other matters,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom
Daschle, D-S.D. ``We need to stand united, Republicans and
Democrats alike, in ensuring that our troops are completely
successful in the dangerous mission that they are undertaking
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Clinton was flying back from Israel on Tuesday, ``there
was obvious concern'' aboard Air Force One that military action
would be viewed as a cynical effort to dodge impeachment, said Rep.
Alcee Hastings, D-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings said the president agonized over the political
implications of his decision after they were raised by Rep. Rick
Lazio, R-N.Y., a member of the congressional delegation who met
with Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings said he told Clinton: ``You have to do what you have to
do as if there were no impeachment. He said he felt that is what he
must do.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of how the strike would be perceived was also
discussed Wednesday aboard Air Force Two as Vice President Al Gore
returned to Washington from Gov. Lawton Chiles's funeral in
Florida, said Rep. Mark Foley, a Republican from West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president made note that people would second-guess
this decision,'' Foley said. Gore would not comment on the timing
of the strike Foley said, but ``merely made the comment that there
would be cynics among us.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats said the timing of the attack was awkward but was
forced by the Iraqi leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not contrived, and it has nothing to do with
impeachment,'' said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass. ``I think that the
reason I wanted to make this statement today is that I think
Americans need to really understand the gravity and legitimacy of
what is happening with Saddam Hussein,'' Iraq's president.
</P>
<P>
   And some Republicans said the bombing is long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam Hussein has thwarted the will of the international
community for far too long,'' said Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan. ``The
U.S. must have the will to bring this to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   The military action was an unexpected climax to a long day of
anticipation as House members returned from holiday recess for the
impeachment debate and possible votes that had been scheduled for
Thursday.

INSPECTORS DETAIL IRAQ'S REFUSAL TO COOPERATE

<P>
   U.N. weapons inspectors have concluded that Iraq could be hiding
two to five times more deadly germ agents than it had admitted to
making, as well as warheads to deliver them, United Nations
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, the inspectors said Iraq's systematic refusal to
cooperate in recent weeks had deepened their suspicions, which stem
from evidence they have gathered since the end of the 1991 Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors disclosed that Iraq had failed to turn over a key
log book of purchases by its germ program, which would account,
among other things, for the amount of media, or special food for
germs, it had purchased.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq also refused to open buildings for routine inspections and
only belatedly made available the Iraqi experts who could help
resolve key discrepancies about Baghdad's production of germ
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Wednesday night, President Clinton said he had
ordered the attack on Iraq to help contain Saddam Hussein and his
weapons of mass destruction. Clinton listed some of the obstacles
and harassment inspectors faced. But the inspectors said the
problems went far beyond the president's statements.
</P>
<P>
   The scope of Iraq's germ program remains cloaked in mystery, the
experts agreed, with every indication that Baghdad had backtracked
during this latest round of inspection on even its previous minimal
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly,'' said one official who returned returned from
Baghdad, ``they weren't going to cooperate and were going out of
their way to cause problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has already confessed to making enough deadly microbes to
kill all the people on earth several times over.
</P>
<P>
   After the Gulf War, Baghdad admitted to having loaded botulinum
toxin (which causes muscular paralysis resulting in death) into 16
warheads, anthrax (which causes high fever and is usually fatal
within two weeks) into five warheads, and aflotoxin (which causes
liver cancer) into four warheads.
</P>
<P>
   It also acknowledged having filled 157 bombs with the same
deadly agents, and having conducted research on tricothecene
micotoxins (which cause nausea, vomiting and diarrhea), wheat cover
smut (which ruins food grains, hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (which
causes extreme pain and temporary blindness) and rotavirus (which
causes acute diarrhea that can lead to death), and camel pox (a
camel version of small pox).
</P>
<P>
   But the inspectors now believe that Iraq could well have gone
even further, based on discrepancies between what Iraq has declared
having imported, consumed, and destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors said that the biological teams were denied at least
three key documents, at least one of which was key to reconciling
Iraq's reporting record.
</P>
<P>
   According to two inspectors, the U.N. team asked the Iraqis on
the morning of the first day of meetings for a ``log book'' that
described purchases and imports for the germ program, which several
of them had seen in 1995 but had failed to grasp its significance.
Among the log book's entries were imported shipments of media, or
the special foods used for growing germs.
</P>
<P>
   At the first meeting, the Iraqis promised to produce the
critical log book. But each day, they offered another excuse, and
each day, the inspectors kept pressing for the document. In the
inspectors' view, the book was critical to estimating the amount of
germ agents that Baghdad could have produced and turned into
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the Iraqi team said they couldn't find the book, two
inspectors said. Then the Iraqis said that the book should be
retrievable, but that if they found it, they would need the
approval of Tarik Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister, to release it
to the team.
</P>
<P>
   By the last day of the meetings, the Iraqis indicated that they
were still looking for the vanished book.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the runaround,'' another inspector said. ``This was
less cooperation than we had seen six months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, the Iraqis refused to provide documents they
acknowledged existed. One was a list of imported food to grow germs
from the customs department, which was also requested on the
meetings' first day. The Iraqis said they couldn't find them, an
inspector said. Another missing document was an inventory of germ
food that had been stored at Al Hakam, Iraq's major germ production
center.
</P>
<P>
   An inspector said that if Baghdad had used the imported germ
food to grow deadly agents, especially anthrax in either liquid or
dry form, the microbes could still be used in weapons.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 4, Diane Seaman, an American inspector, tried to a lead
a large, experienced biological team into a site inspectors
considered routine.
</P>
<P>
   While she was permitted to go the building, the Iraqis refused
to open the doors of the office she sought to enter, telling her
that she would have to ``break down'' any locked doors if she
wished to inspect them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a holy day,'' one inspector conceded. ``But there can
be no exempt days or the inspection system wouldn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis also delayed making available key officials from the
biological program whom the inspectors sought to interview. ``We
had asked for six,'' one inspector said. ``But they only produced
three of the people we wanted at our early meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   By the last meeting, when their usefulness was marginal, Iraq
finally produced the full contingent of experts.
</P>
<P>
   But the Iraqis have told inspectors that two top scientists in
the germ program whom the United Nations wanted to question are out
of the country. One of them was said to be in Britain, an
allegation London has flatly denied.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors said that Iraq was well aware of the stakes in
this latest round of test inspections and monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the biological meetings, Gabriele Kraatz-Wadsack,
the leader of the biological teams, sat down with the Iraqis and
gave them a detailed account of the remaining discrepancies and
failures to provide key information and documents.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis did not challenge her account, one inspector
recalled, adding: ``They only got into a debate about insignificant
things.''

   There was a dreadful, telling moment during the latest Middle
East theatricals, when President Clinton shared a Sunday press
conference with Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister.
</P>
<P>
   The American President had urged the Palestinians to abandon
those clauses in the Palestinian charter which call for the
destruction of Israel. Already, Yasser Arafat had arranged the very
show of hands which the Israelis and Americans had demanded.
</P>
<P>
   Then suddenly _ without any prior warning _ Netanyahu produced a
new ``condition'' which the Palestinians would have to meet if
Israeli troops were to make a further scheduled withdrawal from
occupied Arab land on Friday: Arafat would have to publicly abandon
any plan to declare a Palestinian state next May.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was silent. His face mirrored not perplexity but
hopelessness.
</P>
<P>
   He had just promised Israel that he would ask Congress to give
it a further $1.2 billion to help Israel's ``security'' during the
final stages of the ``peace process.'' But he said nothing.
</P>
<P>
   If he realized amid his own personal crisis that the Israelis
were torpedoing any hope of peace in the Middle East, he did not
reveal it.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis had simply produced one more ``condition'' which
was supposedly included in the Wye agreement _ itself a restatement
of all the unfulfilled promises of the 1993 Oslo agreement _ and
the Americans went along with it.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Israelis said that Arafat must also halt all violent
demonstrations. This too, we were told, was part of the Wye
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   It was nothing of the sort. There are no sentences, clauses or
paragraphs in the Wye treaty which forbid Arafat from declaring a
Palestinian state, any more than there are prohibitions on
demonstrations, however violent.
</P>
<P>
   But Wye was so dishonest a document _ so humiliatingly accepted
by Arafat and his cronies _ that it scarcely matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You did a good thing today in raising your hands...'' Clinton
told the obedient members of the Palestine National Council who
were merely reiterating what they had already said four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   No one asks anymore whether the conditions set by the Israelis
are actually written into the Oslo or Wye agreements. ``Palestinian
compliance,'' as Netanyahu's spokesman David Bar-Ilan puts it _
note that word ``compliance'' _ has become part of the rubric of
this forlorn ``peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Netanyahu's domestic political crisis is produced as a
reason for Israel's refusal to abide by the peace accords _ as if
it is quite normal for a nation-state to break solemn signed
agreements with a third party when its prime minister has personal
problems with his ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has long complained _ and rightly _ that peace treaties
with Arab states might prove worthless if regimes changed and then
chose to disavow the undertakings of their predecessors. But when
Israel does just this, it is seen as a natural, if regrettable,
course of events.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Arafat has now been emasculated. To keep America's
friendship and secure Israel's next microscopic retreat, he has
sacrificed any chance of bargaining over the Palestinian charter.
</P>
<P>
   He cannot allow Palestinians to demonstrate against the doomed
``peace'' process unless their protest turns violent. He cannot
demand a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   He cannot demand even a part of Jerusalem as his capital _
Netanyahu having stated (without a murmur of dissent from Clinton)
that Jerusalem is the ``unified and eternal capital of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat must arrest his own opponents with the assistance of the
CIA.
</P>
<P>
   So what of the Palestinian leader who has so shamefully accepted
this totally lopsided agreement, who has smothered any aspiration
to freedom and democracy in his putative ``state,'' whose cruel
secret policemen now murder suspects on whim or _ how symptomatic
of their carelessness _ by mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Egged on by the CIA experts who now measure his battle against
``terrorism,'' the chairman of the Palestinian Authority has now
turned his would-be state into a typical Middle East dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   He ignores his 88-member Palestinian Legislative Council. He
pays no attention to the laws they have passed. He bans books
(Edward Said, the distinguished Palestinian professor at Columbia
University, is merely one of his latest victims). &QL;

better respected in Israel that in ``Palestine.''
</P>
<P>
   I still remember how Arafat boasted to me in Beirut in the dark
days of the early 1980s that his nation was ``a democracy among the
guns.'' But what he has created in the West Bank and Gaza Strip _
those pathetic slivers that he would call a ``state'' _ is a
grotesque version of the gunman's fiefdom which he ruled in Lebanon
20 years ago. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   He may not be so quick to shuffle off the mortal coil as other
Arab leaders _ the cancer-riven King Hussein of Jordan, they say,
may be with us for only another two or three months _ but Arafat
let slip a remark last week that in two years' time, someone else
may be Palestinian leader. Chosen, the cynics said at once, by the
Israelis. &QL;

weekend to condemn the vote of the Palestine National Council.
</P>
<P>
   But when delegates called for the setting up of a rival PLO,
Nayef Hawatmeh of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine _ the sanest of the anti-Arafat league _ opposed the

   So what are we left with after the latest deplorable charade in
the Middle East? A powerless Clinton, to be sure, too frightened,
too lacking in concentration to dare criticize Netanyahu or do more
than say that Palestinians should ``determine their own destiny on
their own land.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Netanyahu were to allow such a development _ which he
won't _ Arafat would never permit it.
</P>
<P>
   True, Clinton was the first American president to visit
Palestinian-controlled land. But he originally intended to land Air
Force One in Gaza. The moment the Israelis suggested this might
imply statehood, the leader of the world's only superpower meekly
agreed to fly in from Tel Aviv by helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   In a real battle of wits between equal partners, Arafat might
have made a few Netanyahu-like conditions to the Israelis: no
continuation of the ``peace process'' unless Israel renounced its
exclusive claim to Jerusalem as a capital (which precludes next
May's final status talks as surely does a Palestinian declaration
of a state); no more Jewish settlements on occupied Arab land in
contravention of U.N. resolutions and international law; no more
negotiations until Netanyahu ends Jewish settler attacks on
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   But of course, Arafat would not do that _ and America would not
talk to him if he did.
</P>
<P>
   So what was the surprise when Clinton, Arafat and Netanyahu
ended their summit without any signs of the success proclaimed by
the U.S. government?
</P>
<P>
   Oslo and Wye destroyed any Palestinian hope for a just peace.
Israel was allowed to build more Jewish settlements on Palestinian
land, confiscate Palestinian identity papers, demolish Palestinian
homes.
</P>
<P>
   And Arafat _ for perhaps 14 percent of the land of ``Palestine''
_ had to promise to protect the Israelis who were building the
settlements, confiscating the paper and demolishing the homes.
</P>
<P>
   And they called it peace. &QL;

U.S. BOMBS IRAQ; REPUBLICANS QUESTION TIMING
</HEADLINE>
   (htv) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES and STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton ordered a ``strong sustained
series of air strikes'' against Iraq Wednesday, defending the
attack as unavoidable even as incensed Congressional Republicans
charged it was politically timed to stave off the resolution to
impeach him pending in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq has abused its final chance,'' Clinton declared in an
address to the nation Wednesday night as televised scenes from
Baghdad reverberated with flashes of explosions and anti-aircraft
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he spoke, House Republican leaders, yielding to the
eruption in the Iraq crisis, postponed their plans to begin the
impeachment debate on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to defer,`'' said Speaker-designate Bob
Livingston, in careful comments emphasizing support for the troops
involved in the exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave Saddam a chance, not a license,'' Clinton said of
Iraq's President, Saddam Hussein, three hours after U.S. cruise
missiles were launched, followed by air strikes by Navy jets from
the aircraft carrier Enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks were ordered, the president said, because of Iraq's
refusal to live up to its promise after its defeat in the Persian
Gulf War, to allow the United Nations to conduct on-site
inspections for weapons of mass destruction. The timing, he
insisted, was a strategic decision, based on a report delivered on
Tuesday by Richard Butler, the chairman of the U.N. Special
Commission overseeing the disarmament of Iraq's weapons, even as
Republicans accused him of orchestrating the crisis as a lever over
public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had delayed for even a matter of days,`` Clinton
insisted, citing the latest reports from U.N. inspectors, ``We
would have given Saddam more time to disperse his forces and
protect his weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   His decision was immediately endorsed by British Prime Minister
Tony Blair who denounced Saddam as a ``serial liar.'' He committed
18 British Tornado fighter jets to the raids.
</P>
<P>
   The attack will continue for three to four days, according to
Pentagon officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. While they
declined to be precise about the duration, they noted that
President Clinton had expressed the nation's sensitivity to the
religious signficance of Ramadan, the Muslim holy period that
begins this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The president spoke after a tumultuous political day in
Washington in which Republicans questioned his motives, suggesting
they might be more rooted in political survival than in world
security.
</P>
<P>
   As the first missiles were striking Iraq, Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, issued a statement questioning ``both the timing and
the policy'' behind Clinton's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I have been assured by administration officials that
there is no connection with the impeachment process in the House of
Representatives,'' Lott declared, ``I cannot support this military
action in the Persian Gulf at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   The president made one brief allusion to impeachment near the
end of his 15-minutes address when he declared:
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam Hussein and other enemies of peace may have thought
that the serious debate before the House of Representatives would
distract Americans or weaken our resolve to face him down. But once
more, the United States has proven that although we are never eager
to use force, when must act in America's vital interests, we will
do so.''
</P>
<P>
   The first Tomahawk cruise missiles were fired from six
destroyers, one cruiser and an attack submarine at about 11 p.m.
Baghdad time. They began to hit military and industrial targets
across Iraq almost simultaneously two hours later, Pentagon
officials said. The Clinton administration has twice before carried
out strikes against Iraq _ in July of 1993 and September of 1996 _
but the strikes on Wednesday were described as by far the largest
military action in Iraq since the end of the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing attacks are expected to include 15 B-52 bombers
armed with air-launched cruise missiles as well as additional
fighters and bombers that Secretary of Defense William Cohen
dispatched to the region Wednesday night, including F-117
``stealth'' attack fighters designed to elude radar.
</P>
<P>
   There were no immediate reports on the effectiveness of the
raids or on casualties suffered on the ground, although the
president said there would be ``unintended'' Iraqi casualties that
planners were trying to minimize.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from the Oval Office, Clinton said the mission of the
raids is ``to protect the national interests of the United States
and indeed the interests of people throughout the Middle East and
around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam Hussein must not be allowed to threaten his neighbors
or the world with nuclear arms, poison gas or biological weapons,''
Clinton declared.
</P>
<P>
   Amid their doubts, other Republicans voiced support for the
American forces at risk in the military strike. But one House
leader, Rep. Gerald Solomon, chairman of the rules committee, was
furious in accusing the president of using the Iraqi air strikes as
a political foil to impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obvious that he is doing this for political reasons, and
I and others are outraged,'' he declared outside the Capitol
minutes after receiving word of the air strikes. ``They are doing
everything they can to postpone this impeachment in order to try
and get whatever kind of leverage they can, and the American people
ought to be as outraged as I am about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But any thought of impeachment as a factor in the military
decision was denied by Cohen, a former Republican member of the
Senate. ``I am prepared to place 30 years of public service on the
line,'' he said, ``to say the only factor that was important in
this decision is what is in the American people's best interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the raid had been in the works and planned for
execution on Wednesday since a previously ordered attack was
canceled in November during an earlier confrontation with Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry Shelton,
added, ``Militarily it was the right decision, the right date, and
that decision was made back in November.''
</P>
<P>
   In the domestic furor, critics questioned the timing of the
attack as a scenario designed to exploit a war mentality as a
distraction from domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
   The timing ``smells to high heaven,'' said Lawrence Eagleburger,
former secretary of state in the Bush administration who said,
however, that tough military action against Iraq was long overdue.

<P>
   There was a dreadful, telling moment during the latest Middle
East theatricals, when President Clinton shared a Sunday press
conference with Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister.
</P>
<P>
   The American President had urged the Palestinians to abandon
those clauses in the Palestinian charter which call for the
destruction of Israel. Already, Yasser Arafat had arranged the very
show of hands which the Israelis and Americans had demanded.
</P>
<P>
   Then suddenly _ without any prior warning _ Netanyahu produced a
new ``condition'' which the Palestinians would have to meet if
Israeli troops were to make a further scheduled withdrawal from
occupied Arab land on Friday: Arafat would have to publicly abandon
any plan to declare a Palestinian state next May.

heard, and viewers of CNN and MSNBC learned along with the Iraqi
people that an attack was probably imminent.

``Nightscope Image'' on screen explained the green color that

   This was an attack television had been anticipating all day. Its
drama came not from any element of surprise, but because, from the
safety of home and with the guilty intimacy of a voyeur, viewers
could watch the attack almost step by step.
</P>
<P>
   From early morning, the cable news channel had a split
personality, leaping back and forth between the impeachment debate
that had been planned for Thursday in the House of Representatives
and the probability of an attack on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Among other cultural lessons, the day demonstrated how swiftly
``wag the dog'' has entered the language as a shorthand phrase for
a war staged to distract attention from a sex scandal. (NBC even
briefly showed a clip of the film ``Wag the Dog.'') The issues were
so intertwined that even President Clinton could not avoid a
reference to his domestic crisis in his televised address, carried
by all the networks, about why he had ordered the missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   From early morning, the cable channels had continued to chart
what everyone described as congressional ``momentum'' in favor of
impeachment. But the account was sharing attention with what was
happening at the Pentagon. In early afternoon reporters were saying
that Republicans and Democrats would probably agree to postpone the
House vote if an attack were to happen.
</P>
<P>
   The sirens from Baghdad soon after 4:15 changed everything. It
was the cue for the networks to join the cable stations,
positioning themselves to be there when the missiles hit. The
methodical way the process unfolded before our eyes added a
chilling note that was both intensely real in its content and
bizarrely surreal because it arrived in a neat television package,
a drama to outdo ``E.R.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching along with us, even the network anchors were at first
uncertain of what was happening. On CBS, Dan Rather said, ``We
don't know'' if an attack had already started. It was ``possibly
under way,'' Peter Jennings said on ABC. And on NBC Tom Brokaw
said, ``The attack is under way in Baghdad,'' though it turned out
he was watching Iraqi anti-aircraft fire, not American missiles.
</P>
<P>
   While waiting for the actual missiles to hit, word came that the
attack had been approved. Standing in front of the White House,
David Bloom of NBC was not exaggerating when he said ``you will
see'' the missiles soon.
</P>
<P>
   And though the Baghdad scenes were familiar from the Persian
Gulf war, Wednesday's media lead-up to the event signaled how
thoroughly viewers have become accustomed to watching every step of
the news unfold. When Brokaw said, ``We know some targets have
already been hit outside our ability to see them'' (outside the
city), that came as a shock in the midst of such saturation
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   When the missiles did hit and what looked like great plumes of
green smoke filled the screen, viewers could flip around networks
searching for the greatest action as if this were a real-life video
game. And as the attacks continued, so did the political crisis.
Sometimes sound and pictures were mismatched to cover both
happenings at once. As Brokaw talked to two Democratic members of
the House Judiciary Committee, their voices ran over pictures from
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton spoke from the Oval Office in early evening, the
bags under his eyes and the atmosphere of a dual crisis informed
the speech, even when he was explaining his decision on Iraq. He
showed no emotion when he said America would not be distracted by
what he called ``the serious debate currently before the House of
Representatives'' (never using the word ``impeachment''). Only at
the end was there a touch of the lofty rhetoric and emotion that
usually serves him best.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a new century we'll have a remarkable opportunity to shape
a future more peaceful than the past, but only if we stand strong
against the enemies of peace.'' The message about standing strong
was, of course, addressed to the national audience following his
impeachment crisis as well as to Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Well into prime time, the two events continued to merge. ABC
signed off after its evening news, only to break in for a brief
news conference in which Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., the newly
selected speaker of the House, confirmed that the impeachment vote
would be delayed. Later in the evening, ABC and CBS offered special
hourlong reports. NBC stayed on continuously from late afternoon
until 9. Against those increasingly familiar green-tinted images,
they monitored how many Republicans supported the president on Iraq
and how many thought he was wagging a dog.

COMMENTARY: ON IMPEACHMENT EVE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Has Bill Clinton at long last had a change of heart
about Saddam Hussein? Or is his sudden hawkishness _ on the eve of
Impeachment Day _ a trick to buy time, delay the vote on spurious
national security grounds and play for a break in the House?
</P>
<P>
   A mark of the degree of distrust in the president's word,
developed over years of listening to evasions, half-truths and
outright lies, is the fury of frustrated Republicans on the Hill.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night they heard him invoke ``the fear of force''
against the dictator who for years has had no reason to fear
Clinton force. ``The cost of action,'' he intoned, ``must be
weighed against the price of inaction.'' So true _ just as it was
true in the spring, when he chose inaction with the U.N.'s Kofi
Annan, and true recently when he flinched at the last minute and
gave Saddam a cheap victory by recalling an air strike.
</P>
<P>
   But then we have to ask ourselves: Would any U.S. president,
even in political extremis, stoop to risking lives to cling to
power? Holding summit meetings to affect public opinion is par for
the course, but launching hundreds of cruise missiles will cost
lives and invite retaliation. No matter what I think of Bill
Clinton's motives and methods, I cannot bring myself to think that.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming only patriotic motives, then, what do we make of
``Desert Fox,'' the first American military operation named after a
Nazi-era German general? What is its mission, and how long will it
last?
</P>
<P>
   One clue comes from the reason given for the attack at
impeachment time. The president tells us that it would have been a
mistake to ``initiate'' it during Ramadan, Islam's holy month. That
starts on Saturday. Unless it is deemed not ``profoundly
offensive'' to continue bombing during Ramadan, that limits the
attack to a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the heavy rhetoric and the televised sight and sound,
the timorous mission has not changed. With off-again-on-again
bombing, Clinton still hopes to ``contain'' Saddam, to persuade him
to re-admit inspectors, to finance indigenous rebellion, to plead
with the United Nations to maintain sanctions. It is a strategy of
half-measures.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a lucky hit, a few days _ or even weeks _ of bombs will
not eliminate the Iraqi dictator's threat to every civilized
country. Air power may temporarily ``degrade'' but not knock out
his capacity to produce germ and poison-gas weapons, nor will bombs
destroy the well-dispersed Republican Guard. Even as we annoy him
from above, he will produce a weapon of mass destruction somewhere
down below. And then he will tell us to stop or else.
</P>
<P>
   Only the credible threat of another invasion of Iraq is likely
to stimulate a successful coup. No such unpopular gulf buildup will
be in the works during the Clinton administration. That can has
been kicked to the next president.
</P>
<P>
   Now to the impact of the Impeachment-Eve Desert Foxiness on
Clinton's personal fortunes. The last-ditch, fallback argument of
his defenders is that House action would ``paralyze the country.''
That has just been demolished by Clinton's acceptance of Saddam's
invitation to bomb his people into Arab martyrdom.
</P>
<P>
   The answer to the national-paralysis bogeyman can be found in
these punitive air strikes. The House, with a bow to seemliness,
will delay an impeachment decision for a bit. Then, as Clinton
declares a famous victory in the war process (following his getting
things ``back on track'' in the peace process) the House will
coolly proceed with the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   We are in a period of half-measures. The military half-measure
Clinton is taking in Iraq is unlikely to depose Saddam, which is a
bad thing. But the political half-measure Congress is taking in
Washington _ with the House impeaching and the Senate chastising
but not removing Clinton _ is a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   In so conducting our foreign and domestic affairs, we show the
world that the United States is able to exert military power abroad
while calling to account the abuse of executive power at home. Up
to a point, we can chew up a dictator and chew out a president at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Clinton with pure motives in doing too little, too late.
Credit Congress with equally patriotic motives in doing just enough
and on time.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a dreadful, telling moment during the latest Middle
East theatricals, when President Clinton shared a Sunday press
conference with Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister.
</P>
<P>
   The American President had urged the Palestinians to abandon
those clauses in the Palestinian charter which call for the
destruction of Israel. Already, Yasser Arafat had arranged the very
show of hands which the Israelis and Americans had demanded.
</P>
<P>
   Then suddenly _ without any prior warning _ Netanyahu produced a
new ``condition'' which the Palestinians would have to meet if
Israeli troops were to make a further scheduled withdrawal from
occupied Arab land on Friday: Arafat would have to publicly abandon
any plan to declare a Palestinian state next May.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was silent. His face mirrored not perplexity but
hopelessness.
</P>
<P>
   He had just promised Israel that he would ask Congress to give
it a further $1.2 billion to help Israel's ``security'' during the
final stages of the ``peace process.'' But he said nothing.
</P>
<P>
   If he realized amid his own personal crisis that the Israelis
were torpedoing any hope of peace in the Middle East, he did not
reveal it.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis had simply produced one more ``condition'' which
was supposedly included in the Wye agreement _ itself a restatement
of all the unfulfilled promises of the 1993 Oslo agreement _ and
the Americans went along with it.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Israelis said that Arafat must also halt all violent
demonstrations. This too, we were told, was part of the Wye
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   It was nothing of the sort. There are no sentences, clauses or
paragraphs in the Wye treaty which forbid Arafat from declaring a
Palestinian state, any more than there are prohibitions on
demonstrations, however violent.
</P>
<P>
   But Wye was so dishonest a document _ so humiliatingly accepted
by Arafat and his cronies _ that it scarcely matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You did a good thing today in raising your hands...'' Clinton
told the obedient members of the Palestine National Council who
were merely reiterating what they had already said four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   No one asks anymore whether the conditions set by the Israelis
are actually written into the Oslo or Wye agreements. ``Palestinian
compliance,'' as Netanyahu's spokesman David Bar-Ilan puts it _
note that word ``compliance'' _ has become part of the rubric of
this forlorn ``peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Netanyahu's domestic political crisis is produced as a
reason for Israel's refusal to abide by the peace accords _ as if
it is quite normal for a nation-state to break solemn signed
agreements with a third party when its prime minister has personal
problems with his ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has long complained _ and rightly _ that peace treaties
with Arab states might prove worthless if regimes changed and then
chose to disavow the undertakings of their predecessors. But when
Israel does just this, it is seen as a natural, if regrettable,
course of events.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Arafat has now been emasculated. To keep America's
friendship and secure Israel's next microscopic retreat, he has
sacrificed any chance of bargaining over the Palestinian charter.
</P>
<P>
   He cannot allow Palestinians to demonstrate against the doomed
``peace'' process unless their protest turns violent. He cannot
demand a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   He cannot demand even a part of Jerusalem as his capital _
Netanyahu having stated (without a murmur of dissent from Clinton)
that Jerusalem is the ``unified and eternal capital of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat must arrest his own opponents with the assistance of the
CIA.
</P>
<P>
   So what of the Palestinian leader who has so shamefully accepted
this totally lopsided agreement, who has smothered any aspiration
to freedom and democracy in his putative ``state,'' whose cruel
secret policemen now murder suspects on whim or _ how symptomatic
of their carelessness _ by mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Egged on by the CIA experts who now measure his battle against
``terrorism,'' the chairman of the Palestinian Authority has now
turned his would-be state into a typical Middle East dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   He ignores his 88-member Palestinian Legislative Council. He
pays no attention to the laws they have passed. He bans books
(Edward Said, the distinguished Palestinian professor at Columbia
University, is merely one of his latest victims). &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST 100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A poll taken by the Center for Palestine Research and Studies
suggests that Palestinians believe democracy and human rights are
better respected in Israel that in ``Palestine.''
</P>
<P>
   I still remember how Arafat boasted to me in Beirut in the dark
days of the early 1980s that his nation was ``a democracy among the
guns.'' But what he has created in the West Bank and Gaza Strip _
those pathetic slivers that he would call a ``state'' _ is a
grotesque version of the gunman's fiefdom which he ruled in Lebanon
20 years ago. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   True, he is a deteriorating man. His brain tumor _ following his
air crash in Libya _ has left him with a palpable shake in the
right hand that looks suspiciously like the onset of Parkinson's
disease.
</P>
<P>
   He may not be so quick to shuffle off the mortal coil as other
Arab leaders _ the cancer-riven King Hussein of Jordan, they say,
may be with us for only another two or three months _ but Arafat
let slip a remark last week that in two years' time, someone else
may be Palestinian leader. Chosen, the cynics said at once, by the
Israelis. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND 100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet what do Arafat's opponents elsewhere in the Arab world have
to offer? All the anti-peaceniks of Palestine met in Damascus last
weekend to condemn the vote of the Palestine National Council.
</P>
<P>
   But when delegates called for the setting up of a rival PLO,
Nayef Hawatmeh of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine _ the sanest of the anti-Arafat league _ opposed the
motion and called for further political action in the occupied
territories. He was howled down by infuriated Palestinian radicals
shouting for ``unity.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So what are we left with after the latest deplorable charade in
the Middle East? A powerless Clinton, to be sure, too frightened,
too lacking in concentration to dare criticize Netanyahu or do more
than say that Palestinians should ``determine their own destiny on
their own land.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Netanyahu were to allow such a development _ which he
won't _ Arafat would never permit it.
</P>
<P>
   True, Clinton was the first American president to visit
Palestinian-controlled land. But he originally intended to land Air
Force One in Gaza. The moment the Israelis suggested this might
imply statehood, the leader of the world's only superpower meekly
agreed to fly in from Tel Aviv by helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   In a real battle of wits between equal partners, Arafat might
have made a few Netanyahu-like conditions to the Israelis: no
continuation of the ``peace process'' unless Israel renounced its
exclusive claim to Jerusalem as a capital (which precludes next
May's final status talks as surely does a Palestinian declaration
of a state); no more Jewish settlements on occupied Arab land in
contravention of U.N. resolutions and international law; no more
negotiations until Netanyahu ends Jewish settler attacks on
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   But of course, Arafat would not do that _ and America would not
talk to him if he did.
</P>
<P>
   So what was the surprise when Clinton, Arafat and Netanyahu
ended their summit without any signs of the success proclaimed by
the U.S. government?
</P>
<P>
   Oslo and Wye destroyed any Palestinian hope for a just peace.
Israel was allowed to build more Jewish settlements on Palestinian
land, confiscate Palestinian identity papers, demolish Palestinian
homes.
</P>
<P>
   And Arafat _ for perhaps 14 percent of the land of ``Palestine''
_ had to promise to protect the Israelis who were building the
settlements, confiscating the paper and demolishing the homes.
</P>
<P>
   And they called it peace. &QL;

IT'S ALL ABOUT CASH, NOT COLOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By IRA BERKOW    
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The players were angry. The labor dispute had gone on
longer than anyone had believed possible, and some were taking it
personally. There was a feeling among them that the owners, who
were locking them out, did not necessarily have the highest opinion
of their ability to hang together and that they were being
dismissed as just a bunch of dumb jocks.
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar? The National Basketball Association and its
players association today? Yes and no. This was also the situation
at this time of the year in the National Hockey League _ four years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Another scenario: The players had been seeking to make an
agreement with management, management was, essentially, giving them
the back of their hand. They were getting no satisfaction and felt
they were getting even less respect. And at the All-Star Game, the
best players in the league had decided they would boycott the game
unless they received a little more of both of the above. They did _
an hour before the game _ and so played it. That was in the
National Basketball Association in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   There have also been several strikes and lockouts in major
league baseball in the last three decades. ``What I see being done
and said in the labor dispute in the NBA ,'' said Donald Fehr,
executive director of baseball's players association, ``is
fundamentally no different from our experiences. If you change the
names, from, say the Bulls and Knicks and Ewing and Mourning, to
the Yankees and Dodgers and Keith Hernandez and David Cone, you
have virtually the same story.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a difference with the NBA today and the other
situations cited. The players in the NBA are 85 percent black, 15
percent white. The National Hockey League is less than 1 percent
black. Baseball is 18 percent black. And in 1964, the NBA was just
the reverse of the present, 85 percent white, 15 percent black.
</P>
<P>
   And with the preponderance of black players in the NBA has come
a sense that the all-white ownership of the 29 teams is treating
them, as Karl Malone said, ``like children.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The league has cast us as dumb and stupid and
uninformed.''
</P>
<P>
   And Jayson Williams of the Nets said, ``For some guys it's hard
not to think about race.''
</P>
<P>
   If the season were canceled, he continued, ``You'll have to look
under the carpet and ask why.''
</P>
<P>
   Has there been even a single overt racist comment or tactic that
the players can put their fingers on? The answer is no, though the
owners have not been quick to defend players who have been
portrayed in the press as lavish spenders _ black men as lavish
spenders, that is.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for the players to play the race card without factual
evidence is very disappointing,'' said Bob Cousy, the Hall of Fame
guard and first president of the players association in the early
1950s. ``Sure, it's a racist planet, and being black in America is
no shrimp cocktail, but in this case, it's not justified. The
league has been ahead of most of the rest of the country in race
relations. No, this is purely a bottom-line issue.''
</P>
<P>
   There are substantial reasons for some of the black players'
racial perceptions in this case. It is an understandable _ if not
anticipated _ historical reaction for them, growing up black in
America. And despite the current diversity in the league, the
league did have a history of quota systems, both on the court and
on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``And,'' said Richard Hurd, a labor relations professor at
Cornell University, ``maybe Billy Hunter, the executive director of
the players association, is using it to keep the union solid. It
may not be such a bad thing.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the labor dispute itself, Paul Weiler, Harvard professor
of labor relations, said it follows in the tradition of labor
disputes in sports and beyond. ``It's a complex question about how
to divide revenues of $2 billion,'' he said. ``But I think it will
be resolved and there will be a season.''
</P>
<P>
   David Falk, agent for such star players as Ewing and Michael
Jordan, believes the season won't be canceled _ ``too much money
involved on both sides,'' he said. He sees a settlement by Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Weiler recalled that the 1994 hockey lockout was settled on Jan.
13. ``And they went on to have a decent season,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When the NBA All-Stars threatened to strike in 1964, Tom
Heinsohn was the president of a players association. ``Relations
between players and management were about the same then as now _
tense,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   And the issue was the same. It was not about race. It was about
money.  &QL;

   SAN MARINO, CALIF. _ San Marino is not the sort of community to
sport large welcome signs for visitors. All the arriving motorist
sees is a clutch of warnings: trucks over three tons may not pass;
street parking is prohibited between the hours of 2 a.m. and 5
a.m.; dogs must be kept on a leash at all times.
</P>
<P>
   Along winding residential streets with perfectly trimmed trees
and manicured lawns lurk further discreetly posted signs. ``No
riding bicycles or wheeled toys on sidewalk,'' one says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flying of model airplanes or possession of any motorized racer
is prohibited,'' says another. This is at the entrance to the main
public recreation area, Lacy Park.
</P>
<P>
   But these visible prohibitions are only the beginning of the
story. According to city rules, home owners may not leave cars on
their driveways for more than 48 hours without risking a fine.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone wishing to trim a tree has to seek official permission,
and failure to abide by the strict regulations can result in
mandatory enrollment in a community-sponsored tree-pruning class.
</P>
<P>
   Forgetting to mow the lawn can result in a citation at the local
courthouse and a fine. Ditto for those who let their lawn
sprinklers dribble on to the pavement.
</P>
<P>
   Professional gardeners are encouraged, but only after they have
been vetted and issued with an identification tag that must be
carried on the job at all times.
</P>
<P>
   Every house has to have a garage with room for at least two
cars. Using a garage for other purposes _ for storage, or for
office space _ is strictly forbidden. In fact, business activities
of all kinds are banned in private homes.
</P>
<P>
   As is the construction of more than one kitchen. More than one
kitchen might encourage tenants, and tenants are strictly forbidden
under an ordinance proclaiming that all houses in San Marino must
be single-family homes.
</P>
<P>
   In laid back, happy-go-lucky, anything-goes-California, San
Marino is an anomaly. It is probably the most regulated local
community in America, if not the world.
</P>
<P>
   What other city would insist on bicycle licenses, or pet
restrictions limiting households to ``a maximum of three dogs or
four cats over the age of six weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People here like rules and orderliness,'' explained Tom
Santley, executive director of the San Marino Chamber of Commerce.
``It all stems from the desires of the residents themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, this is a conservative part of the world, a
suburb of old, established money just south of Pasadena, about 10
miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The police rarely show their faces on the streets because they
do not need to. If a resident commits an infraction, they soon know
it because the neighbors instantly call up to complain.
</P>
<P>
   San Marino was originally the retreat of Henry Huntington, a man
who built his fortune from trams and railroads at the turn of the
century and established a famous library and botanical garden here
beneath the San Gabriel mountains that still attract tens of
thousands of visitors each year.
</P>
<P>
   He deliberately named San Marino after the secluded principality
in central Italy, the last independent city-state in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Originally the rules in San Marino were stricter still _ so
concerned were Huntington and his friends to deter unsightly crowds
that they inadvertently banned churches along with all other public
gathering places (an oversight corrected in 1940).
</P>
<P>
   Although alcohol was always available for consumption at home,
it was not authorized in restaurants until last year.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, San Marino's core population of white
Protestants from the downtown elite has given way to an influx of
new money including, most strikingly, prosperous families of Asian
origin. But attitudes have remained the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still like to think of ourselves as the landed gentry,''
said Santley.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say there isn't room for friction. Warren
Pedersen, a retired engineering geologist sweeping leaves off his
front lawn, explained how his gentlemanly offer to pay for his
neighbor's tall eucalyptus trees to be trimmed (to avert possible
storm damage to his roof) nearly ended in tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police said my neighbor had violated a rule protecting
branches of more than four inches in diameter and threatened to
take her to court. I had to step in to explain what had happened,''
Pedersen explained. ``People take trees pretty seriously around
here.''
</P>
<P>
   To help new residents through the labyrinth of rules and
regulations, the city has produced a guidebook on the main points.
It's a hefty volume that explains how front yards may only be 35
percent cemented over, how political stickers and neon signs are
banned, and how vehicles may not be advertised for sale anywhere
within the city limits.
</P>
<P>
   As a memory aid, there is even a pictorial summary. The summary
is entitled: ``Do's and don'ts.'' And it is subtitled: ``Mostly
don'ts.'' &QL;

IRAQI ATTACK LARGEST SINCE THE GULF WAR

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The military strike against Iraq ordered by
President Clinton on Wednesday was by far the largest and most
punishing since the 1991 Gulf War and was intended to cripple
Iraq's ability to make chemical, biological and nuclear weapons,
according to senior administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   They said the joint American-British attack, which is expected
to last at least until this weekend, began with a wave of more than
200 Tomahawk cruise missiles, most of them launched against
facilities believed to be used by the Iraqis for the manufacture or
storage of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Other missiles, they said, were targeted against compounds of
buildings used by Iraqi intelligence agencies and by the elite
military unit known as the Republican Guard. Initial reports
Wednesday night suggested that one of President Saddam Hussein's
marble-draped palaces in central Baghdad had also been hit, and
that ambulances were rushing to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   While senior American officials insisted that the air strikes
would significantly hamper Iraq's programs to make poison gas and
nuclear weapons, they readily acknowledged that the weapons
programs would continue and perhaps accelerate, and that the air
strikes could mean the end of the 8-year-old United Nations weapons
inspection program in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Without the inspection program, they said, the Clinton
administration will have only a limited ability to monitor Iraq's
program to manufacture weapons of mass destruction _ and to prevent
Iraq from threatening its neighbors with poison gas.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, they said, will likely be forced to leave a
large military force in the region for several years, ready to
strike Iraq whenever American intelligence agencies develop
evidence from aerial surveillance showing that the Iraqis are close
to deploying chemical, biological or nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has already acknowledged that a military strike like the
one launched Wednesday would sound the death knell for the weapons
inspections that have been carried out in Iraq by the U.N. Special
Commission, or UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
   When he called off air strikes on Iraq last month, Clinton said
then that he had made the decision in part because he believed such
an attack ``would mean the end of UNSCOM'' and ``we would then have
no oversight, no insight, no involvement in what is going on in
Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, with air strikes against Iraq underway, senior
administration officials said they feared that the UNSCOM
inspection program was dead, as the president had predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``After this, it's hard to imagine that Saddam will ever allow
the inspectors back in,'' said one American official. ``So what is
our policy? What do we do in a post-UNSCOM world? I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   While refusing to provide full details on the weapons fired
against Iraq and the number of American warplanes and ships that
joined in the mission, administration officials said Wednesday's
attack was several times larger than any strike launched against
Iraq since the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ``The others were pinpricks by comparison,'' one official said.
`'It's smaller than the war but much bigger than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   In June 1993, the United States fired 23 cruise missiles at
Iraqi intelligence headquarters in Baghdad in retaliation for an
alleged plot to assassinate former President Bush. In September
1996, 27 cruise missiles were launched against military targets in
southern Iraq in retaliation for the movement of Iraqi troops
against Kurds in northern Iraq.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   American officials said that they have had target lists for the
attack ready since last month, when the United States initially
planned to launch air strikes against Iraq over its refusal to
allow unfettered weapons inspections by UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
   The target list, they said, included a variety of factories,
warehouses and military compounds identified by the U.N. inspectors
as potential sites for the manufacture or stockpiling of chemical
and biological weapons, some of them in Baghdad or on the outskirts
of the Iraqi capital.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Department officials, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said Wednesday's attack was similar in most respects to
the attack that was planned for last month, when the United States
and Britain were prepared to launch a first strike of nearly 300
cruise missiles from eight warships in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   They said the cruise missile attack that began Wednesday night
in Baghdad was followed by an intensive bombing campaign by F-14
and F-18 fighters launched from the aircraft carrier Enterprise,
which is now in the gulf. They said that several B-52 bombers
stationed on the Diego Garcia, the British-controlled island in the
Indian Ocean, were expected to join in subsequent attacks this
week.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Defense Department, there are 24,100 American
troops in the Gulf region; 22 warships, eight of them armed with
Tomahawk cruise missiles; and 201 military aircraft. The aircraft
carrier Carl Vinson is expected to join the Enterprise in the gulf
on Saturday, along with six other warships able to fire cruise
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen announced Wednesday that he had
ordered an additional 80 to 90 aircraft, including about a dozen
F-117 ``stealth'' fighter jets, to travel to the region to join in
the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has maintained a small but powerful force in the region
since last January, when Iraq's standoff over U.N. weapons
inspections first brought the threat of military action. The
British force in the region includes 12 Tornado fighter-bombers
stationed in Kuwait, six reconnaissance jets in Saudi Arabia and a
frigate in the gulf.

   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from the House Judiciary
Committee's report written by the staff of the Republican majority
recommending the impeachment of President Clinton, as made public
by the committee:
</P>
<P>
   Article I &QR;
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 17, 1998, William Jefferson Clinton swore to tell the
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth before a federal
grand jury of the United States. Contrary to that oath, William
Jefferson Clinton willfully provided perjurious, false and
misleading testimony to the grand jury concerning one or more of
the following: (1) the nature and details of his relationship with
a subordinate government employee; (2) prior perjurious, false and
misleading testimony he gave in a federal civil rights action
brought against him; (3) prior false and misleading statements he
allowed his attorney to make to a federal judge in that civil
rights action; and (4) his corrupt efforts to influence the
testimony of witnesses and to impede the discovery of evidence in
that civil rights action.
</P>
<P>
   1. The committee concluded that, on Aug. 17, 1998, the president
provided perjurious, false and misleading testimony to a federal
grand jury concerning the nature and details of his relationship
with a subordinate government employee.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 17, 1998, the president gave perjurious, false and
misleading testimony regarding his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky before a federal grand jury. Such testimony includes the
following:
</P>
<P>
   Q. Mr. President, were you physically intimate with Monica
Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   A. Mr. Bittman, I think maybe I can save the _ you and the grand
jurors a lot of time if I read a statement, which, which I think
will make it clear what the nature of my relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky was and how it related to the testimony I gave, what I was
trying to do in that testimony. And I think it will perhaps make it
possible for you to ask even more relevant questions from your
point of view. And, with your permission, I'd like to read that
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Absolutely. Please, Mr. President.
</P>
<P>
   A. When I was alone with Ms. Lewinsky on certain occasions in
early 1996 and once in early 1997, I engaged in conduct that was
wrong. These encounters did not consist of sexual intercourse. They
did not constitute sexual relations as I understood that term to be
defined at my Jan. 17, 1998, deposition. But they did involve
inappropriate intimate contact.
</P>
<P>
   These inappropriate encounters ended, at my insistence, in early
1997. I also had occasional telephone conversations with Ms.
Lewinsky that included inappropriate sexual banter.
</P>
<P>
   The president referred or reverted to this perjurious, false and
misleading statement many times throughout his grand jury
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   This statement is misleading. The fact that it was prepared
beforehand reveals an intent to mislead. The purpose of the
statement was to avoid answering specific questions related to the
president's conduct with Ms. Lewinsky. This is evident from the
fact that the president reverted to his statement 19 times in lieu
of answering direct questions required by a grand jury witness. He
used a prepared statement in order to justify the perjurious
answers he gave at his deposition, which were intended to affect
the outcome of the Jones case. The above quoted testimony reveals
some direct lies. For example, the sexual contact between the
president and Ms. Lewinsky was not limited to 1996 and 1997. It
began in 1995, when Monica Lewinsky was a 21-year-old intern. The
president and Ms. Lewinsky were not alone only on ``certain
occasions.'' They were alone at least 20 times, and had 11 sexual
encounters. The ``occasional'' telephone conversations that
included ``sexual banter'' actually included 55 phone
conversations, during 17 of which they engaged in phone sex.
</P>
<P>
   These direct lies, however, taken alone, do not constitute the
heart of the perjury committed by the president. Rather, the fact
that he provided to the grand jury a half-true, incomplete and
misleading statement as a true and complete characterization of his
conduct (as required by the oath), and used that statement as a
response to direct questions going to the heart of the
investigation into whether he committed perjury and obstructed
justice related to his deposition, constitutes a premeditated
effort to thwart the investigation and to justify prior criminal
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton testified before the grand jury that he did
not have ``sexual relations'' with Ms. Lewinsky. The committee has
concluded that the president lied under oath in making this
statement. The obligation to tell the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth requires a complete answer and does not allow
a deponent to hide behind twisted interpretations that a reasonable
person would not draw. ...
</P>
<P>
   2. The committee concluded that the president provided
perjurious, false, and misleading testimony to a federal grand jury
concerning prior perjurious, false and misleading testimony he gave
in a federal civil rights action brought against him.
</P>
<P>
   3. The committee concluded that the president provided
perjurious, false, and misleading testimony to a federal grand jury
concerning prior false and misleading statements he allowed his
attorney to make to a federal judge in that civil rights action.
</P>
<P>
   4. The committee concluded that the president provided
perjurious, false, and misleading testimony to a federal grand jury
concerning his corrupt efforts to influence the testimony of
witnesses and to impede the discovery of evidence in that civil
rights action.
</P>
<P>
   a. The president gave perjurious, false and misleading testimony
before the grand jury when he denied engaging in a plan to hide
evidence that had been subpoenaed in the federal civil rights
action against him. ...
</P>
<P>
   b. The president made false and misleading statements before the
grand jury regarding his knowledge that the contents of an
affidavit executed by a subordinate federal employee who was a
witness in the federal civil rights action brought against him were
untrue. ...
</P>
<P>
   c. The president made false and misleading statements before the
grand jury when he recited a false account of the facts regarding
his interactions with Monica Lewinsky to Betty Currie, a potential
witness in the federal civil rights action brought against him. ...
</P>
<P>
   d. The president made perjurious, false and misleading
statements before the grand jury concerning statements he made to
aides regarding his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. ...

<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ According to a bitter little joke that did the
rounds of Calcutta during Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's emergency
rule between 1975 and 1977, India's troubles were due entirely to
Raja Rammohan Roy.
</P>
<P>
   He was an 18th-century Bengali social reformer who spearheaded
the movement to ban suttee, the Hindu practice of burning widows on
the husband's funeral pyre.
</P>
<P>
   Today, stories are flavored with extra spice. For not only does
another female, and a widow to boot, loom large on India's
political horizon, but Indira Gandhi's daughter-in-law, Sonia, who
led the disgraced Congress party to victory in three states in
recent elections, was born abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to these tales, you would be justified in supposing
that Indians are as uptight about the rest of the world as the
Chinese with their Middle Kingdom complex and horror of gweilos, or
foreign devils.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, no country could be less xenophobic. Indeed, many
historians hold that India's receptive attitude to all comers, be
they from across the Hindu Kush mountains in the northwest or from
beyond the oceans, has been its undoing, playing into the hands of
predators and conquerors.
</P>
<P>
   Add to a trusting nature a deep veneration of the Mother
Goddess, and its fleshly embodiment of mother, wife and daughter,
and you have an explanation of why so many women from abroad have
risen to positions of power and influence in India through the
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sonia Gandhi _ whose husband, Rajiv Gandhi, was prime
minister when he was assassinated _ was Italian before she acquired
Indian citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Mother Teresa, now on the fast track to canonization, was an
ethnic Albanian from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   There was also the Frenchwoman known simply as The Mother who
presided over the devotees of Sri Aurobindo, a Bengali
revolutionary who fled to French-ruled Pondicherry.
</P>
<P>
   The community flourished and expanded under The Mother's
stewardship, with branches in every Indian city and hundreds of
thousands of worshippers worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   I remember her at tennis in baggy satin slacks, or taking the
salute at the daily dusk parade of the faithful, from tiny toddlers
in green shorts to lumbering ancients in khaki, while the band
rolled out sonorous Wagnerian music.
</P>
<P>
   No detail of ashram administration, its farms and factories,
cars and clinics, was too petty or complicated for The Mother's
personal attention.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, most of the other foreign women who rose to
prominence in India were British. There is Margaret Noble, the
daughter of an Irish Protestant clergyman, who attached herself to
Swami Vivekananda, the 19th century Hindu preacher, and became
famous as Sister Nivedita.
</P>
<P>
   One of Mahatma Gandhi's most loyal disciples, Marjorie Slade,
known in India as Mirabehn, was not only the daughter of a Royal
Navy admiral but also Winston Churchill's cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is Mrs. Sonia Gandhi the Congress Party's first female
European chief. There was Annie Besant, a radical humanist who went
on to found the Theosophical Society; also Nellie Sengupta, the
English wife of a Bengali nationalist barrister on whom Indians had
bestowed the sobriquet of Deshapriya, Lover of his Land.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these women were dragons, belying Francis Fukuyama's
idyllic view that a world run by women ``should become less
aggressive, adventurous, competitive, and violent.''
</P>
<P>
   When the British closed down the nationalist-spiritual magazine
that Sister Nivedita edited, she warned darkly of violence.
``Evidently the Government is thirsting for the day when the
propaganda of assassination shall be the only method of service for
men who desire to give their lives to their country,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful of her revolutionary activities, the Ramakrishna
Mission, the religious order with which Swami Vivekananda was
connected, eventually had to disavow her.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Besant was just as formidable, declaring during World War
I, ``The moment of England's difficulty is the moment of India's
opportunity.'' She too had to be restrained by Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Besant, you are distrustful of the British; I am not, and
I will not help in any agitation against them during the war,''
Mahatma Gandhi admonished her. He believed then that a victorious
Britain would voluntarily grant India independence.
</P>
<P>
   I once heard someone suggest that so many of these European
women attached themselves to eminent Indians that some might have
been plants.
</P>
<P>
   This was at a time when people in the milieu in which I grew up
were beginning to suspect the influence of Lady Mountbatten, the
wife of the last British viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, on Jawaharlal
Nehru, soon to be India's first prime minister after independence.
</P>
<P>
   But those rumors were soon squashed. Whatever might be whispered
about the last viceroy's consort, not an adverse word would Indians
tolerate against foreigners, men and women, who gave themselves to
a people and a cause so far from home. That was an act of
identification that deserved gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   Foreigners might even have an edge in a land that places such a
high value on everything imported. Mahatma Gandhi was addressing
Chinese women, not locals, when he said in 1947 that if only they
united, they could ``kick away the atom bomb like a mere ball.''
</P>
<P>
   So Mrs. Sonia Gandhi has everything going for her. She is a
woman in a male-dominated society and an outsider in a land that
loves foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, if Mrs. Gandhi does scale dizzy political heights, would
she find it lonely at the top. Little noticed at home and abroad,
India's first lady, President K.R. Narayanan's wife, is Burmese. &QL;

   5. Explanation of the Rogan Amendment to Article I
</P>
<P>
   The committee adopted an amendment to Article I of the
resolution offered by Rep. (James) Rogan of California. Article I
addresses certain statements which the president made during his
grand jury testimony on Aug. 17, 1997. More explicitly, the article
charges the president with providing perjurious, false, and
misleading testimony governing the following topics: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ The nature and details of his relationship with a subordinated
government employee;
</P>
<P>
   _ Prior testimony in a deposition he gave in a federal civil
rights action against brought against him in the case of Jones vs.
Clinton;
</P>
<P>
   _ Prior false and misleading statements he allowed his attorney
to make to a federal judge in that civil rights action; and
</P>
<P>
   _ His corrupt efforts to influence the testimony of witnesses
and to impede the discovery of evidence in that civil rights
action.
</P>
<P>
   The Rogan amendment supplements the language of Article I by
specifying that the president willfully provided perjurious, false
and misleading testimony to the grand jury concerning any one or
more of the four topics enumerated. In other words, contrary to his
grand jury oath, the president provided perjurious, false, and
misleading testimony about ``one or more'' of the four topics.
</P>
<P>
   The Rogan language simply tracks identical language invoked in
the 1974 Articles of Impeachment against President Nixon. Like the
evidence in the Nixon precedent, the evidence in the instant case
is sufficient to sustain President Clinton's culpability under
Article I for his testimony concerning all four topics
collectively, or each topic individually.
</P>
<P>
   Article II
</P>
<P>
   1. The committee concluded that, in the civil case, the
president provided perjurious, false and misleading testimony in a
federal civil rights action in response to written questions. 2.
The committee concluded that, in the civil case, the president
provided perjurious, false and misleading testimony in a federal
civil rights action in his deposition.

conduct with a subordinate federal employee who was a witness in
the federal civil rights action brought against him. ...

anyone had reported to him within the past two weeks that they had

in certain locations with a subordinate federal employee who was a
witness in the action brought against him. ...

who was a witness in the action brought against him. ...
</P>

the contents of an affidavit executed by a subordinate Federal
employee who was witness in the federal civil rights action brought

</P>
<P>
   The following explanations for the individual paragraphs of
Article III clearly justify the conclusion that President Clinton,
using the powers of his high office, engaged personally and through
his subordinates and agents, in a course of conduct or plan
designed to delay, impede, cover up, and conceal the existence of
evidence and testimony related to the duly instituted federal civil
rights lawsuit of Jones vs. Clinton and the duly instituted
investigation of independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Although, the actions of President Clinton do not have to rise

of justice in order to justify impeachment, some if not all of his
actions clearly do. ...

   1. The committee concluded that on or about Dec. 17, 1997,
William Jefferson Clinton corruptly encouraged a witness in a
federal civil rights action brought against him to execute a sworn
affidavit in that proceeding that he knew to be perjurious, false
and misleading. ...
</P>
<P>
   2. The committee concluded that on or about Dec. 17, 1997,
William Jefferson Clinton corruptly encouraged a witness in a
federal civil rights action brought against him to give perjurious,
false and misleading testimony if and when called to testify

</P>

testimony of that witness in that proceeding at a time when the
truthful testimony of that witness would have been harmful to him.
...
</P>
<P>
   5. The committee concluded that on Jan. 17, 1998, at his
deposition in a federal civil rights action brought against him,
William Jefferson Clinton corruptly allowed his attorney to make

20-21, 1998, William Jefferson Clinton related a false and

<P>
   7. The committee concluded that on or about Jan. 21, 23, and 26,
1998, William Jefferson Clinton made false and misleading
statements to potential witnesses in a federal grand jury
proceeding in order to corruptly influence the testimony of those
witnesses. The false and misleading statements made by William
Jefferson Clinton were repeated by the witnesses to the grand jury,
causing the grand jury to receive false and misleading information.
...
</P>
<P>
   Article IV &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The president abused his power by refusing and failing to
respond to certain written requests for admission and willfully

<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ According to a bitter little joke that did the
rounds of Calcutta during Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's emergency
rule between 1975 and 1977, India's troubles were due entirely to
Raja Rammohan Roy.
</P>
<P>
   He was an 18th-century Bengali social reformer who spearheaded
the movement to ban suttee, the Hindu practice of burning widows on
the husband's funeral pyre.
</P>
<P>
   Today, stories are flavored with extra spice. For not only does
another female, and a widow to boot, loom large on India's
political horizon, but Indira Gandhi's daughter-in-law, Sonia, who
led the disgraced Congress party to victory in three states in
recent elections, was born abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to these tales, you would be justified in supposing
that Indians are as uptight about the rest of the world as the
Chinese with their Middle Kingdom complex and horror of gweilos, or
foreign devils.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, no country could be less xenophobic. Indeed, many
historians hold that India's receptive attitude to all comers, be
they from across the Hindu Kush mountains in the northwest or from
beyond the oceans, has been its undoing, playing into the hands of
predators and conquerors.
</P>
<P>
   Add to a trusting nature a deep veneration of the Mother
Goddess, and its fleshly embodiment of mother, wife and daughter,
and you have an explanation of why so many women from abroad have
risen to positions of power and influence in India through the
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sonia Gandhi _ whose husband, Rajiv Gandhi, was prime
minister when he was assassinated _ was Italian before she acquired
Indian citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Mother Teresa, now on the fast track to canonization, was an
ethnic Albanian from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   There was also the Frenchwoman known simply as The Mother who
presided over the devotees of Sri Aurobindo, a Bengali
revolutionary who fled to French-ruled Pondicherry.
</P>
<P>
   The community flourished and expanded under The Mother's
stewardship, with branches in every Indian city and hundreds of
thousands of worshippers worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   I remember her at tennis in baggy satin slacks, or taking the
salute at the daily dusk parade of the faithful, from tiny toddlers
in green shorts to lumbering ancients in khaki, while the band
rolled out sonorous Wagnerian music.
</P>
<P>
   No detail of ashram administration, its farms and factories,
cars and clinics, was too petty or complicated for The Mother's
personal attention.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, most of the other foreign women who rose to
prominence in India were British. There is Margaret Noble, the
daughter of an Irish Protestant clergyman, who attached herself to
Swami Vivekananda, the 19th century Hindu preacher, and became
famous as Sister Nivedita.
</P>
<P>
   One of Mahatma Gandhi's most loyal disciples, Marjorie Slade,
known in India as Mirabehn, was not only the daughter of a Royal
Navy admiral but also Winston Churchill's cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is Mrs. Sonia Gandhi the Congress Party's first female
European chief. There was Annie Besant, a radical humanist who went
on to found the Theosophical Society; also Nellie Sengupta, the
English wife of a Bengali nationalist barrister on whom Indians had
bestowed the sobriquet of Deshapriya, Lover of his Land.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these women were dragons, belying Francis Fukuyama's
idyllic view that a world run by women ``should become less
aggressive, adventurous, competitive, and violent.''
</P>
<P>
   When the British closed down the nationalist-spiritual magazine
that Sister Nivedita edited, she warned darkly of violence.
``Evidently the Government is thirsting for the day when the
propaganda of assassination shall be the only method of service for
men who desire to give their lives to their country,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful of her revolutionary activities, the Ramakrishna
Mission, the religious order with which Swami Vivekananda was
connected, eventually had to disavow her.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Besant was just as formidable, declaring during World War
I, ``The moment of England's difficulty is the moment of India's
opportunity.'' She too had to be restrained by Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Besant, you are distrustful of the British; I am not, and
I will not help in any agitation against them during the war,''
Mahatma Gandhi admonished her. He believed then that a victorious
Britain would voluntarily grant India independence.
</P>
<P>
   I once heard someone suggest that so many of these European
women attached themselves to eminent Indians that some might have
been plants.
</P>
<P>
   This was at a time when people in the milieu in which I grew up
were beginning to suspect the influence of Lady Mountbatten, the
wife of the last British viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, on Jawaharlal
Nehru, soon to be India's first prime minister after independence.
</P>
<P>
   But those rumors were soon squashed. Whatever might be whispered
about the last viceroy's consort, not an adverse word would Indians
tolerate against foreigners, men and women, who gave themselves to
a people and a cause so far from home. That was an act of
identification that deserved gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   Foreigners might even have an edge in a land that places such a
high value on everything imported. Mahatma Gandhi was addressing
Chinese women, not locals, when he said in 1947 that if only they
united, they could ``kick away the atom bomb like a mere ball.''
</P>
<P>
   So Mrs. Sonia Gandhi has everything going for her. She is a
woman in a male-dominated society and an outsider in a land that
loves foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, if Mrs. Gandhi does scale dizzy political heights, would
she find it lonely at the top. Little noticed at home and abroad,
India's first lady, President K.R. Narayanan's wife, is Burmese. &QL;

NFL PLAYOFF PICTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM BUZINSKI  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   All the talk in Washington this week revolves around the
impending impeachment of President Clinton by the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Censure him,'' say the president's defenders. ``Throw him
out,'' say his critics. But here's a better idea:
</P>
<P>
   Force Bill Clinton and Henry Hyde to stand before the Congress
and explain the NFL's procedures to determine playoff teams. First
one that figures out how New Orleans and Seattle can play for the
Super Bowl wins.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, here are the NFL playoff possibilities with
two weeks to go:
</P>
<P>
   NFC
</P>
<P>
   West
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta (12-2):
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have clinched a playoff spot. They will win the
division and have a first-round bye by defeating Detroit this week.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco (11-3):
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers have clinched a playoff spot. They will clinch the
division and have a first-round bye by winning its last two games
and if Atlanta loses to Detroit this week (based on best record vs.
Common opponents).
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans (6-8):
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, the Saints will win a playoff spot with two
wins (against Arizona and Buffalo) and one Tampa Bay loss (based on
head-to-head wins over Arizona and Tampa).
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis (4-10)
</P>
<P>
   and Carolina (2-12)
</P>
<P>
   were eliminated before the end of Daylight Savings Time.
</P>
<P>
   Central
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota (13-1):
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings have clinched the Central Division and a first-round
bye. They will clinch home field advantage through the NFC playoffs
this week with either a win and Atlanta beats Detroit by less than
68 points, or an Atlanta loss.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay (9-5):
</P>
<P>
   The Packers will clinch a playoff berth with one win or one loss
by either Tampa Bay or Arizona. The only way for the Packers to not
make the playoffs would be to lose twice while Arizona and Tampa
each win twice. The Packers will almost certainly be the NFC's
fifth seed and have to play a wild card game at San Francisco or
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay (7-7):
</P>
<P>
   The Buccaneers will clinch a playoff berth with two wins and one
Arizona loss or two Green Bay losses. It is also mathematically
possible for Tampa to qualify at 8-8, but it would take up more
space than the Starr referral.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit (5-9)
</P>
<P>
   and Chicago (3-11)
</P>
<P>
   were eliminated before the season premiere of the `X-Files.`
</P>
<P>
   East
</P>
<P>
   Dallas (8-6)
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys will clinch the NFC East with one win or one Arizona
loss. The only way for the Cowboys to miss the playoffs is to lose
twice while Tampa Bay beats Washington this week (based on a worst
record vs. Common opponents with Tampa).
</P>
<P>
   Arizona (7-7)
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals will clinch their first playoff berth since moving
to the desert in 1988 with two wins, or a win this week coupled
with one Tampa Bay loss and one loss or tie by the New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
   New York (6-8):
</P>
<P>
   The Giants will clinch a playoff berth with two wins, two Tampa
Bay losses, plus one loss each by Arizona and New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Washington (5-9)
</P>
<P>
   and Philadelphia (3-11)
</P>
<P>
   were eliminated when Mark McGwire had only 40 homers.
</P>
<P>
   AFC
</P>
<P>
   West
</P>
<P>
   Denver (13-1):
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos have clinched home field advantage throughout the
AFC playoffs. Wish they were all this easy.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland (7-7):
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders will make the playoffs with two wins, plus two
losses each by Tennessee and New England and one loss by
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle (7-7):
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks will make the playoffs with two wins, plus two
losses by New England and one loss each by Tennessee, Pittsburgh
and Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City (6-8)
</P>
<P>
   and San Diego (5-9)
</P>
<P>
   were eliminated when Newt Gingrich was still relevant.
</P>
<P>
   Central
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville (10-4):
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars will clinch the Central Division title with one win
or tie, or one Tennessee loss or tie. The Jaguars also clinch a
playoff spot with either a Miami loss or a New England loss or tie.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee (8-6):
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers will win the division with two wins and two
Jacksonville losses (based on better division record than the
Jaguars). The Oilers will clinch a playoff spot with two wins, plus
one loss by either New England or Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh (7-7):
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers will make the playoffs with two wins, plus two
losses each by New England and Tennessee. There might be a scenario
where the Steelers could wind up in a 9-7 tie with five teams and
still qualify, but my calculator only goes to 178 decimal places.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore (5-9)
</P>
<P>
   and Cincinnati (2-12)
</P>
<P>
   were eliminated when the American flag had only 48 stars.
</P>
<P>
   East
</P>
<P>
   New York (10-4):
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have clinched a playoff spot and will win the division
title with a win over either Buffalo or New England. The Jets will
clinch a first-round bye with two wins, or one win and one
Jacksonville loss.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo (9-5):
</P>
<P>
   The Bills will win the division with two wins, two New York
losses and one Miami loss. The Bills will clinch a playoff spot
with a win, or a Tennessee loss as long as the Bills lose to the
Jets by less than 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   Miami (9-5):
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins will win the division with two wins, plus two New
York losses and one Buffalo loss. The Dolphins will clinch a
playoff berth with a win against Denver and any one of the
following occurring: a New England loss or tie; a Tennessee loss or
tie; or a Buffalo loss by more than 1 point.
</P>
<P>
   New England (8-6):
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots will clinch a playoff berth with a win and a
Tennessee loss. The Patriots can also win the division, but sending
a man to Mars is less complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis (3-11)
</P>
<P>
   was eliminated when the only Manning playing quarterback was
Archie.

CLINTON COULD NOT COUNT ON ALL HIS ALLIES IN VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also IMPEACH, IMPEACH-INTEL, IMPEACH-SCENE, IMPEACH-CLINTON,

 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If the House of Representatives votes to impeach
President Clinton, as seems almost certain, three of the six
Democratic Senators from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut say
they would probably vote to acquit him after a trial before the
Senate next year. The other three would not say how they might
vote.
</P>
<P>
   The three who would forecast their votes, Sens. Robert
Torricelli and Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, and Senator-elect
Charles Schumer of New York, said that they did not think that
Clinton had committed impeachable offenses. But all three said they
thought Clinton's actions in the Monica Lewinsky affair were
reprehensible and deserving of some lesser punishment, like
censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his personal conduct, while ugly, is not an
impeachable offense,'' Lautenberg said in an interview this week.
``But I think people across the country would find it almost
impossible to understand that there wasn't something there that
demanded a reprimand. So I would consider that as a possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York region's other three senators, Christopher Dodd and
Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, and Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New
York, said they felt their roles as potential jurors obligated them
to avoid taking positions on impeachment or removal until a Senate
trial was over.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan's chief of staff, Tony Bullock, said: ``The senator has
been very careful to not make any public comments on this matter,
in light of the possibility that it may come over to our side. He
views his role as a juror. He takes that role very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Removing a president from office requires 67 votes in the
Senate, where the Republicans hold a 55-45 majority. That means the
president's adversaries would need to convince 12 Democrats to vote
for conviction while preventing any defections from the Republican
side to force Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   Both Moynihan and Lieberman might be considered possible votes
against Clinton. Lieberman, once considered one of Clinton's
strongest Senate allies, sharply rebuked the president in a Senate
speech in September, calling Clinton's actions ``immoral.'' But he
has also advocated censure, calling it ``a collective statement by
Congress that while Mr. Clinton's conduct may not be reason enough
to remove him, it calls for rebuke.''
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan, who will retire at the end of his fourth term in 2000,
has often clashed with the Clinton administration. He also rose to
applaud Lieberman after his September speech, saying that Clinton's
apologies were ``not adequate.'' Later, in a television interview,
Moynihan said that perjury might be an impeachable offense. But he
has expressed an openness to considering censure.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd, who has been a strong ally of Clinton, did not return
repeated phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, who has served nine terms in the House, was one of the
first and most outspoken defenders of Clinton in Congress. He voted
against impeachment in the House Judiciary Committee, and says he
will vote against it in on the House floor and again in the Senate.
He says he thinks a Senate trial will prevent Congress from dealing
with more important issues.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli, who was just appointed as chairman to the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee, asserted that the impeachment was
being driven by right-wing groups, calling it a ``constitutionally
sanctioned coup.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said that at some point, Senate leaders might
encourage Clinton and congressional leaders to begin negotiations
to settle the case with some penalty short of removal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the judge will say, `Come into my chambers _ why
don't we work this out?''' Lieberman said. ``But it's way early for
that.''

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp. is finding itself increasingly
isolated within the computer industry over its view of the natural
relationship between Internet software and operating systems,
testimony presented Wednesday in federal court showed.
</P>
<P>
   While testimony of executives from companies that develop
operating systems demonstrated that most now include Internet
software with their products, it also made it clear that only
Microsoft ties the two together in a way that prevents them from
being separated.
</P>
<P>
   The government insists that Microsoft does this to trump its
competition in Web browsing software, Netscape Communications Corp.
Microsoft argues that embedding its browser in its Windows
operating system is a product innovation it has every right to
make.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is central to the government's antitrust suit
against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, just before a holiday recess, the Justice
Department played videotaped depositions from four computer
industry executives and made public transcripts from four others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who testified said consumers want to be able to
choose which Web browser they use, or maybe to have no Web browser
at all,'' said David Boies, the government's lead trial lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft did not dispute the fact that no one else integrates a
Web browser with an operating system. ``But from a legal
standpoint, that's irrelevant,'' said a spokesman, Mark Murray.
``The government does not have the right to dictate how we design
our products.''
</P>
<P>
   In testimony offered Wednesday, executives of other companies
said they saw none of the clear technical advantages that Microsoft
sees in integrating its browser into Windows. They said they
preferred allowing their customers to decide what they want.
</P>
<P>
   While Sun Microsystems, for example, ships its own browser,
HotJava, with the company's Solaris operating system, ``our
licensee partners decide whether or not to include it,'' said
Curtis Sasaki, a group marketing manager for Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Executives from several other companies that manufacture
operating systems _ including Caldera Inc., Santa Cruz Operation
and Network Computer Inc. _ offered similar testimony.
</P>
<P>
   All the companies said the issue was important to them because
many of their business customers did not want a Web browser on
their machines. And those that wanted any browser, they said,
wanted only one because installing a second browser wasted valuable
disk space and increased technical support costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most companies would just prefer to support one browser,''
said John Kies, a senior product manager for Packard Bell NEC.
``And most corporations would prefer not to have any items in the
user interface that they're not ready to support.''
</P>
<P>
   His company would have been happier, he said, if Microsoft had
not integrated its browser into Windows 98.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Among the depositions made public Wednesday evening was one from
Philip Barrett, an executive with Real Networks Inc. who was a
senior executive with Microsoft until September 1994. His testimony
undercut Microsoft's assertion in recent months that the company
made the decision to develop a Web browser and integrate it with
Windows in April 1994, before Netscape even existed. Barrett said
he attended the meeting where Microsoft says the decision was made
_ a retreat at the Shumway Mansion in Kirkland, Wash. _ but heard
no discussion of developing a browser, much less of integrating it
with Windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not consistent with my memory of the meeting,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett said such a discussion could have taken place out of his
earshot. But he added that he heard no mention of such a strategy
during the following five months _ even though the project would
have come to him.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about an August newspaper article quoting a Microsoft
executive as saying, ``Phil Barrett, a Windows executive, was
assigned to work on the browser,'' Barrett said that assertion was
not true.
</P>
<P>
   The trial adjourned Wednesday for a holiday recess and will
reconvene Jan. 4. But before leaving the bench, the presiding
judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, denied a request by Microsoft for
the right to subpoena records from America Online, Netscape and Sun
about America Online's plan to acquire Netscape and to cooperate
with Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft cites the deal as evidence that competition remains
fierce in the software industry, and thus the government suit is
irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said, ``We are aware of what might be a very significant
change in the playing field insofar as this industry is
concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   But rather than using subpoenas, he said, Microsoft should
assess the deal based on a reading of the large batch of records
that Justice Department regulators would acquire as part of their
regulatory review of the acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   On another front, Microsoft said Wednesday that it would appeal
a preliminary injunction issued Nov. 17 in which a federal judge in
California, ruling in a contract dispute between Microsoft and Sun,
ordered Microsoft to make its version of the Java programming
language compatible with Sun's version within 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   Although Microsoft has already brought its version of Java into
compliance with the order, the company said it was appealing
because it was ``confident that Microsoft has developed the best
Java implementation within the terms of our contract with Sun and
in the best interests of Java developers and consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft licenses Java from Sun, which developed and owns the
language.

EDITORIAL NOTEBOOK: HAVE YOURSELF A TACKY LITTLE CHRISTMAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editorial Notebook)  
 By VERYLYN KLINKENBORG (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I know a house where Santa Claus was hung by his heels from a
beam every Christmas. I know the house because my family lived in
it. One December my brother stuck a stuffed Santa upside down
overhead in the living room, just to get it out of the way, and
because it happened once it became tradition and was made to happen
again and again, until my parents moved to a house without a
living-room beam.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas has that agglutinative quality. Things stick to it
like a half-eaten candy cane in a coat pocket and never let go.
That is why nothing feels more festive to some people than the
sight of Santa riding his electric-razor sleigh in the old TV
commercial. It reminds them of childhood Christmases long, long
ago, which is one of the very things Christmas is supposed to do.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas also brings out the jaybird in nearly everybody _ that
instinctive love of bright shiny objects. In some families it just
doesn't feel like Christmas until they screw the aluminum tree
together and plug in the color wheel and the room fills with sparks
of light in the primary tints. There is no accounting for tastes,
it is said, but at Christmas there is almost no taste to account
for. This has become a big, wide, sloppy holiday, and if you are
going to try too hard it should be in the general direction of
tacky. It looks less ironic.
</P>
<P>
   I blame the whole thing on the Clauses. When Madison Avenue went
shopping for a holiday shill, it faced a choice: a cozy, childless
elderly couple with a strong manufacturing and distribution base or
a homeless carpenter and his pregnant virgin bride. Santa lives in
a land that is wee, and every year the world, at least that portion
with charge cards, gets wee with him.
</P>
<P>
   This holiday came to a fork in the road years ago, and the
beacon it ended up following turned out to be Rudolph's nose. We
wanted a smaller God _ omnipresent, omniscient but not so scary or
paradoxical _ and now Santa has the job for one month a year in
certain parts of town. Naughty and nice _ the wee ethics of
Christmas _ is Santa's bailiwick, not good and evil, which is just
how we seem to like it.

<P>
   If President Clinton was trying to divert attention from his
personal problems by bombing Iraq on Wednesday, he succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of talking about his probable impeachment by the House
of Representatives, instead of discussing his sex life and debating
whether lying is a high crime or misdemeanor, Americans had turned
their attention to questioning the president's motives in launching
air strikes, finding the timing more than a little coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wag the Dog, I say, Wag the Dog,'' said Andrew Kaye, a New
York lawyer, as he led his three children to see ``Grimm Tales'' at
the New Victory Theater in Times Square. ``It is linkage, political
linkage, because this is an elective event. You can wait a week.''
</P>
<P>
   The cynics were everywhere: A seventh-grader Christmas shopping
in Hartford, Conn., switched into a fake falsetto and called
Clinton ``desperate.'' A San Francisco industrial designer used the
words ``ludicrous,'' ``pathetic'' and ``shameful'' in one breath. A
commuter in the Chicago loop said she questioned the president's
character ``more today than yesterday.'' And at Kennedy
International Airport, a Brazilian tourist wondered why he didn't
wait until tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish they weren't connected,'' said Bill Bonebreak, 39, a
Denver photographer. ``It's like having one child who screams
louder than the other, and the louder one will get the attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Lizondo, a 29-year-old architect hurrying to catch a bus
from Denver to his home in Boulder, Colo., was one of the few who
said he believed the timing was coincidental. ``But I'm sure Bill's
happy about it,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they made the inevitable comparisons to the Hollywood
movie in which an American president fakes a war to keep the focus
off of his extramarital extracurriculars, most of those interviewed
in the moments after the bombs fell Wednesday said they supported
Clinton's decision. If he benefited politically from the timing, so
what? It was long past time to get serious with Saddam Hussein,
person after person on the streets of cities across the country
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Republicans and others who are eager for Clinton's
ouster were among the strongest backers of the decision to launch
air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Granted, the timing is poor,'' said John Cable, 37, a
financial adviser who lives in Bloomfield, N.J., and joined the
throng watching President Clinton's address to the nation on the
Jumbotron in Times Square. ``But I thought we were way overdue. I
thought we were going to do it the last time, and should have.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to get criticized either way,'' Cable said. ``If he
doesn't act, people will get him for that. If he does act, people
will question his timing.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the growing criticism of Clinton, as the bombs fell
Wednesday he placed himself opposite perhaps the least popular
person in America. Saddam Hussein is the enemy Americans love to
hate, and while some expressed concerned about the impact of the
air strikes on Iraqi civilians and American soldiers, people could
not find harsh enough words for what they hoped happened to the
Iraqi leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man's getting what he deserves,'' said Jerry Gilbert, 35,
a contractor who was heading home to the San Fernando Valley after
finishing cementing a stairway on a building near Wilshire
Boulevard in Los Angeles. ``I feel he's capable of way more
destruction than people want to believe. I think we have to do what
we have to do to keep him in check.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Halligan, an accountant from Berkeley, Calif., only quibbled
with the tactics. Why risk a military action, he asked, suggesting
outright assassination instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't we just get the CIA to go whack Saddam?'' Halligan
said. ``That would be the smart way to conserve money and lives.''
</P>
<P>
   At a Kmart in Urbana, Ill., John Gallimore of Las Vegas was
gung-ho: ``I say, `Go get him, Frosty.' He's pushed everybody too
many times. We should have got him the last time.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Flesher, a Philadelphia car salesman, called Saddam ``a
Hitler'' with whom one can't negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too bad they can't drop a bomb right on him,'' said Rosie
Moon, 67, as she headed home to the Bronx from her job in midtown
Manhattan. ``He has played possum with us for too long. He deserves
what he's getting. He's a wicked man.''
</P>
<P>
   Some even blamed any suspicious timing not on Clinton, but on
Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had no choice because if he didn't do anything right now
they would look at it as a very weak response and blame the
impeachment,'' said Dana Burrell, a student who lives in Oakland.
``I think Saddam did this to exactly coincide politically with the
impeachment.''

</P>
<P>
   Few quibbled with the denouncements of the Iraqi leader, but
many were worried about the fate of his people. About 50 antiwar
protesters rallied in Times Square, chanting, ``Money for jobs, not
for war, stop the bombing now,'' while others complained that
another round of air strikes would only increase the poverty and
devastation in Iraqi cities and towns, not disable its government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want anyone to fight,'' said Elizabeth Aguilar, 33, a
receptionist in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to kill a lot of people again,'' worried Helen
Alexandri, 42, a seamstress at Maxene Dry Cleaners on the Upper
West Side of Manhattan. ``We have to get Hussein. But I'm very
sorry for the people over there, the children.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Sepin of Chicago said he was firmly opposed to the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we do is punish the Iraqi people and we don't gain
anything from it,'' said Sepin, 61. ``I don't have any solution,
but I don't think bombing is the solution.''
</P>
<P>
   In a week that has been filled with banner headlines over
impeachment even as department-store ads blare reminders about the
dwindling number of shopping days until Christmas, many of those
interviewed were in overload. Too much to do, too much news, too
little time.
</P>
<P>
   At every corner in Times Square, necks were craned, chins lifted
toward the Jumbotron, where white letters marched across the screen
transcribing Clinton's somber speech. As they stopped to watch,
people wondered if the president was resigning. Only when the CNN
graphics of little green specks crossing the sky took over the
screen did they understand that, suddenly, the subject had been
switched.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about impeachment, all about impeachment,'' chanted
Ozzie Wiley, a large man in sunglasses and a black knit NYC ski
hat, as others silently watched the closed-captioned address. ``Put
two and two together. You've got to go out with a big bang. He's
going to pick off some human life before you go.''
</P>
<P>
   Commuters with briefcases, tourists with shopping bags and
messengers with dollies all stood still as Clinton, and then
Secretary of Defense William Cohen, and then Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright filled the massive screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird, with all the other stuff that's going on in the
country,'' said Jeanne Dzienciol, an architect who was on her way
to her company Christmas party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is mixed up,'' said Joseph Rozgonyi, 58, a painter
and poet who emigrated from Hungary and now lives near Times
Square. ``Maybe the bombing is related to other problems. I don't
know if it's based on sufficient evidence. How can you find out
what is the truth?''
</P>
<P>
   An impromptu salon broke out in the median of Broadway, as
socialists from the protest confronted military veterans in debates
about foreign policy. A woman from Cologne, Germany, feared for her
safety as she traveled home Thursday. A woman from the United Arab
Emirates feared for her family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton's bombing everyone, left, right and center,''
complained the woman, Nada Hamad, 21, who is in New York on a
three-week vacation but heading home soon for Ramadan. ``He's
talking about everyone in other countries going along with him.
That's because they can't say no to him. He's been bombing
everyone. What's to stop them from bombing them, too?''
</P>
<P>
   Most people hoped that this attack, finally, would end the
years-long threat Saddam has posed in the Middle East. And even if
Clinton managed to boost morale and score some political points,
they said, he was unlikely to permanently take the minds of the
country _ or of the Congress _ off the scandal that has dominated
the past year of his presidency. The House may have postponed its
impeachment vote, but it will remain on the agenda once this crisis
passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a snowball rolling downhill, you can't stop it
now,'' said Sharon Quiller, 46, a financial analyst in Chicago.
``He can try to bomb the whole world, it's not going to stop now.
It's got a life of its own.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. and British forces launched massive air
strikes on Iraqi military and communications sites late Wednesday,
as President Clinton said patience had run out on Baghdad's secret
efforts to build chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ''Iraq has abused its final chance,'' Clinton said in a
televised Oval Office address announcing the strikes, as U.S. B-52
bombers, F-16 fighters and warships at sea loosed more than 100
cruise missiles on Iraqi targets.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq responded with sporadic anti-aircraft fire, but as of late
Wednesday U.S. officials reported no American casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the operation, dubbed ''Desert Fox,'' would consist
of ''a strong, sustained series of air strikes,'' expected to
continue day and night at least until the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is to diminish Iraq's weapons production capability and
to strike hard at the heart of the Iraqi military, the backbone of
President Saddam Hussein's two-decade grip on power in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   In response, House Republicans postponed debate that was
scheduled to begin Thursday on whether to impeach Clinton on
charges stemming from the Monica Lewinsky sex-and-deception
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials denied any link between the two events,
and Clinton said the controversy has not divided the nation on
security issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was not a factor in the president's decision,'' White
House National Security Adviser Samuel E. ``Sandy'' Berger told
reporters. ''This is an action taken by the president solely on the
basis of his best judgment of what is in the national security
interest of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Girding Americans against the images of civilian deaths, Clinton
cautioned that ''there will be unintended Iraqi casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar strikes that were planned but not executed against Iraq
last month could have killed several thousand Iraqi civilians,
according to Pentagon estimates, and Berger said the strikes that
began Wednesday night would be ''no less than what we had
contemplated in November.''
</P>
<P>
   Without referring to specific estimates on such deaths, Clinton
said, ''We must be prepared for these realities.''
</P>
<P>
   Saddam told the Iraqi people that several targets had been hit,
and he accused the United States and Britain of cowardice for
striking with long-range missiles instead of assuming the higher
risks of close-range bombing strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fight the enemies of God, enemies of the nation, enemies of
humanity,'' Saddam implored his countrymen in a statement carried
by the official Iraqi News Agency, the Associated Press reported
from Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's strikes were another step in eight years of U.S.
efforts to contain Iraq's military ambitions. The attack capped a
year-long standoff between the Clinton administration and Saddam
over the issue of Iraq's efforts to build and hide weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ''Saddam Hussein must not be allowed to threaten his neighbors,
or the world, with nuclear weapons, poison gas or biological
weapons,'' Clinton said. ''Other countries possess weapons of mass
destruction . . . with Saddam, there is one big difference: he has
used them.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Clinton, ''left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will use these
terrible weapons again.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from Iraq's weapons, Clinton made clear that the military
might that props up Saddam's regime is also being targeted, in the
hope of weakening his ability to retain control.
</P>
<P>
   ''The hard fact is that so long as Saddam remains in power he
threatens the well-being of his people, the peace of his region,
the security of the world,'' Clinton said. ''The best way to end
that threat once and for all is with a new Iraqi government.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of his surrender to U.S.-led coalition forces
following the Persian Gulf War in 1991, Saddam agreed to dismantle
his weapons of mass destruction program and to permit U.N.
inspectors to verify his compliance with that promise.
</P>
<P>
   Twice this year -- in February and again in November -- Clinton
has arrayed massive force against Iraq and threatened air strikes
after Saddam so impeded U.N. inspections teams that they were
unable to effectively do their work.
</P>
<P>
   After the latest showdown, on November 15 and 16, Saddam
promised to cooperate fully with the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, he's continued to obstruct them, according
to a report filed Wednesday with the United Nations by Richard
Butler, chief of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM), charged with
overseeing the inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ''In short, the inspectors are saying that, even if they could
stay in Iraq, their work would be a sham,'' Clinton said. ''Instead
of the inspectors disarming Saddam, Saddam has disarmed the
inspectors.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq disputed that assessment, saying Clinton was determined to
strike Iraq and was trumping up a crisis to justify it.
</P>
<P>
   ''During the last three weeks, there has been about 300
visits,'' by UNSCOM inspectors, Iraq's ambassador to the United
Nations, Nizar Hamdoon, told reporters in New York. ''Iraq has done
its best to try to meet the obligations and try to satisfy both
UNSCOM and the
</P>
<P>
   IAEA,'' referring to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the
U.N. arm that has been inspecting Iraq's alleged efforts to acquire
nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said it was important to strike quickly in the face of
the UNSCOM report, to prevent Iraq from taking evasive and
defensive measures, as it has in the past, to mitigate the effects
of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   While stopping short of condemning the attacks, U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan expressed frustration and grief over them. He
stressed Iraq's humanitarian needs and made no mention of Saddam's
record of UNSCOM impedance.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a sad day for the United Nations, and for the world,''
he told reporters at U.N. headquarters in New York. ''My thoughts
tonight are with the people of Iraq and with the 307 United Nations
humanitarian workers who remain in the country and all others whose
lives are in danger.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the United
States had the support, in the U.N. Security Council and in the
international community at large, it needed to conduct the strikes,
and she dismissed the suggestion that the attack had been launched
with unnecessary haste.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States did no go looking for this fight,'' Albright
told reporters. ''We have explored and exhausted every diplomatic
option.''

 &HT;    MILITARY FORCES WERE ALREADY DEPLOYED

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Concern about Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's
ability to ``threaten his neighbors'' with chemical and biological
weapons was the underlying cause of America's decision to attack
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen promised that the Tomahawk
cruise missiles that rained their 2,000-pound warheads down on Iraq
early Thursday (Iraq time) was the first of what would be a
``serious and sustained'' assault.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen also referred to concerns about the possibility that
Hussein could develop and use nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But neither Cohen nor Army Gen. Hugh Shelton, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, would say specifically how long they
expected the military action the Pentagon had designated
``Operation: Desert Fox'' to last.
</P>
<P>
   ``The objective of the attack is to go after those chemical,
biological or weapons of mass destruction sites,'' Cohen said at a
Pentagon briefing, ``and to prevent him from being able to deliver,
to the best of our ability, the chemical or biological or nuclear
weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   The military hardware deployed to carry out that mission was
impressive:
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a carrier task force made up of the U.S.S.
Enterprise, two guided missile cruisers, two guided missile
destroyers and missile-armed attack submarine, the United States
had 16 other ships in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Over 200 aircraft, ranging from B-52s based at the Indian Ocean
island of Diego Garcia to helicopters aboard the Marine helicopter
assault ship U.S.S. Belleau Wood were arrayed against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   A second carrier task force, assembled around the U.S.S. Carl
Vinson was en route to the Persian Gulf from bases in the Pacific
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The Southwest Asia ``Crisis Response Force'' also included Air
Force F-15s , F-16s and F-117 stealth fighters.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 24,100 troops from all four branches of the service
also were in the area, Defense Department spokesmen said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen acknowledged that striking Iraq's facilities for
manufacturing chemical and biological would be complicated by the
fact that the plants may be hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   But both he and Shelton predicted that before the United States
has finished its attack the Iraqi leaders ability to use such
weapons will be ``degraded.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have very carefully selected those things that are very
closely associated with the things that he uses to transport, the
things he uses to protect, the things he uses to guard his
facilities, as well as delivery facilities and some production
capabilities,'' Shelton said.
</P>
<P>
   He would not be more specific about the targets of the first
wave of U.S. attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton said military planners have been working on details of
the assault since mid-November when most of the U.S. forces were
originally deployed to the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cohen and Shelton refused to say even which weapons
systems were used in the first attacks, Greg Seigle, a weapons
analyst with Jane's Information Group, said Tomahawk cruise
missiles are designed for just such a use.
</P>
<P>
   Accurate, dependable and capable of carrying any of several
different kinds of warheads, the Tomahawk could be launched from
most of the ships in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   It is also likely, Seigle said, that Tomahawks launched against
Iraq Wednesday at 5 p.m. Washington time (early in the morning in
Baghdad), carried a new 2,000-pound ``BLU 116'' warhead that
reportedly has twice the penetrating capability of its
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   After one or two cruise missile attacks, the typical strategy in
an action like that ordered against Iraq by President Clinton would
be to attack with a ``wide array'' of manned aircraft, Seigle said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``you could keep hitting him with the Tomahawk.
It's so accurate, there's no reason to stop using it if you don't
want to.''

 By ANDREW GUMBEL  
 c.1998 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE -- Seattle is not a city much used to adversity. Since
the rise of Microsoft, the hi-tech industry and the invention of
Pacific Northwest cafe lattes, it has gone from boom to boom,
adding an exhilarating cosmopolitanism to its pleasantly
understated prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   So when Boeing, still the Seattle area's largest employer,
announced recently that it was laying off 48,000 workers in the
next two years, it came as the kind of shock the city had almost
forgotten existed.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the job cuts are expected to hit the string of Boeing
factories and assembly plants around Puget Sound, the large natural
harbor dotted with islands that surrounds Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The cause is a sharp drop-off in orders from Asia, compounded by
a chain of over-enthusiastic expansion decisions in the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Boeing _ which merged two years ago with McDonnell
Douglas to form an aircraft-producing behemoth _ has got caught in
a price war with its thriving European rival, Airbus Industrie,
cutting its profit margins to the bone in a declining market.
</P>
<P>
   The company's work force has yo-yoed from 110,000 in the early
1990s, to about 230,000 now, and is set to fall to around 180,000
by the start of the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a crisis on the scale of the early 1970s, when
Seattle was virtually a one-company town and someone put up a sign
_ since much copied _ asking whether the last person to leave could
please turn out the lights.
</P>
<P>
   But it is nevertheless the largest single job cut in living
memory _ a cut that is likely to be compounded by the fact that
every Boeing job generates two or three others in the local
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian crisis is particularly bad news for a city that built
the foundations of its present affluence on trade with the East in
the 1980s, and relied on it to survive the last, much smaller slump
at Boeing in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1991-93 the state economy held up pretty well, because of
other areas _ obviously the high-tech area _ but also timber and
agriculture,'' said Charles Hill, a professor at the University of
Washington's business school. ``The problem now, of course, is that
timber and agriculture are Asian-dependent. Go figure.''
</P>
<P>
   So, does the news from Boeing spell recession in boomtown
Seattle? Not exactly.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and the computer industry (which includes the local
software retailer amazon.com) are planning to add employees by the
thousands in the next few years, as is the building industry.
</P>
<P>
   The housing market is going through the roof, with hi-tech
workers building monster homes in the suburbs and along the
shorelines of Puget Sound and the Olympic Peninsula _ a trend that
shows no signs of slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   The real danger is that Seattle will lose its working class. The
friendly, diverse, endlessly tolerant city that attracted so many
people in the past few years risks turning into a haven for yuppies
and Microsofties to the exclusion of all others _ following much
the same pattern as San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the middle-class housing boom has encroached on suburbs
such as Renton and Everett, which traditionally belonged to
employees of the aircraft industry.
</P>
<P>
   With the rise of Microsoft, the friendly small-town manners of
Seattle have been given a jolt by the aggressive, competitive ethos
of the world's fastest-growing economic sector. The resentment has
been as palpable as it has been unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   As David Brewster, a local columnist, wrote in the Seattle Times
recently: ``This form of hyper-capitalism, with its exaggerated
emphasis on homo economicus, is bound to have a transformative
effect on our region.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing job cuts are only going to exacerbate that trend. In
all probability, many of the laid-off workers will find new
employment in construction. Local economists predict a slowing in
the economy but certainly not a recession.
</P>
<P>
   But Seattle will lose what is left of its innocence _ the
innocence that allowed it to profit from windfalls such as the
Alaska gold rush or the military construction boom of the Second
World War while enjoying a pleasant sense of provincial detachment
from the sources of its revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing cuts won't make Seattle a nicer place; they will drag
it reluctantly into the hard, real world. &QL;

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE -- Seattle is not a city much used to adversity. Since
the rise of Microsoft, the hi-tech industry and the invention of
Pacific Northwest cafe lattes, it has gone from boom to boom,
adding an exhilarating cosmopolitanism to its pleasantly
understated prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   So when Boeing, still the Seattle area's largest employer,
announced recently that it was laying off 48,000 workers in the
next two years, it came as the kind of shock the city had almost
forgotten existed.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the job cuts are expected to hit the string of Boeing
factories and assembly plants around Puget Sound, the large natural
harbor dotted with islands that surrounds Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The cause is a sharp drop-off in orders from Asia, compounded by
a chain of over-enthusiastic expansion decisions in the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Boeing _ which merged two years ago with McDonnell
Douglas to form an aircraft-producing behemoth _ has got caught in
a price war with its thriving European rival, Airbus Industrie,
cutting its profit margins to the bone in a declining market.
</P>
<P>
   The company's work force has yo-yoed from 110,000 in the early
1990s, to about 230,000 now, and is set to fall to around 180,000
by the start of the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a crisis on the scale of the early 1970s, when
Seattle was virtually a one-company town and someone put up a sign
_ since much copied _ asking whether the last person to leave could
please turn out the lights.
</P>
<P>
   But it is nevertheless the largest single job cut in living
memory _ a cut that is likely to be compounded by the fact that
every Boeing job generates two or three others in the local
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian crisis is particularly bad news for a city that built
the foundations of its present affluence on trade with the East in
the 1980s, and relied on it to survive the last, much smaller slump
at Boeing in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1991-93 the state economy held up pretty well, because of
other areas _ obviously the high-tech area _ but also timber and
agriculture,'' said Charles Hill, a professor at the University of
Washington's business school. ``The problem now, of course, is that
timber and agriculture are Asian-dependent. Go figure.''
</P>
<P>
   So, does the news from Boeing spell recession in boomtown
Seattle? Not exactly.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and the computer industry (which includes the local
software retailer amazon.com) are planning to add employees by the
thousands in the next few years, as is the building industry.
</P>
<P>
   The housing market is going through the roof, with hi-tech
workers building monster homes in the suburbs and along the
shorelines of Puget Sound and the Olympic Peninsula _ a trend that
shows no signs of slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   The real danger is that Seattle will lose its working class. The
friendly, diverse, endlessly tolerant city that attracted so many
people in the past few years risks turning into a haven for yuppies
and Microsofties to the exclusion of all others _ following much
the same pattern as San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the middle-class housing boom has encroached on suburbs
such as Renton and Everett, which traditionally belonged to
employees of the aircraft industry.
</P>
<P>
   With the rise of Microsoft, the friendly small-town manners of
Seattle have been given a jolt by the aggressive, competitive ethos
of the world's fastest-growing economic sector. The resentment has
been as palpable as it has been unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   As David Brewster, a local columnist, wrote in the Seattle Times
recently: ``This form of hyper-capitalism, with its exaggerated
emphasis on homo economicus, is bound to have a transformative
effect on our region.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing job cuts are only going to exacerbate that trend. In
all probability, many of the laid-off workers will find new
employment in construction. Local economists predict a slowing in
the economy but certainly not a recession.
</P>
<P>
   But Seattle will lose what is left of its innocence _ the
innocence that allowed it to profit from windfalls such as the
Alaska gold rush or the military construction boom of the Second
World War while enjoying a pleasant sense of provincial detachment
from the sources of its revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing cuts won't make Seattle a nicer place; they will drag
it reluctantly into the hard, real world. &QL;

TIMING OF ATTACK LEAVES REPUBLICANS DIVIDED
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Updating and adding throughout.) 
(htv) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans in Congress were bitterly divided
Wednesday night over the timing of the air strikes against Iraq,
and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott fiercely attacked President
Clinton's policy.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After a meeting with House Republicans, Rep. Bob Livingston of
Louisiana, the speaker-designate, called on Republicans and
Democrats ``to support our troops now that they're deployed.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly skeptical of the timing of the attack, Livingston said,
``we'll leave that to the best judgment of the American people.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers wrestled with competing instincts: the urge
to support American troops and an American president when bombs are
falling, and a thinly-disguised anger that the attack had come on
the eve of an impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   That led to surreal scenes, like Livingston's news conference in
the Capitol rotunda, with comments about praying for the troops
mingled with a promise that the impeachment vote would be put off
for only a matter of days.
</P>
<P>
   That conflict extended beyond Washington, with Republicans like
Gov. Christie Whitman of New Jersey also tempering her condemnation
of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq with her criticism of Clinton
and the timing of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who is on the Armed Services
Committee, said of Clinton, ``Obviously, there will be those who
will question his motives and timing. He will receive significant
support because it's pretty obvious that Saddam Hussein is neither
complying nor cooperating'' with international arms inspectors.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But in an extraordinary rebuke of the president's foreign
policy, Lott, said he opposed the air assault on suspected Iraqi
chemical, nuclear and biological weapons sites, arguing that the
attacks were ineffective. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot support this military action in the Persian Gulf at
this time,'' Lott said in a statement, infuriating the White House.
``Both the timing and the policy are subject to question.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For months, Lott has criticized the administration for failing
to take more aggressive steps to topple Saddam. Under pressure from
Congress, Clinton enacted the Iraq Liberation Act in October, which
earmarked $8 million to support Iraqi political opposition. But in
a letter to Clinton on Wednesday, Lott and five other Senate
Republicans said only $58,000 of that money has been spent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I will support serious and sustained action but will oppose
action that does not accomplish our larger strategic goal,'' Lott
said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But even as Lott raised objections, House Republicans were
planning to vote Thursday on a resolution of support for the troops
in the Persian Gulf.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The core of the debate among Republicans, who were suddenly
chastened by the spectacle of impeaching the commander-in-chief
while he launched one of the biggest military strikes since the
1991 Persian Gulf War, was over the timing and motivations behind
the aerial bombardment that began on Wednesday night.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious they're trying to do everything they can to
postpone the vote in order to get as much leverage as they can,''
said Rep. Gerald Solomon of New York, a former marine who is
chairman of the House Rules Committee, said on CNN. ``For him to do
this at this unbelievable time is just outrageous.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tillie Fowler of Florida, the fifth-ranking Republican and
a member of the House National Security Committee, said: ``I'm very
suspicious of the timing.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans accused the president of bombing rogue nations
or terrorists when he was in political binds in the past. The last
time the United States launched air strikes, said Rep. Spencer
Bachus of Alabama, they ``destroyed a drug store in the Sudan and
two camels in Afghanistan.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina put it bluntly: ``The
trust level is low.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But several other Republicans, many of whom are vocal critics of
the White House, set aside partisan differences, and defended the
president.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He has our full support as long as he's president to take any
action he deems necessary,'' said Rep. John Mica of Florida. ``I
don't think they conflict at all.''  &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sherwood Boehlert of New York, who announced Wednesday that
he would vote for impeachment, said: ``I really do believe that in
sensitive foreign policy issues, partisanship does stop at the
water's edge.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Edward Porter of Illinois, another moderate
Republican, echoed similar sentiments: ``The president is the
president. I respect the office and I respect the judgments that
have to be made in regards to Iraq and the situation there.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Chafee, a Rhode Island Republican on the Intelligence
Committee, said: ``It is not for anyone to say that there's a
linkage between the President's problems with impeachment on the
one hand and the bombing of Iraq on the other. This military
operation has been planned for some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats quickly threw their support to the president. Rep.
Dick Gephardt of Missouri and Sen. Thomas Daschle of South Dakota,
the House and Senate Democratic leaders, said in a joint statement:
``The president has made the correct decision to undertake military
action against Iraq at this time. Any delay would have given Saddam
Hussein time to reconstitute his arsenal of weapons of mass
destruction and undermine support for our efforts.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., a decorated Vietnam veteran, said
Wednesday that no one should question the ``legitimacy'' of
Clinton's decision to bomb Iraq. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident that every reasonable member of the United
States Congress and reasonable people of this country will
understand the legitimacy of this moment,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans went further: Rep. Gerald Solomon of New York
called the bombing ``outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   But others seemed to accept that the domestic crisis needed to
take a back seat to foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make Iraq observe international law, submit to
weapons inspections and abide by U.N. resolutions,'' said Rep.
Christopher Shays of Connecticut, who held a town-hall meeting this
week so his constituents could help him decide how to vote on
impeachment. ``All Americans need to support our troops abroad, and
Congress needs to delay the vote on impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials said that the blame for the unfortunate
timing of the bombings lay with Saddam Hussein, not Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no coincidence that Saddam took these actions this
week,'' said Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, referring to
Saddam's barring of U.N. inspectors from weapons sites, ``with
Ramadan approaching and with the current political situation in the
House. But he miscalculated, as he has done with the House before,
underestimating the American will to act.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. and Senator-elect Charles Schumer of New York echoed
Torricelli's sentiments that Saddam had forced Clinton's hand.
``Under the circumstances,'' he said, ``the United States and her
allies had no choice but to act.''

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Dec. 17: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At an October conference called ``The Claims of Memory,'' the
novelist Cynthia Ozick is reported to have said, ``The aims of the
imagination are not the aims of history.'' These words come to mind
in the case of the Nobel peace laureate Rigoberta Menchu. A new
book by the anthropologist David Stoll now refutes a number of
claims in Ms. Menchu's widely celebrated memoir, ``I, Rigoberta
Menchu,'' published in 1983. These include her assertions that the
adversaries in her family's land disputes were wealthy landowners
of European extraction, that she witnessed mass executions by
burning, and that, as a young woman, she worked as a laborer and
political organizer.
</P>
<P>
   The question this case raises is how best to serve the aims of
history. For the most part, the crimes Ms. Menchu reported,
including widespread political murder and torture, were real
crimes, even if she learned of some of them from others. The
struggle to which Ms. Menchu has devoted herself _ asserting the
rights of indigenous peoples _ is a struggle in which most of her
immediate family died and for which she herself has suffered. The
criminal oppression of indigenous peoples in Guatemala cannot be
disputed nor can the impact of her example. Why, then, the sinking
feeling upon learning that some of the essential facts in ``I,
Rigoberta Menchu'' are not true?
</P>
<P>
   In a war between unequals, especially when the more powerful
side is rampantly duplicitous, we expect that truth will be on the
side of the innocent. Ms. Menchu has clearly chosen what might
generously be called ``representative'' truth, where the sufferings
of a people are conflated in the tale of an individual life. Her
achievement has been diminished because she altered the truth,
perhaps merely in order to make her story more emblematic. That sad
fact mitigates none of the crimes committed against Guatemalan
Indians. Testimony is the people's history, but it is only as
powerful as it is true. &QL;

HOUSE REPUBLICANS AGREE TO DELAY IMPEACHMENT VOTE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hours before a constitutional showdown with the
White House, House Republicans agreed late Wednesday to postpone a
vote on whether to impeach President Clinton as he launched a
military attack against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The House's presidential impeachment debate, only the second in
U.S. history, was set to begin Thursday and had been expected to
end with a vote along party lines to put the president on trial in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Although House action on impeachment was put off, a move that
angered several conservative Republicans who have pushed to end
Clinton's presidency, lawmakers plan to convene anyway to consider
a resolution of support for U.S. military forces.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker-elect Bob Livingston declined to question Clinton's
motivation for launching the missile attack on the eve of the
impeachment debate, but the New Orleans Republican warned that it
would not be put off indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to ask that all members, Republican and Democrat,
remain available to the call of the chair for further action,
possibly Friday, possibly Saturday, but within the near future,''
Livingston told reporters as he emerged from a two-hour,
closed-door meeting of House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   While the attack on Iraq delayed the start of the debate, it was
not expected to change the outcome. Before the missile launch
Wednesday, more moderate Republicans, a segment of the GOP the
White House had hoped would side with Clinton, announced their
support for at least one of the four articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The articles, recommended last week in a series of party-line
votes by the House Judiciary Committee, accuse the president of
perjury, obstruction of justice and abuse of power in trying to
hide his affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of even one article of impeachment will send the
president's case to the Senate for trial, a process experts say
could last several months.
</P>
<P>
   Republican moderates announcing their decision to vote against
the president were Reps. Brian Bilbray of California, Sherwood
Boehlert of New York, Jim Leach of Iowa and Bob Ney of Ohio. Also
announcing plans to support impeachment were Jay Kim of California,
Mike Pappas of New Jersey, Billy Tauzin of Louisiana and John
Porter, an Illinois moderate who said he could no longer oppose
impeachment, a position he staked out earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get the impression that the president considers himself
above the law,'' Porter said. ``If there are no consequences for
the president's conduct, our commitment to truth and the rule of
law is undermined.''
</P>
<P>
   As word spread that Clinton had ordered military action and then
that House leaders were planning to postpone the impeachment
debate, some Republicans responded with fury and questioned whether
the attack was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart dismissed suggestions
that Clinton was trying to escape House action with a blend of
military and political chicanery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president of the United States makes national security
decisions based on the best interest of the United States, based on
the recommendations of his national security advisers and in the
best interest of the people of the United States,'' Lockhart told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cynicism is at an all-time high,'' said Rep. Curt Weldon,
a Pennsylvania Republican. ``This is the `anything to keep my job'
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Longtime Clinton critic Rep. Bob Barr, a Georgia Republican who
filed a presidential impeachment resolution in late 1997 well
before the Lewinsky affair began dominating the news, called the
timing of the Iraq attack ``highly suspicious.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ron Paul of Texas called the bombing a ``despicable'' act
that in itself was an impeachable offense. ``How many American
soldiers and innocent Iraqi children will die so that this
president can hide from justice?'' Paul said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Michael Castle, R-Del., said he had all but given up on
convincing Livingston, Richard Armey, R-Texas, and other party
leaders to allow a vote on an impeachment alternative, a harshly
worded censure resolution that, if endorsed by the president, would
impose a $2 million fine. If House leaders stick by their plans to
not allow a vote on censure, Castle said he is undecided whether he
will vote for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said there were no plans for any dramatic overtures by
the president to fend off an impeachment vote by the House. At the
same time, Lockhart said, White House officials are continuing to
seek a compromise short of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton never met as planned Wednesday with Rep. Christopher
Shays, a Connecticut Republican who once opposed impeachment but is
now wavering. He did meet with Rep. Amo Houghton, a New York
Republican who has announced he is against impeachment.

ITALY FREES KURDISH REBEL LEADER FROM HOUSE ARREST 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: SUBS to add comment from German chancellor, Italy's
suggestion on international court, quote from D'Alema on
extradition decision; minor changes throughout.)

 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ An appeals court in Rome freed a Kurdish rebel leader
from house arrest Wednesday, further inflaming a bitter diplomatic
dispute between Italy and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The court determined that Italy had no grounds for detaining
Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party, which has
been fighting for self-determination in southeast Turkey. But
Italy's prime minister, Massimo D'Alema, quickly said Ocalan would
nevertheless be kept under police surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   After the ruling, Turkish officials, already furious with Italy
for refusing to extradite Ocalan to Turkey, expressed outrage and
renewed threats of economic retaliation against Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will damage Turkish-Italian relations and international
law,'' Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin told Turkish television
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Italy has refused to extradite Ocalan, who is wanted in Turkey
on terrorism charges, because of a law that bans the extradition of
prisoners to countries with a death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan was arrested by the Italian police in Rome on Nov. 12
while trying to enter Italy from Moscow on a false passport.
Shortly after his arrest, he requested political asylum in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Italy, which quickly found Ocalan's presence burdensome, has so
far been unable to persuade other European countries to take him
off its hands.
</P>
<P>
   Germany, which issued a warrant for Ocalan's arrest in 1990 on
homicide charges, declined to ask for his extradition, fearing
repercussions from Turkey and from Turks living in Germany.
Chancellor Gerhard Schroder said an international court should try
him, but did not volunteer Germany as a venue.
</P>
<P>
   Italy has also suggested that an international trial might be a
suitable way of bringing Ocalan to justice, but was hoping that the
court could convene elsewhere in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, both D'Alema and Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said
Italy would either have to make Ocalan available for trial or expel
him. Neither one mentioned a third option: granting him political
asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, D'Alema, a former Communist, refused to rule out
political asylum, a choice favored by some leftists in his
coalition. But pressure from Turkey and the United States, which
also regards Ocalan as a terrorist, has made political asylum less
palatable. Human rights groups have also accused Ocalan of killing
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   That pressure led Italy and other countries to consider the
option of a trial in an international court. But Turkey is
vehemently opposed, worried that Ocalan would try to use such a
trial as a forum for airing the grievances of the Kurdish
separatist movement.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema said Wednesday, ``Since Turkey does not intend to back a
trial for Ocalan outside its territory, this situation represents a
very serious obstacle to the search for any solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers representing Ocalan said that though he was free to
leave Rome, he had decided to stay in the apartment where he had
been held under house arrest and await a decision on political
asylum. A commission of the Interior Ministry is expected to decide
on asylum by the end of the month or early January.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema suggested Wednesday that a decision might come sooner.
``At this point, it may be necessary to accelerate certain
decisions,'' he said.

 WASHINGTON: long overdue. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, said the
timing of the attack was related to the Butler report to the United
Nations, and to military strategists' advice that any attack begin
as quickly as possible. The fact that Clinton was about to face the
threat of impeachment, Berger said, ``would not alter what he saw
as his responsibility as President.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott, who surprised some Republicans with his statement of
opposition to an overseas military enterprise, said he favored a
``more clearly defined'' operation, not a ``cursory air strike.''
Central to this, he said, should be ``the removal of Saddam Hussein
from power.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This administration has squandered too many opportunities in
Iraq,'' he contended.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, however, defended his record as the correct mixture of
diplomatic and economic pressures and, finally, force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark my words,'' he said of Saddam, ``he will develop weapons
of mass destruction. He will deploy them, and he will use them.
Because we're acting today, it is less likely that we will face
these dangers in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said that even if the arms inspectors could stay
in Iraq, their work would be ``a sham.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam's deception has defeated their effectiveness,'' he
said. ``Instead of the inspectors disarming Saddam, Saddam has
disarmed the inspectors.''
</P>

<P>
   U.N. weapons inspectors have concluded that Iraq could be hiding
two to five times more deadly germ agents than it had admitted to
making, as well as warheads to deliver them, U.N. officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, the inspectors said Iraq's systematic refusal to
cooperate in recent weeks had deepened their suspicions, which stem
from evidence they have gathered since the end of the 1991 Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors disclosed that Iraq had failed to turn over a key
log book of purchases by its germ program, which would account,
among other things, for the amount of media, or special food for
germs, it had bought.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq also refused to open buildings for routine inspections and
only belatedly made available the Iraqi experts who could help
resolve key discrepancies about Baghdad's production of germ
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Wednesday night, President Clinton said he had
ordered the attack on Iraq to help contain Saddam Hussein and his
weapons of mass destruction. Clinton listed some of the obstacles
and harassment inspectors faced. But the inspectors said the
problems went far beyond the president's statements.
</P>
<P>
   The scope of Iraq's germ program remains cloaked in mystery, the
experts agreed, with every indication that Baghdad had backtracked
during this latest round of inspections on even its previous
minimal cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly,'' said one official who returned returned from
Baghdad, ``they weren't going to cooperate and were going out of
their way to cause problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has already confessed to making enough deadly microbes to
kill all the people on earth several times over.
</P>
<P>
   After the Gulf War, Baghdad admitted to having loaded botulinum
toxin (which causes muscular paralysis resulting in death) into 16
warheads, anthrax (which causes high fever and is usually fatal
within two weeks) into five warheads, and aflotoxin (which causes
liver cancer) into four warheads.
</P>
<P>
   It also acknowledged having filled 157 bombs with the same
deadly agents, and having conducted research on tricothecene
micotoxins (which cause nausea, vomiting and diarrhea), wheat cover
smut (which ruins food grains, hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (which
causes extreme pain and temporary blindness) and rotavirus (which
causes acute diarrhea that can lead to death), and camel pox (a
camel version of small pox).
</P>
<P>
   But the inspectors now believe that Iraq could well have gone
even further, based on discrepancies between what Iraq has declared
having imported, consumed, and destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors said that the biological teams were denied at least
three key documents, at least one of which was key to reconciling
Iraq's reporting record.
</P>
<P>
   According to two inspectors, the U.N. team asked the Iraqis on
the morning of the first day of meetings for a ``log book'' that
described purchases and imports for the germ program, which several
of them had seen in 1995 but had failed to grasp its significance.
Among the log book's entries were imported shipments of media, or
the special foods used for growing germs.
</P>
<P>
   At the first meeting, the Iraqis promised to produce the
critical log book. But each day, they offered another excuse. The
inspectors said the book was critical to estimating the amount of
germ agents that Baghdad could have produced and turned into
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the Iraqi team said they couldn't find the book, two
inspectors said. Then the Iraqis said that the book should be
retrievable, but that if they found it, they would need the
approval of Tarik Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister, to release it
to the team.
</P>
<P>
   By the last day of the meetings, the Iraqis indicated that they
were still looking for the book.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, the Iraqis refused to provide documents they
acknowledged existed. One was a list of imported food to grow germs
from the customs department, which was also requested on the
meetings' first day. The Iraqis said they couldn't find them, an
inspector said.
</P>
<P>
   An inspector said that if Baghdad had used the imported germ
food to grow deadly agents, especially anthrax in either liquid or
dry form, the microbes could still be used in weapons.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 4, Diane Seaman, an U.S. inspector, tried to a lead a
large, experienced biological team into a site inspectors
considered routine.
</P>
<P>
   While she was permitted to go the building, the Iraqis refused
to open the doors of the office she sought to enter, telling her
that she would have to ``break down'' the locked doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a holy day,'' one inspector conceded. ``But there can
be no exempt days or the inspection system wouldn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis also delayed making available key officials from the
biological program whom the inspectors sought to interview. ``We
had asked for six,'' one inspector said. ``But they only produced
three of the people we wanted at the early meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   By the last meeting, when their usefulness was marginal, Iraq
finally produced the contingent.
</P>
<P>
   But the Iraqis have told inspectors that two top scientists in
the germ program whom the United Nations wanted to question are out
of the country. One of them was said to be in Britain, an
allegation London has flatly denied.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors said that Iraq was well aware of the stakes in
this latest round of test inspections and monitoring.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The military strike against Iraq ordered by
President Clinton on Wednesday was by far the largest and most
punishing since the 1991 Gulf War and was intended to cripple
Iraq's ability to make chemical, biological and nuclear weapons,
according to senior administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   They said the joint U.S.-British attack, which is expected to
last at least until this weekend, began with a wave of more than
200 Tomahawk cruise missiles, most of them launched against
facilities believed to be used by the Iraqis for the manufacture or
storage of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Other missiles, they said, were targeted against compounds of
buildings used by Iraqi intelligence agencies and by the elite
military unit known as the Republican Guard. Initial reports
Wednesday night suggested that one of President Saddam Hussein's
marble-draped palaces in central Baghdad had also been hit, and
that ambulances were rushing to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   While senior U.S. officials insisted that the air strikes would
significantly hamper Iraq's programs to make poison gas and nuclear
weapons, they readily acknowledged that the weapons programs would
continue and perhaps accelerate, and that the air strikes could
mean the end of the 7-year-old U.N. weapons inspection program in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Without the inspection program, they said, the Clinton
administration would have only a limited ability to monitor Iraq's
program to manufacture weapons of mass destruction _ and to prevent
Iraq from threatening its neighbors with poison gas.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, they said, will likely be forced to leave a
large military force in the region for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has already acknowledged that a military strike like the
one launched Wednesday would sound the death knell for the weapons
inspections that have been carried out in Iraq by the U.N. Special
Commission, or UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
   When he called off air strikes on Iraq last month, Clinton said
then that he had made the decision in part because he believed such
an attack ``would mean the end of UNSCOM'' and ``we would then have
no oversight, no insight, no involvement in what is going on in
Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After this, it's hard to imagine that Saddam will ever allow
the inspectors back in,'' said one U.S. official. ``So what is our
policy? What do we do in a post-UNSCOM world? I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   While refusing to provide full details on the weapons fired
against Iraq and the number of U.S. warplanes and ships that joined
in the mission, administration officials said Wednesday's attack
was several times larger than any strike launched against Iraq
since the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ``The others were pinpricks by comparison,'' one official said.
`'It's smaller than the war but much bigger than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   In June 1993, the United States fired 23 cruise missiles at
Iraqi intelligence headquarters in Baghdad in retaliation for an
alleged plot to assassinate former President Bush. In September
1996, 27 cruise missiles were launched against military targets in
southern Iraq in retaliation for the movement of Iraqi troops
against Kurds in northern Iraq.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   U.S. officials said that they have had target lists for the
attack ready since last month, when the United States initially
planned to launch air strikes against Iraq over its refusal to
allow unfettered weapons inspections by UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
   The target list, they said, included a variety of factories,
warehouses and military compounds identified by the U.N. inspectors
as potential sites for the manufacture or stockpiling of chemical
and biological weapons, some of them in Baghdad or on the outskirts
of the Iraqi capital.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Department officials, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said Wednesday's attack was similar in most respects to
the attack that was planned for last month, when the United States
and Britain were prepared to launch a first strike of nearly 300
cruise missiles from eight warships in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   They said the cruise missile attack that began Wednesday night
in Baghdad was followed by an intensive bombing campaign by F-14
and F-18 fighters launched from the aircraft carrier Enterprise,
which is now in the gulf. They said that several B-52 bombers
stationed on Diego Garcia, the British-controlled island in the
Indian Ocean, were expected to join in subsequent attacks this
week.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Defense Department, there are 24,100 U.S.
troops in the Gulf region; 22 warships, eight of them armed with
Tomahawk cruise missiles; and 201 military aircraft. The aircraft
carrier Carl Vinson is expected to join the Enterprise in the gulf
on Saturday, along with six other warships able to fire cruise
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen announced Wednesday that he had
ordered an additional 80 to 90 aircraft, including about a dozen
F-117 ``stealth'' fighter jets, to travel to the region to join in
the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has maintained a small but powerful force in the region
since last January, when Iraq's standoff over U.N. weapons
inspections first brought the threat of military action. The
British force in the region includes 12 Tornado fighter-bombers
stationed in Kuwait, six reconnaissance jets in Saudi Arabia and a
frigate in the gulf.

 WASHINGTON: long overdue. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, said the
timing of the attack was related to the Butler report to the United
Nations, and to military strategists' advice that any attack begin
as quickly as possible. The fact that Clinton was about to face the
threat of impeachment, Berger said, ``would not alter what he saw
as his responsibility as President.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott, who surprised some Republicans with his statement of
opposition to an overseas military enterprise, said he favored a
``more clearly defined'' operation, not a ``cursory air strike.''
Central to this, he said, should be ``the removal of Saddam Hussein
from power.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This administration has squandered too many opportunities in
Iraq,'' he contended.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, however, defended his record as the correct mixture of
diplomatic and economic pressures and, finally, force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark my words,'' he said of Saddam, ``he will develop weapons
of mass destruction. He will deploy them, and he will use them.
Because we're acting today, it is less likely that we will face
these dangers in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said that even if the arms inspectors could stay
in Iraq, their work would be ``a sham.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam's deception has defeated their effectiveness,'' he
said. ``Instead of the inspectors disarming Saddam, Saddam has
disarmed the inspectors.''
</P>
<P>
   He gave no indication of what Iraq might do to bring about a
halt in the strikes. Administration officials said later that the
raids would continue to completion and that there was nothing Iraq
could do to curtail them.

UNION WANTS COMMISSIONER TO OPEN TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A defiant Billy Hunter said he had no intention of calling David
Stern to restart talks and predicted that there would not be a
resolution to the National Basketball Association's labor dispute
before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   While Hunter, executive director of the players union, said both
parties could come to an agreement after a few days of intense
negotiations, he was agitated at times, using a conference call
with the news media Wednesday to put the onus for closing a deal
and salvaging the season on league officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to find ourselves locked into the 12th-hour
scenario,'' Hunter said. ``At this stage, it's almost like poker.
What they're trying to do is see who blinks first. Unless they're
prepared to compromise, there's not going to be a season and this
thing is just going to go up in smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   Where are the talks going on the 169th day of the lockout? Home
for the holidays. Stern, the NBA commissioner, is planning to leave
for a weeklong trip to his Colorado vacation home this weekend, and
Hunter said he would return home to Oakland, Calif. Both principal
negotiators said they could quickly return to New York if needed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with neither side in a rush to negotiate, it appears that
Jan. 1 is not a hard deadline for an impending settlement. Hunter
even spoke of the season beginning Feb. 1, a date that would allow
teams a 40- to 50-game season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it concerns me,'' Hunter said, when asked if he was
worried about not reaching an accord before Christmas. ``Am I
overly concerned? Obviously, I'm not. I look at David, and I figure
David will be the one to decide when and if we get a deal. When
he's ready, he'll negotiate. Obviously, his time line is not
affected by the week before Christmas now that he's going to Aspen,
Colo.''
</P>
<P>
   That was just one of several shots Hunter lobbed Stern's way
Wednesday. Indicative of how pride has filtered into the
negotiations, Hunter also seems to be fed up with initiating
conversations to bring the sides back to the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with initial contact, it gives the impression
we're weakened,'' he said. ``I know on several occasions they
haven't called because it's an issue of a pride, and that goes
before the fall. Maybe this time, I need to stay where I am and see
if they want to talk to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern disputed that Hunter is always the one to make first
contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to Hunter's assertions, last week's meetings were
convened at my initiative alone,'' Stern said in a written
statement. ``I called him on Tuesday, met privately with him that
evening and outlined to him the compromises the NBA was prepared to
make in order to achieve a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meetings that followed on Thursday and Saturday were thus
the result of my initiative and were without precondition. Hunter's
position at the Saturday meeting was that the union was prepared to
accept the NBA's concessions but was unprepared to make any
significant ones of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we told the union's representatives, we remain willing to
negotiate at any time and at any location if it will be
productive.''
</P>
<P>
   The most ominous stumbling blocks to a deal remain how large a
percentage of revenues will be devoted to salaries, and whether
there will be an absolute maximum salary for players with more than
seven years' experience. On many other issues, the sides are
gaining ground.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``There will be no piecemeal negotiations,'' Hunter said.
``We're not going to sit around and concede. We always concede to
the demands of the NBA, and we're no longer going to engage in
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter also addressed the issue of race in the negotiations, a
subject that has been openly discussed in articles in Newsweek
magazine and The New York Times this past week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is, you've got a group of extremely successful
businessmen who own teams,'' he said. ``Most of them are
billionaires. You've got men accustomed to seeing their dictates
honored. When they make a demand, it's customary that most people
respond to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other side of the table, you've got a group of players
who are predominantly African-American in origin. People can read
into it anything they want. But I think it's all about dollars.
It's about hard economics. People tend to read different things. If
things don't go right or tempers flare, the first reaction is, it's
got to be racial. I think we have to put that aside and get a
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Hunter also warned of the grave consequences of a lost
season, including the formation of a rival league. He spoke of
``other individuals who would step up and try to fill the void,
create another league, a competing league.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The NBA would take a hit and never recover. If
there's a mass exodus, I think the NBA would be decimated. It's
ludicrous for us to not try and reach an accord.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration's eagerness to strike
immediately after this latest challenge by Saddam Hussein to the
U.N. weapons inspectors marked a sharp break with past U.S.
practice, some senior administration officials said Wednesday, and
while Secretary of State Madeleine Albright talked to some 16
foreign ministers of the Security Council and European and Arab
allies, she did more informing than consulting.
</P>
<P>
   Her most heated conversation was with Russian Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov and only took place after the air strikes began,
officials said. The Russians have criticized the quick attack on
Iraq all day, and Albright rejected Ivanov's contention that the
main faults lie with U.N. inspectors and their chairman, Richard
Butler, and not Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she urged Ivanov to look beyond Iraq to more important
common interests Washington and Moscow share, including Russia's
own economic survival.
</P>
<P>
   France was also annoyed with Washington for getting Butler to
pull out his inspectors from Iraq without discussion with the
Security Council. French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said that his
country regretted ``the situation that has been created and which
prompted these American strikes in Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States won public support from its reliable allies
Japan and Canada while China joined Russia in angrily denouncing
the U.S. strike.
</P>
<P>
   And U.S. officials at the Pentagon and State Department were in
close touch all day with top Saudi officials, given Saudi Arabia's
willingness to let U.S. and British planes refuel from Saudi bases.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen said that from the start the
United States had planned to work closely with Britain. ``We also
had the support of many other nations,'' he said. ``I have talked
personally with a number of countries, and they were prepared to
volunteer assets. And they did in fact call and say they would be
supportive of anything that we were to undertake.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, also said
that when the president and his aides telephoned foreign leaders
they found ``a good deal of support in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the United States decided to avoid the time-consuming
process of asking countries other than Britain to take part in the
military operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided that we would act with the British, ourselves, with
the support of many other countries, but not necessarily with their
participation,'' Berger said, adding that pulling together a
multi-nation military operation would have ``taken us days, if not
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright did not speak with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
officials said. He issued a personal statement in New York on
Wednesday, calling this ``a sad day'' for the United Nations, the
world, and ``me personally,'' because of his failure to avert the
use of force despite great efforts.
</P>
<P>
   His sadness was justified, U.S. officials said, because
Wednesday's strikes also marked the end of a nearly eight-year
effort to police and disarm Iraq through the United Nations itself,
rather than through powerful Security Council members.
</P>
<P>
   The inspection process is largely dead, U.S. officials say.
Instead, Washington will use other forms of traditional
containment, including continued economic sanctions, threats,
support for opposition forces and the intermittent use of force to
try to restrain Saddam. But few officials believe that air power
alone can eliminate the threat posed by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the criticism Wednesday was America's timing and
lack of new consultation, and the fear that Clinton would be
perceived abroad, especially by Arab countries, for acting in his
own benefit to avoid rapid impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Some Western diplomats and analysts charged that U.S. officials
had worked closely with Butler and appeared to force the pace of
his report. But U.S. and allied officials countered that Butler had
coordinated some of the terms of his latest report on Iraqi
roadblocks with U.S. officials in confidential conversations on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Senior U.S. officials argued that the surprise factor and the
imminence of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month that begins Saturday
night _ not the impeachment vote _ was forcing the schedule, but
analysts were not convinced, and did not think the world would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``When other confrontations with Iraq have dragged out for days
and weeks while the administration geared up for a possible
response, checked off all the diplomatic boxes and then usually did
not act, how is it possible that the bombing had to happen today?''
asked Robert Kagan of the Carnegie Endowment. ``A reasonable person
is logically forced to view this with a degree of cynicism.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Kagan acknowledged, Clinton had authorized similar
air strikes a month ago, then called them off when Saddam appeared
to capitulate and promise full compliance with the United Nations.
And U.S. officials emphasized at the time that they expected Saddam
to renege on his promises, because he always intended to keep a
core of biological and chemical weapons, and they would be able to
use force later with less international criticism.
</P>
<P>
   And analysts said they had considerable concerns, both about how
effective the bombing campaign will be to rid Iraq of the weapons
of mass destruction Unscom inspectors were prevented from
uncovering, and about how the bombing may or may not fit into the
larger strategy of ridding the world of Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Even presuming that Clinton and his foreign-policy team had no
political reasons to bomb Wednesday, said William Quandt, a former
National Security Council official under Presidents Nixon and
Carter, ``my qualms are about what happens the day after the
bombing stops.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam's a disaster, but will this get rid of him?'' Quandt
asked. ``We know what we want but we're not prepared to pay the
price to do it. Bombing is the compromise choice that makes us feel
better, that we're somehow punishing Iraq, though not necessarily
Saddam, and we won't take any significant risks of casualties
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, one senior official said, using force now is also an
important signal to the world that Clinton will act when he needs
to, despite his domestic difficulties.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Wednesday evening, Clinton defended the joint U.S.-British
strikes, which he described as ``strong and sustained,'' and
intended to repress and degrade Iraq's ability to produce weapons
of mass destruction and use them against its neighbors. And U.S.
officials said more explicitly that the attacks were also designed
``to shake the regime'' by also targeting Saddam's structure of
power, including the Revolutionary Guard, his communications
facilities, his palaces and strongholds.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials also conceded that it is unlikely that the
Unscom inspectors will be able to return to Iraq and work freely,
and that in effect, the United States and Britain, acting on behalf
of the U.N. Security Council, had moved to a more traditional
containment policy. Rather than relying on Iraq, monitored by
Unscom, to disarm itself, Washington will now try to degrade Iraq's
capacities, rather than eliminate them, and to deter Saddam from
daring to use the terror weapons he may have.
</P>
<P>
   That policy includes an intention to strike later, again without
warning, if Iraq attempts to reconstitute its weapons of mass
destruction. It includes warnings to Saddam that he will be
obliterated if he uses such weapons, and attempts to keep harsh
economic sanctions on Saddam's regime, to limit its income.
</P>
<P>
   It also will include, Clinton said, more U.S. support for the
badly divided Iraqi opposition. That support was pressed on the
administration by the Congress this year in the $97-million Iraqi
Liberation Act.
</P>
<P>
   But senior U.S. officials say that efforts to replace Saddam
have failed badly in the past, and must be viewed as a long-term
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Officials joke that the money will provide the Iraqi opposition,
whose leaders live in London, with used U.S. armored personnel
carriers in which to ride through Mayfair.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department announced that it is ordering the departure
of dependents and some other personnel from diplomatic posts in Tel
Aviv, Jerusalem and Kuwait because of military action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The order is an upgrade of earlier warnings. A general travel
advisory to Americans to use caution and review their security
practices was also updated from November to mention the new
military strikes.
</P>
<P>
   But officials said there was no specific threat that prompted
the warning.

DNA TESTING PROPOSALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Dec. 17: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir's proposal to collect DNA
samples from anyone arrested in New York City is a threat to
personal privacy that is unnecessary for fighting crime. Safir says
the DNA record would be expunged if there is no conviction, but
minor offenders such as turnstile jumpers and protesters engaged in
acts of civil disobedience would have their DNA record entered into
a state data bank.
</P>
<P>
   Safir and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani argue that DNA sampling, done
by collecting saliva, is equivalent to taking fingerprints. But
there is a huge difference. Fingerprints cannot be used for any
purpose other than identification. DNA samples provide the
government extraordinary amounts of personal genetic information
that could be misused. Critics worry, for example, that such data
could leak into the hands of insurance companies to identify those
at risk for genetic diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, the state already collects DNA samples from
people who have been convicted of certain major crimes such as rape
and homicide. Prosecutors can also get a court order to take blood
and DNA samples if they have probable cause to target an individual
in an investigation. As it is, the police crime labs have not had
the capacity to test all DNA samples collected at the scenes of
unsolved crimes. Evidence has been routinely thrown out after five
years without being tested at all. If the department wants to do
more with DNA testing, it should start by testing the samples it
has.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has given civil libertarians even more reason for
concern. Wednesday he indicated he would not oppose DNA testing and
fingerprinting on all newborns _ a bold privacy invasion at birth
rather than arrest. He also suggested that DNA collected by the
police could be used to establish paternity and increase child
support payments in the city. But using DNA information that way
has nothing to do with solving crimes, the reason for which the DNA
supposedly would be collected. Any such change would require
approval from the state legislature, where Democratic lawmakers
have criticized these ideas. Some days it seems the mayor, who says
he champions civility, thinks it can only be achieved by police
surveillance.

SUPER BOWL: SAINTS vs. SEAHAWKS? 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Has new lead) 
By JIM BUZINSKI  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Could New Orleans and Seattle really end up in the Super Bowl?
You bet they can, though it won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the NFL playoff possibilities with two weeks remaining
in the regular season:
</P>
<P>
   NFC
</P>
<P>
   West
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta (12-2):
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have clinched a playoff spot. They will win the
division and have a first-round bye by defeating Detroit this week.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco (11-3):
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers have clinched a playoff spot. They will clinch the
division and have a first-round bye by winning their last two games
and if Atlanta loses to Detroit this week (based on best record vs.
common opponents).
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans (6-8):
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, the Saints will win a playoff spot with two
wins (against Arizona and Buffalo) and one Tampa Bay loss (based on
head-to-head wins over Arizona and Tampa).
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis (4-10)
</P>
<P>
   and Carolina (2-12)
</P>
<P>
   were eliminated before the end of Daylight Savings Time.
</P>
<P>
   Central
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota (13-1):
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings have clinched the Central Division and a first-round
bye. They will clinch home field advantage through the NFC playoffs
this week with either a win and if Atlanta beats Detroit by less
than 68 points, or an Atlanta loss.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay (9-5):
</P>
<P>
   The Packers will clinch a playoff berth with one win or one loss
by either Tampa Bay or Arizona. The only way for the Packers to not
make the playoffs would be to lose twice while Arizona and Tampa
each win twice. The Packers will almost certainly be the NFC's
fifth seed and have to play a wild card game at San Francisco or
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay (7-7):
</P>
<P>
   The Buccaneers will clinch a playoff berth with two wins and one
Arizona loss or two Green Bay losses. It is also mathematically
possible for Tampa to qualify at 8-8, but it would take up more
space than the Ken Starr referral.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit (5-9)
</P>
<P>
   and Chicago (3-11)
</P>
<P>
   were eliminated before the season premiere of the ``X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   East
</P>
<P>
   Dallas (8-6)
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys will clinch the NFC East with one win or one Arizona
loss. The only way for the Cowboys to miss the playoffs is to lose
twice while Tampa Bay beats Washington this week (based on a worst
record vs. common opponents with Tampa).
</P>
<P>
   Arizona (7-7)
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals will clinch their first playoff berth since moving
to the desert in 1988 with two wins, or a win this week coupled
with one Tampa Bay loss and one loss or tie by the New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
   New York (6-8):
</P>
<P>
   The Giants will clinch a playoff berth with two wins, two Tampa
Bay losses, plus one loss each by Arizona and New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Washington (5-9)
</P>
<P>
   and Philadelphia (3-11)
</P>
<P>
   were eliminated when Mark McGwire had only 40 homers.
</P>
<P>
   AFC
</P>
<P>
   West
</P>
<P>
   Denver (13-1):
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos have clinched home field advantage throughout the
AFC playoffs. Wish they were all this easy.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland (7-7):
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders will make the playoffs with two wins, plus two
losses each by Tennessee and New England and one loss by
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle (7-7):
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks will make the playoffs with two wins, plus two
losses by New England and one loss each
</P>
<P>
   by Tennessee, Pittsburgh and Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City (6-8)
</P>
<P>
   and San Diego (5-9)
</P>
<P>
   were eliminated when Newt Gingrich was still relevant.
</P>
<P>
   Central
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville (10-4):
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars will clinch the Central Division title with one win
or tie, or one Tennessee loss or tie. The Jaguars also clinch a
playoff spot with either a Miami loss or a New England loss or tie.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee (8-6):
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers will win the division with two wins and two
Jacksonville losses (based on better division record than the
Jaguars). The Oilers will clinch a playoff spot with two wins, plus
one loss by either
</P>
<P>
   New England or Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh (7-7):
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers will make the playoffs with two wins, plus two
losses each by New England and Tennessee. There might be a scenario
where the Steelers could wind up in a 9-7 tie with five teams and
still qualify, but my calculator only goes to 178 decimal places.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore (5-9)
</P>
<P>
   and Cincinnati (2-12)
</P>
<P>
   were eliminated when the American flag had 48 stars.
</P>
<P>
   East
</P>
<P>
   New York (10-4):
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have clinched a playoff spot and will win the division
title with a win over either Buffalo or New England. The Jets will
clinch a first-round bye with two wins, or one win and one
Jacksonville loss.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo (9-5):
</P>
<P>
   The Bills will win the division with two wins, two New York
losses and one Miami loss. The Bills will clinch a playoff spot
with a win, or a Tennessee loss as long as the Bills lose to the
Jets by less than 20.
</P>
<P>
   Miami (9-5):
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins will win the division with two wins, plus two New
York losses and one Buffalo loss. The Dolphins will clinch a
playoff berth with a win against Denver and any one of the
following occurring: a New England loss or tie; a Tennessee loss or
tie; or a Buffalo loss by more than one point.
</P>
<P>
   New England (8-6):
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots will clinch a playoff berth with a win and a
Tennessee loss. The Patriots can also win the division, but sending
a man to Mars is less complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis (3-11)
</P>
<P>
   was eliminated when the only Manning playing quarterback was
Archie.

TURBODYNE SUES SHORT SELLER OVER TECHNOLOGICAL FRAUD CLAIMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Turbodyne Technologies said it is suing a
well-known short seller for bad-mouthing the company, contributing
to a stock decline of 74 percent since July.
</P>
<P>
   The company filed a lawsuit against Manuel P. Asensio and his
New York firm, Asensio &AMP; Co., in Los Angeles County Superior Court.
The six-count complaint charges Asensio with fraud, defamation and
other violations for claiming that Turbodyne did not possess any
valuable technology or the patents for it.
</P>
<P>
   Turbodyne, based in suburban Woodland Hills, is seeking $60
million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   Asensio is a well-known short seller -- someone who profits from
a declining stock. In a short sale, an investor borrows shares from
a broker and immediately sells them with the intention of buying
shares to pay back the broker later when the stock price drops. The
short seller profits from the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Turbodyne has short sales of 1.96 million shares, with 41.3
million shares outstanding. Its stock closed Wednesday at $4.375,
up 25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   In an Aug. 4 report, Asensio &AMP; Co. said that ``no manufacturer
has ever incorporated a single Turbodyne product in a new engine or
vehicle. . . . Despite raising and spending over $55 million in
equity capital, Turbodyne has failed to create any new products.''
</P>
<P>
   Asensio contends that Turbodyne's technology, incorporated into
its Turbopac and Dynacharger products and expected to improve fuel
efficiency and minimize pollution, is merely an
``electric-motor-driven supercharger.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Asensio described his company's research on
Turbodyne as ``complete, correct and accurate.'' He said Turbodyne
has been making claims about its technology for years but that it
hasn't been reflected in sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fraudulent company that got caught,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Turbodyne argued that its ``breakthrough technology'' is
protected by more than 30 granted and pending patents worldwide. It
is certified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and is
being installed in buses nationwide, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is true that Turbodyne's annual sales of $39 million
come from another part of its business -- engine components and
cast-aluminum wheels.
</P>
<P>
   An expected surge in Russian sales for the new technology
disappeared when that country lapsed into an economic crisis, said
Brett Hendrickson, an analyst at B. Riley &AMP; Co. in West Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The company had expected a positive cash flow in the fourth
quarter, but that will be pushed back now because of the situation
in Russia, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Turbodyne lost $12 million,
or 35 cents per diluted share, on sales of $29.8 million. In 1997,
the company lost $13.2 million, or 50 cents per share, on revenues
of $39 million.

   NEW YORK _ The main suspects in the disappearance of an Upper
East Side millionaire were charged Wednesday with murder and a wide
range of other felonies in an 84-count indictment that details what
prosecutors said was a highly sophisticated scheme to steal the
missing woman's ornate East 65th Street mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators presumed that the missing woman, Irene Silverman,
82, who was last seen on July 5, was dead, but they have not found
her body. The suspects, Sante Kimes and her son, Kenneth, have been
charged with murder in an indictment that outlines a complex scheme
involving disguises, false identities, tapped telephones, forged
deeds, false addresses and burglaries.
</P>
<P>
   At no point does the indictment indicate how the Kimeses are
believed to have killed Mrs. Silverman, nor does it include
findings of fingerprints, blood samples or other forensic evidence
that would link them to Mrs. Silverman's disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   Along with second-degree murder, Mrs. Kimes, 64, and her son,
24, are charged with conspiracy, robbery, attempted robbery,
burglary, grand larceny, attempted grand larceny, weapons
possession, forgery, possession of forged instruments, possession
of stolen property and eavesdropping. If convicted of all charges,
they would face 131 1/3 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors may have a difficult task before them in proving
murder. While murder convictions have been won without the bodies
of the victims being found, the prosecutors have usually found a
witness who saw the victim abducted or someone who saw a suspect
disposing of a body. In the case detailed in Wednesday's
indictment, law enforcement officials appear to have no such
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   But Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said he was
confident that a murder conviction could be won. The indictment
states that the Kimeses kept detailed records of their scheme,
including whom they phoned under different aliases, that were
recovered when they were arrested in New York for passing a bad
check to buy a car in Utah on July 5. They have been held in
custody since then while investigators have tried to build a murder
case against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mere fact that you don't have a body doesn't give somebody
a walk,'' Morgenthau said. ``All the facts show that a murder was
committed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mel Sachs, the Kimeses' lawyer, called the evidence weak and
predicted an acquittal. ``They do not have proof to show that the
Kimeses intended to cause the death of Irene Silverman, caused the
death of Irene Silverman, or that Irene Silverman is deceased,'' he
said. ``There isn't any way that they connect the Kimeses to those
three essential elements.''
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir called the criminal scheme one
of the most sophisticated ever seen in New York City. ``This is as
complex and widespread a case as the NYPD has ever been involved
in,'' he said. ``These two are very competent and very cold
criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Kimeses, who have been suspected of carrying out a
nationwide string of frauds, are acquitted of murder, prosecutors
said the evidence against them on the lesser crimes was strong and
convictions were considered likely.
</P>
<P>
   The Kimeses, according to the indictment, also tried to trick
Mrs. Silverman's relatives, her former accountant, her employees
and her employees' relatives into divulging information about her
that would have helped them forge a deed turning her mansion over
to a company they controlled.
</P>
<P>
   While the indictment did not name who was cooperating with law
enforcement officials, it appeared from descriptions in the
indictment that two people associated with the Kimeses _ Jose
Alvarez, a Florida man they hired to work for them, and Stan
Patterson, an informer who turned them over to the police _ had
testified against the Kimeses before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kimes, according to the indictment, set the scheme into
motion in April by calling Mrs. Silverman's mansion and,
identifying herself as Eva Guerrero, saying she was searching for a
room for her boss. After her husband died, Mrs. Silverman had
turned her mansion into a high-price boardinghouse.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next two months, the Kimeses mounted an exhaustive
search for information about Mrs. Silverman's home, the indictment
said. On June 14, Kimes, using a false name, moved into the mansion
but instructed employees that no one was to know that Mrs. Kimes
and another man, apparently Alvarez, were living in his apartment,
it said, adding that from the day of their arrival, the Kimeses
ordered Alvarez to eavesdrop on conversations and monitor who
entered and left the building. For a week, they tapped Mrs.
Silverman's telephone calls, the indictment charged.
</P>
<P>
   Kimes, according to the indictment, concealed his face from a
surveillance camera as he entered the building by sliding along a
wall and hid Mrs. Kimes whenever she passed by the camera.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the Kimeses also made several unsuccessful attempts to
obtain Mrs. Silverman's Social Security number, the indictment
said. Those efforts also failed and the Kimeses eventually
manufactured a false Social Security card.
</P>
<P>
   The two also prepared the numerous forms needed to transfer
ownership of Mrs. Silverman's home to the Atlantis Group Ltd., a
company they controlled, according to the indictment. On July 2,
three days before Mrs. Silverman's disappearance, Mrs. Kimes
disguised herself as Mrs. Silverman, forged the widow's signature
and tricked a notary public into notarizing the documents, the
indictment said.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Flashing the smile that has helped make him a
clubhouse favorite on the Giants and the New England Patriots,
David Meggett put on a Jets cap Wednesday and pronounced himself
ready for a clutch performance despite 11 months away from
football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very confident,'' the new third-down back/kick returner
said. ``I've played in the league nine years in pressure
situations.''
</P>
<P>
   In four more days, he will have a role in another clutch game:
the Jets' attempt to capture their first division title since 1969,
when they were still playing in the American Football League. He
will return punts and kickoffs, and probably be in for a limited
number of running and receiving plays as the Jets tangle with the
Buffalo Bills in a crucial American Football Conference East game
in Orchard Park, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Meggett became a Jet after the team discovered Monday night that
Leon Johnson had cracked a rib in Sunday night's victory over the
Miami Dolphins. Johnson, who has been unable to match his versatile
rookie-season heroics this year, will be gone for the rest of the
campaign. He should recover in two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Dave will be a quality replacement,'' Coach Bill
Parcells said Wednesday of Meggett, a player he has coached on the
Giants and the Patriots and for whom he obviously has a high
regard. ``I'm very close to him and asked him how he was doing
three weeks ago, and he said he didn't think he was quite ready. I
called him two days ago and asked him if he was ready and he said,
`I can help you this weekend if you want me to.'''
</P>
<P>
   The 32-year-old Meggett looked at his watch as he thought of
what he would have been doing if Parcells hadn't lifted him from
limbo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm supposed to be taking a final right now,'' Meggett said.
</P>
<P>
   Meggett, who underwent foot surgery in April _ two months after
he was arrested and charged in conjunction with theft and assault
on a 33-year-old woman in Toronto _ was cut by the Patriots in May.
At the time, Patriots Coach Pete Carroll said that off-the-field
events played a role in deciding whether to keep the player. After
being released, Meggett enrolled at Towson State in Maryland and
took 15 credits toward a degree in sports administration.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he also maintained his workouts _ ``just as I've
been doing since I was 13 years old.'' He said that his foot
problem no longer was a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Previous Jets regimes would have been unlikely to hire a
Meggett, who still has the equivalent of a misdemeanor-theft charge
pending in Toronto. He is to answer that next March. He has had
several other legal battles stretching to 1990, including court
appearances over charges he beat up a girlfriend, and claims of
nonsupport payments for children he fathered with different women.
</P>
<P>
   But Parcells is the Jets' dictator for the new millennium. He
brings in players he wants. He brought in the controversial Bryan
Cox at linebacker over the summer, and he has become one of the
team's most important players. Beyond the fact that Parcells has
the power, though, he contends that Meggett ``is a trustworthy,
honest person.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's never lied to me, he's never been a discipline problem,''
said Parcells, who watched as the 5-foot-7-inch, 190-pound Meggett
went to the Pro Bowl from his 1989 Giants and his 1996 Patriots
teams and, of course, had Meggett on his 1990 Super Bowl
championship squad.
</P>
<P>
   Meggett is the National Football League's career leader in punt
returns and yardage. He said he did not know why the Patriots
released him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being in football nine years,'' he said, ``I never questioned
it.''
</P>
<P>
   So he wasn't upset the Patriots didn't back him up?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I didn't grow up with them,'' he said. ``I know Bill
Parcells has confidence in me as a person and a player.''
</P>
<P>
   But can Meggett now avoid the situations that got him into
trouble in the past?
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to be careful,'' he said. ``But things happen.'' He
made a reference to Murphy's Law: if there is a possibility for
something to go wrong, it will go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   As for the playoffs, he had an interesting spin. ``I feel kind
of good because I didn't have to do any work to get us here,''
Meggett said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Cox, who was named the AFC defensive player of the week on
Wednesday, returns to Buffalo on Saturday, where two previous
incidents resulted in heavy fines. The linebacker was fined $10,000
in 1993, when he was a Dolphin, for making obscene gestures toward
the fans. He later sued the league, claiming that fans had shouted
racial epithets and that the league hadn't provided a ``workplace
environment free from racial harassment.'' That suit was settled
when the league agreed to eject fans who use racial slurs, and the
fine was lowered to $3,000. He also was fined in 1995 when he spit
at fans after he was ejected for fighting with a Bills player. . .
. Two starters, defensive back Aaron Glenn (ankle) and fullback
Keith Byars (broken arm), are practicing this week and listed as
50-50 to play against Buffalo. . . . Bills Coach Wade Phillips said
the way the Jets' defense harried Doug Flutie in their first
meeting this season led to a change in Buffalo's offensive
alignment. ``One guy `spied' on Doug,'' said Phillips, describing
how linebacker James Farrior's assignment was to shadow Flutie. The
Bills subsequently changed their offense, spreading it with more
receivers and making it difficult to key on the quarterback.
Meanwhile, Flutie has never lost a regular-season home game as a
starter in the NFL. His record: 11-0 with the Patriots and the
Bills, including 5-0 this season. &QL;

COMMENTARY: WHAT TO THINK?  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We interrupt this impeachment to bring you the bombing of Iraq
...''
</P>
<P>
   What to think? An international crisis in the nick of time? The
latest development in a yearlong series of cynical and
irresponsible acts by government officials? A president and a
Congress locked in a domestic war that has flamed dangerously out
of control? Stay tuned.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment-eve attack on military and security targets in
Iraq had the dramatic impact usually reserved for the cheapest of
melodramas, which is exactly what we have been living through. The
sudden launching of deadly cruise missiles by a previously
unwarlike president was guaranteed to fuel the suspicions and the
anger of Republicans in Congress who were all set to wrap the cloak
of historical ignominy around William Jefferson Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The attack was followed immediately by accusations that Clinton,
as slippery as ever, had wagged the dog in a last-ditch effort to
escape impeachment for having lied about having sex with ``that
woman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Never underestimate a desperate president,'' said Rep. Gerald
Solomon, a Republican from upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   What to think?
</P>
<P>
   A president who evaded the draft as a young man and has avoided
the use of force through most of his presidency has now launched
his second series of attacks in recent months. The first came last
August when Clinton ordered the bombing of targets in Afghanistan
and the Sudan in retaliation for the bombing of U.S. embassies in
East Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks in Afghanistan and the Sudan came just three days
after Clinton had gone on national television to acknowledge that
he had had an inappropriate relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
``Wag the Dog'' theories were rampant.
</P>
<P>
   A disturbing, surreal haze covers nearly every development now.
Every act and every utterance has multiple potential meanings. The
right wing of the Republican Party clearly is out to destroy
Clinton. At the same time, the president has lied so often and so
easily it is difficult to know when he is telling the truth, or if
he ever tells the whole truth.
</P>
<P>
   I am going to hope, whatever the merits of the bombing in Iraq,
that the president is not lying now.
</P>
<P>
   In his address to the nation Wednesday night, Clinton stressed
that the attack _ and its timing _ had the unanimous support of his
national security team, which includes the vice president, the
secretary of state, the secretary of defense, the chairman of the
joint chiefs of staff and the national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   If they are all wagging the dog, we are in deeper trouble than
we can imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Before the attack was announced, I was writing about the
``almost certain'' impeachment of Clinton. I had written, ``The
right wing of the Republican Party has seized command of the ship
of state and cannot be dissuaded from ramming it into the iceberg
of impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's actions have postponed that collision, but only for
the moment. The country is in a strange and dangerous state.
Feelings of bitterness and suspicions of bad faith permeate the
government. Clinton, despite his forceful statement on Iraq, is
reeling from self-inflicted wounds and his enemies are moving in
for the kill. This is happening despite the verdict of the public,
which has said, loudly, ``Enough.'' Most Americans believe Congress
should censure the president and move on.
</P>
<P>
   But Tom DeLay, the House Republican whip and right-wing zealot
who is leading the crusade to oust Clinton, says Congress has a
``duty'' to impeach him. And the so-called Republican
``moderates,'' who might have staved off the radical remedy of
impeachment, have chosen to surrender their independence and are
lining up like lackeys to follow DeLay's fanatical lead.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton has always been his own worst enemy. He has always
furnished his opponents with generous amounts of ammunition to use
against him.
</P>
<P>
   Now the nation is engaged in a crisis at home and a conflict
abroad. Bill Clinton had better be telling the whole truth about
the attack on Iraq. If it turns out he's not, the rest of the
country will turn away from him and join the Republicans in
demanding his impeachment, and his ouster from office.

 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It became startlingly clear Wednesday how much the
long months of evasion and legalisms, how much his enemies'
unceasing denunciations of him as a liar, have cost Bill Clinton
and the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Gripped by crisis on two fronts, in Congress and the Middle
East, the president came face to face with the stinging reality
that his credibility is crumbling, especially but not exclusively
among Republicans on Capitol Hill. Some sober, experienced leaders
no longer take him at his word. It is a situation he must remedy,
and quickly, but it is not clear he can do so.
</P>
<P>
   On a day of truly explosive drama in this politically
punch-drunk capital, two of the long-running conflicts of these
final years of the old millennium collided with a bang: the Western
allies' struggle to contain and disarm resilient President Saddam
Hussein of Iraq, and Clinton's struggle to govern effectively in
the face of the assaults of his political foes.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader, went so far as to
publicly question Clinton's motives in ordering attacks on Iraq _ a
violation of Washington's long-standing political code. You don't
criticize the president, that code says, when U.S. forces stand in
harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Schwarzkopf, the retired general who commanded U.S.
troops in the Gulf War, joined prominent Democrats in firing back.
He said on NBC, ``By golly, troops are committed, and we can't have
people second-guessing the way they did in Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans were a bit more cautious. The incoming House
speaker, Rep. Bob Livingston of Louisiana, said he would leave
questions of presidential motive and timing to the American people.
But he pointedly said several times that he supported ``the
troops,'' without saying he supported the president.
</P>
<P>
   This was the climax, in a way, of years of deterioration in this
city's political civility. The habit of refusing to give one's
adversaries the benefit of the doubt, of viewing them as enemies
rather than opponents, increasingly ingrained in the congressional
culture, has now seized a beachhead in foreign-policy debate.
</P>
<P>
   As the hours passed, on the eve of the scheduled start of the
House's first impeachment debate in 130 years, one previously
uncommitted Republican after another announced plans to vote
against the president. With Clinton's strategy of courting the
moderates in ruin, gloom enveloped the White House, and a top
Clinton strategist said, ``It's time to think about the Senate and
the trial.'' A trial would follow a House vote to impeach the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., who had announced plans to vote
against impeachment, switched sides, and he was joined on the
anti-Clinton list by Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa. Exaggerating only
slightly, a White House aide said, ``If we can't get Leach, we
can't get anybody.'' But even as he was speaking, missiles were
being readied for launch against Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   When they struck, and when Clinton made a broadcast justifying
his decision to order ``a strong, sustained series of air strikes''
against Iraq, the Washington political establishment might have
been expected to rally behind him. Some spoke out in support, but
there was harsh criticism as well, tinged with the suspicion that
this was just a ploy to buy time on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   It was not so much the words but the men who spoke them that
rattled the president's inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, who has been the prime mover behind
impeachment, declared on a television show last Sunday that he did
not believe anything Clinton said. A few heads snapped back. But
DeLay is one of the most partisan and most ideological of the House
Republicans, a bit of an outsider, so allowances were made. But
Lott and Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., the House Rules Committee
chairman, are major establishment figures.
</P>
<P>
   When they expressed doubts about the president's policy itself
and about its timing, in full knowledge that the decision to attack
had been made, the Washington political community was astonished.
Then, not long after the first missile strikes, Lawrence
Eagleburger, a career foreign service officer and former secretary
of state, said on CNN that he understood why attacks had to be made
eventually but thought the timing ``smells to high heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott all but said he did not believe the administration
officials who briefed him. Despite their assurances that
impeachment had nothing to do with the decision to attack, he
declared in a statement, ``Both the timing and the policy are
subject to question.''
</P>
<P>
   Solomon said, ``Never underestimate a desperate president.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how long the attacks on Iraq would continue.
Both Defense Secretary William Cohen and National Security Adviser
Sandy Berger declined to answer the question Wednesday night, and
Clinton himself said only that it would have been a mistake to
begin the bombing campaign during the Islamic holy month, Ramadan,
which begins this weekend. He did not say it could not continue
during Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
   If the bombing lasts for only three or four days, Clinton will
be accused of making an empty gesture; during the Gulf War, weeks
of attacks were required to make limited gains. If it lasts
indefinitely, Clinton will be accused of trying to delay the
impeachment vote as long as he can.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Buying time might be the president's best hope, if only a very
slim one. Pro-impeachment sentiment has reached a peak this week,
but it could conceivably dissipate if the roll-call is
significantly postponed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is not the first president since the end of World War II
to have his foreign policy motives questioned. Ronald Reagan was
accused by a few members of Congress and a few editorial writers of
staging the invasion of Grenada to mute criticism of his failure to
protect marines who were killed in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   But not since Harry Truman and the Korean War has a president
been subjected to quite the same level of questioning of motive
that Clinton was subjected to Wednesday. The fact that Lott
released his statement moments before the attack increased the
sense that he was undercutting the president.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans did, in fact, rally to the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Kolbe of Arizona was in the midst of a press conference
in Tucson lambasting Clinton for ``impeachable offenses'' when
handed a note about the air raids, and he changed course
immediately, voicing support for the attack.
</P>
<P>
   But many others, while not willing to speak as bluntly or as
publicly as Solomon and Lott, gave voice privately to deep
suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton tried his best to allay them, quoting American military
planners as saying that waiting would give Saddam time to conceal
and protect elements of his suspected nuclear and chemical
arsenals. But he did not address a report in Wednesday's Washington
Post that suggested that the administration had orchestrated the
timing and content of the report by Richard Butler, the chief
United Nations inspector, that preceded the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, British Prime Minister Tony Blair proved himself a
friend in need. By agreeing to join in the attacks, and by
defending his decision in an eloquent statement carried on
international television, Blair gave Clinton political cover
against his partisan critics. That was especially welcome in view
of the opposition voiced by China, Russia and France.
</P>
<P>
   The president did all he could to make Wednesday night's
television appearance look like business as usual _ a calm, serious
report about a threat to the national interest, with only a quick,
glancing reference to his own troubles. But he delivered it in a
setting he has recently avoided, the Oval Office, near which many
of his fateful meetings with Monica S. Lewinsky took place.

 Y2K Software Has Problems of Its Own  &HT;       
 By David Einstein 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
For something that boils down to just two digits, the Year 2000
problem certainly has created a thorny dilemma for business and
governments around the world.
</P>
<P>
   It also presents risks to consumers, who may find that their
personal computers won't be able to handle the fact that ``00''
could just as easily be 1900 as 2000. And many software programs _
including Windows 98 _ could have problems when the big ball comes
down in Times Square next year on December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Where there is danger there also is opportunity, however. In
this case, it's the opportunity for software companies to make
money selling programs that fix Y2K problems in PCs. A flurry of
such programs has hit the market in recent months, and more are
sure to follow as the deadly deadline approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K programs check your hardware and software for Year 2000
compliance. They're also designed to fix many of the problems they
encounter, including changing two-digit date fields to four digits
in database and spreadsheet files.
</P>
<P>
   In most newer PCs, Y2K software probably can fix the system's
bios and clock so that they can handle the new millennium. The bios
is the built-in software that tests your system at startup and
makes sure the software can work with the hardware. If your PC was
made before 1997, however, you may have to upgrade the bios.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the two front-runners in the race for your
Year 2000 dollars are Symantec and Network Associates _ the same
companies that have made a killing scaring the hell out of people
about computer viruses and getting them to buy anti-virus programs.
Symantec sells Norton 2000 for $50, and Network Associates sells
the McAfee 2000 Toolbox for $30. Another popular Y2K program is Fix
2000, which goes for $50, from Intelliquis.
</P>
<P>
   I tested all three of those programs on a Compaq Presario loaded
with Windows 98, Microsoft Office 97, Microsoft Money, Microsoft
Front Page, WinFax Pro, America Online, Netscape Communicator,
Paint Shop Pro, Zip-It and a bunch of other stuff I can't remember.
</P>
<P>
   All three Y2K busters gave my system a passing grade in the
hardware department. But they came up with different conclusions
when it came to software.
</P>
<P>
   Norton 2000 told me that Windows 98 and WinFax Pro were known to
have Year 2000 issues (ironic, because WinFax is made by Symantec).
</P>
<P>
   McAfee's 2000 Toolbox found only one problem application _
Microsoft Money.
</P>
<P>
   According to Fix 2000, I've got problems with half a dozen
programs, including Netscape, Front Page and Adobe Acrobat Reader.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, this didn't exactly fill me with confidence.
But it did give me some insight into the horrendous difficulties
presented by the Year 2000. If my little PC is so difficult to
diagnose, think of the magnitude of the problem facing Citibank or
the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   Which Y2K program did the best job? You got me. I suspect that
to ferret out all the potential problems, you'd have to run all of
them _ and perhaps a few others as well.
</P>
<P>
   Among the three programs, Norton 2000 has the best presentation.
In addition to listing applications with known Y2K problems, it
tells you which programs on your PC are questionable when it comes
to Year 2000 compliance, and which applications are claimed to be
compliant by their manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Norton 2000 also calculates the severity of each problem, so you
can identify the ones likely to torpedo your software.
</P>
<P>
   With both Norton 2000 and McAfee 2000 Toolbox, you can get the
latest update for the program anytime for free over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   I have a better idea. Hold off on buying a Y2K program for now.
You've got until the end of next year to deal with it, and in the
meantime, why worry. Besides, maybe the programs will be better by
then.

 E-tailers now offering gifts you can custom-design  &HT;       
 By Jamie Beckett 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Many children tearing open their presents in the next week will
find something that makes them feel special. But a few may be
surprised by a gift that really has their name on it.
</P>
<P>
   It might be ``A Bug's Life'' T-shirt emblazoned with Johnny or
Jane's name, his or her favorite character from the film and a few
special words.
</P>
<P>
   Or a CD labeled ``Jane's CD'' with a selection of her favorite
Christmas or Hanukkah songs. Or a Barbie doll designed to look just
like her.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody likes to be seen as an individual. But in the world of
mass retailing, that's been largely impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Internet. Unlike any other mass medium, the Internet
offers merchants the ability to communicate individually with their
customers. A growing number of sites now offer personalization
features that enable customers to set preferences for what they'd
like to buy or how they'd like the site to look.
</P>
<P>
   But a handful of companies such as Disney and Mattel have taken
personalization a step further by allowing shoppers to
custom-design gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing more than taking the technology of the Internet
and putting it into the hands of the computer user,'' said Russell
Gillam, vice president for electronic commerce at the Buena Vista
Internet Group. He is responsible for both Disney.com and ESPN.com.
</P>
<P>
   Disney added ``Design Online'' to its  &LR; www.disney.com  &LR; site in
February and changes the gift selection seasonally. Although it is
too late to order a custom-designed gift for Christmas, the site
offers gifts for birthdays, holidays and other events decorated
with the smiling faces of such familiar characters as Winnie the
Pooh, Mickey and Minnie Mouse, and Flik and Atta from ``A Bug's
Life.'' Besides the characters, gift-givers can put a name or
personal message (or sometimes both) on a mug, T-shirt, watch,
picture frame, baby's romper and lots of other items.
Custom-designing adds a few dollars to the cost of the item _ an
$18 T-shirt, for instance, is $24 when you personalize it.
</P>
<P>
   Although he isn't providing specifics, Gillam said ``Design
Online'' has been a big hit. The company also is offering
personalized sports jerseys at &LR;  www.espn.com. &LR;  For an extra $30-$50
(depending on the product) shoppers can put the name and number of
their favorite player, a friend or relative or even themselves on
the back of the shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people on the Web are looking for things like this.
You can't manipulate things this way in a retail store or
catalog,'' he said. ``It's something only the Web can bring.''
</P>
<P>
   This ``mass customization'' can provide merchants with lots of
advantages, said Julia Pickar, an analyst at Zona Research in
Redwood City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty of mass customization is that the customer
perceives greater value in the personalization for obvious reasons
_ they are getting exactly what they want. But the cost of
providing these products doesn't increase for each variation,''
Pickar said.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the customization is self-service and doesn't
require the e-retailer to interact with each person or take the
time to record each complicated order, said Ken Cassar, an analyst
in Jupiter Communication's digital commerce group in New York.
</P>
<P>
   That may be a boon to merchants, but for customers, self-service
often can mean no service. The process isn't always easy, and the
flexibility is limited to whatever choices the merchant allows.
Finding out when an order will be delivered or whether a company
can ship in time for a holiday or event requires an e-mail or phone
call. The same goes for any questions that shoppers may have about
an item. And don't even think about changing an order _ names had
better be spelled right the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Still, online customization can be an easy and relatively
inexpensive way to find a unique gift. Among those singing its
praises are some of the music sites. At CDnow ( &LR; www.cdnow.com &LR; ) and
Music Boulevard ( &LR; www.musicblvd.com &LR; ) and a number of smaller
sites, customers can pick the holiday songs they want to hear and
burn them onto a CD. CDnow has Hanukkah and Christmas songs. Music
Boulevard offers only Christmas tunes. Both sites can take orders
for Christmas delivery as late as Monday (with overnight shipping).
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be a lot less economical to do without the
Internet. You wouldn't have as great a reach,'' said Ted Hooban,
digital media director at CDnow.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Washington, Pa., company is selling customized holiday
CDs until December 31 and is working to add other song titles to
its ``burn-your-own'' repertoire. That involves negotiating
licensing deals with record companies, which have been reluctant to
issue licenses for individual songs because of concerns that
customers then won't buy albums.
</P>
<P>
   ``People send us e-mail and say they really like the holiday
thing and want more,'' Hooban said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Barbie dolls can get a personal touch. At Mattel's
 &LR; www.barbie.com &LR;  site, girls can design their own ``friend of
Barbie'' for $39.95. With a few clicks, they can pick the doll's
skin color, eye color, hair color and style.
</P>
<P>
   But customization will go only so far, and you can't always get
what you want. The dolls apparently must adhere to certain Barbie
beauty standards. There are no curly or kinky-haired dolls, no
plump ones and none of them wear glasses.

 More Rivalry May Come to Phone Market  &HT;       
 By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Californians could inch a few steps closer toward true local
competition for telephone and high-speed data services if state
regulators approve several proposals today.
</P>
<P>
   The California Public Utilities Commission is expected to tell
Pacific Bell that it must give competitors access to the phone
company's telephone network and set cheaper rates for that access.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The commission also is expected to approve a road map
outlining steps Pac Bell must take to open the local telephone
market to competition, which it must do before the PUC will allow
it to enter the lucrative long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   Since the passage of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, competing
phone companies have struggled to gain market share in California.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the companies, such as MCI WorldCom and AT&AMP;T, and
consumer groups have blamed Pac Bell, saying the Baby Bell has
created barriers to competition by denying affordable access to its
local phone network.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors need to connect to parts of Pac Bell's telephone
network in order to offer service because it is the only existing
infrastructure that serves most Californians.
</P>
<P>
   Companies have been fighting with Pac Bell for the right to put
their equipment in its central offices in order to connect with Pac
Bell's network.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell has allowed some competitors in, but has often claimed
that there is no space in its central offices for all the
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC is expected to approve an order that would force Pac
Bell to prove the lack of space each time it denies a company's
request to house equipment. The proposed decision calls for an
independent, third-party inspection to verify whether there truly
is no space.
</P>
<P>
   ``For consumers, this means that every time the phone company
contends there is no space, competitors and consumers won't be
forced to take Pac Bell's word on it,'' said Dhruv Khanna, vice
president of Covad Communications. ``This is a breakthrough and it
means the first step toward true local competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Covad, a San Jose company which offers high-speed data services
such as digital subscriber lines, has been fighting Pac Bell about
the issue for more than a year. It has gotten permission to locate
its equipment in several Pac Bell offices, but is still not in
every office it wants access to.
</P>
<P>
   Khanna said he hopes the PUC's decision will change that.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Mashek, a spokesman for Pac Bell, said the company supports
the proposed decision and welcomes third-party inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a reasonable way to ensure that competitors have space in
our locations,'' Mashek said.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies are also hopeful the commission will approve a
proposal that could lower what competitors have to pay to connect
to Pac Bell's network.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, a competitor must buy an ``unbundled network
element'' or a piece of Pac Bell's telephone network if it wants to
sell phone service in the state. Pac Bell has been charging some
competitors about $440 for each customer the competitor signs to
its network _ a charge the companies say is prohibitively
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   It's forced most companies to abandon their quest to serve
residential customers and focus instead on the lucrative business
customer market.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the pricing isn't right, there will never be competition in
the residential market,'' said Barbara Gibson, a spokeswoman for
MCI. ``Pac Bell's rates (for competitor access to its network) are
the highest in the nation by far.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathi Oram, a spokeswoman for AT&AMP;T, said the commission's
proposed decision would make it easier for the phone giant to offer
local service to residential customers.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of PACBELL1 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``The decisions being made are certainly going to help us take a
step forward,'' she said. ``It puts the prices closer to cost,
which is where they should have been to begin with.''
</P>
<P>
   The PUC is expected to vote on a pricing formula and is expected
to set actual prices next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Oram said the commission's expected rejection of Pac Bell's
long-distance application also will help speed competition.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, a judge with the PUC recommended Pac Bell's
application to offer long-distance service be denied because it has
failed to open up the local market to competition. The decision
also outlined what steps the company needs to take to gain entry
into the long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is expected to approve the judge's decision.

<HEADLINE>
FLUTIE IS NOT A MAN TO BE FOOLED TWICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Minutes after Doug Flutie last played against the Jets, he
looked like a man who had walked through a car wash without a
raincoat. He was drenched with sweat, even more than usual for a
National Football League player following a very physical game. He
was limping a bit, and blood was sprinkled on his uniform. Flutie
looked, well, flustered, as if he could have used a big bowl of
Flutie Flakes.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' coach, Bill Parcells, and his defensive coordinator,
Bill Belichick, had devised a brilliant scheme to stop one of the
most athletic quarterbacks in the game. The Jets used four
linebackers and four defensive backs to keep Flutie pinned in the
pocket _ blitzing him relentlessly _ and flooded key areas of the
field with Jets bodies.
</P>
<P>
   It worked. Flutie spent the afternoon scrambling from men in
green. Receivers weren't open. The running game was stopped cold.
He finished with 12 completions on 30 attempts for 154 yards
passing, with two interceptions and no touchdown passes in a 34-12
loss on Nov. 8. Very un-Flutie-like.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been five years since I got my tail kicked like this,''
Flutie said then. ``Their four linebackers and four defensive backs
gave me trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets are basically the only team to put a crimp in Flutie's
comeback tour. Until that game, he had 10 touchdown passes and was
the hottest property this side of videotape for an instant replay
machine; but that day Buffalo managed just four field goals.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the rematch at Rich Stadium on Saturday, and this is
where football becomes fun. What will the Jets attempt this time to
try to stifle Flutie? And what will Flutie and the Bills do in
anticipation of what the Jets may try?
</P>
<P>
   Do not think that Flutie, the ultimate competitor, isn't looking
to even the score. People around the Bills say that Flutie, of
course, wants his team to win this weekend, but he was also irked
at how the Jets were bragging about shutting him down. He has
studied extra hard this week, not wanting to be caught off guard by
anything the Jets dream up on a chalkboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably true,'' the Bills' owner, Ralph Wilson, said.
``That's Doug. After the Jets game, I went into the locker room,
and Doug was dejected. But he turned to me and said, `Don't worry
Ralph, I've never lost two games in a row.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who knows football as well as anybody in the NFL, added:
``The Jets have a very, very good team. They defended Doug very
well. Parcells and Belichick are very good. But I don't think Doug
played his best game against them. I don't want to take anything
away from the Jets, but I think there will be a different Doug
Flutie this game.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's the point. Before people begin anointing the Jets as
the best team in the American Football Conference East and the
biggest threat to the Denver Broncos in the playoffs, they have to
go through an extremely motivated 5-foot-9-inch quarterback, a man
unlikely to be fooled twice.
</P>
<P>
   After the Jets, Flutie went on to win four of his next five
games. The only loss came against New England _ yes, that game _ in
which officials erred on two critical calls and probably still see
Wilson's angry face in their sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking over for an injured Rob Johnson in the first
quarter of the Bills' fifth game, he has helped them recover from
an 0-3 start. Largely because of Flutie, who Wednesday was selected
as the third quarterback for the Pro Bowl, Buffalo can become only
the fifth team in league history to lose its first three games and
make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills learned a valuable lesson in their loss to the Jets.
They were made painfully aware that Flutie is vulnerable to certain
defensive schemes. The Jets used linebacker James Farrior as a
``spy,'' that is to say Flutie had his own personal shadow all over
the field. Since then, Buffalo has adapted.
</P>
<P>
   Bills Coach Wade Phillips said the team has spread out the
offense, going to four wide receivers at times, and preventing the
use of a spy or stacking parts of the field with four linebackers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a little bit different offense now,'' said Flutie, who
is 11-0 in NFL home games. ``As a matter of fact, the week of the
Jets game, we were expecting to open up the offense a little bit
more and we were tinkering with it, but we hadn't practiced it
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Belichick will adapt to what the Bills do now, then
the Bills will adapt, then Belichick will counter. Games inside
games.
</P>
<P>
   Strategy is important, but the game could ultimately come down
to Flutie's athleticism and leadership skills. Expect Flutie to
make more audibles at the line of scrimmage and create more on the
fly than he did in the last Jets game.
</P>
<P>
   Also, look for the return of that great Flutie pizazz that
seemed toned down when the game was at Giants Stadium. Flutie loves
to high-five his teammates and pump his fists in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of what makes Doug great is his enthusiasm,'' Wilson
said. ``Instead of walking off the field, he runs off the field.
I've seen some of these quarterbacks and they kind of amble off the
field, like they are walking down Fifth Avenue.''
</P>
<P>
   No walking for Flutie _ he seems to always be running. On
Saturday against the Jets, he doesn't want to run for his life.

 PUC Set To Vote on Rules for Pac Bell  &HT;       
 By Rebecca Smith 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
The state Public Utilities Commission is scheduled to vote today on
a new set of minimum standards intended to boost the quality of
Pacific Bell phone service.
</P>
<P>
   The vote comes in the wake of a six-month investigation by state
regulators into complaints about substandard service _ including
missed appointments, shoddy repairs and a shortage of lines _ in
Pacific Bell's huge territory that spans 52 of the state's 58
counties.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the new standards would force Pacific Bell
to install new phones within three days of when they are ordered.
Customers would get refunds for extended delays.
</P>
<P>
   The move is an attempt to get Pacific Bell to channel money to
where it can do the most good _ upgrading equipment and adding
personnel who can provide better service.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the rules don't go far enough. Instead of tough
standards backed by stiff penalties, they say the proposed rules
rely on small refunds and the ``competitive market'' to motivate
Pacific Bell to do the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because there's the potential for competition, doesn't
mean we should accept a degradation in the quality of service that
has been provided to us for a hundred years,'' said Elena Schmid,
director of the PUC's Office of Ratepayer Advocates. ``The PUC has
a duty to see that ratepayers get the service they're entitled
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Other critics say the standards are weak because they apply
solely to incumbent carriers like Pacific Bell and General Tele
phone of California, not to the 600-plus other telephone companies
doing business in California.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Pacific Bell says the proposed standards are the
result of slipshod investigative work by the PUC. For one thing,
the PUC refused to hold public hearings. And it failed to collect
comprehensive complaint data, either from its own staff or the
phone company.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC's own statistics were inadmissible because flaws in the
way complaints are recorded resulted in some over counting. The
problem still has not been corrected.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC launched the investigation into phone service quality on
June 18 in response to an increasing number of complaints from
customers who were frustrated with delays in getting new phone
lines put in and getting phones repaired. By law, the PUC must
provide ``high-quality telecommunications service to all
Californians.''
</P>
<P>
   In large measure, the proposed order reflects the PUC's
ambivalence about regulating utilities in deregulated industries.
For much of this decade, the PUC watched passively as Pacific Bell
cut nearly one-third of its workforce and reduced capital
investments in the basic phone network by hundreds of millions of
dollars, when adjusted for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The insufficient spending resulted in a chronic shortage of
phone lines, increases in broken lines and long delays in reaching
people who could help.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC was warned repeatedly in the past five years that
Pacific Bell service had deteriorated. But it adopted a hands-off
posture, trusting the marketplace to make Pacific Bell improve
service.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in July 1997, the chiefs of the PUC's
telecommunications and consumer services divisions gave the
five-member commission a memorandum that detailed substandard
service during a 20-month period ending in November 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The memo, which was updated in January, compared Pacific Bell's
performance with industry standards developed by the National
Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, some state
standards and the phone company's own internal goals.
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell, it found:
</P>
<P>
   _ Repair work was abysmal. NARUC said states should require 90
percent of work orders be completed within 24 hours. Pacific Bell's
goal was 60 percent. Its average performance was 40.6 percent.
California had no standard, and the proposed rules simply grant
small daily refunds if repairs take too long.
</P>
<P>
   _ Installation performance was substandard. NARUC said states
should require 90 percent of installations be completed within
three days. Pac Bell's average was 75.9 percent within three days.
</P>
<P>
   Its internal target was 80 percent within one day when the July
1997 memo was prepared. By the time it was revised in January, the
phone company had reduced its internal objective to 80 percent
within five days.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of knocking heads at Pac Bell over these performance
problems, the commission preferred to tweak the market structure
that it believed had failed consumers.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the five PUC members, all Republicans, trusted
competitive markets to police service quality, even though Pac Bell
faces no meaningful competition for the dial tone service it
provides to 25 million of the state's 32 million residents.
</P>
<P>
   PUC Commissioner Jessie Knight Jr. defended the commission's
approach. ``It's not necessarily Pac Bell I would fault but the
whole monopoly system that's been used to provide service,'' he
said. ``I blame the regulatory scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   SBC Communications Inc. of Texas acknowledged it inherited a
system punctuated with problems when it took control of Pacific
Bell last year. ``We knew something had to be done,'' said Ed
Mueller, former chief of Southwestern Bell who has headed Pacific
Bell for a year.
</P>
<P>
   SBC dramatically stepped up spending and hiring, but the weight
of past neglect, combined with explosive demand for new lines for
fax machines and Internet browsing, made the game of catchup
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   When the commission meets today, it will consider a hastily
written order that was written with input from only a handful of
telephone utilities and consumer groups.
</P>
<P>
   Why the haste? The terms of two of the PUC's five commissioners
expire at the end of the year. That means there is a push to get
work out the door. ``It's hard to set a standard that covers the
whole waterfront,'' said Greg Conlon, the lead commissioner on the
case. ``In the short run, I just wanted to fix the problems we know
we've got.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some provisions of the proposed order:
</P>
<P>
   _ It requires that 90 percent of phone installations be
completed within three days of when service is ordered, but only
``when sufficient existing plant (equipment) is available.''
</P>
<P>
   The order gives utilities who claim they don't have sufficient
equipment a huge loophole.
</P>
<P>
   _ It refunds installation fees to customers when commitments are
not met. But the utilities are given a ``grace period'' that can
extend as long as 11 days after the order is placed, even when
there is no capacity problem.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; _ It grants refunds to customers who cannot get broken phones
fixed fast enough. The refunds, though, only begin three days after
the phone has broken. The daily credit, 37.5 cents for most
residential customers, is barely enough to cover one pay-phone
call.
</P>
<P>
   Although consumer advocates believe the rules fall short of what
Californians deserve, they say they will take any improvements they
can get, especially since they are the first contemplated by the
PUC since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very rare to get sweeping decisions that do everything
you want,'' said Schmid. ``We can build on this.''
</P>
<P>
   The draft decision does strengthen a requirement that Pac Bell
answer 80 percent of all complaint calls within 20 seconds _ one of
California's few standards.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the phone company does not count calls that get busy
signals. The proposed order says such calls should fall under the
20-second rule.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Bell's Mueller said most of its system problems have
been fixed. ``I really feel we're where we need to be,'' he said.
The company is spending $800 million this year improving the
``local loop'' to increase calling capacity.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say there is no regulatory system, including the
proposed set of standards, to prevent backsliding in the future.
``The only thing that can prevent a recurrence is a commission
interested in exercising its authority,'' said Regina Costa, a
telecommunications analyst for the Utility Reform Network in San
Francisco, a nonprofit advocacy group. ``That's something this
commission is loath to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Complaints about Pacific Bell began rising shortly after the PUC
changed the way the company is compensated for the service it
provides for nearly 18 million access lines in California.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called New Regulatory Framework, adopted in 1989, ended
the practice of reimbursing the utility for its investments
dollar-for-dollar. Instead, the utility was given a big pot of
money and allowed to decide, pretty much on its own, how to spend
it.
</P>
<P>
   This new process was supposed to encourage Pacific Bell to
become more efficient, but it also allowed the company to pass
savings along to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   When the new rate-making system began, the phone company had
61,500 employees. By 1996, it had 42,500 workers. Currently, it has
53,000.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Bell's Mueller said California does not need new
standards. He downplays fears that service could deteriorate again.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were to stumble, someone will drive a Mack truck through
us,'' he said. ``No company could allow that to happen again.''

 BofA Forms S.F. Unit for Electronic Payments  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
BankAmerica Corp. has set up a group based in San Francisco to
develop the bank's electronic payments strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The North Carolina bank, which bought San Francisco's
BankAmerica in September and took its name, appointed Chris
Callero, a 27-year veteran of the old BofA, to head the unit.
</P>
<P>
   The new group will chart the bank's course as it rolls out
next-generation electronic payments technologies, such as the
presentation of bills to consumers by computer or interactive
television.
</P>
<P>
   Callero's organization is a planning group that will work with
the business units that will use the new technologies. Those
include commercial businesses, such as corporate cash management,
and consumer banking businesses, such as card services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job is to build the integrated strategy for the company``
in electronic commerce, Callero said.
</P>
<P>
   Callero said he's still hiring staff for the unit. ``We will be
small and mighty. There is not going to be a whole lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the world, banks are shifting from checks to electronic
payment systems to cut costs and keep customers. Both the old BofA
and NationsBank _ the two banks that combined to form the new BofA
_ have invested hundreds of millions in digital payments
technologies.

 How to Fix A PC After An Outage  &HT;       
 By David Einstein  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I was using my computer when the lights went out in San
Francisco last week. The power went out, came back on after a
second, then went out again. When power was finally restored, I got
back on the computer and found there were some problems that I'm
not sure I can fix.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some of the keys on the keyboard are sporadically not
responding.
</P>
<P>
   _ Four of the icons on the Windows desktop have changed to small
numbered Windows icons that don't show exactly what they do.
</P>
<P>
   _ When typing in Word, I see flashes of the red and green
underlines throughout the page.
</P>
<P>
   _ The scanning light in my scanner is on all the time. So I had
to unplug it.
</P>
<P>
   Do I need to get a repairman, or is this something I can fix
myself? I have a service agreement with Gateway.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; Answer: &LR;  OK, here's what you do. Open the computer case,
scoop out the innards and use it as a planter box. Just kidding.
Since you have the service agreement, I'd get on the phone to
Gateway. But if you want to have a go at it yourself, here are a
few things you can try.
</P>
<P>
   First, run the ScanDisk program, which you'll find in the System
Tools folder inside the Accessories folder in the Windows Programs
menu. ScanDisk will check your hard drive for errors, and fix
anything minor (assuming ScanDisk itself hasn't been damaged).
</P>
<P>
   After running ScanDisk, restart the PC. If you still have
problems (and you probably will), reinstall Windows, Word and any
other damaged applications. Also reinstall the driver for your
scanner. If, after doing all this, you've still got trouble, it
probably means the power surge frazzled something in the computer's
circuit system. And for that, you'll need a technician.
</P>
<P>
   Too Good to Be True
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you tell me if the Internet service provider AtBigger.net
has gone under? They offered lifetime service for $60, and I signed
up. But now all access numbers are busy constantly and their
customer service numbers have been disconnected. Also, is there
another ISP that offers lifetime service for even a little more
money?
</P>
<P>
   A: AtBigger.net is a classic example of the adage, if something
seems too good to be true, it probably is. The San Jose company
couldn't survive with its pricing scheme, even though it amassed
some 40,0000 customers. It was acquired in October by Brigadoon, a
Seattle-based ISP which also is having financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Brigadoon reported on its Web site
( &LR; www.brigadoon.com &LR; ) that all access to AtBigger.net had been shut
down. It said it is working to restore service, but didn't say how
long that might take. You can try phoning them at (206) 652-9365
(they're in Seattle), or by sending e-mail to  &LR; admin(AT &LR; 
 &LR; SIGN)brigadoon.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   As for other ISPs, I don't know of any in Northern California
that offer lifetime service. It certainly doesn't appear to be a
profitable way to run a business. However, many ISPs will give you
service for as little as $8 a month if you sign up for a year in
advance.
</P>
<P>
   Printing Problem
</P>
<P>
   Q: In printing a document in Microsoft Word, is there a way to
make the ``current page'' the default rather than ``All?''
Sometimes I want to print on both sides of the paper. But Word
won't let me pause while printing so I can reverse the paper and
thus do it in one operation.
</P>
<P>
   A: You can't change the default, but there is a way to work
around it. In the Print window, type in just the odd numbered pages
_ 1,3,5 etc. When the printing job is finished, turn the printed
pages around and print on the back using the even numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Tower or Desktop
</P>
<P>
   Q: What advantages does a tower PC have over a desktop model?
And which would you recommend?
</P>
<P>
   A: Full-sized towers generally have more room inside than
desktops for adding things like video and sound cards and extra
hard drives. But the trend is toward minitowers, which don't offer
any advantages. If you plan to add components, look for a big tower
such as the Hewlett-Packard Pavilion series, which is designed for
easy expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Operationally, there's no difference between a tower and a
desktop. It comes down to whether you want the computer on the desk
or on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; TIP OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  If your computer crashes, or you get a new one, you're going to
have to re-enter information that's necessary to log onto your ISP
and any other online accounts that you have, including banking and
customized Web pages. So do yourself a favor and write down all
your user IDs, passwords, log-on phone numbers and DNS numbers and
keep them somewhere safe.

HOUSE REPUBLICANS POSTPONE SHOWDOWN ON IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for inserts, rewriting throughout) (sw) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Furious and fractured, House Republicans on
Wednesday night postponed the impeachment vote against President
Clinton for perhaps a few days because of the bombing campaign
against Iraq, even as the odds against the President began to look
insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   As the lame duck 105th Congress returned to the Capitol for
evening party caucuses on impeachment, with one Republican after
another announcing his support, the House was left reeling at the
almost surreal clash of crises. The first wave of bombs fell in
Baghdad just minutes before the Republicans began their closed-door
strategy session on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   After more than three hours of raucous, angry and passionate
debate, the Republicans, despite expressing deep suspicions of
Clinton's motive for ordering the bombing, finally heeded the call
from their incoming speaker, Robert Livingston of Louisiana, that
the impeachment debate, which had been scheduled for Thursday, be
postponed.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston said, ``We're going to defer action tomorrow.'' Not
even bringing himself to mention the word impeachment, he said,
``We are reserving our right to move forward with the other
action.''
</P>
<P>
   He instructed members to stay in Washington on standby, for
debate to resume ``possibly Friday, possibly Saturday, but within
the near future.'' He said, ``The issue is important and will come
up in the next few days.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the presidential spokesman, said that the White
House would have no comment on the House decision to postpone the
impeachment vote. ``That is a matter for the Congress to decide,''
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   As the day wore on, at least nine more Republicans declared they
would vote to impeach Clinton, many of them the moderates whom
Clinton most desperately needed to bring to his side. Their
defection left any White House strategy to protect the president in
shambles.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said that even though it was still mathematically
possible, they could no longer see how the president could avoid
impeachment _ the indictment by the House that would be followed by
trial in the Senate _ unless military action somehow shifted the
mood of the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless this action has an unexpected effect, he's done,'' said
a Democrat close to the effort to spare Clinton impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   But several Republicans said that the bombing strikes had only
hardened the resolve in their party to impeach. ``If anything,
suspicions around the timing of the action in Iraq has solidified
support against the president,'' said Rep. Spencer Bachus, R-Ala.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, who are almost united against impeachment,
rallied behind the president. Some even called for impeachment to
be put off into the next Congress, when the Democrats will have
five more seats and Clinton might have more of a chance of avoiding
being only the second president impeached by the House. ``I don't
understand why this can't go over to the next Congress,'' said Rep.
Henry Waxman, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt, the House minority leader, said, ``There was
a unanimous feeling in our caucus that it should not come up as
long as our troops are in harm's way.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Republicans, from Sen. Trent Lott to Rep. Dick Armey,
suspicions ran angry and deep that Clinton had timed the military
action as a tactic to save his presidency. Rep. Roscoe Bartlett of
Maryland said of the Republican caucus, ``some people were
incredulous'' about the motivation for the bombing. ``Emotion ran
all the way from disgust to anger.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey, the House majority leader, said the fact that Republicans
had doubts about the legitimacy of the military action showed that
Clinton was losing his ability to lead. ``If the president refuses
to resign for the sake of the nation, I believe he should be
impeached and face Senate trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Both political parties went straight from their respective
meetings to the House floor for a briefing by the president's
entire national security team. The departing House speaker, Newt
Gingrich, worked with Cabinet officials to organize that session
while Livingston helped conduct the Republican caucus on
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Joe Lockhart, the press secretary, dismissed
any suggestion that Clinton was using his powers as commander in
chief to avoid becoming the first president to be impeached since
Andrew Johnson 130 years ago. ``The president of the United States
makes national security decisions based on the best interest of the
United States,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the extraordinary day, Republicans tried to assure
the nation of the stability of foreign policy even as one after
another they announced their decisions to vote for the president's
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am comforted by the fact that the president is in contact
with the bipartisan leadership,'' said Rep. Sherwood Boehlert,
R-N.Y.,, as he announced that he had decided to vote for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been by far the most difficult, even tormenting
decision I have had to make in my 16 years in Congress,'' Boehlert
said speaking softly before television cameras. ``I simply have not
found the means to rationalize away the fact that our president
lied under oath, that he has tried repeatedly to game the judicial
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans spoke in similar uncompromising terms. ``I get
the impression that the president considers himself above the
law,'' said Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., who had once said he would
oppose impeachment, but now said he would support it on the House
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Rep. Rick Lazio of New York on Wednesday night
contrasted the president's statements on Monica Lewinsky with the
sacrifice American soldiers make in battle, saying, ``It should not
be difficult now to tell the truth or vote according to the
dictates of conscience even if it means the end of one's career.''
</P>
<P>
   The others who came out against Clinton made up a roster of
Republicans he had hoped to sway, including Reps. Brian Bilbray of
California, Jim Leach of Iowa and Bob Ney of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Before the impeachment debate became interwoven with the Iraq
actions, the battle lines seemed to be forming for how the two
parties were going to fight on after the House vote on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The White House did get one message of support on Wednesday from
Republicans. Rep. Jay Kim of California, who pleaded guilty to
accepting illegal donations in 1997, said he was leaning toward
opposing impeachment. A Senate trial ``is going to be an
international embarrassment,'' Kim told the Inland Valley Daily
Bulletin in California.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, who canceled a trip to New Hampshire to
stay in Washington, began sounding what is expected to be the White
House theme in the weeks ahead _ that Republicans were embarked on
a partisan, divisive course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe on Capitol Hill there is still time for Democrats
and Republicans to come together and embrace a bipartisan
compromise to seek a resolution that is both quick and fair and try
to turn away from the bitter partisanship that we have seen so
far,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Michael Pappas, R-N.J., one of the lame-duck members of
Congress, who put his support behind impeachment on Wednesday by
contrast renewed the call for Clinton to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``His actions were the cause that brought us to this point,'' he
said. ``He can resign and keep us from having to move forward to go
to the time and expense and diversion this would cause the Congress
or the Senate.''

SUNBEAM LOST $587 MILLION IN FIRST 9 MONTHS THIS YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bedeviled Sunbeam Corp. turned in yet another poor financial
performance Wednesday, reporting a $587 million loss for the first
nine months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   While the company said the final quarter should show some
improvement, it also indicated the hemorrhaging has not stopped.
</P>
<P>
   After restating its financial results in October to adjusted
figures for six quarters through the first three months of this
year, Sunbeam Wednesday reported results for the second and third
quarters, which reflected steep revenue drops and losses.
</P>
<P>
   The maker of Sunbeam and Oster brand blenders and toasters lost
$344.1 million, or $3.41 a share in the second quarter, including
$213 million in primarily one-time charges. Revenue totaled $578.5
million, compared with $271.4 million in the prior year. But
excluding revenue gains largely from three recently acquired
companies, sales declined 23 percent to $202.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   For the third quarter, the company lost $188.9 million, or $1.88
a share, including $89 million in primarily one-time charges. That
compared with earnings of $24.8 million, or 28 cents a share a year
earlier. Revenue totaled $496 million, compared with $286.8 million
a year earlier. But excluding revenue gains largely from the three
acquired companies, sales declined 42 percent to $162.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The losses in those periods were far worse than the already
negatively revised estimate of analysts polled by First Call. The
company had been expected to lose 30 cents a share in the second
quarter and 12 cents a share in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the performance, Sunbeam shares rose 25 cents, or 4.4
percent, Wednesday to $5.9275.
</P>
<P>
   Investor reaction appeared to indicate some confidence that the
company's new management had adequately assessed its problems _ a
retail pipeline jammed with too much product, confusion about the
businesses' financial position and headline-grabbing management
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Sunbeam has been in crisis since Albert Dunlap, its
once-celebrated chief executive, delivered several quarters of
unexpected earnings disappointments last year and was ousted in
June.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the favorable market reaction, analysts expressed
caution about the outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are by no means out of the woods yet,'' said William
Steele, an analyst who follows Sunbeam for Buckingham Research
Group.
</P>
<P>
   For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Sunbeam's lost $587.1
million, or $6.12 a share, compared with earnings of $28.8 million,
or $0.33 a share in the the previous year. The 1998 period includes
$339 million in various charges related, in large part, to excess
inventory, early debt payment and the issuance of warrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``These losses provide a clear indication of the measures
necessary to stabilize Sunbeam's businesses and get the company
back on track,'' said Jerry Levin, president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, ``the losses are much larger than expected,'' said
Nicholas Heymann, an analyst who follows the company for Prudential
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   For the nine months, Sunbeam's revenue totaled $1.3 billion,
compared with $810.7 million in the prior year. Excluding the
revenue gains this year largely from the three companies Sunbeam
acquired in the spring, revenue declined 24 percent to $594
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is the company is beginning to manage cash flow
and used substantially less than might be thought likely in the
third quarter,'' Heymann said.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said it had worked down $80 million in excess
inventory at the retail level and had begun to pare its own surplus
of products, though management did not disclose the amount of
unsold grills and electric blankets that were still in warehouses.

   Britain: Prosecutors See No Bias in Pinochet Case
</P>
<P>
   LONDON _ Prosecutors told the House of Lords that its decision
to let Gen. Augusto Pinochet be arrested in England and held on a
Spanish extradition petition was not tainted by bias. The former
Chilean dictator's lawyers want the lords to set aside the ruling
because of disclosures that the law lord who cast the decisive
vote, Lord Hoffmann, was associated with Amnesty International. A
decision on the appeal is expected on Thursday.

K-TEL STOCK SURGES ON FINANCE NEWS BEFORE GIVING BACK MOST OF GAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Shares of K-Tel International Inc. continued
their wild performance, surging 43 percent after the company
announced a plan to raise up to $20 million, then giving up most of
the gain as skepticism replaced bullishness.
</P>
<P>
   K-Tel stock finished Wednesday up $1.1875 to $13.50 a share, a
9.6 percent gain. More than 3.1 million shares changed hands during
the session, and the issue hit $17.625 -- three times its 1998 low
of $5.1875 and half its 1998 high of $33.9375, reached after it
launched its ktel.com Web site in May.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of K-Tel, best known for hawking music compilations on
late-night television, have jumped on several occasions this year
due to investor frenzy over Internet stocks, then fallen back due
to concerns over the speculative fever and fundamental problems at
the suburban Calabasas-based company.
</P>
<P>
   K-Tel's gain was overshadowed Wednesday by the surge in online
bookseller Amazon.com Inc., which soared $46.25 to $289 after a
CIBC Oppenheimer analyst predicted the stock will reach $400 in 12
months. Shares have already risen eight times above their lowest
level this year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have cautioned that the speculative frenzy among
Internet stocks will lead to overvaluation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The frenetic buying of Internet stocks is going to make the
17th-century tulip buyers look like value investors by
comparison,'' said Rick Berry of J.P. Turner &AMP; Co. ``I think a lot
of K-Tel's strength is the meteoric rise of Amazon, moving on its
coattails.''
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's developments, K-Tel said its board has approved a
plan to issue stock to raise $15 million to $20 million in equity
to maintain its Nasdaq listing. The exchange told K-Tel last month
that it faced delisting because it didn't meet a requirement of $4
million in tangible assets.
</P>
<P>
   K-Tel, which had tangible assets of $450,000 at the end of
September, said it had received $2.88 million of additional equity
during the current quarter from employee stock options being
exercised. On Tuesday, the board also granted Lawrence Kives, who
became president in October, an option to buy 200,000 shares of
common stock at $11.1875 per share.
</P>
<P>
   Kives said he will exercise the option in its entirety by Dec.
31, which should push tangible assets over the $4 million level.
The board also authorized management to raise $15 million to $20
million of additional equity in order to meet long-term capital
requirements and assure continued listing on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   K-Tel also said it will lose $1 million in the current quarter,
mostly due to investments in electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   During the session, two law firms announced separately they have
filed class-action suits against K-Tel alleging securities fraud by
artificially inflating the price of shares in October and November.
</P>
<P>
   ``When everything's all said and done, K-Tel may be a player,
but the bottom line is that no one really knows,'' Berry said.
``The margins in e-commerce are going to be razor-thin because if
you have something popular, it's only going to be a matter of time
before someone comes along and takes it away. The true beneficiary
will be the consumer.''

 WILLIAM GADDIS, 75, INNOVATIVE AUTHOR OF COMPLEX, DEMANDING
NOVELS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   William Gaddis, author of ``The Recognitions'' and ``JR,'' and a
novelist of immense range, complexity and satiric humor, died
Wednesday at his home in East Hampton, N.Y. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was prostate cancer, said his daughter, Sarah Meares
Gaddis.
</P>
<P>
   Gaddis was one of the most innovative and demanding of writers.
His four published novels stand tall and totemic in the field of
modernist literature. For ``The Recognitions,'' his first novel, in
1955, he was compared to James Joyce. With other books, critics
drew parallels with Malcolm Lowry and Herman Melville. Aspects of
all three and others figured in his work, but most of all he was,
in Cynthia Ozick's words, ``an American original.''
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing Gaddis' 1985 novel, ``Carpenter's Gothic,'' in The New
York Times Book Review, Ms. Ozick looked back on ``The
Recognitions'' as ``the most overlooked important work of the last
several literary generations.'' It was, she said, ``a vast fiction
about fabrication and forgery, about the thousand faces of the
counterfeit, and therefore, ineluctably, about art and religion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Carpenter's Gothic,'' Ms. Ozick said, was an ``unholy
landscape of a novel _ an extra turret added on to the ample,
ingenious, audacious Gothic mansion William Gaddis has slowly been
building in American letters.'' In her judgment the book marked a
turning point in his career; admirers hoped that it would bring him
a wider audience.
</P>
<P>
   Despite rapturous reviews and a covey of awards (including two
National Book Awards and a MacArthur ``genius'' grant), he was not
destined to have a popular readership. He was often considered one
of the least read of important American writers. But his books have
become contemporary classics.
</P>
<P>
   As his reputation grew, he was surrounded by academics seeking
symbols and offering deep analyses of his work. He maintained his
equilibrium, saying, ``What can I do if people insist I'm cleverer
than I think I am?''
</P>
<P>
   Observing Gaddis at a writers conference in the Soviet Union in
1985, Louis Auchincloss said that he was ``reserved and quiet,
impeccably clad, with the patient composure of a man of the world
and the piercing eye of a wit,'' and that he spoke ``in measured
tones of the small sales that the serious novelist might expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaddis was born in Manhattan on Dec. 29, 1922, grew up in
Massapequa, N.Y., and went to boarding school in Connecticut and
Farmingdale High School on Long Island. He studied English
literature at Harvard University, and wrote stories, poems, essays
and reviews for the Harvard Lampoon. In his senior year, he was
asked to resign from the college after he and a friend were
involved in an altercation with the police.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, he worked as a fact checker at The New Yorker, and
spent his free time in Greenwich Village with Allen Ginsberg, Jack
Kerouac and other writers of the Beat Generation. Leaving New York,
he traveled through Mexico and Central America, joining insurgents
in Costa Rica during a brief civil war. Subsequently he went to
Spain and Africa, gathering experience and material while working
on ``The Recognitions.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued work on the novel through the early 1950s.
Published in 1955, it weighed in at a hefty 956 pages. It received
generally unappreciative reviews. In a brief one in The New York
Times Book Review, Granville Hicks said that the author had
``ostentatiously aimed at writing a masterpiece,'' but had written
a book that was ``no more than very talented or highly ingenious
or, on another level, rather amusing.'' Gaddis said the book's
reception was ``a sobering experience.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 20 years before he published another novel, but during
the interval, ``The Recognitions'' was reprinted in a paperback
edition and was published abroad, and it began building an
underground reputation for the author. To continue his fiction,
Gaddis supported himself by teaching and writing nonfiction on
assignment. For four years, he worked in public relations for the
Pfizer pharmaceutical company. In 1963 he won a National Arts and
Letters grant and, four years later, another from the National
Endowment for the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, ``The Recognitions'' was reissued in a mass market
paperback. Tony Tanner took that occasion, in a review in The New
York Times Book Review, to extol Gaddis, ranking him alongside
Thomas Pynchon as an experimentalist: ``In its scope, its
witty-serious use of erudition, its endless exploitation of the
resources available to a modern text, its brilliant use of
language, and, not least, its marvelous humor and range of tone,''
the book seemed to him ``one of most important American novels
written since the last war.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time ``JR'' was published the following year, Gaddis had
achieved the recognition that had been denied him upon publication
of his first novel. In The New York Times Book Review, George Stade
characterized the theme of ``The Recognitions'' as ``the multiple
and paradoxical relations between recognition and forgery,'' and
said the book had raised the question whether ``all human products
and activities are each no more than items in a series of copies
for which there is no original.''
</P>
<P>
   The reviewer continued that ``as much, and more'' could be said
about ``JR,'' and concluded that ``no recent novel I know of with
anything like the fullness or accuracy of `Jr' is at once so
inventive and subtle in the structure of relations among its
parts.''
</P>
<P>
   The title character of ``JR'' is an 11-year-old who becomes a
wizard of Wall Street. In a Paris Review interview, Gaddis
explained why the character was so young. ``He is in this
prepubescent age where he is amoral'' and ``dealing with people who
are immoral, unscrupulous,'' he said, ``whereas his good cheer and
greed he considers perfectly normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Praised by William H. Gass and other writers, ``JR'' won the
National Book Award. ``Carpenter's Gothic'' followed in 1985. At
262 pages, it was Gaddis' shortest work. At the time of the book's
publication, the author said in an interview that there was no
underlying scheme to his novels. ``There is an obligation not to
bore or be bored yourself in doing your work,'' Gaddis said. ``If a
writer is bored, the reader will be too.'' For ``A Frolic of His
Own'' in 1994, a book about plagiarism and intellectual property,
he won his second National Book Award.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his daughter, a novelist who lives in Asheville,
N.C., and Sag Harbor, N.Y., he is survived by a son, Matthew Hough
Gaddis, a filmmaker in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In ``JR,'' the writer Jack Gibbs is trying to finish a book
titled ``Agape Agape.'' Before his death, Gaddis finished his fifth
novel, also titled ``Agape Agape.'' It is, said his son, an
extension of that original idea in ``JR,'' a novel about ``the
secret history of the player piano.'' The player piano was an early
obsession of the author, who considered it to be an example of a
``a nonparticipatory art form.'' In other words, the new Gaddis
will be about the destructive elements of mechanization and the
arts.

 WASHINGTON: he can.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buying time might be the president's best hope, if only a very
slim one. Pro-impeachment sentiment has reached a peak this week,
but it could conceivably dissipate if the roll-call is
significantly postponed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is not the first president since the end of World War II
to have his foreign policy motives questioned. Ronald Reagan was
accused by a few members of Congress and a few editorial writers of
staging the invasion of Grenada to mute criticism of his failure to
protect marines who were killed in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   But not since Harry Truman and the Korean War has a president
been subjected to quite the same level of questioning of motive
that Clinton was subjected to Wednesday. The fact that Lott
released his statement moments before the attack increased the
sense that he was undercutting the president.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans did, in fact, rally to the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Kolbe of Arizona was in the midst of a press conference
in Tucson lambasting Clinton for ``impeachable offenses'' when
handed a note about the air raids, and he changed course
immediately, voicing support for the attack.
</P>
<P>
   But many others, while not willing to speak as bluntly or as
publicly as Solomon and Lott, gave voice privately to deep
suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton tried his best to allay them, quoting American military
planners as saying that waiting would give Saddam time to conceal
and protect elements of his suspected nuclear and chemical
arsenals. But he did not address a report in Wednesday's Washington
Post that suggested that the administration had orchestrated the
timing and content of the report by Richard Butler, the chief
United Nations inspector, that preceded the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, British Prime Minister Tony Blair proved himself a
friend in need. By agreeing to join in the attacks, and by
defending his decision in an eloquent statement carried on
international television, Blair gave Clinton political cover
against his partisan critics. That was especially welcome in view
of the opposition voiced by China, Russia and France.
</P>
<P>
   The president did all he could to make Wednesday night's
television appearance look like business as usual _ a calm, serious
report about a threat to the national interest, with only a quick,
glancing reference to his own troubles. But he delivered it in a
setting he has recently avoided, the Oval Office, near which many
of his fateful meetings with Monica S. Lewinsky took place.

IRAQI ATTACK FAILS TO UNITE LAWMAKERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For most of the year Monica Lewinsky and Saddam
Hussein have competed for Americans' attention.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday the two dramas collided when President Clinton
approved U.S. airstrikes against Iraq just a day before the House
was to open debate on impeaching the commander in chief.
</P>
<P>
   The events did little to unite members of both parties _ as
military actions traditionally do _ but rather inflamed poisonous
partisanship that has infected the nation's capital during the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   And while the military action forced congressional Republicans
to delay the impeachment vote, few believe it is likely to affect
the outcome, which appears to be tilting against the president.
</P>
<P>
   However, some observers said the attack will give the president
a few precious days to try and halt the momentum growing against
him.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, it allows Clinton to bolster his image at a time
when Republicans are harshly condemning his ethics and questioning
his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the airstrikes spread among House members as they were
walking into their respective party meetings to map out strategy
for the impeachment debate.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans were unable to contain their anger, voicing
suspicions that the attack was politically timed to distract the
nation from the president's domestic woes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a liar, and he can't be trusted,'' shouted Rep. Dana
Rohrbacher, R-Calif., as he walked into a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   A number said it only reinforced their belief that the president
should be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suspicions some people have about the president's motives
in this attack is a powerful argument for impeachment,'' said House
Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas. ``After months of lies the
president has given millions of people around the world reason to
doubt that he has sent Americans into battle for the right
reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, said that ``today's events have
reinforced the need for President Clinton to resign or be removed
from office.''
</P>
<P>
   In a highly unusual move, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss, issued a press release just moments before the bombing
saying he opposed the military action.
</P>
<P>
   Others rushed to the television cameras to condemn the
president's motives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obvious that he is doing it for political reasons, and I
and others are outraged,'' Rep. Gerald Solomon, an outspoken
Republican from New York, told Cable News Network.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks triggered an immediate backlash.
</P>
<P>
   Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, was hissed by many of his
colleagues when he interrupted a briefing by Defense Department
officials to ask if there was any reason the impeachment hearing
couldn't continue during the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats accused their colleagues of breaking with tradition by
engaging in partisan attacks on the president when troops were
engaged in military action abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ken Bentsen, D-Texas, called Republican criticism ``rather
crass'' and a ``cheap shot.'' He noted that members of Congress
still supported President Reagan when he took military action
during the Iran-Contra scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't stop the world while all this is going on,'' Bentsen
said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Chet Edwards, D-Texas, also called Republicans
``irresponsible'' for questioning the military action, saying such
divisiveness would only embolden Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Gene Green, D-Texas, said that Saddam may have been
trying to take advantage of perceived U.S. weakness because of the
impeachment fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't sit on our hands because we are going through this
constitutional crisis,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most political observers said there is little question that the
military strike will enhance the embattled president's standing
with the voters in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drop a bomb and your ratings go up 10 points,'' said Larry
Sabato, political science professor at the University of Virginia,
who believes that the president factored in political
considerations in deciding to launch the attack the day before the
impeachment debate.
</P>
<P>
   He noted this is the second time the president has taken
military action when he was in trouble. In August, Clinton sent
cruise missiles into Afghanistan and the Sudan days after he
admitted to an improper relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the events were likened to the movie ``Wag the
Dog,'' where a president embroiled in a sex scandal concocts a fake
war to distract the voters.
</P>
<P>
   University of Pennsylvania political science professor Mark
Rozell said that Republicans are unlikely to back away from
impeachment even if the president gets a short-term popularity
boost.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Clinton currently enjoys high approval ratings but
that has has not stopped GOP lawmakers from pursuing impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the bottom line is the Republicans will do what they
have planned on doing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are aware of the public relations problem of pushing
the impeachment vote into Christmas week, when Americans might view
such action as unseemly.
</P>
<P>
   They are also alarmed at the prospect that prolonged military
action could force the impeachment debate into next year. That
could jeopardize any impeachment effort because the Republicans
will lose five seats from their majority.

HONORING IMMIGRANTS, AND HOW THEY LIVED  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ELISABETH BUMILLER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ruth Abram's life is the story of how personal hurts
grew into a museum that no one ever imagined.
</P>
<P>
   It started on a bus in Atlanta in the early 1950s, when the
Abram family maid, Rosa May Maddox, found a seat for young Ruth in
the front, then moved to the back. In 1958, when Ruth was 13, she
was told at her private Atlanta school that she could not join the
cotillion because she was Jewish. Soon after, when the Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. came to her home _ her father is Morris
Abram, the legendary civil rights lawyer _ her parents said it was
best not to tell her friends.
</P>
<P>
   Much later, when Ms. Abram found an Orthodox synagogue in
Riverdale for the education of her children, the rabbi informed her
that she was not Jewish at all. Why? Because Ms. Abram's mother, a
one-time Methodist, had converted to Judaism only after Ms. Abram's
birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sort of felt like I was being spun out into the universe,
with no anchor,'' Ms. Abram said.
</P>
<P>
   So it is not a complete surprise that Ms. Abram, 53, is the
founder and president of the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, an
institution that celebrates immigrants _ and which Ms. Abram sees
as ``promoting the kind of tolerance that wouldn't permit the
things I experienced.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the decade-old museum _ housed in a five-story
Orchard Street apartment building that from 1863 to 1935 was home
to about 10,000 people from 25 countries _ became a ``national
historic area'' and part of the National Park Service, meaning it
can now apply for federal funds. The month before, the tenement
building was designated a site of the National Trust for Historic
Preservation. So far, it is the only Trust site in America that was
not the home of someone rich or famous. (New York has two other
Trust sites: Kykuit, the Rockefeller estate, and Lyndhurst, the
home of Jay Gould, the financier and swindler.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abram, needless to say, is in a very good mood. There is the
prospect of more money, and visitors. There is also the realization
that she is running the only tenement museum in the country, and
helping to change the idea of what is important to preserve in
America. Her goal, someday, is to have the museum be a stop for
tourists after they see Ellis Island. ``I always say there's this
great question,'' she said. ```What happened afterward?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abram talked last week in the drafty kitchen of the tenement
house, where she was gracious and appropriate. She came alive,
though, during a one-hour tour of the museum _ she still gives one
a week _ for a group of a dozen or so. (Whose families came, they
told her when she asked, from England, China, Peru, Bangladesh,
Russia, Ireland, Sweden and Poland.) Ms. Abram started in the
building's entrance hall, in total darkness and under peeling
paint, just as it looked in 1863. ``Welcome home!'' she said.
``Come with me.''
</P>
<P>
   There followed a tour of the museum's permanent exhibit, opened
last week, of the apartment of the Rogarshevskys, a family of
Orthodox Jewish immigrants from Lithuania, who lived in three rooms
re-created to look as they did on July 12, 1918, after Abraham
Rogarshevsky, a 45-year-old garment presser, died of tuberculosis.
There was medicine on the table by his bed, and bagels and bialys
brought by friends. Ms. Abram calls the Rogarshevskys and their
neighbors ``our urban pioneers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rogarshevsky apartment is the fourth of 20 in the building
to be restored. The most recent in time is that of Adolpho and
Rosaria Baldizzi, Catholic immigrants from Sicily, who lost their
jobs during the Depression and were evicted in 1935. Ms. Abram told
her tour that the Baldizzi apartment, re-created to look as it did
on the day they were thrown out, was filled with authentic
belongings taken from the apartment by the Baldizzis' daughter,
Josephine, who lived there as a child and died a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the apartment opened to the public, Ms. Abram said,
Josephine came to see it. ``And she got right here, and she burst
into tears,'' Ms. Abram said. Josephine Baldizzi requested only one
change: That she be allowed to iron and neatly pack the clothes
displayed in the suitcases on the apartment floor. ``My mamma was
fastidious!'' Josephine told Ms. Abram. ``Even for eviction, she
never would have thrown things together in the haphazard way you
packed!''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abram lives on the Upper West Side, is married to Herbert
Teitelbaum, a partner at Robinson Silverman, has two grown
children, was a social worker and a women's rights organizer,
graduated from Sarah Lawrence College, has a master's degree in
American history from New York University and apologized for being
boring in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Her most vivid memory of Dr. King? ``What I remember more than
anything is going to the Abyssinian Baptist Church to hear him
preach, and what he was saying to the congregation was `support
your children.' In other words, your children will be doing things
you don't want, but there is a higher law. And it had an incredible
effect on me. Because of all the places to try to change people's
minds, to do that in your own community is harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abram's forbears were from Romania, Prussia, Ireland and
Scotland. Despite her pedigree, she says her museum has made her
feel as if she has ``come home'' __ to a place where Americans can
``meet our families before they became acceptable.''

AIRPORT THEFT RING IS BROKEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By VIVIAN S. TOY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Law enforcement officials Wednesday shut down a major
theft ring that stole millions of dollars in merchandise from
warehouses around Kennedy International Airport, moving against a
crime that officials say saddles customers with incalculable hidden
costs on many everyday purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Officials recovered more than $5 million in stolen items that
ranged from specialized items like airplane data recorders and
designer Italian suits to more common purchases like Disney wall
clocks, bottles of aspirin and anti-smoking kits.
</P>
<P>
   They said, however, that the $5 million in goods was probably
only a small percentage of the total losses from cargo theft in and
around the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The two-year investigation involved city, state and federal
officials and resulted in the indictment of 56 people, including
warehouse owners, teamster shop stewards and owners of stores
across the city that sold the stolen goods.
</P>
<P>
   As the announcement was being made, as many as 300 law
enforcement officials were rounding up the suspects, 43 of whom
were in custody by last night.
</P>
<P>
   The Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, said that
``virtually everything and anything that moves through J.F.K.'' was
included in the ring's inventory. He said breaking up the ring was
crucial for ``protecting one of New York's most valuable economic
resources, the airport, but also the consuming public.''
</P>
<P>
   The airport's $100-billion-a-year air cargo industry, which has
made it the fourth busiest cargo airport in the world, has long
been a target of theft and corruption operations that for years had
been controlled by organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that at least two of the people arrested
Wednesday had ties to the Lucchese and Gambino crime families, but
added that organized crime no longer had exclusive rights to air
cargo theft, as most of those arrested were warehouse workers or
otherwise legitimate business owners.
</P>
<P>
   Robert M. Caron, a detective with the police of the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey, said that cargo theft had
become so routine at airports across the country that many
companies regularly shipped far more items than a retailer ordered
because they expected a certain amount to be stolen. He said that
the computer industry in particular had become a very popular
target.
</P>
<P>
   The record of recovered stolen goods read like an exhaustive
holiday shopping list. There were hundreds of name-brand laptop
computers, 11,000 Remington electric shavers valued at $1.8
million, boxes of Kodak cameras and 10,000 rolls of Kodak film;
crates of Hugo Boss and Estee Lauder perfume, racks of designer
suits, loads of Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren shirts and sweaters,
cases of Versace sunglasses and $242,000 worth of cigars.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they first learned of the ring in the summer of
1996 when BAX Global, a shipping concern with a warehouse at
Kennedy Airport, discovered two employees stealing laptop
computers. The company assisted in the investigation. &QL; 
 &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS &QC;  &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Officials said that information from the workers at BAX led them
to Lewis Luxenberg, 54, who apparently brokered the sale of
millions of dollars in stolen goods from his home in Sheepshead
Bay, Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that workers and owners would contact Luxenberg
whenever they stole items that were being shipped through their
warehouses and that Luxembourg in turn would find shop owners in
Manhattan, Brooklyn and Staten Island who were willing to sell the
items.
</P>
<P>
   The two people indicted in the ring who officials said were
connected to organized crime are Louis Tranese, whom the district
attorney's office Wednesday called an associate of the Lucchese
crime family known as Old Man Louie, and Frank Daviano, who the
officials said was connected to the Gambino crime family and is
known as Frankie Suits. Tranese was accused of supplying Luxenberg
with the stolen goods, while Daviano was charged with selling
stolen items on the black market.

DEAL CLOSER TO ESTABLISH SCORES OF CHARTER SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gov. George E. Pataki and legislative leaders in Albany moved
closer Wednesday to a compromise on an ambitious plan to establish
scores of charter schools across the state with limited government
and union regulation, officials close to the negotiations said
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative arrangement _ if it goes to the Legislature and is
approved _ would make New York the 33rd state with legislation
permitting some form of charter schools, taxpayer-financed public
schools run by parents, teachers and community groups.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of establishing charter schools has been a favorite of
Pataki's but has faced opposition from local school boards, which
see the schools as a threat to their authority, and from the
teachers' unions. The powerful United Federation of Teachers, in
particular, has been fearful that the charter schools would not be
unionized.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those concerns appear to have been addressed by
negotiators Wednesday, who were talking about retaining the union
in larger charter schools and granting some salary and pension
enhancements to teachers, officials close to the negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
   Those negotiations are part of talks between the governor and
legislative leaders over several unresolved matters, including a
pay increase for elected state officials, an overhaul of the way
budgets are approved and legislation that could help farmers obtain
higher prices for milk.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Pataki and Sheldon Silver, the Assembly Speaker, denied
that negotiators had reached even a tentative agreement and refused
to discuss the talks. These kinds of deals, with their many
components, have in the past fallen apart over minor disagreements.
</P>
<P>
   If one side balks at a section in the charter school proposal,
for example, that could hold up voting on the entire package. But
in a sign that both sides were moving closer to an agreement,
lawmakers were called back to Albany for meetings on Thursday, and
Pataki told reporters, ``There's gray smoke _ actually it's gray
tilting toward white.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials close to the negotiations said that as part of the
emerging compromise, the governor had agreed to give the teachers
improvements in their pensions, as well as salary supplements that
he had vetoed before in an effort to pressure the union to accept
an agreement on charter schools. Officials would not immediately
disclose the cost of those enhancements.
</P>
<P>
   The union was also able to retain control of charter schools
with more than 250 students, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which has been in secret negotiations for days, would
cut out Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the City University of New
York; in the governor's version of the bill the university had been
among the agencies authorized to grant charters to new schools,
officials said. It also appeared to bar the New York City Schools
Chancellor, Rudy Crew, who had strongly attacked the legislation in
the last days of negotiations, from starting any charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure to close a deal quickly has been increased by the
Monday deadline for Pataki to sign or veto a 38 percent pay raise
for legislators. Pataki has implied that he would veto the raise,
the first in 10 years, if he did not get some of his agenda in
return.
</P>
<P>
   The State Senate passed a charter bill on Dec. 2, as part of a
bigger package of legislation, but the Assembly refused to go
along.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no tentative deal; there isn't a deal,'' said Zenia
Mucha, a spokeswoman for Pataki. ``I'm not going to tell you
details of anything that has been discussed.''
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Lynch, spokeswoman for Silver, said the legislators had
been recalled to Albany because ``we're optimistic, and given the
holiday period it's the last possible opportunity to put something
together before the holiday period.''
</P>
<P>
   The emerging compromise, officials said, would allow an
unlimited number of existing public schools to convert to charter
schools, and 100, maybe fewer, charter schools to start from
scratch. Typically, charter schools are given a five-year operating
charter and independence from local school districts in exchange
for meeting certain standards.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki had advocated giving oversight of charter schools to a
newly created Commission on Charter Schools, with a majority of
members appointed by the governor, drawing strong protests from
school officials who asserted that oversight should remain within
the public education system. It appeared Wednesday that the State
Board of Regents, which now regulates both public and private
schools, would get some if not all of the oversight power.
</P>
<P>
   Local school districts, officials said, would be allowed to
issue charters for converting public schools, and those schools
would remain in the union and would have to meet all state testing
requirements and standards.
</P>
<P>
   Schools started from scratch, however, would be granted their
charters by the State Board of Regents or the State University of
New York, officials said. It appeared that CUNY, local school
boards, the Chancellor of the New York City school system and
Giuliani _ who had all been included in the governor's plan _ had
been cut out.
</P>
<P>
   Schools with more than 250 students would have automatic union
representation, officials said, while those with fewer than 250
students would have to vote for collective bargaining. A major
sticking point, officials said, continued to be where the funds for
charter schools would come from. Local school boards have bitterly
opposed the governor's proposal that they should be required to
finance charter schools.

 MEMORIES OF JUDICIARY COMMITTEES PAST  
 DESPERATELY SEEKING THE FISTS OF ALI  
 STORY WITH PICTURES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

<P>
   It may sound like an unusual variation on the old
where-were-you-when question, but for those who worked in the
administration of Richard Nixon, it is not. What do you remember
about July 1974, the last time the House Judiciary Committee voted
on articles of impeachment?
</P>
<P>
   Diane Sawyer _ then a White House aide, now a correspondent for
ABC News _ said through a spokeswoman that she ``would love to
talk, but not in the middle of the storm.'' Charles Colson _ now a
syndicated radio personality _ recalled his testimony before the
Judiciary Committee as he called for President Clinton's
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   As for memories of the moment when the House Judiciary Committee
voted the first of three articles of impeachment against Nixon, ``I
was having a white wine spritzer,'' said Frank Gannon, a special
assistant to the president. Nixon and his closest aides were in
California, he said, and he was in Washington, having a drink with
his landlady, Kay Halle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a combination of suspended animation and devastating
action because there was very little happening for those of us in
Washington,'' he said. ``Suspended animation, but with the feeling
that these enormous tides were surging under you.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali's Bronze Fists Have Disappeared
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it floated away like a butterfly. Its disappearance is
stinging like a bee.
</P>
<P>
   A 14-pound bronze casting of Muhammad Ali's fists disappeared
from a foundry in Beacon, N.Y., that did the casting for the Korean
War memorial in Washington and for several sculptures by the artist
Roy Lichtenstein. Reproductions of the fists were to have been sold
through catalogs and galleries for $4,195.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the foundry, Peter Homestead, told The Associated
Press that he had not given up hope that the fists had merely been
misplaced, not stolen. Cast in June, they were not reported missing
until last week.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Walley, president of Virtual Presence Recreations, which
ordered the fists cast, also voiced a hope that they would turn up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not support the theory of this being some kind of inside
job,'' he said. He added that the foundry was supposed to make 100
copies and that 30 had been finished.
</P>
<P>
   Caricature Tale
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This story started in 1991, when the Broadway
producer Stewart Lane took his daughter, Eliana, to Sardi's for
dinner for her sixth birthday. The watercolors on the walls above
the banquettes captured her attention. Row after row of famous
faces. Actors. Mayors. Governors. And lots of prominent teeth, some
real, some removable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you up there?'' she asked Lane, who is an owner and a
manager of the Palace Theater.
</P>
<P>
   He decided to wing it. ``I looked around and I saw the one of
David Merrick, and because I have a mustache and dark hair, I said,
`That's me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe she believed him, maybe she did not.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Lane has produced ``The Will Rogers Follies,'' which
won a Tony Award for best musical.
</P>
<P>
   He has set up a Web site with an address, www.mrbroadway.com,
that is anything but modest.
</P>
<P>
   And recently, Lane's picture was hung at Sardi's, and Eliana had
another birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Lane pointed proudly to himself, but Eliana was not buying. She
announced that she liked the Merrick portrait better. ``She said he
had darker hair, and more of it,'' Lane said.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not all. The other day Lane went to Sardi's for
lunch. One of the restaurant's owners, Max Klimavicius, switched
the pictures before he arrived, putting the one of Lane under that
of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. The one of Merrick went on the opposite
wall.
</P>
<P>
   Lane looked flummoxed until another customer clued him in to the
practical joke.

ROCHESTER MAN IS SENTENCED TO DEATH FOR A 1996 SLAYING 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Rochester man convicted of committing a murder during a
kidnapping was sentenced to death Wednesday. It was second death
sentence handed down by a jury since capital punishment was
reinstated in New York in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The jury in State Supreme Court in Rochester sentenced the man,
Angel Mateo, 29, after rejecting defense arguments that his life
should be spared because of mitigating factors, including the
physical abuse he suffered as a child.
</P>
<P>
   Mateo, who faces another death penalty trial next year in the
killings of three people in an unrelated case, showed no emotion
when the sentence was announced. His lawyer said he would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence came six months after a Brooklyn jury sentenced a
former jail guard, Darrel Harris, to die for killing three people
in a robbery at an illegal social club. The death sentence in that
case was the first since the governor and the Legislature
reinstated capital punishment in New York nearly 12 years after the
state's highest court declared the state's previous death penalty
law unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Harris and Mateo face execution by lethal injection, as
prescribed under the death penalty statute. The last person
executed in the state, Eddie Lee Mays, was put to death in the
electric chair in 1963 for killing a woman while robbing a bar.
</P>
<P>
   The Mateo case was the first death penalty trial in Rochester
since 1952. In recent weeks, it became the focus of intense public
debate there, with opponents of the death penalty staging daily
protests outside the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Mateo was convicted on Dec. 3 of first-degree murder in the
killing of Juan Rodriguez-Matos. Mateo has also been charged with
capital murder in the slayings of three people on a street in
Rochester in 1995. He faces a trial in March for those killings.
</P>
<P>
   The jury sentenced Mateo to death Wednesday after an eight-day
sentencing trial in which his lawyer called Mateo's mother, an aunt
and cousins to the stand to ask the jury to spare his life.
</P>
<P>
   His relatives testified that his rampage had been fueled by a
lifetime of traumas, including childhood beatings, his father's
suicide in 1971 and the murders of his sister in 1993 and
half-sister in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The killing of Rodriguez-Matos was part of a violent rampage
that Mateo embarked on in November 1996, prosecutors said. He had
been on a frenzied search for his estranged girlfriend, who was
hiding at a shelter for battered women, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Mateo held two families hostage and slit a man's throat in an
effort to get them to help him find his girlfriend. The man whose
throat was slashed, Willie McWilliams, survived and testified
against Mateo.
</P>
<P>
   In between those attacks, Mateo kidnapped Rodriguez-Matos on the
street. When Rodriguez-Matos, who was mentally ill, could offer
little help on the woman's whereabouts, Mateo shot him in the head
and suffocated him with a plastic bag, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   The Monroe County District Attorney, Howard R. Relin, praised
the jury's decision Wednesday. ``The law says that certain people
warrant the death penalty,'' he said in a telephone interview after
the verdict. `` Mateo is certainly one of those people. The
callousness and viciousness of the murder is what separates him
from other defendants.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Everywhere Bill Parcells has been in the National Football
League, every team that Parcells has coached, David Meggett has
been there.
</P>
<P>
   Been there with Parcells with the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Been there with Parcells with the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   And now Meggett is here with Parcells with the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   They are like the right shoe with the left one, or the other
pants leg, or the other glove. They understand each other (and
that's a mouthful). They often find they need each other.
</P>
<P>
   Meggett _ Parcells calls him ``David'' though many call him Dave
_ was a big part of Parcells' success with the Giants. Parcells'
second Super Bowl victory with the Giants was earned with Meggett
returning kicks and punts and tripping defenses on third-down plays
as a receiver from the backfield. Then Parcells went to New
England, and soon after Meggett joined him with the Patriots.
Parcells lobbied long and hard for Meggett with the New England
brass and won it over. Soon, Meggett did, too, on the field and as
a leader in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   During the past off season, however, Meggett was recuperating
from a foot injury and more. He has theft and assault charges
pending in an alleged sexual misconduct incident last February in
Toronto. The Patriots cut him. He had been attending classes at
Towson State.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells called.
</P>
<P>
   He called Meggett after the Toronto incident, too. Meggett
needed him then. He called Meggett recently. This time, Parcells
needed him.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells needed Meggett because Parcells and the Jets are in the
thick of the race for the first place in the American Football
Conference East. The Jets are 10-4 and are already in the playoffs.
They want more. Parcells wants more. With big regular-season games
left at Buffalo on Saturday and then home the following week
against New England, Parcells is marshaling his forces for the East
title and for the best possible seeding in the playoffs. Injuries
have hurt his kick-returning game and his depth at running back.
This is no time for guesswork; go for what you know. And Parcells
knows Meggett.
</P>
<P>
   He nurtured him as a young player. He rode him and ripped him
and coaxed him and then watched Meggett respond. Not every player
responds to Parcells' heavy hand and nauseating bark. His style can
be deplorable to some, lovable for others. Meggett can take it and,
more important for the player, it works. There was an incident once
in New England when Meggett muffed a punt and returned to the
sideline, and Parcells whacked him good. Right there on the
sideline. And then in the same game Meggett scored a touchdown.
When he returned to the sideline, Parcells hugged him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to him two days after the Toronto thing happened,''
Parcells said. ``He said, `This is a setup.' He has never lied to
me. He's never been a discipline problem, never late for meetings.
Some of these guys socially, it's tough to keep up. I know David to
be a trustworthy, honest person. A lot of these guys are
vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   The loving, caring, understanding Bill Parcells?
</P>
<P>
   This is not a mile he would walk for merely any player. In word
or in deed.
</P>
<P>
   This is where Parcells must love being the general manger and
head coach of the Jets. Given any of his previous setups with the
Giants or the Patriots, Parcells would have had to perform major
selling to sign Meggett, not only because of the old injury but
also because of the off-field baggage he brings. But now, this
decision, obviously, is pretty much Parcells'. And it did not take
him long to settle on Meggett once he saw him run and cut in a
workout and do the things he used to do.
</P>
<P>
   In New England, Meggett was one of Parcells' lieutenants in the
locker room. Meggett would offer advice to younger players. He
would help those struggling to understand Parcells' unorthodox
ways. He helped to keep the locker room focused on Parcells as much
as on winning.
</P>
<P>
   He is a special player _ the National Football League career
leader in punt returns (344) and in punt return yardage (3,688) _
and he is in a special situation. Fourteen Jets games down. Two
Jets games to go in the regular season, and then a run toward the
Super Bowl. Enter Meggett. A player who has not taken a hit on the
field this season but has taken hits in his pride and character in
nearly every way imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells is an irascible guy who builds loyalties that last with
a handful of players and coaches. Bill Belichick, his defensive
coordinator, has 13 seasons with Parcells. Romeo Crennel, his
defensive line coach, has 19 seasons with Parcells. Keith Byars
followed him from the Patriots to the Jets. So did Curtis Martin.
</P>
<P>
   But Meggett is a rare player who has been everywhere Bill
Parcells has been as a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Almost three seasons ago, the Patriots came to Giants Stadium to
play the Giants in the regular-season finale for both teams. The
Patriots were en route to Super Bowl XXXI and their loss to Green
Bay. It was Parcells' return to the New York fans, this time as the
Patriots' coach. It was Meggett's return, this time as a Patriots
kick returner. Meggett returned a punt for 60 yards for a touchdown
in that game and the Patriots, down by 22-0, rebounded with vigor
and won, 23-22. The look in the eyes of Parcells and Meggett on
that day said plenty about their special relationship.
</P>
<P>
   I need you. You need me.

CLINTON ORDERS MISSILE ATTACK AGAINST IRAQ 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton unleashed a massive military
airstrike against Iraq on Wednesday, hitting targets in Baghdad and
other parts of the country in an effort to cripple chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   Long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles fired from American ships in
the Persian Gulf and U.S. and British warplanes also struck several
military sites.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's surprise decision to launch the military action,
dubbed ``Desert Fox,'' sparked angry Republican charges that he was
putting U.S. military personnel in harm's way to stave off the
House vote on impeachment that had been scheduled for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In an address from the Oval Office, Clinton said he ordered ``a
strong, sustained series of airstrikes against Iraq,'' because of
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's continued defiance of United Nations
orders to allow unrestricted inspections of suspected weapons
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam Hussein must not be allowed to threaten his neighbors
or the world with nuclear weapons, poison gas or biological
weapons,'' the president said, describing the military action as
vital to America's national interests.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's action came less than a day after the United Nations
was presented with what he called a ``profoundly disturbing''
report from its chief weapons inspector, Richard Butler, outlining
Saddam's repeated violations of an agreement that was reached Nov.
15. The agreement narrowly postponed a U.S. military strike then.
Clinton warned Saddam at the time that if he violated the November
agreement, military action would come ``without delay, diplomacy or
warning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had delayed for even a matter of days ... we would have
given Saddam more time to disperse his forces and protect his
weapons,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he acted on the eve of the scheduled impeachment vote
``because, in the judgment of my military advisers, a swift
response would provide the most surprise and the least opportunity
for Saddam to prepare.''
</P>
<P>
   Fires broke out in Baghdad in the wake of the initial attack,
which began about 5 p.m. EST. Anti-aircraft fire lit the night sky
there as missiles fell from planes launched from the aircraft
carrier USS Enterprise in the Persian Gulf and land bases in the
region. The missile attacks continued intermittently through the
night, with some missiles hitting near one of Saddam's palaces.
U.S. officials said ground forces were not involved in the action.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam issued a statement to the Iraqi people in the midst of
the attack, saying the country was under assault by ``wicked
people.'' He urged citizens to take to the streets to fight ``the
enemies of God, enemies of the nation, enemies of humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said there would be no immediate information
on targets hit, or more importantly, on casualties. Military
officials would say only that more than 200 U.S. and British
aircraft were involved in the initial attacks, including 15 B-52
bombers that were deployed to the region last month with 400 cruise
missiles and bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Hugh Shelton said that
another 36 combat aircraft are on their way to the region,
including B-117 Stealth fighters. He said there also are 24,100
U.S. military personnel aboard 22 ships and on land bases in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stressed that he wanted to act before the Muslim holy
month of Ramadan begins this weekend because he feared that using
force during that time would be ``profoundly offensive'' to the
Arab world and damage U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
   The president's decision caused an angry eruption among
Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill, who were anticipating a vote
Thursday on impeaching Clinton for lying about his affair with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. But instead of voting to
remove him from office, incoming House Speaker Bob Livingston,
R-La., said the impeachment debate would be postponed and that
members instead would vote on a bipartisan resolution in support of
U.S. forces.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston said he and a few other congressional leaders were
first told by administration officials about two days ago that an
attack might occur this week. Still, several GOP members denounced
Clinton's action, accusing him of putting U.S. military personnel
in danger in an attempt to derail the Republican-led impeachment
movement against him.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss, issued a statement
saying, ``I cannot support this military action in the Persian Gulf
at this time. Both the timing and the policy are subject to
question.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Republican Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas questioned the
timing, but said he would support U.S. forces. But he did not
endorse the policy, as his Texas GOP colleague Sen. Kay Bailey
Hutchison did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a long time coming,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the window was small (because of the Ramadan holy
month), and I don't think that waiting a month would have been a
good thing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also got support from former President Bush, who led the
allied war against Iraq seven years ago. Bush issued a statement
saying that ``as long as one American military airman, seaman, or
soldier is in harm's way, I will fully support this action.''
</P>
<P>
   In his address to the nation, Clinton alluded to the controversy
surrounding the timing of his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam Hussein and the other enemies of peace may have thought
that the serious debate currently before the House of
Representatives would distract Americans, weaken our resolve to
face them down,'' Clinton said.``But once more the United States
has proven that although we are never eager to use force, when we
must act in America's vital interests we will do so.''
</P>
<P>
   In a briefing for reporters at the Pentagon, Defense Secretary
William Cohen, a former Republican senator, called on lawmakers not
to allow the impeachment to blunt their support for what he
insisted was a matter of national security.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am prepared to place 30 years of public service on the line
to say the only factor that was important in this decision was what
was in the American people's best interests,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   While not aimed at getting Saddam, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said the military strikes would likely increase pressure
within Iraq for Saddam's removal. In the meantime, she said the
United States would step up its efforts to work with Iraqi
opposition groups determined to overthrow Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton gave the final order to begin the attack only hours
after his return from a Middle East trip.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to the White House late Tuesday night, he was
briefed more fully on Butler's report and called a meeting of his
national advisers for Wednesday morning. The final decision on
military action was made in that meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks to the nation, Clinton said the missile strikes
are designed to ``degrade Saddam's capacity to develop and deliver
weapons of mass destruction and to degrade his ability to threaten
his neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If Saddam defies the world and we fail to respond, we will
face a far greater threat in the future. ... Mark my words,''
Clinton said, ``he will develop weapons of mass destruction, he
will deploy them and he will use them.''
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton spoke to the nation, the Security Council met at
the U.N. to discuss the president's decision and to hear from
Iraq's ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sad day for the United Nations and the world,'' said
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has happened cannot be reversed,'' he said, calling on
U.N. officials to get behind humanitarian relief efforts in Iraq
and to begin ``healing diplomacy.''

U.S. INDICTS PRODUCER OF CONTAMINATED BEEF 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: Ill., Neb., Ky. ,  Colo., Mo.)  
(nk) 
 By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ A federal grand jury has indicted a beef company and
two employees, charging them with providing false information in
connection with the contamination of hamburgers produced at a
Nebraska beef plant last year.
</P>
<P>
   The hamburgers, which are believed to have sickened 16 people in
Colorado and Kentucky in August 1997, prompted the recall of 25
million pounds of ground beef, the largest meat recall in U.S.
history.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the U.S. attorney in Omaha, Thomas Monaghan,
announced the indictments of the company, Hudson Foods, and two
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson, which merged with Tyson Foods in January, operated the
Columbus, Neb., plant that produced the hamburgers. The indicted
employees are Brent Wolke, who managed the Hudson plant, and
Michael Gregory, who was director of customer relations and quality
control for Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Frozen hamburger patties produced at the plant were linked to an
outbreak of E. coli O157:H7, bacteria that can cause serious kidney
problems and other symptoms and may be deadly, especially in
children, the elderly and those with vulnerable immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment says Wolke, Gregory and the company falsely told
investigators from the U.S. Department of Agriculture that the
company had traced the infected beef to a single lot of hamburgers.
By pinpointing the outbreak to a single lot, the company limited
the scope of the national recall to only three days of beef
production, the indictment says.
</P>
<P>
   But, Monaghan's office said, the grand jury determined that the
meat produced on those three days had not been sent to Colorado,
where the majority of the illnesses occurred. The indictment
charges that the company and the two employees learned that the
beef had not been shipped to Colorado, but still told investigators
that the single lot of beef was linked to the outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment also says it was impossible to identify the
specific day or production run tied to the E. coli outbreak because
Hudson Foods had a practice of using leftover ground beef from one
production run in later production runs, sometimes freezing the
leftover meat for months before it was ultimately made into burger
patties. The grand jury found that Hudson did not accurately track
the use of leftover ground beef in subsequent production runs.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, the two employees could face up to five years in
prison and fines of up to $250,000, while Hudson Foods could be
fined up to $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Wolke, Peter Romatowski of Washington, said the
charges were fales. ``We look forward to the opportunity to prove
that in court,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wolke is still the manager of the plant, which was closed after
the outbreak but was bought by IBP and reopened.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory's lawyer, J.R. Hobbs of Kansas City, Mo., could not be
reached Wednesday night. Gregory now works for Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson Foods said in a statement: ``The company has no basis to
believe that any mistakes that might have been made in the handling
of the recall amount to actionable offenses. Hudson believes it
cooperated fully with the government during the recall period and
withheld no information.''
</P>
<P>
   Hudson's former chairman, James T. Hudson, issued a separate
statement defending his company's honesty and criticizing the
Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overreaction of the USDA in Washington in this incident
destroyed my company's good name,'' Hudson said.

D'AMATO'S NEXT JOB: MEDIATING HOLOCAUST VICTIMS' SUIT AGAINST
BANKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sen. Alfonse D'Amato has decided to begin his life
after government on familiar terrain: He has accepted a job
mediating a federal lawsuit brought against German and Austrian
banks by Holocaust survivors, whose cause he has relentlessly
championed in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The short-term appointment by a federal judge in Manhattan,
which was disclosed Wednesday, caught the participants in the
lawsuit by surprise, and quickly generated debate over whether
D'Amato's vigorous advocacy on behalf of Holocaust victims might
complicate the negotiations that he would oversee.
</P>
<P>
   Because the job is not full time, D'Amato, who lost his bid for
a fourth term last month, is still considered likely to take a
position with a prominent law firm and to venture into the media
world, perhaps becoming the host of a radio talk show like his
friend Edward Koch, the former mayor.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the plaintiffs in the class-action lawsuit, Edward
Fagan, applauded the choice of D'Amato, saying that the banks
should be ``terrified'' of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``D'Amato is a street fighter with not only gut instincts, but
with a very good history and a lot of knowledge to back it up,''
Fagan said. ``He is not going to buy a lot of the regular mumbo
jumbo and all the other things that the banks are going to try and
throw at the court.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Fagan said he believed that D'Amato would be
fair.
</P>
<P>
   One of the German banks, Dresdner Bank, declined to comment on
the lawsuit, which alleges that the banks trafficked in gold that
the Nazis stole from European Jews during World War II. A
spokeswoman for another bank, Deutsche Bank, referred calls to the
bank's headquarters in Frankfurt, where there was no answer
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The German banks have asked the judge to dismiss the suit, which
was filed last June, on the grounds that Germany had already paid
extensive reparations for its wartime actions.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald McKelvey, a spokesman for two Austrian banks named in the
suit, Bank Austria and Creditanstalt, said D'Amato was ``eminently
qualified.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no conflict as far as we are concerned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge in the case, Shirley Wohl Kram of U.S. district court,
is no stranger to D'Amato, who is to be paid $350 an hour. He
recommended her for the post to President Reagan in 1982, who
formally selected her. The judge declined to comment on D'Amato's
appointment.
</P>
<P>
   The judge asked D'Amato, whose title is Special Master, to
supervise talks between the two sides in an attempt to get them to
settle before trial.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's spokesman, Harvey Valentine, said questions about his
impartiality in the matter or his ties to the judge were misguided.
</P>
<P>
   ``The senator demonstrated his commitment to fairness in the
pursuit of justice during the Senate Banking hearings in the Swiss
bank inquiry,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment is an unusual turn in D'Amato's work on behalf
of Holocaust victims and survivors. Throughout his last term, he
repeatedly came to their aid, holding hearings in the Senate and
criticizing what he said was the unwillingness of some Swiss and
German institutions to make amends for their actions during World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, D'Amato often promoted these efforts in an
attempt to reach out to Jewish voters, who have historically leaned
more toward Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank acknowledged earlier this year that it had dealt
in Nazi gold during the war, saying that it ``regrets most deeply
injustices that occurred.'' It declined then to say whether its
wartime officials knew that some of the gold might have been from
Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
   Two experts on legal ethics said they saw nothing improper in
Judge Kram's decision to give work to a senator who helped her get
appointed. They noted that D'Amato recommended many people for
federal judgeships in his 18 years in office and that it would not
be practical for him to recuse himself from dealings with all of
them.
</P>
<P>
   One expert, Professor Stephen Gillers of New York University Law
School, said that if the judge had asked D'Amato to draw
conclusions about the case and make recommendations, then such a
role might present a conflict. But Gillers said that because the
job was limited to mediating, it was not troubling. If the banks do
not like a proposed settlement, they can reject it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The other expert, Professor Steven Lubet of Northwestern School
of Law, noted that the justice system was based upon the idea that
judges and others handling disputes would set aside their personal
views. But he added that, ``Even assuming that Senator D'Amato
could be achingly fair, you could understand why the defendants
might prefer to have somebody else.''

EXPERTS ASSERT CASE CAN BE PRESSED WITHOUT BODY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Conn., Del., Calif.)   (Eds: Sidebar to MILLIONAIRE-DISAPPEAR) 
(jw) 
 By LAURA MANSNERUS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The examples are few, but the law was clear for the
prosecutors who secured the indictment of Sante and Kenneth Kimes:
A homicide case can proceed without a body.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an old common-law rule,'' said Steven Zeidman, a
professor at the New York University School of Law. ``The body
isn't necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The underlying rationale,'' he said, ``is that you're not
entitled to an acquittal because you were especially good at
getting rid of the body.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Schreiber, a deputy district attorney in Brooklyn, had to
put that reasoning to the test when he prosecuted a homicide case
last year in which the body of the victim, an 8-year-old girl, was
never found. ``The bottom line is you don't need the corpus,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But in that case, involving the killing of Justina Morales in
1995, Schreiber won a conviction for manslaughter, not murder, as
he had sought.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, a jury in 1989 convicted a Connecticut man, Richard
Crafts, of murdering his wife, whose body was never recovered,
after hearing evidence that he had put the body parts through a
wood chipper. And in a highly publicized case now on trial in
Delaware, Thomas Capano, the defendant, was charged with murder
after a 17-month search for the body of a former girlfriend yielded
nothing but the cooler that witnesses said he used to dump it at
sea.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there has long been reluctance to prosecute homicides on
the basis of a confession alone, or on circumstantial evidence
alone, Zeidman said, and for years some states required the body
for an indictment to be handed up, though these laws have all been
repealed.
</P>
<P>
   It was a 1957 prosecution in California that paved the way for
allowing a murder case to be brought without the body of a victim.
The defendant, Leonard Ewing Scott, was convicted of killing his
wife, Evelyn, though no physical trace of her was ever found. Her
body was believed to have been buried in the supports of the San
Diego freeway. Although he was convicted, the jury rejected the
death penalty in favor of life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Several dozen cases around the nation have been successfully
prosecuted since then. But Zeidman said that in these instances,
``my guess is that you'll see some kind of admission or
confession.'' He added: ``They don't have that from the Kimeses. I
think the Kimes case is going to push this to the limit.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his prosecution in Brooklyn, Schreiber pointed out, ``our
case was not entirely circumstantial.'' First, he said, the child's
stepfather had acknowledged her death and acknowledged striking
her, though he maintained that it was accidental. In addition, he
noted that prosecutors were able to obtain the testimony of the
girl's mother.
</P>
<P>
   And it is that kind of account, from witnesses to a homicide, if
not from the defendant, that the Manhattan prosecutors lack in
their account of how Irene Silverman disappeared from her East Side
town house this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have not found any physical evidence that Mrs.
Silverman was harmed. Such evidence was critical in the Connecticut
case, which included traces of bone, a fingernail and hair samples
recovered from the victim, Helle Crafts.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, even with such direct evidence, Schreiber said,
without a body ``you can't corroborate statements because without a
coroner you can't confirm the account of death; in the absence of
medical testimony, it's more difficult.''

RECALLING GRIDIRON PATRIOTS AS A RAGGED, PROUD BAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the New England Patriots left Boston for Foxboro, Mass., 27
years ago, it was a treat for the team to have any home at all. The
Patriots, a charter team in the maverick American Football League,
were pigskin nomads from 1960 to 1970, when they roamed the Boston
area playing home games in other teams' homes: Harvard, Boston
College, Boston University and Fenway Park of the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1970, the president of Harvard wrote my dad a note, saying,
`Billy, you finally made it to Harvard,''' said Chuck Sullivan, one
of the six children of William H. Sullivan Jr., the Patriots'
original owner who died last February.
</P>
<P>
   So the team was happy to have a stadium of its own, even one it
had to pay $7.1 million to build.
</P>
<P>
   Now the team will be on the move again, 85 miles away to
Hartford. By 2001 at the earliest, the Patriots will move into a
$375 million downtown stadium with 150 luxury suites and 5,000 club
seats, thanks to a generous package approved Tuesday night by the
Connecticut legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Although he described the terms as awesome, Sullivan, an
investment banker and a former executive vice president of the
team, said: ``My dad wouldn't have let the taxpayers of
Massachusetts or Connecticut build a stadium for him. He felt the
taxpayers shouldn't foot the bill for a private business.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Sullivan was a raconteur, former sports publicity agent,
newspaperman, printing salesman and oil company executive from
Lowell, Mass. He acquired the eighth and final team in the new AFL
in 1959 with $8,300 of his own money and the rest of the $25,000
franchise fee from his brother, father-in-law and others.
</P>
<P>
   Those were arduous days for the AFL, which had to convince
players it was serious and endure the scorn of the National
Football League. There were wealthy owners, like oil man Lamar
Hunt, owner of the Dallas Texans (which became the Kansas City
Chiefs), and those who were just getting by, like Harry Wismer, a
former radio sportscaster who owned the New York Titans (now the
Jets). They were the days of five-figure salaries and grass fields,
a time when cities were not competing to lure teams with
taxpayer-built stadiums filled with luxury boxes and club seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``One game we were playing the Titans, in either 1960 or 1961,''
Chuck Sullivan recalled. ``Harry couldn't meet his payroll, and we
were not financially strong either. But my father wouldn't let
anybody who was involved in the game not be paid. So he paid both
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Sullivan's Patriots were an up-and-down team, losing more
than winning under nine coaches. But there were stars, like
quarterbacks Babe Parilli and Jim Plunkett and place-kicker Gino
Cappelletti. After a 5-9 start in 1960, the team fired its coach
early in the next season and posted a 9-4-1 record. The Patriots
made it to the 1963 AFL championship game, but were trounced,
51-10, by the San Diego Chargers.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan still owned the team when Coach Raymond Berry took the
team to Super Bowl XX in 1986, but the Patriots were trampled by
the Chicago Bears, 46-10. In the late 1980s, the team entered a
period of instability. In 1988, the NFL had to advance $4 million
for the team to meet its payroll. The Patriots put the stadium into
bankruptcy to prevent its being auctioned.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Sullivan sold the team for $85 million to Victor Kiam
and Fran Murray. Kiam bought out Murray and sold the team to James
Orthwein for $106 million in 1992. Orthwein sold it to Robert K.
Kraft for $158 million. Kraft had bought the stadium for $25
million six years before.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Billy Sullivan filed an antitrust suit against the
NFL in federal court in 1991, charging that the league conspired to
keep him from selling 49 percent of the team when he needed to
raise money to pay his debts. Five years later, he settled for
$11.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, under Coach Bill Parcells, the Patriots made it back to
the Super Bowl, but lost again, 35-21, to the Green Bay Packers.
Shortly after, Parcells bolted to the Jets, enraging Kraft, who was
awarded four draft picks by the NFL as compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Sullivan thought about his father this week while reading
about the perks Hartford offered the team: a free stadium, no rent,
a $13 million revenue guarantee if luxury boxes and club seats
don't sell out, and $15 million for a training center.
</P>
<P>
   Asked on Tuesday what he would make of his old team's going to
Hartford, he said: ``If you ask the season-ticket holders who were
with us in 1960, and who are still there, I'll bet 10 out of 10
don't want to go to Hartford. Dad's focus was not on the luxury box
holder.''

COLUMN: SITES FOR WOMEN FLOURISH ON THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A new chapter in the history of communications is
unfolding in New York, and it looks pretty much like the previous
ones. Women are yet again taking over a medium invented by men.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the computer revolution has been guided largely by
male engineers scattered along the West Coast in isolated garages,
basements and suburban office parks. But the hot Internet companies
this fall exploit one of Manhattan's greatest resources: a network
of educated women.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, it was estimated that only 5 percent of the
Internet's users were women, but today the figure is nearly 50
percent, and women are projected to become a majority in the next
several years. So investors and media executives have become
enthralled with Internet companies in New York run by and for
women.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street is eagerly anticipating a public stock offering by
iVillage, the SoHo company that operates the Internet's most
popular female-oriented sites and recently announced partnerships
with NBC and AT&AMP;T. Meanwhile, America Online and Oprah Winfrey have
formed alliances with Oxygen Media, a new-media company in midtown
started this year by Geraldine Laybourne, the former head of cable
television operations at Disney/ABC.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is a natural place for women,'' Ms. Laybourne
said, ``because they care so much about relationships and staying
connected. New York is the place to find women who know how to
reach that audience, because there are so many smart women here
with experience in cable television, magazines, publishing and
advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   Men have long had a knack for inventing communication gadgets,
from pen and paper to the printing press, the telephone and the
computer. But it's women who master the media and spend more time
using them. They write more personal letters, send more cards and
spend more time on the phone than men do. They're more likely to
become authors, and they read more books and magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet lets women use words, which is their natural
tool,'' said Helen Fisher, an anthropologist at Rutgers University
who is working on a book on gender differences. ``Little girls
speak in more complex, grammatical sentences than little boys do,
and women never lose that superiority in verbal ability. The
Internet is also a wonderful outlet for women's talent at
networking. Men tend to be hierarchical, but women are driven to
make lateral connections so they can cooperate.''
</P>
<P>
   While men are busy blasting virtual rocket launchers at one
another over the Internet, women are talking. A survey this fall by
Jupiter Communications, a market research company in SoHo, found
that women spend less time on the Internet playing games and more
time participating in chat rooms and exchanging e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started iVillage, fun and games and surfing were key
activities on the web,'' Nancy Evans, the editor in chief, explains
in an open letter to her site's visitors. ``Today, using the
Internet to help with real life has taken over the No. 1 spot. Not
that we don't like fun; but let's face it, we women are
practical.''
</P>
<P>
   The practical means Web sites that look more like products of
the Hearst and Conde Nast buildings than of Silicon Valley. They're
devoted to health care, parenting (Oxygen has a site called Moms
OnLine), fitness, beauty and fashion, with plenty of
self-improvement quizzes and advice.
</P>
<P>
   Click on iVillage's Relationships site, and you find links to
Dating Dilemmas, Couples Clinic, How to Kiss Better, The Wedding
Women, Ms. Demeanor and a chat session for the Ex-Wives Club. The
site is called a ``circle of help and support'' by its editor in
chief, Ms. Evans.
</P>
<P>
   ``One iVillager tells how she reinvented herself after getting
fired, and three of you, maybe a dozen, even a hundred get
inspired,'' Ms. Evans writes in her open letter. ``Another
iVillager tells her story of getting over trying to be perfect _
size 6, good hair days _ and now she's living, just living,
happily. And we feel emboldened by her resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   This may not sound so emboldening to veterans who still think of
the Internet as a place for e-mail flame wars, chat rooms about sex
and politics, and Web pages filled with arcana on debugging
software and scoring higher on Quake. But these males will have to
get used to sharing their turf. They may be able to beat one
another in rocket-launcher shootouts, but they can't resist an army
of well-spoken, well-connected women.

ATTACK ON BAGHDAD GIVES CLINTON REPRIEVE ON IMPEACHMENT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Startled and angry House Republicans gave President
Clinton a reprieve Wednesday night from certain impeachment as the
United States and Britain launched a military attack on Saddam
Hussein's Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   House leaders, confronted with the assault on the eve of an
impeachment debate that had been set for Thursday, abruptly
postponed the proceedings, deferring what Clinton's friends and
foes all but agreed would be his inevitable impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than debate Clinton's impeachment fate Thursday, the
House will vote on a resolution to support US forces involved in
the strike on Iraq. House Republicans said the impeachment
proceedings would be delayed until after the military action but
probably to no later than early next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We reserve the right in the next few days to complete the
business that brought us here in the last few hours,'' said the
House speaker-designate, Representative Robert L. Livingston,
referring to the impeachment debate.
</P>
<P>
   In a stunning confluence of events, Clinton ordered the military
strike as a final wave of moderate Republicans appeared to seal the
president's fate by announcing they no longer consider him fit to
govern in the face of four impeachment charges stemming from his
sexual affair with the former White House intern, Monica S.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The timing triggered anger among many Republican lawmakers,
despite the administration's insistence that Clinton's impeachment
crisis had no effect on the military foray.
</P>
<P>
   ``This president is shameless in what he will do to maintain his
presidency,'' said Representative Tillie Fowler of Florida, vice
chairwoman of the House Republican conference. ``He will use our
military, our foreign policy, whatever it takes to stay in
office.''
</P>
<P>
   While other GOP members called for Clinton's resignation, the
House majority leader, Richard K. Armey, said, ``After months of
lies, the president has given millions of people around the world
reason to doubt that he has sent Americans into battle for the
right reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic leaders vehemently defended the strike as a vital
response to Saddam Hussein's latest provocation in refusing to
comply with United Nations resolutions that Iraq dismantle its
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam Hussein should make no mistake that despite domestic
political differences in the United States, the American people and
Congress stand firmly behind the defense of our nation's vital
interests,'' the Democratic leaders of the House and Senate,
Richard A. Gephardt and Thomas A. Daschle, said in a joint
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, denounced the attack,
saying, ``Both the timing and the policy are subject to question.''
</P>
<P>
   But other Republican lawmakers cautioned against criticizing the
military action while US troops are carrying out Clinton's order.
Livingston said the resolution Thursday will ``say that we are
united ... in the belief that Saddam Hussein must be contained and
that his use of weapons of mass destruction must be curtailed, and
in the belief that our troops should come home safely after the
completion of their effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in an address to the nation, made only a brief
reference to his military order intersecting with the imeachment
inquiry. In announcing the assault, Clinton said: ``Saddam Hussein
and the other enemies of peace may have thought that the serious
debate currently before the House of Representatives would distract
Americans or weaken our resolve to face them down.''
</P>
<P>
   On a day that verged on the bizarre even by Washington
standards, the business on Capitol Hill gradually shifted from
completing final preparations for the first House impeachment vote
in 130 years to monitoring televised images of anti-aircraft fire
lighting the sky over Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, lawmakers who had planned to gather in the House
chamber Thursday for an unprecedented lame-duck impeachment session
convened instead for a closed-door briefing on the military action
by Pentagon officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing is nuts,'' said Representative E. Clay Shaw
Jr., a Florida Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, few of the signs were promising for Clinton.
For every conservative Republican who blasted the timing of the
military attack, there was a moderate GOP lawmaker who was vowing
to vote for Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``While history remembers that George Washington could not tell
a lie, it now appears that history may well remember Bill Clinton
for his inability to tell the truth,'' said Representative Jerry
Lewis, a California Republican, in announcing he will vote for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen other GOP moderates joined Lewis in turning
against Clinton, leaving the president little mathematical chance,
if any, of surviving the vote to send his case to the Senate for a
trial, according to lawmakers on both sides of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly believe the vote is going to be the same whether it
is cast Thursday, Friday, Saturday or Sunday,'' said Representative
Edward J. Markey, a Malden Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston remained adamant in refusing to allow the House to
vote on an alternative resolution of the crisis short of
impeachment, such as a censure. Some of Clinton's allies said the
leadership's resistance to the censure plan has helped drive
moderate Republicans to vote for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Even Democrats who had believed Clinton would not be impeached
were close to conceding his defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was wrong,'' said Representative Barney Frank, a Newton
Democrat. ``The right wing is determined to do it, and I
underestimated their control over the Republican moderates. It
means the total collapse of moderate Republicanism.''
</P>
<P>
   The only good news for the White House, scant as it was, emerged
from an unusual source. Representative Jay Kim, a California
Republican who is wearing an electronic bracelet as part of his
sentence for pleading guilty to accepting illegal campaign
donations, said he is leaning against voting to impeach Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on Iraq enflamed hostilities among House factions
that already were bitterly divided over the impeachment issue. The
frayed relations were evident last night as House members huddled
in closed-door party caucuses to develop strategy for the
impeachment proceedings and late-breaking military attack.
</P>
<P>
   Told that the impeachment debate might be delayed until
Christmas week, several Democrats accused conservative Republicans
of trying to oust Clinton at all costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't we do it during Mass?'' said Representative David R.
Obey, a Wisconsin Democrat. ``Then we can have a national
crucifixion.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans said they were increasingly losing tolerance
and respect for Clinton, even as US pilots were in the air over
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never underestimate a desperate president,'' said
Representative Gerald B.H. Solomon, a New York Republican. ``This
time he means business. What option is left for getting impeachment
off the front page and maybe even postponed? It's about the lowest
thing I can think of any president doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Dana Rohrabacher, a California Republican, called
Clinton ``a shameless liar,'' and joined other GOP members in
calling on him to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats said Clinton would come under fire no matter
which course he pursued, particularly on Iraq. ``If he did nothing,
the same Republicans who are complaining about him would be jumping
down his throat, saying, `See, he's not acting like the president
of the United States,''' said Representative James P. McGovern, a
Worcester Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans also opposed delaying the impeachment debate.
``To postpone it is like giving satisfaction to Saddam,'' said
Representative Bill McCollum, a Florida Republican. ``It's like
yielding to terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank said of the anti-Clinton Republicans: ``Their hatred for
him is just bubbling over in every direction. It has gotten out of
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy struck a similar chord. ``This is a
classic absue of power, a subversion of the Constitution of the
United States, carried on by extremists in the Republican Party,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The day began with Vice President Al Gore appealing to Congress
to ``turn away from the bitter partisanship'' and reject Clinton's
impeachment. But there was little sign last night of either side
bridging the gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Disagreements abounded, including a dispute over how long the
impeachment debate should last. Gephardt called for a 36-hour,
around-the-clock debate that would permit every member to speak for
five minutes, as lawmakers had been given to debate the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   But GOP leaders said they want to limit the debate to six to
eight hours.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development, Clinton's focus on the military action
prompted him to postpone a meeting Wednesday with Representative
Christopher Shays, a Republican from Connecticut who had initially
opposed impeachment but has wavered in recent days.

<P>
   Following is a transcript of President Clinton's address to the
nation Wednesday on Iraq, as recorded by The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
   Earlier today I ordered America's armed forces to strike
military and security targets in Iraq. They are joined by British
forces. Their mission is to attack Iraq's nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons programs and its military capacity to threaten
its neighbors. Their purpose is to protect the national interest of
the United States and indeed the interests of people throughout the
Middle East and around the world. Saddam Hussein must not be
allowed to threaten his neighbors or the world with nuclear arms,
poison gas or biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   I want to explain why I have decided, with the unanimous
recommendation of my national security team, to use force in Iraq,
why we have acted now and what we aim to accomplish. Six weeks ago,
Saddam Hussein announced that he would no longer cooperate with the
United Nations weapons inspectors called UNSCOM. They are highly
professional experts from dozens of countries. Their job is to
oversee the elimination of Iraq's capability to retain, create and
use weapons of mass destruction and to verify that Iraq does not
attempt to rebuild that capability. The inspectors undertook this
mission first 71/2 years ago, at the end of the Gulf War when Iraq
agreed to declare and destroy its arsenal as a condition of the
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   The international community had good reason to set this
requirement. Other countries possess weapons of mass destruction
and ballistic missiles. With Saddam, there's one big difference. He
has used them, not once but repeatedly, unleashing chemical weapons
against Iranian troops during a decade-long war. Not only against
soldiers but against civilians. Firing Scud missiles at the
citizens of Israel, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Iran, not only
against a foreign enemy but even against his own people, gassing
Kurdish civilians in Northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The international community had little doubt then, and I have no
doubt today that, left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will use these
terrible weapons again. The United States has patiently worked to
preserve UNSCOM as Iraq has sought to avoid its obligation to
cooperate with the inspectors. On occasion we've had to threaten
military force and Saddam has backed down. Faced with Saddam's
latest act of defiance in late October, we built intensive
diplomatic pressure on Iraq backed by overwhelming military force
in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Security Council voted 15-0 to condemn Saddam's actions
and to demand that he immediately come into compliance. Eight Arab
nations _ Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar,
United Arab Emirates and Oman _ warned that Iraq alone would bear
responsibility for the consequences of defying the U.N.
</P>
<P>
   When Saddam still failed to comply we prepared to act
militarily. It was only then at the last possible moment that Iraq
backed down. It pledged to the U.N. that it had made, and I quote,
``a clear and unconditional decision to resume cooperation with the
weapons inspectors.''
</P>
<P>
   I decided then to call off the attack with our airplanes already
in the air because Saddam had given in to our demands. I concluded
then that the right thing to do was to use restraint and give
Saddam one last chance to prove his willingness to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   I made it very clear at that time what unconditional cooperation
meant based on existing U.N. resolutions and Iraq's own
commitments. And along with Prime Minister Blair of Great Britain,
I made it equally clear that if Saddam failed to cooperate fully,
we would be prepared to act without delay, diplomacy or warning.
</P>
<P>
   Now over the past three weeks, the U.N. weapons inspectors have
carried out their plan for testing Iraq's cooperation. The testing
period ended this weekend, and last night UNSCOM's chairman,
Richard Butler, reported the results to U.N. Secretary-General
Annan. The conclusions are stark, sobering and profoundly
disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   In four out of the five categories set forth, Iraq has failed to
cooperate. Indeed, it actually has placed new restrictions on the
inspections. Here are some of the particulars.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq repeatedly blocked UNSCOM from inspecting suspect sites.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it shut off access to the headquarters of its
ruling party and said it will deny access to the party's other
offices, even though U.N. resolutions make no exception for them
and UNSCOM has inspected them in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq repeatedly restricted UNSCOM's ability to obtain necessary
evidence. For example, Iraq obstructed UNSCOM's effort to
photograph bombs related to its chemical weapons program. It tried
to stop an UNSCOM biological weapons team from videotaping a site
and photocopying documents and prevented Iraqi personnel from
answering UNSCOM's questions.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the inspection of another site, Iraq actually emptied
out the building, removing not just documents, but even the
furniture and the equipment. Iraq has failed to turn over virtually
all the documents requested by the inspectors, indeed we know that
Iraq ordered the destruction of weapons-related documents in
anticipation of an UNSCOM inspection.
</P>
<P>
   So Iraq has abused its final chance. As the UNSCOM report
concludes, and again I quote: ``Iraq's conduct ensured that no
progress was able to be made in the fields of disarmament. In light
of this experience, and in the absence of full cooperation by Iraq,
it must regrettably be recorded again that the commission is not
able to conduct the work mandated to it by the Security Council,
with respect to Iraq's prohibited weapons program.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, the inspectors are saying that even if they could stay
in Iraq, their work would be a sham. Saddam's deception has
defeated their effectiveness. Instead of the inspectors' disarming
Saddam, Saddam has disarmed the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   This situation presents a clear and present danger to the
stability of the Persian Gulf and the safety of people everywhere.
The international community gave Saddam one last chance to resume
cooperation with the weapons inspectors. Saddam has failed to seize
the chance. And so we had to act, and act now.
</P>
<P>
   Let me explain why.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First, without a strong inspection system Iraq would be free to
retain and again to rebuild its chemical, biological and nuclear
weapons programs. In months, not years.
</P>
<P>
   Second, if Saddam can cripple the weapons inspection systems and
get away with it, he would conclude that the international
community, led by the United States, has simply lost its will. He
will surmise that he has free rein to rebuild his arsenal of
destruction and someday, make no mistake, he will use it again as
he has in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Third, in halting our air strikes in November, I gave Saddam a
chance not a license. If we turn our backs on his defiance the
credibility of U.S. power as a check against Saddam will be
destroyed. We will not only have allowed Saddam to shatter the
inspection system that controls his weapons of mass destruction
program, we also will have fatally undercut the fear of force that
stopped Saddam from acting to gain domination in the region.
</P>
<P>
   That is why on the unanimous recommendation of my national
security team, including the vice president, secretary of defense,
the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the secretary of state
and the national security adviser, I have ordered a strong
sustained series of air strikes against Iraq. They are designed to
degrade Saddam's capacity to develop and deliver weapons of mass
destruction and to degrade his ability to threaten his neighbors.
At the same time we are delivering a powerful message to Saddam. If
you act recklessly you will pay a heavy price.
</P>
<P>
   We acted today because in the judgment of my military advisers a
swift response would provide the most surprise and the least
opportunity for Saddam to prepare. If we had delayed for even a
matter of days, from Chairman Butler's report, we would have given
Saddam more time to disperse his forces and protect his weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins this weekend. For
us to initiate military action during Ramadan would be profoundly
offensive to the Muslim world and therefore would damage our
relations with Arab countries and the progress we have made in the
Middle East. That is something we wanted very much to avoid without
giving Iraq a month's head start to prepare for potential action
against it.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, our allies including Prime Minister Tony Blair of Great
Britain, concur that now is the time to start. I hope Saddam will
come into cooperation with the inspection system now, and comply
with the relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions. But we have to
be prepared that he will not. And we must deal with the very real
danger he poses. So we will pursue a long-term strategy to contain
Iraq and its weapons of mass destruction and work toward the day
when Iraq is a government worthy of its people.
</P>
<P>
   First, we must be prepared to use force again if Saddam takes
threatening action such as trying to reconstitute his weapons of
mass destruction or other delivery systems threatening his
neighbors, challenging allied aircraft over Iraq or moving against
his own Kurdish citizens. The credible threat to use force, and,
when necessary, the actual use of force, is the surest way to
contain Saddam's weapons-of-mass-destruction program, curtail his
aggression and prevent another gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   Second. So long as Iraq remains out of compliance we will work
with the international community to maintain and enforce economic
sanctions. Sanctions have cost Saddam more than $120 billion _
resources that would have been used to rebuild his military. The
sanction system allows Iraq to sell oil or food or medicine or
other humanitarian supplies for the Iraqi people. We have no
quarrel with them.
</P>
<P>
   But without the sanctions, we would see the oil-for-food program
become oil for tanks, resulting in a greater threat to Iraq's
neighbors and less food for its people. The hard fact is that so
long as Saddam remains in power he threatens the well-being of his
people, the peace of this region, the security of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to end that threat, once and for all, is with a new
Iraqi government, a government ready to live in peace with its
neighbors, a government that respects the rights of its people.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing change in Baghdad will take time and effort. We will
strengthen our engagement with the full range of Iraqi opposition
forces and work with them effectively and prudently.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to use force is never cost-free. Whenever American
forces are placed in harm's way we risk the loss of life. And while
our strikes are focused on Iraq's military capabilities, there will
be unintended Iraqi casualties. Indeed in the past Saddam has
intentionally placed Iraqi civilians in harm's way in a cynical bid
to sway international opinion. We must be prepared for these
realities.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Saddam should have absolutely no doubt if he
lashes out at his neighbors, we will respond forcefully.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy as they are, the cost of action must be weighed against
the price of inaction. If Saddam defies the world and we fail to
respond, we will face a far greater threat in the future. Saddam
will strike again at his neighbors. He will make war on his own
people. And mark my words, he will develop weapons of mass
destruction. He will deploy them and he will use them.
</P>
<P>
   Because we are acting today it is less likely that we will face
these dangers in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Let me close by addressing one other issue. Saddam Hussein and
the other enemies of peace may have thought that the serious debate
currently before the House of Representatives would distract
Americans or weaken our resolve to face him down. But once more the
United States has proven that although we are never eager to use
force, when we must act in America's vital interests, we will do
so.
</P>
<P>
   In the century we're leaving, America has often made the
difference between chaos and community, fear and hope. Now in a new
century we will have a remarkable opportunity to shape a future
more peaceful than the past. But only if we stand strong against
the enemies of peace. Tonight, the United States is doing just
that.
</P>
<P>
   May God bless and protect the brave men and women who are
carrying out this vital mission and their families. And may God
bless America.

CHILES SALUTED FOR HIS TIES TO THE PEOPLE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ With Vice President Al Gore and scores of
other dignitaries in attendance, Gov. Lawton Chiles was remembered
at his funeral Wednesday as a leader who never forgot the common
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lawton loved his fellow citizens in the state,'' said former
Sen. Sam Nunn, a Democrat from Georgia, who once worked beside
Chiles in the Senate. ``No other senator or governor had such a
remarkable bond with his constituents.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout a 100-minute service at Faith Presbyterian Church
here in the state capital, the life and 40-year public career of
Chiles, who died of heart failure on Saturday at the age of 68, was
recalled by officials, friends and relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Although about half the church's 850 seats were open to the
public, the pews were packed with dignitaries, including the vice
president, seven current or former senators, half a dozen members
of the House, the governors of five other states, four former
governors of Florida, the Florida Cabinet and most of the
160-member state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   A common thread in the eulogies was Chiles' ability to relate to
ordinary citizens. Many said it began with his 1,000-mile campaign
walk across the state in 1970, a trek that helped turn a
little-known Democratic state legislator into a U.S. senator.
</P>
<P>
   Chiles served 18 years in the Senate before retiring in 1989,
then came out of retirement to run for governor in 1990. He was
within 23 days of completing his second and final four-year term
when he died. He was succeeded by Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay, who will
be governor until Jeb Bush, who defeated MacKay in the election
last month, is inaugurated on Jan. 5.

</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES and STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton ordered a ``strong sustained
series of air strikes'' against Iraq on Wednesday, defending the
attack as unavoidable even as incensed congressional Republicans
charged it was politically timed to stave off the resolution to
impeach him pending in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq has abused its final chance,'' Clinton declared in an
address to the nation on Wednesday night as Americans watches
explosions flash on television and heard Baghdad reverberate with
the sound of anti-aircraft fire.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said more than 200 missiles rained down upon Iraq
without warning about 24 hours after the chief U.N. weapons
inspector reported that President Saddam Hussein was once again
thwarting his work.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton spoke, House Republican leaders, yielding to the
eruption in the Iraq crisis, postponed their plans to begin on
Thursday the second impeachment debate in American history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to defer,`'' said House Speaker-elect Robert
Livingston, in careful comments emphasizing support for the troops
involved in the exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave Saddam a chance, not a license,'' Clinton said three
hours after U.S. cruise missiles were launched, followed by air
strikes by Navy jets from the aircraft carrier Enterprise in the
Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Among the targets were suspected weapons plants, Iraqi
intelligence agencies, and fortifications of the military unit
known as the Republican Guard, which substantially survived the war
with Iraq in 1991 despite weeks of sustained bombing. Initial
reports on Wednesday night suggested that one of Saddam's
marble-clad palaces in Baghdad had also been hit, and that
ambulances were seen there.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks were ordered, Clinton said, because of Iraq's
refusal to live up to its promise, after its defeat in the Persian
Gulf War, to allow the United Nations to conduct inspections to
uncover weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The timing, he insisted, was a strategic decision based on a
report delivered Tuesday by Richard Butler, the chairman of the
United Nations Special Commission overseeing the disarmament of
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had delayed for even a matter of days,'' Clinton
insisted, citing the latest reports from U.N. inspectors, ``we
would have given Saddam more time to disperse his forces and
protect his weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   His decision was immediately endorsed by the British prime
minister, Tony Blair, who denounced Saddam as a ``serial liar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam has no intention whatever of keeping to his word,''
said Blair, who committed 12 British Tornado fighter jets and six
reconnaissance planes to the raids.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the first explosions, Saddam confirmed the American
attack in a statement to the nation. ``Resist and fight them,'' he
declared. ``The cowards have bombarded several objectives on Iraqi
soil in the belief that they would make you bend.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack will continue for three to four days, according to
Pentagon officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. While they
declined to be precise about the duration, they noted Clinton
expressed the nation's sensitivity to the religious significance of
Ramadan, the Muslim holy period that begins this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The military strike marked a clear policy departure for the
administration. The president had indicated at one point that a
major military strike could end efforts to use U.N. inspection to
prevent Iraq from building up its arsenals. Senior American
officials said the administration might have to rely on aerial
surveillance and keep a large force in the region for several more
years, ready to strike again when intelligence reports indicate a
need.
</P>
<P>
   There are 24,100 American troops in the gulf region; 22
warships, eight of them armed with Tomahawk cruise missiles, and
201 military aircraft, according to the Defense Department. The
aircraft carrier Carl Vinson is expected to join the Enterprise in
the gulf on Saturday, along with six other warships able to fire
cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The president launched the attack on the eve of the House
Republican majority's impeachment move against him after a
tumultuous political day in Washington in which Republicans
suggested Clinton's motives in the attack seemed rooted more in his
political survival in office than in world security.
</P>
<P>
   As the first missiles were striking Iraq, Senate Majority leader
Trent Lott issued a statement questioning ``both the timing and the
policy'' behind Clinton's decision.
</P>
<P>
   The president made one brief allusion to impeachment near the
end of his 15-minutes address when he declared:
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam Hussein and other enemies of peace may have thought
that the serious debate before the House of Representatives would
distract Americans or weaken our resolve to face him down. But once
more, the United States has proven that although we are never eager
to use force, when we must act in America's vital interests, we
will do so.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The first Tomahawk cruise missiles were fired from six
destroyers, one cruiser and an attack submarine at about 11 p.m.
Baghdad time. They began to hit military and industrial targets
across Iraq almost simultaneously two hours later, Pentagon
officials said. The Clinton administration has twice before carried
out strikes against Iraq _ in July of 1993 and September of 1996 _
but the attack on Wednesday was described as by far the largest
military action in Iraq since the end of the gulf war in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing attacks are expected to include 15 B-52 bombers
armed with air-launched cruise missiles as well as additional
fighters and bombers that Secretary of Defense William Cohen
dispatched to the region Wednesday night, including F-117
``stealth'' attack fighters designed to elude radar.
</P>
<P>
   There were no immediate reports on the effectiveness of the
raids nor any definitive word on casualties, although the president
said ``unintended'' Iraqi casualties were inevitable and that
planners were trying to minimize the chances of injuries to people.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from the Oval Office, Clinton said the mission of the
raids is ``to protect the national interests of the United States
and indeed the interests of people throughout the Middle East and
around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam Hussein must not be allowed to threaten his neighbors
or the world with nuclear arms, poison gas or biological weapons,''
Clinton declared.
</P>
<P>
   Amid their doubts, other Republicans voiced support for the
American forces at risk in the military strike. But one House
leader, Gerald B.H. Solomon, chairman of the Rules Committee, was
furious in accusing the president of using the Iraqi air strikes as
a political foil to impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obvious that he is doing this for political reasons, and
I and others are outraged,'' he declared outside the Capitol
minutes after receiving word of the air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   But any thought of impeachment as a factor in the military
decision was denied by Cohen, a former Republican member of the
Senate. ``I am prepared to place 30 years of public service on the
line,'' he said, ``to say the only factor that was important in
this decision is what is in the American people's best interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the raid had been in the works and planned for
execution on Wednesday since a previously ordered attack was
canceled in November during an earlier confrontation with Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry Shelton,
added, ``Militarily it was the right decision, the right date, and
that decision was made back in November.''
</P>
<P>
   In the domestic furor, critics questioned the timing of the
attack, with cynics describing it as a scenario intended to exploit
a war mentality as a distraction from domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
   The timing ``smells to high heaven,'' said Lawrence Eagleburger,
former secretary of state in the Bush administration who said,
however, that tough military action against Iraq was long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, said the
timing of the attack was related to the latest report from Butler,
the chief U.N. weapons inspector, and by the military strategists'
advice that any attack be launched as quickly as possible. The fact
that the president was about to face the threat of impeachment,
Berger said, `` would not alter what he saw as his responsibility
as president.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Retired Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the central commander of the
gulf war, expressed approval of the latest attack in a television
interview, declaring, ``By golly, the troops are committed, and we
can't have people second guessing the way they did in Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott, who surprised some Republicans with his statement of
opposition to an overseas military enterprise, said he favored a
``more clearly defined'' operation, not ``a cursory air strike.''
Central to this, he said, should be ``the removal of Saddam Hussein
from power.'' He contended that ``this administration has
squandered too many opportunities in Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, however, defended his record as the correct mixture of
diplomatic and economic pressures and, finally, force. ``Mark my
words,'' he said of Saddam, ``He will develop weapons of mass
destruction. He will deploy them, and he will use them. Because
we're acting today, it is less likely that we will face these
dangers in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that even if the U.N. inspectors could stay in
Iraq, their work would be ``a sham.'' ``Saddam's deception has
defeated their effectiveness,'' he said. ``Instead of the
inspectors disarming Saddam, Saddam has disarmed the inspectors.''
</P>
<P>
   He gave no indication of what Iraq might do to halt the strikes.
Administration officials said later that the raids would continue
to completion and there was nothing Iraq could do to curtail them.
</P>
<P>
   `No, they had their chance,'' said Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright.

 &HT;    Timing inspires cynicism or belief in coincidence
 &HT;    By Bob Dart

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Defense Secretary William Cohen rushed to the
Capitol on Wednesday night to explain the military mission against
Iraq after Republican leaders openly questioned whether President
Clinton had launched the attacks to delay his presidency's day of
reckoning.
</P>
<P>
   Many GOP members of both the House and Senate voiced suspicion
about Clinton's decision to attack on the eve of a scheduled debate
and possible vote on his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never underestimate a desperate president,'' said Rep. Gerald
Solomon (R-N.Y.), the retiring chairman of the House Rules
Committee. ``They're doing everything they can to avoid
impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Solomon, a former Marine, said the American people should be
``outraged'' and charged that Clinton launched the attack for
``political reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly rather suspicious timing,'' said Rep. Tillie
Fowler (R-Fla.), of the House GOP leadership team. ``I think the
president is shameless in what he would do to stay in office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot support this military action in the Persian Gulf at
this time, ``said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.).
``Both the timing and the policy are in question.''
</P>
<P>
   The skepticism was extraordinary in that such missions almost
always receive bipartisan backing, at least while the attack is
actually taking place.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP critics took care to declare their support for American
military forces. Speaker-designate Bob Livingston (R-La.) said the
House would convene today to pass a resolution of bipartisan
backing of the troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``As to the matter of timing, we just would leave that to the
best judgment of the American people,'' said Livingston. ``We
support the troops.''
</P>
<P>
   While conceding that he doesn't ``blame anyone for being a
little cynical'' about the timing, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) said,
``Regardless of any cynicism anybody has, we ought to get behind
the president at this particular time.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, a former Republican senator from Maine, was questioned at
a Pentagon briefing before his trip to Capitol Hill about the
suspicions of his former colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that every member of Congress and every member of this
country will have to make his or her own judgment based upon the
facts,'' he said. ``I am prepared to place 30 years of public
service on the line to say the only factor that was important in
this decision is what is in the American people's best interest.
There were no other factors.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic congressional leaders defended the mission and
predicted that most members from both parties would end up
supporting the mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake about it: The American people and the American
Congress will stand behind our troops and stand behind our
president as we go into these next few days,'' said House Minority
Leader Dick Gephardt (D-Mo.).
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a time for our country to be united, even though we
are divided on other matters,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom
Daschle (D-S.D.). ``We need to stand united, Republicans and
Democrats alike, in ensuring that our troops are completely
successful in the dangerous mission that they are undertaking
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Clinton was flying back from Israel on Tuesday, ``there
was obvious concern'' aboard Air Force One that military action
would be viewed as a cynical effort to dodge impeachment, said Rep.
Alcee Hastings (D-Fla.), himself a subject of impeachment as a
federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings said the president agonized over the political
implications of his decision after they were raised by Rep. Rick
Lazio (R-N.Y.), a member of the congressional delegation who met
with Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings said he told Clinton: ``You have to do what you have to
do as if there were no impeachment. He said he felt that is what he
must do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastings, as a federal judge, was impeached by the House and
convicted by the Senate in 1989 of soliciting a bribe.
</P>
<P>
   The question of how the air strike against Iraq would be
perceived also was discussed Wednesday aboard Air Force Two as Vice
President Al Gore returned to Washington from Gov. Lawton Chiles'
funeral in Florida, said Rep. Mark Foley (R-Fla.).
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president made note that people would second-guess
this decision,'' Foley said. Gore would not comment on the timing
of the strike. Foley said, but ``merely made the comment that there
would be cynics among us.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats said the timing of the attack was awkward, but
was forced by the Iraqi leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not contrived, and it has nothing to do with
impeachment,'' said Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.). ``I think that the
reason I wanted to make this statement today is that I think
Americans need to really understand the gravity and legitimacy of
what is happening with Saddam Hussein,'' Iraq's president.
</P>
<P>
   And some Republicans said the bombing is long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam Hussein has thwarted the will of the international
community for far too long,'' said Sen. Sam Brownback (R-Kan.).
``The U.S. must have the will to bring this to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   The military action was an unexpected event in a long day of
anticipation as House members returned from recess and thought they
would be debating, and possibly voting, on impeachment of the
president.

 &HT;    Baghdad bombs a `surreal' event for those in impeachment
trenches
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As House Republicans crowded into a windowless room
in the basement of the U.S. Capitol, David Schippers sat quietly
underneath a potted fern just outside the door.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders had called the chief investigative counsel of
the House Judiciary Committee to brief members about the
impeachment inquiry of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But just minutes before the meeting started, bombs started
falling in Iraq at the request of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, impeachment went to the back burner behind bombs and
Schippers was ordered outside with the rest of staff.
</P>
<P>
   So here he sat, legs dangling from his perch like a 10-year-old
boy's, waiting for the lawmakers inside to make a decision: would
they green-light the vote on impeachment scheduled for today or
would they postpone in light of the air raids on Iraq?
</P>
<P>
   The salty Chicagoan, known for his penchant for poetry and love
of the Democratic Party, appeared weary of the constant news coming
through he hallways of the Capitol. Weary of trying to read the
political tea leaves, longing for the black and white of the court
room.
</P>
<P>
   And now this. Another delay.
</P>
<P>
   This time over bombs. ``Surreal would be a good word to express
how I feel,'' Schippers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What comes to mind as I sit here? I wish I was in Chicago,''
said Schippers. ``I wish I was home.''
</P>
<P>
   Every year, his 10 children and 25 grandchildren gather at his
home just outside Chicago to celebrate the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   It is Schippers' tradition to gather the children by his feet
and regale them with stories.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the vote on impeachment has been indefinitely delayed,
it is questionable whether he will make it home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to tell them that there might not be a Christmas,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Given all of the political machinations of the four-month
impeachment inquiry, Schippers has less than a stellar appetitie
for the wily ways of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He's enjoyed the people, but has little respect for the
political process _ the way loyalty is a rare commodity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been out here long enough that nothing surprises me,'' he
said. But about the bombs flying on the eve of the impeachment
vote? ``I wouldn't believe this if it were fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Other members had the same disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   Many mentioned the same surreal feeling that Schippers had as
they filed into the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   They had all been called back to vote on impeachment but they
suddenly found themselves coping with combat with Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Many questioned the timing of the attack, suspecting that
Clinton bombed Iraq in a desperate effort to save his political
life.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gerald B.H. Solomon (R-N.Y.) is one who believes that.
</P>
<P>
   Even after a briefing by Secretary of Defense William Cohen in
the House chambers, Solomon said he ``didn't feel any better about
the bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   As he rushed to leave the Capitol, Solomon noted that the
information Clinton used to make his decision to bomb Iraq was
delivered to Congress and the White House back in September by a
former U.N. inspector.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why didn't we bomb 90 days ago, 60 days ago, 30 days ago?''
Asked a visibly upset Solomon. ``They're trying to divert
attention, no one can convince me otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   During the session with Cohen, House Majority Whip Tom Delay
(R-Texas) asked about the timing, expressing disbelief that it was
merely coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   Following the session, Cohen said he had a productive exchange
with doubting members. Every question was answered.
</P>
<P>
   At the close of the meeting, Speaker-designate Rep. Bob
Livingston walked out of the Capitol with a solemn face.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the session with Cohen had changed minds among
Republicans about the timing of the bombing, Livingston looked out
from the gaggle of aides surrounding him and said quietly, ``These
are tough times.''

IRAQI ATTACK LARGEST SINCE THE GULF WAR

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senior Clinton administration officials say that
the air strikes ordered Wednesday against Iraq, the largest and
most punishing since the 1991 Gulf War, will likely leave the
United States with little ability to closely monitor Iraq's
capability to develop chemical, biological and nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The attack, they said, will almost certainly mean the end of the
7-year-old U.N. weapons inspection program in Iraq, and will force
the United States to maintain a large military presence in the gulf
region for at least several more years.
</P>
<P>
   While senior U.S. officials insisted that the air strikes would
significantly hamper Iraq's programs to make poison gas and nuclear
weapons, they readily acknowledged that the weapons programs would
continue and perhaps accelerate after the bombing ends.
</P>
<P>
   Without the U.N. inspection program, they said, the Clinton
administration would have only a limited ability to determine
whether Iraq is manufacturing and stockpiling weapons of mass
destruction _ and to prevent Iraq from threatening its neighbors
with poison gas.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, they said, will need to leave a large
military force in the region for the foreseeable future at a cost
to taxpayers of billions of dollars a year, ready to strike
whenever U.S. intelligence agencies develop evidence from aerial
surveillance to show that the Iraqis are close to deploying
chemical, biological or nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very unpalatable scenario for the U.S.,'' said a
Pentagon official. ``We can keep track of some of what's going on
the ground with satellites and surveillance planes. But that's not
the same as having inspectors on the ground, poking around or at
least trying to poke around Iraqi installations.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Wednesday night, President Clinton warned
ominously that ``without a strong inspection system, Iraq would be
free to retain and begin to rebuild its chemical, biological and
nuclear weapons programs in months _ not years.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials concede that the only other tools left to the United
States in containing Iraq are economic sanctions, which the Clinton
administration has struggled to keep in place over the opposition
of Russia, France and other nations, and support for the ragtag
Iraqi opposition movement, which has yet to prove that it can mount
a serious challenge to the authority of President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has already acknowledged that a military strike like the
one launched Wednesday would sound the death knell for the weapons
inspections that have been carried out in Iraq by the U.N. Special
Commission, or UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
   When he called off air strikes on Iraq last month, Clinton said
then that he had made the decision in part because he believed such
an attack ``would mean the end of UNSCOM'' and ``we would then have
no oversight, no insight, no involvement in what is going on in
Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, with air strikes against Iraq underway, senior
administration officials said they believed and feared that the
Unscom inspection program was dead, as the president had predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``After this, it's hard to imagine that Saddam will ever allow
the inspectors back in,'' said one U.S. official. ``So what is our
policy? What do we do in a post-UNSCOM world? I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   While refusing to provide full details on the weapons fired
against Iraq and the number of U.S. warplanes and ships that joined
in the mission, administration officials said Wednesday's attack
was several times larger than any strike launched against Iraq
since the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ``The others were pinpricks by comparison,'' one official said.
`'It's smaller than the war but much bigger than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   In June 1993, the United States fired 23 cruise missiles at
Iraqi intelligence headquarters in Baghdad in retaliation for an
alleged plot to assassinate former President Bush. In September
1996, 27 cruise missiles were launched against military targets in
southern Iraq in retaliation for the movement of Iraqi troops
against Kurds in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said that they have had target lists for the
attack ready since last month, when the United States initially
planned to launch air strikes against Iraq over its refusal to
allow unfettered weapons inspections by UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
   The target list, they said, included a variety of factories,
warehouses and military compounds identified by the U.N. inspectors
as potential sites for the manufacture or stockpiling of chemical
and biological weapons, some of them in Baghdad or on the outskirts
of the Iraqi capital.
</P>
<P>
   A senior adminstration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that the United States hoped in this evening's
missile attacks to destroy several buildings and other structures
across Iraq identified by Unscom and U.S. intelligence agencies as
part of the Iraqi program to develop weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the missile attacks are a success and all of the
buildings are destroyed, he noted, the Iraqi government will still
employ scores of scientists with an expertise in the ability to
manufacture chemical or biological weapons. ``And it's not as if
you need a sophisticiated factory to make poison gas,'' he added.
``For some of these weapons, all you need is a bathtub and a few
hours' time.''

 WASHINGTON: he can.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buying time might be the president's best hope, if only a very
slim one. Pro-impeachment sentiment has reached a peak this week,
but it could conceivably dissipate if the roll-call is
significantly postponed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is not the first president since the end of World War II
to have his foreign policy motives questioned. Ronald Reagan was
accused by a few members of Congress and a few editorial writers of
staging the invasion of Grenada to mute criticism of his failure to
protect marines who were killed in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   But not since Harry Truman and the Korean War has a president
been subjected to quite the same level of questioning of motive
that Clinton was subjected to Wednesday. The fact that Lott
released his statement moments before the attack increased the
sense that he was undercutting the president.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans did, in fact, rally to the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Kolbe of Arizona was in the midst of a press conference
in Tucson lambasting Clinton for ``impeachable offenses'' when
handed a note about the air raids, and he changed course
immediately, voicing support for the attack.
</P>
<P>
   But many others, while not willing to speak as bluntly or as
publicly as Solomon and Lott, gave voice privately to deep
suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton tried his best to allay them, quoting U.S. military
planners as saying that waiting would give Saddam time to conceal
and protect elements of his suspected nuclear and chemical
arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, British Prime Minister Tony Blair proved himself a
friend in need. By agreeing to join in the attacks, and by
defending his decision in an eloquent statement carried on
international television, Blair gave Clinton political cover
against his partisan critics. That was especially welcome in view
of the opposition voiced by China, Russia and France.
</P>
<P>
   The president did all he could to make Wednesday night's
television appearance look like business as usual _ a calm, serious
report about a threat to the national interest, with only a quick,
glancing reference to his own troubles. But he delivered it in a
setting he has recently avoided, the Oval Office, near which many
of his fateful meetings with Monica S. Lewinsky took place.
