 &HT;    Braves stop McGwire as streak hits 8
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The best pennant race met the great home run chase
as the Braves and Mark McGwire converged Friday night at Busch
Stadium to open a three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the sellout crowd of 46,723, this one had a
lot more of a Braves feel to it. They outlasted the Cardinals 2-1
as Bret Boone drove in Brian Jordan with the winning run in the top
of the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   With that stroke, the Braves extended their season-high winning
streak to eight games and are a win shy of matching their best
winning streak of last season. Greg Myers started the rally with a
single to right off Juan Acevedo, Gerald Williams prolonged it with
an infield hit and Boone sealed the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the point now where we just need wins,'' Boone said.
``This team is starting to get excited about things. We're in a
great pennant race. The last two, three weeks, I've been feeling
good at the plate, started swinging the bat the way I should be
swinging.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Acevedo) came right at me with all fastballs. I got a pitch
out away, didn't try to do too much. It's nice when you can be a
big part of a win. ''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves kept McGwire stuck on 51 homers as he went 1-for-4
with a single and three strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   With Greg Maddux missing his first start in more than two years
because of a chipped bone in his wrist, Terry Mulholland filled in
valiantly. He limited the Cardinals to a run over six innings, but
it was Russ Springer who got the win after working a perfect
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 3-1 in my starts and I'll take that,'' Mulholland said.
``Things are snowballing a little bit. Confidence is really up.
It's tough to beat a team when they're feeling that good
mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulholland struck out a season-high seven and the bullpen added
seven as Mike Remlinger, Springer and John Rocker struck out seven
of the nine batters they faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greg (Myers) did a great job calling the game,'' Mulholland
said. ``He worked all my stuff, making really good pitch selection
in key situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulholland dodged eight singles and stranded seven while holding
a 1-1 tie through four. He retired the heart of the Cardinal order
with two runners on in the first inning and did some nifty work
with the bases loaded in the third, holding the Cardinals to a run
on Fernando Tatis' liner.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett Stephenson, who spent most of the season in Class AAA,
was making his fifth start ever for the Cardinals and sixth against
the Braves, dating to his days with the Phillies.

 &HT;    Dolphins' deep threat: They will throw long
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ You can call it the bomb. Or the deep pass. Or the
``go'' pattern.
</P>
<P>
   In NFL meeting rooms, it often is called the ``9-route,'' a
reference to its place on the passing tree. The 0-route is a hitch.
The 1-route is a quick out. And so on, until you get to last stop
on the football map, the 9-route.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my professional opinion, it's the lowest percentage route
in the game,'' Dolphins receivers coach Robert Ford said. ``If you
throw eight of them and get two of them, you're actually beating
the odds.''
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, in recent years the Dolphins rarely tried to beat
those odds. The 9-route became the nein-route.
</P>
<P>
   And for that matter, the 7-route (a post pattern) and 8-route (a
corner pattern) weren't getting much use either.
</P>
<P>
   Last season the Dolphins had only three completions for more
than 50 yards, the lowest amount in the AFC.
</P>
<P>
   And it was for lack of trying.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Johnson admitted as much at the start of training camp
when he said, ``One thing we're trying to emphasize is our deep
passing game. We were last in the league last year with the number
of deep passes attempted. We are trying to stress that. We're
charting it and looking at a lot of different things.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Johnson admitted as much when he spent the off-season
searching for a deep threat and ended up taking a chance on
free-agent receiver Tony Martin, who was released by Atlanta
because of the impending federal money-laundering trial.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Dolphins first let go of Martin _ trading him to
San Diego for a fourth-round pick in 1994 _ Martin has been one of
the NFL's top deep threats. In his first season in San Diego, he
became the seventh player in NFL history to catch a 99-yard
touchdown pass.
</P>
<P>
   Last season he averaged 17.9 yards a catch, fourth-best among
NFL players with at least 50 receptions.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the Dolphins got the news that Martin will be in
uniform this season. He was found innocent of all five charges he
faced.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether Martin, who expects to be on the
field for most of tonight's exhibition game against Detroit, will
be the playmaker the Dolphins hope he is. Or whether Yatil Green,
the 1997 first-round pick who has yet to play a regular-season
down, will stay healthy. Or whether Lamar Thomas, who has a torn
labrum in his left shoulder, will be effective.
</P>
<P>
   But this much is certain: Johnson seems intent on making the
deep pass more a part of the offense in '99.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask the Dolphins' defensive backs.
</P>
<P>
   This year's training camp has been filled with more deep passing
drills, which means more running for the receivers and defensive
backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see more deep balls this camp,'' cornerback Sam Madison
said. ``And you see more being caught. I'm not saying they're
beating us up and down the field. We're right on them, but they
come down with the big play. ... Now we have guys that can stretch
the defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the receivers love the idea of going deep, they haven't
exactly been thrilled with the way it has changed training camp.
They have spent many an hour in the August heat, running up and
down the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard on them, especially when we go two-minute offense,''
Ford said. ``They look at me like I'm nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   That especially was clear after one practice in San Diego last
week. Thomas got hurt running a deep route. And the receivers who
were healthy were weary.
</P>
<P>
   As O.J. McDuffie trudged down the sideline after trying to chase
down one deep pass, he muttered: ``It's like a track meet out
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Although four receivers will miss tonight's game _ Thomas,
Oronde Gadsden (back), Nate Jacquet (toe) and McDuffie (thumb) _
Dolphins coaches don't buy the idea that the rash of injuries can
be traced to the practices.
</P>
<P>
   And they also believe that when the season opens Sept. 13 in
Denver, they will be ready to test Dan Marino's arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not just because of Tony,'' Johnson said. ``Oronde Gadsden is
as good as we have with the deep pass. Obviously, Yatil is one of
the better players we have with the deep pass. Larry Shannon maybe
gets open better than anybody, including Tony. ... In the San Diego
game we had an opportunity for four or five big plays if we just
make the catch. I think we're on schedule to make some of those
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   That schedule got a boost Friday when Martin showed up for his
first post-verdict practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been an unusual training camp for the receivers with
the injuries and having all this uncertainty,'' Ford said. ``And
it's all behind us now. The only way can go now is up.''
</P>
<P>
   Up and, they hope, deep.

DORIS R. SCHWARTZ, A NURSE WHO ADVANCED GERIATRIC CARE, DIES AT
84  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Mich.)   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Doris R. Schwartz, a nurse who did some of the earliest research
on geriatric nursing care and whose findings led to improvements in
health care for the elderly, died on Sunday at her home in Gwynedd,
Pa.
</P>
<P>
   A former resident of Manhattan, Ms. Schwartz was 84 and had
moved to the Foulkeways Continuing Care Community in Gwynedd after
a stroke in 1980. She retired that year from Cornell University-New
York Hospital School of Nursing, where she was a professor for many
years.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schwartz's familiarity with the debilities of old age
stemmed from her years as an Army nurse in World War II, when she
tended to wounded soldiers with similar afflictions. Her work
continued even after she began to use a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   After moving to the retirement center, she initiated research by
the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing into the use of
physical restraints on patients in nursing homes and hospitals; her
work led to changes in restraint procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schwartz wrote an autobiography, ``My Fifty Years in
Nursing: Give Us to Go Blithely'' (Springer; 2d ed., 1995), which
remains in print.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks before her death, she had been working on a book
about the 55 people who most influenced her career.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Schwartz was born in Brooklyn and graduated from the
Central Methodist Hospital School of Nursing there in 1942. She
enlisted in the Army Nurse Corps and served in the Pacific and,
after the war, at a military rehabilitation center in Battle Creek,
Mich., rising to the rank of captain.
</P>
<P>
   She then worked as a public health nurse in the Visiting Nurse
Service with babies and new mothers in the Red Hook section of
Brooklyn into the 1950s. She became an adviser to the Teaching
Nursing Home Program of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   She was a member of the Institute of Medicine at the National
Academy of Science and co-director of two groundbreaking programs
to train geriatric and family nurse practitioners at Cornell
University-New York Hospital. There she taught staff members and
worked with victims of strokes and dementia.
</P>
<P>
   A Doris Schwartz Chair of Gerontological Nursing was established
at the University of Pennsylvania, and a Doris Schwartz Research
Award, honoring a nurse for outstanding research in aging, is given
by the Hartford Foundation Institute of Geriatric Nursing at New
York University.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schwartz leaves no immediate survivors.

MORTON'S HEALTH IS KEY FOR USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If one player is considered invaluable to the USC
football team, it has to be quarterback Carson Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the unthinkable happened and the sophomore (begin
ital)wunderkind(end ital) got injured, USC would not be completely
devastated. Backup quarterback Mike Van Raaphorst has started 10
games while senior John Fox has nine career starts.
</P>
<P>
   Tailback is another situation. If senior Chad Morton gets
injured, the Trojans are in trouble. They only have an
inexperienced cast of replacements behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Below Morton on the depth chart are redshirt freshman Sultan
McCullough (0 career carries), sophomore Frank Strong (37 carries,
three fumbles) and senior Jabari Jackson (13 carries). There is
also sophomore Malaefou MacKenzie, who is still recovering from
knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer is clearly USC's most valuable player, but the most
irreplaceable Trojan is Morton.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a comforting predicament, considering Morton has missed
games each of the past three seasons because of injuries.
Basically, Morton can't afford to get injured this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's critical for us,'' Palmer said. ``Chad is our No. 1 guy.
He's our leader. Hopefully, he's not going to get dinged up.''
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis here is on ``hopefully.'' Morton missed two games
last season with a bruised back, saw limited playing time in
several other games and fell 15 yards short of reaching the magical
1,000-yard figure.
</P>
<P>
   Sensitive to criticism about his ability to remain injury-free,
Morton is trying harder than ever to stay on the field this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in practice, if I get a nick it's hard to come out,''
Morton said. ``People will say, `OK, he's hurt again.' If I'm hurt,
I'm going to have to play with it. I don't even like coming out of
practice anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Morton missed most of USC's first scrimmage with a tender
hamstring but returned Tuesday and gained 25 yards in six carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have gone more,'' Morton said after the scrimmage. ``I
feel great right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, that view was not shared by USC coach Paul
Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Chad Morton is behind where he was a year ago,''
Hackett said. ``He's tired. He's not running with the same zip.''
</P>
<P>
   These comments might be part psychological ploy, just to make
sure Morton plays through any minor aches and pains and realizes he
is indispensable.
</P>
<P>
   Because in the next breath, Hackett defended his star tailback
for being fatigued during training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are exhausted this time of year. I think he extended
himself more this year in the role that he's in,'' Hackett said.
``This year, he is the man. He's got to get himself rested. He
will.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no other choice and Morton knows it. This is his senior
season, and it still angers him that he finished with 985 yards
rushing last year.
</P>
<P>
   Morton entered the Sun Bowl needing just 33 yards to gain 1,000.
He ended up with 18 yards in 11 carries against Texas Christian
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very disappointing. It hurt really bad,'' Morton said.
``A lot of people came up to me and said, `You're going to get it
this game.' Does it make me less of a back because I didn't get 15
yards?''
</P>
<P>
   Although Morton desperately wants to be USC's first back to gain
1,000 yards since 1995, he has tried to alter his goals this
season. If he can just stay healthy, he figures there is no way he
will be denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I go 13 games healthy, I'm going to break 1,000 yards,''
Morton said. ``That's my only goal this year, to play in every
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, almost his only goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, I just want to go to a good bowl game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, in addition to his regular workouts at USC, he
spent his mornings working out with his brother, Detroit Lions wide
receiver Johnnie Morton.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to running, he learned pass routes from his brother,
because he will occasionally line up at wide receiver for the
Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   USC would like to get Morton into the open field without taking
so many hits. It's one way for him to avoid, you guessed it,
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm going to be a little more conscious of the
durability issue because I have grown to admire his ability in
space,'' Hackett said. ``I think he will be able to do more things
than just get in the I-formation and run the ball.''

FATHER MARIO ZICARELLI, BACKER OF SECULAR EDUCATION, DIES AT 72  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Italy)   By RICHARD SEVERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. Mario Zicarelli, a Roman Catholic priest whose
parishioners protested his transfer out of the Bronx in 1972 after
he publicly supported secular education, died Aug. 25 in a hospital
in Nyack, N.Y. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications of a stroke. He had most recently
been pastor of St. Mary's Church in Haverstraw, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Zicarelli had been an associate pastor of Our Lady of Mount
Carmel Church in the Belmont section of the Bronx for the 14 years
when he was ordered to Poughkeepsie, N.Y., to become pastor of a
church with the same name, and his Bronx parishioners held a large
and vociferous rally to protest his transfer. Zicarelli, who was
chairman of the local school board, was outspoken in favoring
public rather than parochial schools and said that spending
taxpayer dollars for parochial schools violated the constitutional
principle of separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   The Archdiocese of New York declined to comment on the reasons
for the transfer, which Zicarelli had resisted.
</P>
<P>
   In Poughkeepsie, he continued to speak out on education, warning
parishioners from the pulpit not to regard parochial schools as a
refuge from integration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't rule out the possibility of saying controversial
things in politics and religion,'' he said later. ``I think that is
the great gift God gave all free souls.''
</P>
<P>
   He also took issue with the church on family planning and
abortion. ``I don't think the Catholic Church has any business
meddling in sex,'' he said in 1974. When Catholics asked him for
advice on sexual matters, he urged them to consult their
consciences and make up their own minds.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, he came to the defense of some Vietnamese refugees who,
he said, were being exploited by an employer. ``First we level
their country and then we do this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Zicarelli was born in Rimini, Italy, the son of Alfredo
and Antonia Nardi Zicarelli. He was educated at public schools in
Italy and at Public School 147 in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   After his graduation from Xavier High School, he attended
Cathedral College and St. Joseph's Seminary and was ordained in
1947, then studied theology at the University of San Anselmo in
Rome and Italian literature at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   He served many parishes, including some in Long Island,
Manhattan and Yonkers. In his final post, at St. Mary's, he was
credited with rebuilding the church, attracting new members and
putting the small parish on a sound financial footing.
</P>
<P>
   He had no immediate survivors.

SPORTS COLUMN: ERVING TOOK THE EASY WAY OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ADDS Stevenson's comments in in 4th graf) (rk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the ninth day of Wimbledon, Alexandra Stevenson sat behind a
dais, as isolated as a new kid in the cafeteria. And people stared.
Around the world, they inspected her features as closely as fine
print. Was there a resemblance? Was she Dr. J's love child?
</P>
<P>
   It's hard enough to be 18 and deal with the normal insecurities
and heartbreaks brought on by crushes who never call. But on this
day, in front of everyone, her most intimate rejection might as
well have been broadcast over the loudspeakers of home room.
</P>
<P>
   This was painfully awkward. This was the day a newspaper report
identified Julius Erving as her father, a story accompanied with
his adamant denial of parentage. How do you think she felt, when
she knew the truth?
</P>
<P>
   Declining to comment on the report, and Erving's denial,
Stevenson seemed to shrug off the rejection, as if to say,
Whatever. A typical teen-ager response, but the subject appears to
cut deeper than she is prepared to admit. She has bristled when
Erving has been mentioned as her ``dad,'' and told USA Today this
week ``a father is somebody who nurtures and cares for you. He's
someone who changes your diapers. He didn't do that.'' &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Erving's reaction was to lie. He did it without regard for the
impact it might have on the vulnerable psyche of an 18-year-old
girl. For some, it's comfortable to explain away the initial
response of Erving as a panic attack. But for weeks, Erving was
aware of the article the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel was preparing
to run. He could have devised a more compassionate response. Only
when the evidence was undeniable did Erving release a statement and
admit the truth.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of behavior was only a continuation of the 18 years
Erving spent as the detached father of Alexandra. He eventually put
out a statement acknowledging he was her father, put the onus on
Alexandra to contact him, and removed himself from the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Erving has said nothing since, and did not return phone calls
Friday seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   When the U.S. Open begins on Monday, he can hide in his
executive digs, tucked away in the Orlando Magic complex while his
daughter continues to deal with the fallout of a bombshell. When
the frenzy begins at Flushing, Erving can remain the absentee
father while Alexandra's mother, Samantha, shuttles her daughter to
the National Tennis Center.
</P>
<P>
   As a visible fixture on the grounds, Samantha Stevenson will
continue to be blistered for her unethical behavior as a female
sportswriter who slept with an athlete, and ridiculed for becoming
mayor in the community of dysfunctional tennis parents. Yes,
Samantha's plan to raise Alexandra as a tennis phenom seems part of
some genetically engineered fairy tale. Yes, Samantha should be
condemned for becoming the caricature of a female sportswriter on
the prowl.
</P>
<P>
   But it's so simple to trash her. After all, she is one of us.
One of the media. For once, we actually know the newsmaker in a
controversy because she has been in the cubicle next to us. So
almost every item of office gossip about Samantha has found its way
into publication over the last month, from rumors about the sexual
innuendo in her line of questioning to the way she buttoned her
blouse. It's the same mentality defense lawyers have used in rape
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Samantha was asking for this. Somehow, no one wants to
blame Erving for cheating on his wife. Sometimes, icons like Erving
just get a free pass on responsibility. Who questions Michael
Jordan's social consciousness? Does it bother anyone that Larry
Bird doesn't reach out to his estranged daughter?
</P>
<P>
   There's always an excuse for immunity. In Erving's case, well,
hey, at least he provided child support through a lawyer. But that
arrangement only makes Erving a caretaker of his own distinguished
and lucrative image. It's an image that was worth a $1 million
salary when the Orlando Magic needed a public relations makeover
and hired the Hall of Fame player as an executive in 1997, a move
made to add a touch of class on the organization.
</P>
<P>
   But what is the criteria for class these days? As a polished
symbol of all that was graceful and dignified in the game, Erving
has loudly decried the selfish acts of Gen-X players who put
themselves above the NBA, players exactly like Steve Francis. The
21-year old out of Maryland pouted when he found himself banished
to the outpost of Vancouver on draft day and forced the Grizzlies
to trade him Friday.
</P>
<P>
   This act of selfishness is the kind of example Erving might have
used when he once questioned the credibility that today's players
have with the public. What credibility does Erving have now?
</P>
<P>
   In the moment of truth, he denied his own daughter, a pattern
Erving established long ago. Plastered with a bold name tag at age
8, Alexandra approached Erving at a basketball clinic and looked
into the oval eyes shaped like her own.
</P>
<P>
   He said nothing, and she walked away. Rejection can be cruel,
but it's easiest for Erving this way.

GALAXY'S PENA A FAVORITE TARGET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA -- Danny Pena might not be the most famous player in
Major League Soccer, but you'll know when he's on the field.
</P>
<P>
   He's one of the league's favorite targets, accumulating more
penalty points (36) than anyone while sharing the league lead in
cautions (8) with New England's Ivan McKinley. He's missed two
games this season because of yellow-card accumulation and has been
kicked out twice in his three-year tenure.
</P>
<P>
   When he joined the Galaxy in 1996, his rough tackles quickly
earned him the reputation as one of the dirtiest players in the
league, yet Pena has never seriously injured anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never understand that (reputation),'' said Pena,
preparing for the Galaxy's Western Conference match at Dallas this
evening. ``I've never been in a situation where I've severely hurt
someone, thrown an elbow at somebody or head-butted somebody. But
if you go by the league and disciplinary committee, they will say
I'm a player to watch out for. It's just crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   His demeanor may be the most misleading.
</P>
<P>
   During practice he's painfully vocal, screaming obscenities at
fellow players for making mistakes while cursing himself if he does
the same.
</P>
<P>
   During matches he's as intense as they come, causing attacking
midfielders to wince when Pena comes full-speed their way.
</P>
<P>
   But he's also one of Los Angeles' most important pieces, a
prized defensive midfield specialist who rarely loses 50-50 balls
and closes space as well as anyone.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, he's just a rare package of determination and skill.
</P>
<P>
   ``That quality comes from being a great competitor,'' said
Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid. ``His number one goal is to compete and
win games and he really doesn't care if he offends anyone. He's an
older player who has been through wars and you can count on him in
the big games.
</P>
<P>
   ``And as far as players, they all have Danny's respect. When you
have his kind of dedication and tenacity, you earn that respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy goalkeeper Kevin Hartman explained how tough it is for
newcomers adjusting to Pena's personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a new player to the Galaxy and you take Danny Pena
seriously, he can scare you,'' said Hartman. ``But he just has a
unique sense about him. Whenever you see him get really mad, you
kind of take it with a grain of salt because he takes the game
very, very seriously. If he makes a mistake, he's the first to
raise his hand and say, `I messed up.' And he expects you to do the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his aggressive play and sometimes volatile nature, Pena
is loved and respected by his teammates and those who know him
personally.
</P>
<P>
   At 31, he's not a rah-rah guy who seeks personal gratification.
In 1997 he turned down an invitation from then-coach Steve Sampson
to join the U.S. National Team in preparation for the 1998 World
Cup in France.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy was in a playoff drive at the time and Pena didn't
want to leave the Galaxy for a substitute role on the U.S. team.
More importantly, Pena wasn't going to show up at the last minute
after the national team had overlooked him his entire career.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a big week with the Galaxy but people need to
understand I've been playing in America for 12 years as a
professional. I just didn't fall out of a tree,'' Pena said of his
1997 decision. ``I was invited at the last second. If I had been
invited to camp from day one (to prepare for that game) like the
other players, it may have been a different story.''
</P>
<P>
   Pena claims he was invited as a substitute, but after he turned
down Sampson's invitation, he was upset to learn later that Sampson
said he would have been a starter in the friendly against Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was completely uncalled for, for him (Sampson) to say,''
said Pena. ``He never spoke to me. He never took two minutes of his
time to call and explain why he wanted to bring me in. He had his
secretary call me. I told her, `Listen, I want you to thank him,
I'm grateful for the opportunity but now is not the best time for
me to come.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Pena admits that part of the reason he may not have been invited
to the national team sooner is because of his vocal demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   It's a reputation that carried over to the MLS when he joined
the league in 1997. And in Pena's mind, MLS has singled him out
because of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been completely and unfairly treated by this league,''
says Pena, who earned most of his yellow cards this season for
dissent. ``When I came into this league I had a reputation during
my days in other outdoor professional leagues I played in as well
as my days in indoor soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of my problems have been with referees and being very
vocal; that's where I get my reputation. But I've never been a
player looked at as a dirty player or a player who hurts players.''

   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Carrying a potential to strengthen
significantly, Hurricane Dennis moved toward the Southeast coast
Friday as residents from Florida to North Carolina prepared and
simply waited.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service issued a hurricane watch for the
east coast of Florida, from Sebastian Inlet northward to Fernandina
Beach, and warned residents from central Florida through North
Carolina to ``closely monitor the progress'' of the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday night, the hurricane was 290 miles southeast of Cape
Canaveral, Fla., and 40 miles east-northeast of Harbour Island in
the Bahamas, The Associated Press reported. With winds of 80 mph,
the storm was moving west-northwest at 7 mph, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Predictions Friday afternoon said the storm might travel along
the Florida coast and either turn inland or gather force and hit
land anywhere from Georgia to North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane Center in
Miami, said, ``We think it does have the potential to intensify and
perhaps even become a major hurricane before landfall.''
</P>
<P>
   For that to happen, the storm would have to stay over the water
and not touch the Florida coast as it heads north, Jarrell said,
adding, ``My best guess is that it probably won't come ashore until
it gets up around either Georgia or South Carolina, and South
Carolina is the most likely.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not good news in this city, which was hit hard in
September 1989 by Hurricane Hugo, a Category 4 hurricane that
killed 504 people in the Caribbean and the Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Stich, chief of the Fire and Rescue Department on
Sullivan's Island, a barrier island near Charleston, said: ``During
Hugo, we were wiped out. Much of the island had to be rebuilt. We
learned a lot from that, and I think a lot of people here don't
want to go through anything like that again.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jim Hodges of South Carolina ordered 1,000 National Guard
troops and 500 state troopers to prepare for storm duty Friday. In
Georgia and North Carolina, emergency planners were also on alert.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Georgia and the Carolinas said decisions about
possible evacuations would not be made until Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now it's pretty much a waiting game,'' said Pamela
Swanson, a spokeswoman for the Georgia Emergency Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hegele of the North Carolina Division of Emergency
Management said; ``When and if the storm decides to come in, we'll
be ready for it. We're concerned about the whole coast. The storm
can swing 100 miles either way on impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, in Daytona Beach, Fla., workers cleared the beach
of life guard towers and trash cans as surfers in brightly colored
shorts rode eight-foot waves. ``It's absolutely surfer heaven,''
said Joe Wooden, the beach chief for Volusia County.
</P>
<P>
   But here along the South Carolina coast, which has been
evacuated three times in the last few years since Hurricane Hugo _
for Hurricanes Fran and Bertha in 1996 and Hurricane Bonnie last
year _ the mood was more serious.
</P>
<P>
   At Bert's Bar on Sullivan's Island here, Brooke Hawkins, a
29-year-old bartender, served patrons this afternoon as the weather
channel played in the background. Talk of neighbors who had already
begun boarding up their homes mixed with discussions of what
everyone planned to do.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hawkins remembered Hurricane Hugo well, and took the threats
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   She said she planned to leave on Saturday if it looked as if the
hurricane was coming this way. ``I live one block from the beach,
and the biggest danger for me is flooding,'' she said. ``I'm trying
to figure out where to put my furniture _ up on cinder blocks, or
my upstairs neighbor said I could put it up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Tate, 42, a real estate agent on Sullivan's Island, moved
here after Hurricane Hugo and said she did not plan to board up her
house, but did plan to leave on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've boarded up the windows and moved all the furniture up
against the wall a few times before, and nothing, nothing,
nothing,'' Ms. Tate said. ``So I'm not going to do it this time. I
don't have the energy, and I have insurance. I can't do anything
about the hurricane coming, so I'm not going to worry about it.''

RANGERS, HELLING MASTER BLUE JAYS
</HEADLINE>
 JAYSG-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Right-hander Rick Helling put himself on target to
start Game 1 of the 1999 Division Series provided the Rangers
secure their near-certain playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   Helling's complete-game effort in the Rangers' 8-2 victory last
night against the Toronto Blue Jays only strengthened his position.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw like a No. 1 starter,'' manager Johnny Oates said.
``He threw breaking pitches from behind. He was in total command,
and he showed it. Body language says a lot, and I didn't need an
interpreter to know what I was seeing out there. I'm excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates identified his potential postseason rotation indirectly
yesterday afternoon by proclaiming that Helling and right-handers
Aaron Sele and Esteban Loaiza _ the unit's most effective members _
will pitch every fifth day.
</P>
<P>
   Helling, Sele and Loaiza have combined for 18 victories through
19 decisions since the All-Star break, and the Rangers improved to
22-3 in games started by those three during that period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's a confidence booster to have the manager want
you to pitch every five days,'' said Helling, who surrendered only
six hits and two walks during his 131-pitch appearance. ``It makes
you feel confident to know that he wants you out on the mound. I'll
pitch whenever he wants me to pitch. I'll pitch on three days rest.
I'll pitch on six days rest. It doesn't matter to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Oates' plans could be that Helling _ the rotation's most
effective and consistent performer _ starts Game 1 of the Division
Series. Helling won for the 11th time through 18 decisions and
improved his rotation-best earned-run average to 4.19.
</P>
<P>
   Helling pitched four innings of no-hit ball, and the Rangers did
not squander that effort, scoring five runs early. Designated
hitter Lee Stevens gave SkyDome's visitors a 2-0 lead with his
two-run, second-inning home run off right-hander Chris Carpenter
(9-8), and the Rangers' advantage grew during their next at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Right fielder Juan Gonzalez delivered a bases-loaded single that
scored second baseman Mark McLemore, and designated hitter Rafael
Palmeiro and third baseman Todd Zeile produced consecutive
sacrifice flies that scored catcher Ivan Rodriguez and left fielder
Rusty Greer.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro also led off the sixth inning with his 40th home run.
</P>
<P>
   Helling's only encounter with trouble occurred during the Blue
Jays' fifth inning. First baseman Carlos Delgado hit his 38th home
run to lead off the inning before third baseman Tony Fernandez and
catcher Darrin Fletcher reached with consecutive doubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to face three or four situations in every game
where the game could be decided,'' Helling said. ``That was
definitely one of them. That was the first time they had a chance
to break out.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling, though, responded with consecutive strikeouts of
shortstop Tony Batista and designated hitter Willie Greene before
inducing an inning-ending ground ball from second baseman Homer
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a bad pitch to Carlos and didn't get it in on him
enough, but I thought I threw a lot of good pitches that inning,''
Helling said. ``You can't let two, three or four hits in a row
bother you. Big-league hitters are going to get three or four hits
in a row sometimes. I realized I was making good pitches, and I
knew I would be fine if I kept making good pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling did, and the display included eight strikeouts. Many of
those were the product of a nasty slider.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind,'' Oates said, ``that might be as well as he's
pitched all year.''
</P>
<P>
   The target remains within Helling's sights. nn

LONGHORNS OPEN WITH A NEW RICKY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ During the summer, members of the Texas football team
were surveyed on a variety of subjects. Some were silly
(worst-dressed teammate), some serious (best leader).
</P>
<P>
   With all precincts reporting, Longhorns fans might be surprised
to learn which player received the most votes from peers as ``The
First Guy I Would Pick For My Team.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't quarterback Major Applewhite, Texas' top returning
offensive weapon. Nor was it defensive end Aaron Humphrey, the
emotional leader of an experienced defense.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it was a guy whose college career has been marked by
more head butts than headlines. A bullish blocker who touched the
ball just 18 times last season: fullback Ricky Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Those who find the election returns surprising, said Applewhite,
fail to appreciate what the Arlington High School graduate does for
the 17th-ranked Longhorns, who open the season tonight at 7:30 at
Royal-Memorial Stadium against North Carolina State.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way to really describe how much he means to us,''
said Applewhite, who ticked off a laundry list of attributes, most
of them related to dependability and dedication. ``I think he's the
most underrated player in the Big 12.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown soon might lose that title. After two years as an
afterthought in weekly game plans, he'll have a much higher profile
in the Texas offense this season. That could lead to recognition
from someone other than Texas offensive coordinator Greg Davis, who
calls Brown ``the fullback of the future'' because he is equally
adept at running, blocking and receiving.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: Brown carried the ball 10 times in 11 games last
season while serving as the lead blocker for Heisman Trophy winner
Ricky Williams. Brown might top that total tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could get 11 carries against North Carolina State,'' Davis
said. ``He could get three. It just depends on how the game
unfolds. The good thing about Ricky is, he really doesn't care.
It's very unusual for a skill-position player to be that unselfish.
He's taken to his role as well as anybody I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Brown admits, somewhat grudgingly, that he's happy his role
is about to change. Although quick to acknowledge tailbacks Hodges
Mitchell and Victor Ike as the primary ball carriers in the Texas
arsenal, Brown likes the idea of touching the ball 10 times a game
_ maybe more _ as a rusher and receiver in the Longhorns'
post-Williams attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heading into this game, the excitement is there a little
more,'' said Brown, a fifth-year senior who has logged 49 carries
in 34 games during his college career. ``I've waited a long time
for this opportunity. I'm ready to go out and surprise some
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown (6-foot, 225 pounds) might catch opponents off-guard with
his quick bursts through holes and his soft hands. But he will not
surprise teammates who watched him average 5.5 yards during his
infrequent excursions last season (10 carries, 55 yards, 1
touchdown). Among the top seven returning rushers in the Big 12,
only Nebraska tailback Correll Buckhalter averaged more yards per
carry last season (5.6) than Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Texas coach Mack Brown said the fullback's versatility makes him
indispensable. In addition to his primary role as the battering ram
for Texas' tailbacks, the Arlington native is expected to line up
in one-back sets and as a slot receiver. Brown grabbed a
career-high eight passes last season and figures he could top 30
this year. The idea, said Texas coaches, is to keep opponents
guessing about Brown's impending role on each snap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see myself getting a lot of catches. I'll probably get an
equal number of catches as runs,'' said Brown, who rushed for 1,939
yards and 31 touchdowns in leading Arlington to the Class 5A
semifinals in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky is the consummate professional. The thing he does is
exactly what he's supposed to do, and he does it on every play,''
Mack Brown said. ``You never hear from him, but he leads by
example. He's known as a great blocker, but every time you give it
to him, he makes yards. He'll be much more involved in the game
plans this season.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being named the Texas player peers would prefer
to build a team around, Brown also won in three other categories:
class act, team leader and _ in a landslide _ the ever-popular
``Doesn't Get the Recognition He Deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting tonight against North Carolina State, that could
change. Brown said he's ready to make the necessary adjustment from
a one-carry-per-game back to a vital cog in a revamped offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, when I heard a play called for me, my eyes would
get big and I'd think, `I'm getting the ball. Now, try and do your
best,''' Brown said. ``I was always surprised when I heard my name
called. I don't think there will be so many surprises this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the ones caught off-guard will be opponents who
underestimate the versatility of a fullback teammates consider a
cornerstone of Texas' revamped offense. nn

GROWING SMARTER COMMITTEE LOOKS TO COMPROMISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DENNIS WAGNER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A state panel assigned to solve rampant growth problems in
Arizona decided Friday . . .
</P>
<P>
   Well, it didn't decide anything. Instead, the Growing Smarter
Commission argued about land-use planning for two days, then
decided to try for a compromise next week.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioners have spent most of the past year conducting
statewide meetings, gathering data and writing proposals to
preserve open space, reform local zoning and encourage citizen
involvement with community planning.
</P>
<P>
   That campaign is scheduled to end Tuesday. In the meantime,
however, members don't even agree on whether they're accomplishing
anything.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Betts, a Phoenix land-use attorney, said the 15-member
committee is on the brink of proposing dramatic changes in the way
development occurs in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's truly significant stuff that is going to make a big
difference in the way we grow,'' Betts added.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Jake Flake, R-Snowflake, said there are so many
irreconcilable differences among the members that very little has
been achieved.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is debating a laundry list of recommendations
that would discourage leap-frog development, reform local planning
methods, preserve open spaces and encourage citizen participation.
Many of the measures under consideration would require amendments
to the Arizona Constitution and federal law, or approval by voters.
One example: a plan to set aside up to 10 percent of the state's
9.4 million acres of trust land for conservation purposes.
</P>
<P>
   By law, proceeds from trust land are used to help finance public
education. During Friday's session, commissioners could not agree
on how much property should be preserved, whether schools should be
compensated for the loss of revenues or who should decide which
properties should be set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gail Griffin, R-Sierra Vista, said she could not support
any plan that involves ``stealing'' money from schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're taking education dollars away for preservation; I'm
opposed to it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After hours of discussion, commission chairman Jack Pfister
ended the meeting and asked members to draw up a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Growing Smarter commissioners are gathering recommendations from
subcommittees. The work is supposed to produce a package that can
compete with the Citizens Growth Management Initiative, an
environmentalist measure that will appear on statewide ballots this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Sierra Club lobbyist Sandy Bahr condemned the Growing
Smarter options even before any had been formally adopted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no substance as far as growth management goes,'' she
said. ``If anything, they (commissioners) could be making things
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Her schtick is to downplay anything we do as insignificant,''
Betts said. ``If this process succeeds, her initiative doesn't have
any momentum.'' &QL;

GRABBING FASSERO A NO-BRAINER FOR RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Jeff Fassero may be the worst pitcher in the American
League this season, bar none.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, that takes in a lot of territory, but then, so have the
Yellowstone Park-sized home runs the one-time Mariners' ace has
surrendered this year, 31 of them to right-handed hitters alone.
</P>
<P>
   That's just a fraction, however, of the 188 hits in 139 innings
he's given up. Or the 123 runs, tops in the league, he's allowed.
Then there are those 14 losses, tying him for the most in that
category, too.
</P>
<P>
   This is downright grisly.
</P>
<P>
   Right-handed hitters are tanning the 36-year-old left-hander's
hide at a .341 clip with a slugging percentage of .631.
</P>
<P>
   There have been reports that even his dog growls at him when he
comes home after the game.
</P>
<P>
   So let me be the first to say that Rangers' general manager Doug
Melvin has pulled off yet another brilliant move.
</P>
<P>
   Seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' general manager has done it again. This is your
basic risk-free, money-back guaranteed deal. Try him out for 30
days and if you don't like what you see, send him on his merry way.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not exactly money back, but you get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   This is a no-brainer. This is the Rangers trying to catch
lightning in the Gatorade jug. This is Melvin plunking down a mere
million of Tom Hicks' bucks on the ``pass'' line and looking for 7
or 11.
</P>
<P>
   Just one time, baby, seven from heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, what's a million bucks between friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit of a roll of the dice,'' Melvin admitted
after trading a borderline minor-league prospect to Seattle for the
beleaguered Fassero. ``I can't say his numbers are good. He won't
say that either.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a relief. At least we know he's not delusional as well as
horrid.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin had a choice this week. He could have put in a waiver
claim for Baltimore right-hander Scott Erickson, who will have
about $26 million and four years left on his contract after this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Or he could opt for Fassero and the just-under $1 million left
on his contract this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a hunch the Orioles weren't really serious about trading
Erickson,'' Melvin said. ``You would have had to overwhelm them. It
would have been expensive, picking up his contract, plus giving up
a ton of players. You're not going to get him for some kid at
Savannah.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians found that out. When the Rangers passed on Erickson,
Cleveland, desperate for a starter, claimed him on waivers and
tried to work out a deal with the Orioles. Those negotiations fell
through yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Erickson has been pitching superbly (8-2) since the
All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a horse,'' said Rangers first baseman Rafael Palmeiro, a
teammate of Erickson's at Baltimore the last five years. ``Forget
his \Rfirst half\S record. He can give you seven, eight, nine
innings and keep you in the game. He'd fit in nicely here.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's Fassero and his season-to-forget who's coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``If can get the old Fassero he could be a great pickup for
us,'' Palmeiro conceded. ``A couple of years ago he was dealing.
Maybe a change of scenery, put him in a pennant race, surround him
with good players ... He was once a great pitcher. We just have to
get him back to where he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Scouting reports say the velocity on Fassero's fastball is still
88-90 miles per hour. There are no reports of injury, though he had
arthroscopic surgery to clean out some bone chips out of his elbow
in the off-season. It's his command that has seemingly deserted
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year he had a pretty good year \R13-12, 3.87 earned-run
average\S,'' Melvin pointed out. ``People keep asking, `How could
he go so bad in so short a time?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of confidence in putting him out in the bullpen
to work with John Wetteland and Larry Hardy. Maybe we can get him
turned around.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks, Melvin said, never flinched when he was called to OK the
deal. And if it had been Erickson and his $26 million?
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even bring it up,'' Melvin said, ``but he probably
would have said, `Whatever you think. If you think he can make the
difference, do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   My kind of owner.
</P>
<P>
   September will be an audition for Fassero, who is said to be
delighted with the trade. The Rangers can use a left-handed starter
or long reliever to help neutralize the strong left-handed hitting
lineups featured by Oakland, New York and Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   It could be one of the youngsters _ Matt Perisho, Corey Lee or
Doug Davis _ due up from Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Or it could be Fassero.
</P>
<P>
   He's a lightweight, million-dollar gamble having a butt-ugly
season.
</P>
<P>
   What a great deal.

WARREN UPBEAT ON INJURY STATUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING _ Cowboys running back Chris Warren says he feels better
than at any point in the 1998 season, when he missed seven games
and was hobbled in several others by a severe groin strain.
</P>
<P>
   However, he also admitted that the groin strain is still not
fully healed and will likely linger all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel better, and I don't have any limitations,'' said
Warren, who will play against the Denver Broncos tomorrow (7 p.m.
at Texas Stadium) after missing the Cowboys' preseason game last
Saturday against the New England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm used to playing pain-free without having to worry about
injuries. I just have to realize it's going to be there, and it's
something I'm going to have to play with.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren, who took a leave from training camp last week to get
therapy from a specialist in Colorado, said he has had no problems
in practice the past few days. He said he is looking forward to
tomorrow's game.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said he's all for Warren doing
whatever it took to care for his injury.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he has no problem if Warren flies to Colorado every
Monday following a Sunday game and gets treatment on Tuesday, the
players' day off, and returns to Dallas for practice Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Warren is slated to be the Cowboys' third-down running back and
the primary backup to starter Emmitt Smith. TWO-WAY THOMAS
</P>
<P>
   Just call Cowboys second-year man Robert Thomas a fullbacker.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of simply moving from linebacker to fullback, as Cowboys
coach Chan Gailey announced a few days ago, Thomas has moved back
and forth between the positions in practice this week, learning
fullback and playing linebacker in the Cowboys' first-team short
yardage defense. He will do both in tomorrow's preseason matchup
with the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas has no problems with the dual role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fullback is almost like linebacker,'' Thomas said. ``You read
and react, and they want you to be real physical. The difference is
I'm not tackling, I'm blocking.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said fullback is actually not that new of a position for
him; he played in high school and as a freshman in college at
Henderson State before concentrating on linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   He said his experience on defense will also help him at
fullback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I have an advantage almost because I know exactly
what a defensive player is thinking,'' Thomas said. ``It enables me
to get my block and get better leverage because whatever they are
thinking about doing I've been there and done that.'' QUINN TO GET
ANOTHER LOOK
</P>
<P>
   Third-string quarterback Mike Quinn will get the nod ahead of
backup Jason Garrett to start the second half tomorrow night.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys want to evaluate Quinn with better people around
him, so he will play when the second-team offense takes the field
in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn's game should go better than his previous game, when he
didn't complete a pass and was sacked three times against the
Oakland Raiders. This time, the backup offensive line should be
better, thanks to the return of Tony Hutson and Everett McIver.
</P>
<P>
   Hutson, who will play left tackle behind starter Flozell Adams,
is expected to bolster the second unit. McIver's return to the
starting lineup at right guard enables rookie second-round pick
Solomon Page to move to the second group as well. UN-LUCKY BREAK
</P>
<P>
   The rash of preseason injuries continued for the Cowboys
yesterday when rookie tight end Mike Lucky, a seventh-round draft
pick, suffered a sprained left foot in practice.
</P>
<P>
   The results of X-rays taken last night won't be known until
today.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky's situation puts the Cowboys in a bind at tight end,
considering that Hayward Clay was sidelined by a sprained knee a
couple of weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clay will have exploratory surgery Wednesday to determine the
seriousness of his injury, which is feared to be season-ending.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky was being looked upon to fill the backup tight-end spot,
behind starter David LaFleur, after Clay's injury.
</P>
<P>
   All that might have changed yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   What's certain is that his injury will result in more playing
time for rookie free agent Brian Waters of North Texas against
Denver tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have already lost three players to season-ending
injuries _ receiver James McKnight, linebacker Brandon Tolbert and
guard/center Mike Kiselak. COWBOYS SCHEME FOR BRONCOS
</P>
<P>
   Chan Gailey acknowledged that the Cowboys have done some
offensive scheming in preparation for the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, who usually shuns the idea of doing a lot of game
planning for preseason games, said the Broncos' unusual defensive
style made it a necessity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are so unusual defensively,'' Gailey said. ``We've spent
a lot more time on them than anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said he has also spent a little time mentally preparing
for the first two games of the regular season, Sept. 12 against the
Washington Redskins and Sept. 20 against the Atlanta Falcons. nn

RAILS SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON IN PENNSYLVANIA WOMAN'S DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY RIZZO  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Moments before he was sentenced to life in prison for strangling
a Pennsylvania woman, Carl Dean Rails assured the woman's parents
that their daughter did ``absolutely nothing wrong'' on the night
she died.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could tell you what really happened,'' Rails said
after turning and facing Vic and Claire Monti at his sentencing
Friday in Johnson County District Court.
</P>
<P>
   Rails made a standing offer to provide the Montis with what he
claimed to be the truth of what happened in the Lenexa hotel room
where Claire-Marie Monti was killed April 26, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Rails avoided trial and a possible death sentence by pleading
guilty on Aug. 12 to capital murder, rape and aggravated sodomy.
</P>
<P>
   He would have to live to be well over 100 before being
considered for parole under the terms of the plea agreement and
sentence imposed by District Judge Peter Ruddick.
</P>
<P>
   While saying Rails deserved the death penalty, Vic Monti said he
and his wife supported the plea agreement as a ``reasonable
alternative'' that ensured Rails would spend the rest of his life
in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Rails will never be a free man,'' he said. ``It's
important to take vicious criminals off the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Claire Monti told Rails, 36, that forfeiting his freedom for the
rest of his life was a small price to pay for taking her daughter's
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave the death sentence to Claire-Marie,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A co-defendant, Rodney Wayne Henry, previously went to trial and
was convicted of first-degree murder, rape and aggravated sodomy.
He also was sentenced to life in prison and is appealing his
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the information about Claire-Marie Monti's last hours
that has been made public came from the confession Henry gave to
police in which he claimed Rails savagely beat and strangled Monti
and defiled her body after she died.
</P>
<P>
   Henry admitted helping Rails restrain her as she struggled for
her life but said he did so out of fear that Rails would also harm
him.
</P>
<P>
   Rails told the Montis on Friday that many of the details they
heard in court about their daughter's death were not true.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying it was not a bad thing or not a horrible
thing,'' Rails said.
</P>
<P>
   Claire-Marie Monti, 32, was in the Kansas City, Mo., area to
give computer software training to employees of a Lenexa company
that spring.
</P>
<P>
   She met Rails and Henry, who were co-workers for a Kansas City
remodeling company, in the Westport area the night before she was
found dead, according to testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Vic Monti said after the sentencing that he could never forgive
Rails but said that at least Rails took responsibility for what he
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's more than we can say for Rodney Henry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Monti said he doubted he would ever take Rails up on his offer
to talk about the crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at either one of them as a reliable source,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rails is the third person in Johnson County to be charged with
capital murder since Kansas reinstated the death penalty in 1994.
All three have avoided a death sentence by pleading guilty or no
contest and have been sentenced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson County District Attorney Paul Morrison said the case was
an example of the power of the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brought the defendant to his knees,'' Morrison said. ``Carl
Rails is going to waste away and die an old man in some
maximum-security prison.''

 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A powerful Russian industrialist whose empire is
under investigation in the money laundering inquiry at the Bank of
New York said Friday that a large part of the billions of dollars
moved through the bank was controlled by Russian officials
protecting their fortunes by shipping their money abroad before
Russian markets collapsed last year.
</P>
<P>
   In in his first interview since the money laundering
investigation became public last week, the industrialist, Mikhail
Khodorkovsky, said by telephone from Moscow that many Russian
officials began selling government securities in 1998 because they
had inside knowledge about government deliberations in the months
leading to a decision to permit the devaluation of the ruble. That
move occurred in August 1998, and caused the Russian economy, and
the value of government debt, to spiral sharply downward.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who sold securities before the devaluation would have
been able to get out of the market while the securities' value was
still relatively high, locking in profits on the high-flying bonds
just before they fell to earth. Khodorkovsky said he believed that
Russian officials did just that, shipping their profits abroad
through a front company and into the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Khodorkovsky, of course, has a vested interest in this theory.
He believes that Russian investigators, who he said have yet to
make contact with him, are poised to re-examine his business
dealings in light of the money laundering inquiry. By pointing his
finger at the investigators' current and former bosses,
Khodorkovsky seemed to be warning Russian leaders that they too may
be dragged into the wide-ranging investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, federal investigators believe that the amount of money
moved through the Bank of New York _ at least $4.2 billion and
possibly as much as $10 billion _ was so large that Russian
organized crime figures linked to the investigation could be
directly responsible for only a small part of it. Investigators say
it is very likely that the bulk of the money that flowed through
the bank is tied to corporate embezzlement and political graft in
Russia. And Russia's securities markets, marred by rampant insider
trading, have long been considered easy for public officials in
Russia to manipulate.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of New York confirmed last week that it is cooperating
with an investigation of what federal authorities describe as the
biggest money laundering inquiry in history. The bank has not been
charged with any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Khodorkovsky, 35, is the chairman of Yukos, one of Russia's
largest oil companies, and was the chairman of Menatep, a now
insolvent Russian bank. Federal investigators are examining
Menatep's relationship with the Bank of New York because the two
banks did business together.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators' interest is heightened because Natasha
Kagalovsky, a Bank of New York executive suspended until the
investigation is complete, is married to Konstantin Kagalovsky, who
is the vice chairman of Yukos and was also vice chairman of
Menatep. The Kagalovskys have not been charged with any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The Kagalovskys ``wish to state unequivocally that they have
never been involved in money laundering in any way, shape or
form,'' the couple's lawyer, Stanley Arkin, said in a statement.
``Nor do they have any knowledge of such activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Arkin's statement was prompted, it said, by ``unfair press
coverage'' based on ``innuendo, rumors, selective and irresponsible
leaks from U.S. governmental sources and disingenuous
`guilt-by-association' assumptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Khodorkovsky called a reporter directly Friday to offer his
theory on what was behind the money laundering scandal and to
defend his integrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Menatep never in its history has done any money laundering,''
he said through an interpreter. ``Menatep has undergone
investigations by many commissions on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he said the money laundering investigation at the
Bank of New York was significant. ``The investigation that is under
way in the U.S. appears to be of great importance,'' he said.
``Because if the investigation is carried out competently, we will
see that Russian criminals will be caught red-handed.''
</P>
<P>
   Khodorkovsky said that Russian organized crime figures were
undoubtedly tied to the scandal, and that he believed, as has been
reported, that Semion Mogilevich, a reputed head of Russian
organized crime, is involved in the matter. Investigators say
Mogilevich used a company called Benex to launder funds through the
Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Mogilevich could not be reached for comment; in the past he has
denied any ties to organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Khodorkovsky declined to speculate on other organized crime
figures he believed to be involved in the scheme, saying he feared
for his safety, but he enthusiastically offered his view that
political insiders in Russia had actively shipped their own
ill-gotten gains through the Benex pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   The chronology of events surrounding the money laundering
investigation adds some credibility to this view. In early 1998,
just as Russia's economy began to show serious signs of strain,
funds started moving through the Benex accounts at the Bank of New
York. Activity in the accounts is believed to have been
particularly heavy starting in the fall of 1998, shortly after the
Russian ruble was devalued, setting off a financial crisis in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that such huge money over such a short period of
time could only be generated by that operation,'' Khodorkovsky
said, referring to his theory that Russian government officials
took advantage of inside knowledge about the country's financial
crisis and shipped bond gains abroad.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. intelligence officials believe that many commercial
banks in Russia also began shipping money out of the country
shortly after the ruble was devalued, when a 90-day debt moratorium
imposed by the Russian government gave the banks an opportunity to
avoid paying debts by stashing their cash abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Khodorkovsky was privy to an exclusive meeting in Russia's
presidential offices attended by a handful of powerful Russian
financiers the weekend before the ruble was devalued. The group
successfully pushed for the moratorium, although Khodorkovsky said
Friday that he had not taken advantage of his position as an
insider.
</P>
<P>
   News reports about the money laundering investigation at the
Bank of New York have offered a variety of other theories about
where the money came from in Russia. The International Monetary
Fund and the U.S. Department of Agriculture said Friday that
neither agency had evidence to support one of those notions _ that
their aid to Russia had been misappropriated by mobsters. But the
IMF conceded Friday that it had badly misjudged how challenging it
was to lend and track billions of dollars in corruption-plagued
countries like Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of whether IMF loans to Russia were illegally diverted
was extensively investigated earlier this year with no evidence
found then that indicated misappropriation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, who said this week that he would
hold hearings in mid-September examining the threat of money
laundering and, in particular, the Bank of New York case, said
Friday that further IMF loans to Russia should be halted until
steps are taken to ensure that the money is not diverted.

SLICK REPLAY THOMAS-HILL SAGA LACKS CONVICTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In October 1991, the real-life saga of race, sex and politics
playing out before their eyes on national television gripped
millions of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strange Justice'' likely won't be so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which dramatizes the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill saga,
includes some great performances, stylish direction, and one of
those stories so bizarre it could happen only in real life, because
no one would think to invent it.
</P>
<P>
   What it lacks is conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Delroy Lindo is outstanding as Thomas. Regina Taylor makes a
convincing, if understated, Anita Hill. Mandy Patinkin gives, for
him, an understated performance as spin doctor Kenneth Duberstein _
not only does he refrain from breaking into a show tune, he never
even looks like he wants to. Emmy nominations all around, no doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Yet aside from a truly bizarre _ and inspired _ take on Thomas'
and Hill's testimony before a Senate committee, ``Strange
Justice,'' based on the book of the same name, doesn't give us much
more than what we already knew. The movie never takes a stand as to
who might have been telling the truth, who was lying. It's
admirably evenhanded in that regard, I suppose, but the drama
suffers because of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were never trying to make a straightforward docudrama about
these events,'' Jacob Epstein, the movie's writer, said from his
home last week. ``We were trying to go for what was the meaning of
all this.''
</P>
<P>
   When Thurgood Marshall retired, then-President Bush nominated
Thomas to the Supreme Court. A conservative Black and a Republican,
Thomas opposed quota systems and the like. Although he had a
relatively thin record as a judge, his nomination seemed set to
sail through the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Until Anita Hill came along.
</P>
<P>
   Hill worked for Thomas a decade earlier, and claimed that he
sexually harassed her. The nation was treated to tales of
legendarily endowed porn stars and pubic hairs left on Coke cans.
(We survived. Today, Monica Lewinsky and Bill Clinton's Oval Office
exploits make all this seem almost quaint.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Strange Justice'' opens with Thomas' confirmation, then
flashes back to Marshall's retirement. The White House enlists
Duberstein, who helped get David Souter confirmed to the bench, to
shepherd Thomas through Senate hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Duberstein, in the cliched manner of Washington types, plays
hardball, warning Thomas never to say anything off the cuff without
clearing it with him first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job is the same as if we were selling a product in the
marketplace,'' he tells the surprised judge. Later he warns Thomas,
``Don't get mad. Don't get even. Get confirmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Oklahoma, Hill is watching Bush nominate Thomas.
(Much like the trickery in ``Forrest Gump,'' Lindo and Taylor are
placed digitally into actual news footage.) The president calls
Thomas the ``best qualified'' candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' a friend of Hill tells her, ``best qualified to grab
your ass.''
</P>
<P>
   The early scenes with Hill drag as she agonizes over whether to
come forward. Meanwhile, Duberstein preps Thomas, repeatedly asking
him if there are any skeletons in his closet. Not a one, Thomas
assures him.
</P>
<P>
   Hill's decision to go public changes all that, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rules of fiasco,'' Duberstein muses. ``The higher the stakes,
the bigger the disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House, of course, attempts to stonewall Hill, as well
as other women who want to come forward with damning testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we get through with Anita Hill, there's not going to be
enough left to mop the floor,'' an oily White House operative
gloats.
</P>
<P>
   Then come the hearings _ and the best part of the movie. They
begin simply enough, with the well-remembered sight of Thomas
sitting at a green-topped table in front of a bank of senators.
Then, oddly, Thomas takes off his jacket and rolls up his sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   Wait a second! you think. He didn't do that. No, he didn't. Nor
did Hill erupt during her testimony. Director Ernest Dickerson
shows not just what they are saying, but how they feel while saying
it. The effect is, at first, more interesting than effective.
</P>
<P>
   Then Thomas begins his famous ``high-tech lynching'' rebuttal.
</P>
<P>
   He removes his shirt and, at one point, hangs himself with his
tie. Lindo is wonderful here. The rage, the humiliation, the
wounded pride all boil to the top. The device succeeds flawlessly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw this as an existential crisis for both of them,'' movie
writer Epstein said. ``They were really speaking to save their
lives. What could be more dramatic than that?''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in ``Strange Justice,'' certainly.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, after the speeches, there is still some movie
left, more tortured scheduling and maneuvering, until Thomas
finally is confirmed. Immediately afterward, the president calls
Duberstein to congratulate him _ and to ask for his help for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Undertakers and spin doctors,'' Duberstein laughs. ``We're
never out of luck.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, ``Strange Justice'' is a depressing story of
manipulation _ manipulation of Thomas, of Hill and, most
importantly, the American people.
</P>
<P>
   We never may find out who was telling the truth. We certainly
won't find out here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can know what happened . . . between those people
except the two people involved,'' Epstein said. ``It would be
impossible for anybody to say, `I know who was right and who was
lying.' I think that's the achievement of the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also its downfall. &QL;

MANNING IS HIGH ON TOLEDO'S LIST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As his players turned their gaze to Boise State,
Bruins coach Bob Toledo offered final thoughts on training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Best freshmen: Tight end Mike Seidman, linebackers Marcus Reese
and Asi Faoa and cornerback Ricky Manning Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Especially Manning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like he's a 25-year-old playing his freshman year,''
Toledo said. ``He's mature beyond belief. He's so aware of what's
happening. I'm really, really pleased with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Most improved: Tight end Bryan Fletcher and defensive tackle Ken
Kocher. Kocher has secured a starting spot, while Fletcher will
rotate with tight ends Gabe Crecion and Seidman.
</P>
<P>
   Most opportunistic: Several players took advantage of the
disabled parking suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Rusty Williams is replacing Santi Hall, who is
replacing the suspended linebackers.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Joe Hunter has replaced Marques Anderson, who is out
for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Walk-on fullback Matt Stanley will start in place of Durell
Price. (Walk-on Adam Geitner is the No. 2 fullback until Price
returns.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The fullbacks are doing a good job,'' Toledo said. ``We'll be
fine with those two guys. They're two walk-ons who could eventually
earn scholarships.''
</P>
<P>
   Best finish: In the final days of training camp, no one was more
impressive than senior defensive end Travor Turner, a pass-rush
specialist whose run defense has improved. Turner is the No. 2
weakside end, behind Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's playing as well as he ever has,'' Toledo said. ``Rusty
has played really well. He just plays so hard. But Travor has put
himself in a position so that we can play him and not drop off at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Suspended in scout colors: Toledo is making optimum use of the
11 suspended players: After a lethargic training camp, they're on
the scout team, which replicates Boise State's attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the suspended guys didn't put in as much effort
(during training camp) as they possibly could, and some have,''
Toledo said. ``Maybe it's a natural instinct when you know you're
not going to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Receiver rotation: Danny Farmer's sprained ankle is threatening
Toledo's plan to redshirt sophomore Jon Dubravac.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's offense requires four healthy receivers. If Farmer can't
play against Boise State _ he's doubtful _ the Bruins might need
Dubravac to relieve Brian Poli-Dixon, Freddie Mitchell and Brad
Melsby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to redshirt him, but I've told him he has to be
ready,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Cody Joyce, Ryan Wilkins and Devon Reese also are competing for
Dubravac's spot.
</P>
<P>
   In and out: Next week, the Bruins will refine their substitution
patterns to prepare for two new rules: Teams cannot break the
huddle with 12 players, and teams cannot have anyone within 10
yards of the huddle.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if coaches placed 12 or 13 players in huddles to confuse
opponents, Toledo said: ``You bet. The intent was to deceive.''

BANK STRIVES TO QUELL Y2K FEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HAYES and FINN BULLERS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Technology and theology have once again
intersected, this time courtesy of the American Bankers
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's bankers have gone into the sermon-writing business
in an effort to calm beliefs in some religious circles that the
Year 2000 will bring an apocalypse, without ATM machines and
electronic checking. Reaction to the bankers' sermon has been less
than charitable.
</P>
<P>
   The four-page homily, being distributed nationwide to bankers to
give to local ministers, priests and rabbis, includes these words:
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to go into the new millennium with hope, eagerness and
faith in this new century of promise. We don't want to be crouched
in our basements with candles, matches and guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are, after all, two ways to cross the Red Sea. With
Moses, who with God's help, led the children of Israel into a
bright, hopeful future. Or with Pharaoh, who in trying to preserve
the old, hurled his chariots, his officers and his army into the
sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Episcopal priest Paul Goodland of Fountain Hills, Ariz., was not
impressed. ``They're treading where angels fear to tread,'' he
said, adding that problems with his ATM card had made him skeptical
of banks' Year 2000 readiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to tell us we're safe in the bosom of the
banks,'' Goodland told us this week. ``But we're safe in the bosom
of the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   Evangelical Steve Hewitt, a Raytown preacher and publisher of
Christian Computing magazine, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if this was the best sermon since `Sinners in the
Hands of an Angry God,' '' he said, it's hard to hear the word of
the Lord channeled through the mouth of a banker.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen with the American Anglican Council and the U.S.
Catholic Conference declined to discuss the sermon. But in the end,
Hewitt said, the bankers may be giving organized religion a dose of
what it deserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grabbed (Y2K) and made it a Biblical issue, and now it's
hard to condemn secular society for trying to set us straight,''
said Hewitt, who travels the country speaking out against Year 2000
alarmism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y2K was never a Biblical issue and we're the ones who strayed
first. We drew first blood.'' Don't believe it
</P>
<P>
   We debunk yet another e-mail hoax this week.
</P>
<P>
   If you receive one of the more than 2 billion e-mail messages
sent each day, chances are you've seen this message in your
mailbox: ``You are not Y2K ready unless you've done this to your
computer
</P>
<P>
   1. Click on ``My Computer.''
</P>
<P>
   2. Click on ``Control Panel.''
</P>
<P>
   3. Click on ``Regional Settings.''
</P>
<P>
   4. Click on the ``Date'' tab. Where it says ``Short Date
Sample,'' look and see if it shows a ``two digit'' year. Of course
it does. That's the default setting for Windows 95, 98 and NT. This
date is the one that feeds application software and will not
rollover in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   5. Click on the button across from ``Short Date Style'' and
select the option that shows mm/dd/yyyy.
</P>
<P>
   6. Click ``Apply'' and then click on ``OK.'' Easy enough to fix.
However, every single installation of Windows worldwide is
defaulted to fail Y2K rollover.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believe it,'' says The Star's own newsroom systems
manager Rob Perschau, ``all you're doing is tricking yourself into
thinking your Windows 95 computer is ready for 2000.'' It may not
be unless you do a more comprehensive check.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says the short date setting is for display purposes
only. Dates are stored and processed by Windows in a four-digit
format.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to check it out for yourself, Perschau recommends

bomb plot
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest threats looming at the end of year comes from
those who want something bad to happen, experts say. Case in point:
Alfred Reumayr of New Westminster, British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The 50-year-old Canadian is suspected in an alleged Y2K bomb
plot. He is charged with attempting to hire a U.S. citizen to blow
up energy supply systems in the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not any sort of terrorist activity. It's not a political
thing. He's not some sort of ideological nut,'' Cpl. Frank Henley
of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police told Reuters news agency. ``It
was a carefully planned-out fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in both countries said the man planned to have
explosives detonate at the end of the year to cover his tracks and
throw suspicion on the Y2K bug. They did not say what systems were
chosen as targets or how the man planned to extort funds.
</P>
<P>
   No arrests have been made. Sheriff's plan scrapped
</P>
<P>
   In Orange City, Iowa, some people think the sheriff would have
done better to call upon church elders rather than people holding
permits for concealed weapons to mobilize a special Y2K reserve
force.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Jim Schwiesow recently sent letters to the county's 396
registered concealed weapon permit-holders, asking them to help his
department in case of any Y2K emergencies. ``This would be strictly
a volunteer pool of trustworthy people that I could summon in dire
times,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Sioux County Board of Supervisors nixed the idea, saying the
county would be liable for the actions of any reserve force. Under
Iowa law, a reserve peace officer force must be approved by the
board and officers must attend a minimum training course of 150
hours plus weapons training.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jeff Sajdak, pastor of Immanuel Christian Reformed
Church, said the sheriff could have called on Sioux County CARES, a
coalition of people in education, law enforcement and social
services. Sioux County CARES would be ``a better and perhaps more
effective way than to find everybody with a weapons permit,'' he
said.

REACTION TO KANSAS EVOLUTION DECISION VOCAL AND VARIED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE BEEM  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS _ In the days after the Kansas Board of Education voted
to play down evolution in the state's science standards, chairwoman
Linda Holloway joked that evolution supporters were acting as if
the sky was falling.
</P>
<P>
   More than two weeks have passed since the Aug. 11 decision, and
the sky is still where it's supposed to be, but there has been
fallout on many fronts:
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas and Western
Missouri sent a letter to the superintendents of each of the
state's 304 school districts. It reviewed recent U.S. Supreme Court
decisions that outlawed teaching biblical creationism in science
classes.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. David Adkins of Leawood said he would sponsor
legislation requiring high school students entering state
universities to have studied evolution, the theory that living
things have common ancestors and change over time.
</P>
<P>
   Two national science organizations _ the National Academy of
Sciences and the American Chemical Society _ condemned the board's
action as a setback for science education in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Evolution proponents formed a group, Kansas Citizens for
Science, to support teachers and districts that want to teach the
theory.
</P>
<P>
   The publisher of a new textbook on Kansas history has decided to
drop a chapter on the state's prehistory. The chapter focused on
the prehistoric inland sea and 150 million-year-old fossils found
in western Kansas. After hearing national reports about the new
science standards, the board of the foundation publishing the book
thought some Kansans might take issue with those topics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we talk about (things that old), then it's beyond a
creation date that most religions use,'' said Jim Bean, director of
the Grace Dangberg Foundation in Carson City, Nev., which promotes
the study of history by young people.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State University Professor Gary Conrad said he's having
difficulty recruiting candidates for two openings within the
biology department.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Conrad said, the president of an out-of-state
research institution told him she would discourage her students
from considering Kansas for employment because their children would
be subjected to a public school education that might not include
evolution.
</P>
<P>
   School board members in Pratt, Kan., west of Wichita, listened
to a presentation on a science textbook that espouses the theory of
intelligent design _ the idea that a superior being designed the
universe and everything in it.
</P>
<P>
   During the media frenzy after the vote of the 10-member board,
confusion abounded about the science standards' purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The standards are guidelines for school districts to use as they
determine what students should learn. The document written by a
27-member committee of science educators listed evolution as a
major concept, but earlier this month six board members _ five
conservatives and one moderate _ voted to remove the emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   The tests used as part of the state's accreditation program are
based on the standards, and observers say most districts teach to
the test. New science tests to be given in the 2000-2001 school
year will not include questions on macro-evolution, the idea that
different species can share common ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine with Mary Douglass Brown of Wichita, one of the
board members who favored de-emphasizing evolution.
</P>
<P>
   The board's intent was not to force creationism or any other
theory on the origins of life into science classrooms, but to allow
school districts to decide for themselves, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she checked with officials of the Wichita School
District before the vote and was told students would continue to
learn about evolution. That's the district's prerogative, Brown
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't seem to want to trust their local people to make
this decision, and that's all we've done,'' Brown said. ``If Yoder
(Kan.) wants creationism and their people want it, that's their
business. And I'm not going to stand in the way of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown dismisses the idea that the board's decision could harm
Kansas students. But it's a real worry for Bill Wagnon, a board
member from Topeka who supported the standards written by the
science teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Wagnon said he feared Kansas would lose its position as a leader
and innovator in education. The K-State professor's troubles
attracting faculty members are just a start, Wagnon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reputations are hard to earn and easy to shatter,'' Wagnon
said.
</P>
<P>
   The science standards have yet to reach school districts. The
board's attorney still is ironing out copyright questions over
parts of the standards based on materials from the National Academy
of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The standards written by the teachers committee relied heavily
on the academy's National Science Education Standards, but the
changed version might not meet with the academy's approval. The
standards will be sent to school districts as soon as those
questions are answered, said Kathy Toelkes, the board's
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Kurtenbach, executive director of the ACLU of Kansas and
Western Missouri, said his organization had recruited a Kansas City
law firm to determine what legal recourse the ACLU has. He disputed
Brown's claim of a return to local control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why have standards at all?'' Kurtenbach said. ``Why select one
aspect of it but pass on pages and pages and pages of other
mandated issues? If it was about local control, the state board
would eliminate all standards and go out of business.''

NOW YOU'RE COOKING: AIKMAN WOWS YOUNG CROWD
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Warning: The following true account of a Dallas
Cowboys player's off-field activity contains no drugs or dancers,
no speed or weed or even a hint of prima-donna sneers, excessive
beers or barber shears. Hold on to your jurisprudence, it's a nice
story about a nice guy helping nice kids. It's probably been a
while so, please, proceed with caution:
</P>
<P>
   Troy Aikman hasn't thrown a pass that counts this season, but he
might have already made his most important completion.
</P>
<P>
   While many of you were still sleeping yesterday morning, the
Cowboys quarterback, who has enough money to buy the Mavericks and
enough popularity to run against Gov. George W. Bush, crawled out
of bed and drove himself to Texas Stadium in search of 100 smiles.
When he arrived around 6:30 a.m., he was met by producers from
ABC's ``Good Morning America'', black-belt chef Emeril Lagasse and
a school-bus worth of stopped hearts, dropped jaws and fixated eyes
enamored by the sight of a superstar sight doubling as a
sympathetic civilian.
</P>
<P>
   Touchdown, Aikman-to-Caring.
</P>
<P>
   Turning heads faster than Michael Johnson and seizing attention
spans stronger than Pokemon, Aikman instantly melted the stress of
100 children staring at fourth-down-and-life. The students _ from
Happy Hill Farm Academy/Home in Granbury _ suddenly weren't
burdened by their troubled pasts of abuse, neglect or simply being
dumped at the doorstep with no note and no hope.
</P>
<P>
   For 45 precious minutes, Aikman reminded the children that
apparently it's still safe to have your Heroes be Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great, like a dream,'' said Heather, a 17-year-old senior
at Happy Hill. ``We're in Texas Stadium, we're meeting Troy and
we're on TV. Plus, we don't have to go back to class today.''
</P>
<P>
   While an additional 200 fans provided a ``GMA'' backdrop of
Aikman jerseys, cardboard cutouts and signs that ranged from
``Marry Me Troy'' (obviously in denial) to ``Pork Fat Rules''
(obviously insane), Aikman switched gears from Chan Gailey's
playbook to the ``Dallas Cowboys Family Cookbook''. Dressed in a
golf shirt and holding _ surprise _ a football (''The only prop
they feel I can handle,'' he joked), Aikman talked to millions of
viewers about his zest for charity and the desperate need of funds
created from sales of the cookbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Proceeds from the cookbook _ started in 1979 by former Cowboys
linebacker Bob Breunig and this year featuring recipes from
renowned Fort Worth chef Grady Spears _ benefit Happy Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a special opportunity to be able to help these kids,''
said Aikman, who wasn't paid for his appearance but did claim to
receive an immeasurable gift. ``Hopefully, with events like this
and others, we can give them another chance in life. That's what
it's all about to me. It's the rewarding part.''
</P>
<P>
   During his live 10-minute segment, Aikman feigned knowing nods
as Lagasse prepared ``Troy Aikman's Chicken Breasts Alfredo'' (page
22).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm into eating much more than the cooking,'' Aikman joked.
``I ran out of recipes after the first year of the cookbook.''
</P>
<P>
   While the chicken soaked in white sauce and the children soaked
in unforgettable memories, Aikman gave a thumbs-up taste test
despite grimacing when Lagasse lopped an entire stick of butter
into the concoction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little heavy for a pregame meal,'' Aikman said before
presenting Lagasse with a No. 8 Cowboys jersey. ``But it would
probably taste pretty good after a victory.''
</P>
<P>
   After the show, which was also open to the public, the children
and fans engorged themselves with T-shirts, souvenir footballs and,
most important, leftovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outstanding,'' said Navy recruiter Mike Raley, who made the
trip with three co-workers from the Naval Air Station north of Fort
Worth. ``The food is good, but the best thing is how Troy is still
down-to-earth. You hear a lot of bad things about athletes these
days, but here's proof they're not all bad. There's some good ones
still out there.''
</P>
<P>
   With the sun rising but a full moon still peeking through the
stadium's roof, Aikman _ the one sometimes criticized for being too
stoic _ unhinged his jerky-tough exterior long enough to give
further glimpse of his soft underbelly. By shaking hands, signing
autographs, exchanging smiles or simply patting a head, he planted
seeds for a new generation of fans seeking positive role models.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to spot someone's big talent,'' Lagasse said. ``But
when you see an athlete give his time and be genuinely excited like
Troy was, you get to see his big heart. He really sent a spark into
those kids. And vice versa.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Cowboys are host to the Denver Broncos tomorrow night,
Aikman will resume being the quarterback. But somewhere at Happy
Hill, 100 youngsters will never be the same.

BASEBALL HALL OF FAMER'S RELATIVES REMEMBER A MAN DIFFERENT FROM
MANY OF TODAY'S STARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE POPPER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kansas City, Mo. _ Recently, as hundreds of Kansas Citians
descended upon Cooperstown, N.Y., to celebrate George Brett's
induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame, one family with
deep Kansas City roots made the journey for a different reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went for a reunion marking the 50th anniversary of our
great-grandfather's election to the Hall,'' said Sharon Everett,
who grew up in Kansas City and now teaches in San Diego, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Her great-grandfather was Charles ``Kid'' Nichols, a legend in
early baseball and one of the first Kansas Citians elected to the
Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   His 15-year major-league record was impressive. His plaque at
Cooperstown credits him with 360 victories and 202 losses.
</P>
<P>
   His other achievements included seven seasons with 30 or more
wins; 48 shutouts; 532 complete games. (He was almost never taken
out of a game for a relief pitcher.)
</P>
<P>
   Ty Cobb called him ``one of the greatest pitchers of all
time...''
</P>
<P>
   Christy Mathewson said he was ``the greatest pitcher'' he'd ever
faced.
</P>
<P>
   Although Nichols played for the old Boston Nationals, later
renamed the Braves, he lived in Kansas City from 1880 until his
death in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   ``But who remembers him now?'' said his great-granddaughter Ann
Everett, a nun and teacher who lives in Fairway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost no one,'' said her sister, Sharon Everett. ``And that
certainly makes you think twice when you read all the sportswriter
hype about `immortal fame' and `enshrinement' in the hall.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, the year of Nichols' induction, entering the Hall of
Fame was a simpler affair than it is now.
</P>
<P>
   That year Nichols traveled alone to Cooperstown for the
ceremony. He could not afford to take his family with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never made more than $3,000 a year in baseball,'' said
Sharon Everett.
</P>
<P>
   In his later years he did not trade upon his fame to hobnob with
the wealthy and powerful. Instead he used his lifetime baseball
pass to take children to games at old Blues Stadium in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``He taught us to love baseball as a game for all the people,''
said Ann Everett. ``We were in awe of him, but we didn't know how
great he had been. He never talked about that.''
In his playing years, Nichols was slender and handsome and, at 5
feet 10 inches tall and 160 pounds, was considered small for a
major leaguer.
</P>
<P>
   Although he smoked cigars and moved through the world with
confidence, he had a baby face that led teammates to tab him the
``Kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his appearance, he was a hard man on the ball field.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1902 game, a bat slipped from a player's hands and smashed
Nichols' head, causing a long gash. He was rushed to a doctor, who
stitched the gash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I returned to the park with my head so swathed in bandages I
was unable to wear my cap,'' Nichols wrote later.
</P>
<P>
   He was woozy and half asleep, but when his team's pitcher was
ejected for arguing with an umpire, Nichols, looking like a mummy,
walked to the mound and pitched three near-perfect innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Star called him an ``iron man.'' The paper paid
special attention to his career because Nichols, although born in
Wisconsin, always called Kansas City his hometown, having moved
here when he was 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began playing baseball on (Kansas City's) corner lots,'' he
wrote. He joined organized baseball when he was 18, playing first
for the old Kansas City Western League club and winning the first
five games he pitched.
</P>
<P>
   At the time he weighed only 135 pounds, but his fastball was
blazing, his curve a sweeping blur.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the major league Boston club in 1890. That year he won
27 games, the next year 30, the year after that 35.
</P>
<P>
   In 1892 he won three consecutive games on three consecutive days
in three different cities, a feat Ty Cobb later called
``remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   His delivery was straightaway. He never broke eye contact with
the batter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I faced the best batters of my time, but I did not dread
them,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He played his last game in 1906. He then returned to Kansas City
and held a series of jobs. He managed bowling alleys, sold
insurance and men's furnishings. He devoted his free time to youth
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always thought of himself as just a common person who had
been given a great talent,'' said Sharon Everett. ``And he wanted
to share it with everybody.''
When Nichols' descendants returned to Cooperstown this year, what
they encountered outside the museum surprised them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw Pete Rose and other old ballplayers set up booths and
charge $25 for each autograph they signed,'' said Sharon Everett.
</P>
<P>
   ``It disgusted me. One of the things I hate most is seeing
little kids begging ballplayers for autographs as the players walk
by without a second glance. It breaks my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   She recalls that when children wrote asking for her
great-grandfather's autograph, he always sent one by return mail.
After his death at 83, his daughter, Alice, continued the
tradition, cutting Nichols' signatures off old canceled checks,
pasting them on postcards and sending them out with notes of
thanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot has changed since then,'' said Ann Everett.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now at the ballpark I see tiers of fancy corporate boxes, and
the lower level filled with people who have paid a fortune for
tickets and aren't even watching the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then I wonder, why can't we be down there instead, people
like us who may not be rich but who really love the game?''
</P>
<P>
   Every Memorial Day, Ann Everett takes flowers to her
great-grandfather's grave at Mount Moriah Cemetery in south Kansas
City.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, as she was cleaning the floral urn in front of the
grave, a baseball rolled out and fell onto the grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball was very old and brown and cracked,'' she said. ``But
I could see it was signed in several places. I was so happy that
somebody remembered him and wanted to honor him with a ball from
his own era.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, filled with curiosity, she took the ball to autograph
experts to find out who had signed it. But the signatures were so
faint that no one could read them. They had faded away like the
forgotten past.

MCCAIN COURTS VOTES IN NAVAJO COUNTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KRIS MAYES  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. _ Sen. John McCain on Friday became the first
presidential candidate to take his campaign to Navajo country,
where he is hoping to convert a long record of political favors
into votes.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who still is running behind Texas Gov. George W. Bush,
told residents of the Navajo Nation that he would make their issues
a priority in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I am elected president of the United States, after the
election I will come back here to Window Rock, and we will meet,''
McCain told 71 members of the Tribal Council gathered for a special
session to work on the tribe's budget. ``And we will formulate new
policies for the Navajo Nation and Indian Country.''
</P>
<P>
   With more than 55,000 registered voters, Navajos represent an
undeniably attractive block of votes to any presidential candidate.
In 1996, Republican presidential hopeful Steve Forbes, who
eventually won Arizona's primary, set up shop here.
</P>
<P>
   In his Senate campaigns in Arizona, McCain has done well among
the Navajo and during his last two Senate bids secured the tribe's
official endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference at tribal headquarters, McCain told
reporters that the Indian vote could become critical if the
Republican race tightens.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are tens of thousands of (Native American) votes in
Arizona,'' he said. ``And it's not just the reservation, and it's
not just this tribe. In a close race, every vote counts.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the day's biggest surprises, former Navajo President
Peterson Zah publicly switched his voter registration from Democrat
to Republican at a press conference. McCain hopes it's the
beginning of a campaign to convert the Navajo into a tribe of
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of you out there are Democrats, but you know there is a
way you can help this man,'' Zah told about 150 people. ``If you
are a Democrat, you can change over during the primary and vote for
this man, and, if you want, you can change back during the
general.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain spent the day meeting with tribal leaders and the
council, followed by a rally thrown by Navajo military veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Small groups of veterans, many of whom expressed their affinity
for McCain, a former prisoner of war in Vietnam, gathered to hear
the senator speak under a hot afternoon sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Democrat, but I still wish McCain a lot of luck,'' said
Oscar House, a former Marine from Window Rock who served in Korea.
``Because he's a veteran and I'm a veteran, I have a lot of respect
for the man and what he went through.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, House noted that McCain's challenge will be in bringing
Native Americans to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out here, he can get a lot of support if he gets people who
will push for him,'' House said. ``The Navajo are voters in tribal
elections. They just don't go out and vote in national elections.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a former member of the Senate Native American Affairs
subcommittee, has spent years wooing Arizona Indians. Repeatedly on
Friday, he sought to highlight his record on Indian issues. In his
speech before the Tribal Council, McCain vowed to help eradicate
poverty on the reservation and resolve a long-standing dispute over
Indian trust funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a public disgrace, $2.4 billion in revenues that belong
to tribal governments,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To land the Native American vote, McCain will be relying in part
on the efforts of Arizona House Speaker Jeff Groscost, R-Mesa, who
has made recent inroads with Navajo voters on behalf of the GOP.
Groscost, who has been traveling between Phoenix and Window Rock
for McCain, promised to deliver the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the Navajo) understand that he needs help, and I think
people would be surprised how willing they are to help,'' Groscost
said. ``They are extremely loyal people.'' &QL;

TOO MANY INVITES FOR SOSA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sammy Sosa is on everybody's A-List these days and
that could be a problem tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, the major-league home run leader with 53, was scheduled to
appear at a dinner honoring Dodgers coach and Dominican icon Manny
Mota in downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But Sosa, whose Cubs play the Dodgers this afternoon, also has
been invited to the birthday party of pop star Michael Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, who earlier this season was visited by President Clinton
at Wrigley Field, is in demand, signing a $25 million endorsement
deal Thursday with a Chicago-based marketing firm. He also is
planning to open a restaurant on Chicago's fashionable Michigan
Ave. that will include affordable meals for low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa received the loudest ovation Friday night when he came to
the plate with two on and one out in the first inning. He struck
out on a high fastball by Dodgers starter Ismael Valdes.
</P>
<P>
   More fun: One party Sosa didn't make was the one thrown Thursday
night by Dodgers left fielder Gary Sheffield for more than 100
people at his home in Bel Air.
</P>
<P>
   The party was attended by players and club employees, but one
no-show was manager Davey Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know if it was one of those parties where the manager
isn't supposed to come,'' Johnson said with a smile. ``Sometimes
the players just like to get together without us around.''
</P>
<P>
   The party was sponsored by the Gary Sheffield Foundation, which
works extensively with inner-city youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Davey knows he was invited,'' Sheffield said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Medical news: Pitchers Antonio Osuna (elbow) and Robinson Checo
(groin) each threw in the bullpen before the game, but it is
unknown if or when they will begin rehabilitation assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Osuna has been told repeatedly he needs reconstructive surgery
on his right elbow, but with a club option of $1.5 million next
year, he wants to continue throwing. He went on the disabled list
May 18 for the second time this season and has appeared in just
five games.
</P>
<P>
   Checo, sidelined since suffering a groin strain July 28 in his
only start, made a rehab start last Thursday but experienced more
pain in his groin.
</P>
<P>
   He underwent a CAT scan for a hernia, but instead doctors found
swollen lymph nodes. Antibiotics reduced the swelling, but the team
will wait until today to see how he feels before plotting its next
move.
</P>
<P>
   Quick hits: Carlos Perez, who looked sharp in his last
minor-league start Tuesday, is scheduled to pitch again for
Triple-A Albuquerque on Sunday. If all goes well, Perez could
return to the Dodgers next week. Perez's fastball was clocked at 91
after clocking in at anywhere from the low to mid-80s with the
Dodgers.... George Brett, who was inducted into the Hall of Fame
last month, was a clubhouse visitor before the game.... The Cubs,
who came in undecided about Sunday's starter, will go with
right-hander Kyle Farnsworth (2-7, 6.17 ERA) in the final game of
the series.

 CHARLOTTE BEATS LIBERTY IN GAME 1, 78-67

   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ As she walked from the bench to the scorer's
table with just over six minutes left in the game, Teresa
Weatherspoon barked at the official standing nearby, ``Let me
play!'' The official didn't look her way, the argument already
lost. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With Weatherspoon spending most of the game's most crucial
moments on the bench in foul trouble, her Charlotte Sting
counterpart, Dawn Staley, took over the game, guiding the Sting to
a 78-67 victory in Game 1 of the two-of-3-games Eastern Conference
finals. The Liberty goes home for Sunday night's Game 2 with the
very real prospect of elimination just 40 minutes away. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Houston Comets found themselves on the losing end on
the underdog's home court in the Western Conference playoffs on
Thursday night, the Liberty now can forget about the 18-14 record
and its first-place finish in the conference. The Liberty must now
use the home court advantage that it gained throughout the regular
season to pull off two straight victories over the Sting, which has
beaten the Liberty in the teams' last three meetings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Staley finished the game with 16 points and nine assists, while
Weatherspoon had five points and eight assists. But it was what
Staley did when Weatherspoon was forced to the bench that made the
difference. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weatherspoon drew a pair of fouls in a four-second span in the
opening minutes of the second half, sending her to the sideline
with four fouls. When Becky Hammon took her place, Staley
immediately attacked, and with 16 minutes 52 seconds to play, she
hit from beyond the arc to tie the score at 42-42. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Robinson led the Liberty in Weatherspoon's absence, continuing
her run that had begun in the final minutes of the first half,
scoring seven of the Liberty's first 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't enough to keep the Sting from pushing to its first
lead since early in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Staley gave Charlotte a 49-47 lead by finishing a 3-on-1 fast
break after a missed 3-pointer by Hammon. That forced Liberty coach
Richie Adubato to put Weatherspoon back into the game, but she
stayed off Staley and the Liberty paid for that. With the shot
clock winding down minutes later, Staley drained a 3-pointer over
Vickie Johnson to give Charlotte a 62-55 lead. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then, with 7:48 to play, Weatherspoon drew her fifth foul and
was back on the bench, the damage already done. Staley had scored
nine points in the those first 12 minutes of the second half, and
the Sting was pulling away. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Robinson had kept the Liberty alive through the first half after
starting miserably from the floor, missing four consecutive shots
after starting the game with a 3-point field goal. But she missed
three straight 3-pointers and then misfired on a long jumper.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So Robinson went inside, just the way any coach would beg even
the best of shooters to do, passing up a 3-pointer and giving the
ball to Weatherspoon, who found Robinson cutting down the lane.
Robinson dropped in a reverse layup with 2:50 left in the first
half and then she was off. The next trip downcourt, she took a pass
on the left sideline on a break and delivered a 3-pointer. After a
pair of free throws by Weatherspoon, Robinson converted a pretty
turnaround jumper just outside the lane, finishing the half with 10
points and helping the Liberty to a 36-33 halftime advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defenses are looking for her and they're not going to give her
the jump shot,'' Adubato said before the game. ``She's going to
have to do that, use the pump fake, drive around people, or look
for the open man.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team, the Sting, is so concerned with her. She was six
for 12 from 3-point range in one game against them, that's my No. 1
concern.''
</P>

 TRUMP'S DEAL TO BUY THE fLAMINGO HILTON CASINO FACES A POSSIBLE (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The fate of Donald Trump's deal to buy the
Flamingo Hilton Casino in Kansas City could be known by Wednesday,
and right now things don't look good.
</P>
<P>
   When the sale was announced in January, Trump and Hilton agreed
that either side could walk away after midnight Aug. 31 if the deal
hadn't closed by that date. Now, it's unclear when or whether the
state will approve the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Trump and Hilton officials would not comment this week on the
deal, but one gaming industry source said Friday that Hilton Hotels
Corp. had been quietly shopping its Kansas City casino elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Gaming Commission had been expected to wrap up its
background investigation of Trump and approve the sale long before
now. But executive director Mel Fisher admits those background
checks have bogged down in detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Trump organization is rather complex and clearly presents
a challenge,'' he said Friday. ``We were obviously overly
optimistic in the length of time we thought it would take to
complete the investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump Hotels &AMP; Casino Resorts Inc. agreed to purchase the
Flamingo for $15 million _ about 15 cents on the dollar that it
cost to build the purple and pink gambling palace a few miles north
of downtown Kansas City, off Interstate 29.
</P>
<P>
   The ownership change was quietly engineered late last year to
take Hilton off the hook with the gaming commission over
still-pending bribery and perjury allegations that have threatened
Hilton's gaming licenses in other states. Gaming officials appeared
more than ready to approve the deal and be done with Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   But now a Hilton official, who asked not be identified, said the
company hadn't heard from the gaming commission in months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hearing a lot more information several months ago,''
the official said. ``That's all clammed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Missouri regulators earlier this year acknowledged a keen
interest in the Trump companies' long-term debt _ $1.8 billion and
one of the largest corporate debt obligations to be found in the
gaming industry.
</P>
<P>
   Trump's debt also gave pause to New Jersey regulators earlier
this year. Two months ago New Jersey agreed to re-license Trump's
gambling operation there, but not before voicing reservations about
the company's ability to meet its obligations.
</P>
<P>
   A Hilton subsidiary still owns the Kansas City casino despite
spinning off virtually all of the rest of its far-flung casino
empire into Park Place Entertainment Inc. last year.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas-based Park Place is handling the Trump sale for
Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   Nine months ago Hilton jumped at Trump's $15 million purchase
offer.
</P>
<P>
   The previous summer Hilton had agreed to pay the federal
government more than $500,000 in fines and penalties to avoid a
criminal trial.
</P>
<P>
   The government contends Hilton provided financial rewards to
associates of then-Kansas City Port Authority Chairman Elbert
Anderson in exchange for his political support for the casino that
eventually was built on city-owned land.
</P>
<P>
   One former Hilton official has been indicted on state perjury
charges related to the payments and is awaiting trial. Anderson is
serving a prison term for an unrelated bribery conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The years-long criminal investigation raised fears among
investors and throughout the gaming industry that Hilton was at the
brink of being fined, suspended or stripped of its Missouri Gaming
Commission license.
</P>
<P>
   If so, other jurisdictions with Hilton casinos could have taken
their own disciplinary actions against the company, jeopardizing
the viability of the then billion-dollar, worldwide gambling and
hospitality giant.
</P>
<P>
   The Park Place spinoff evolved about the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Then Trump offered Hilton an expedient way out of its Missouri
troubles, despite the Flamingo's $100 million construction price
tag.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed asset sale to Trump, Hilton would voluntarily
surrender its Missouri gambling license and sell the Kansas City
riverboat when Trump receives its license.
</P>
<P>
   If the sale to Trump falls through, Hilton would again
potentially face state disciplinary action.

TOVE HANSEN, LOS ANGELES RESTAURATEUR, DIES AT 88  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Denmark, Calif., Israel)   By NICK RAVO 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tove ``Musse'' Hansen, who presided over Scandia, a popular Los
Angeles restaurant in the 1950s and '60s, after helping Jews flee
Denmark during World War II, died last Saturday at her home in Los
Angeles. She was 88.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, Ms. Hansen's husband, Kenneth, opened Scandia, a French
and Scandinavian restaurant on Sunset Boulevard. Over the years, it
became one of the best known restaurants in Los Angeles, a
destination for presidents and movie stars. It was sold in 1978 and
went out of business about 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ms. Hansen was not the owner of Scandia, she was known
for her presence in the restaurant when it was a celebrity
rendezvous.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Chroman, a longtime friend of Ms. Hansen's and her
lawyer, said that Ms. Hansen, when she lived in Denmark, helped
Danish Jews in their mass escape to Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   He added that she was later honored by Israel and the Israel
Bond Organization in Los Angeles for her efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hansen's husband died in 1980; she is survived by a sister,
Else Thomasen of Denmark.

AID OFFERS ABOUND FOR 14-YEAR-OLD WHO WANTS ABORTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KARINA BLAND  
 and KRIS MAYES  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lawmakers in Arizona want to send her to college.
</P>
<P>
   Parents as far way as Oklahoma want to adopt her.
</P>
<P>
   And strangers from around the country are offering her money,
clothing and a place to live.
</P>
<P>
   But only if she keeps her baby.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people want to help a 14-year-old girl who last week
received a judge's permission to have a late-term abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the girl decides to have the baby, there will be a
scholarship waiting for her,'' Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., said
Friday during a campaign stop on the Navajo Reservation in Window
Rock.
</P>
<P>
   He pledged $25,000. His offer was matched by former state
Attorney General Grant Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon later called former gubernatorial candidate and local
businessman Eddie Basha who, along with his son, promised an
unspecified amount of money. KFYI radio talk show host Barry Young
pledged $10,000 for the care of the young mother through the time
of delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like coercion to me,'' Bruce Miller, director of
Arizona Right to Choose, an abortion rights advocacy group, said of
all the offers. ``This is nothing more than trying to bribe a young
woman into continuing a pregnancy she doesn't want by throwing a
handful of coins in front of her.''
</P>
<P>
   He asked whether the men were going to give that much money to
every pregnant 14-year-old girl in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Jeff Groscost, R-Mesa, bristled at the suggestion
that the offers are bribes, saying such characterizations are
cynical.
</P>
<P>
   He said his office at the state Capitol has been deluged with
more than 600 telephone calls, including 300 from people who have
offered to either adopt the girl's yet-unborn baby or give her
money if she chooses to continue the pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really was just a groundswell of people saying, `We want to
put our money where our mouths are,' '' Groscost said.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Finkel, a doctor at Metro Phoenix Women's Center and a
strong abortion rights advocate, said lawmakers are unduly
influencing not only this girl but the judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this girl does not get her abortion because of the
strong-arming of lawmakers, she is going to become Arizona's next
multimillionaire,'' he said, alluding that lawyers would line up
behind her to sue the state for forcing her to continue her
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Miller says he's been in contact with the National Abortion
Rights Action League about the possibility of hiring an attorney
for the girl if the judge reverses his decision to allow the
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The Governor's Office has been flooded with calls as have the
court and the state Department of Economic Security.
</P>
<P>
   Tamra Burnett, a foster mother from the small farming community
of Lamont, Okla., is offering to adopt both the girl and her baby.
</P>
<P>
   A Flagstaff family, too, is offering her a home.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett read about the girl in her local newspaper. She has had
eight foster children since 1996 and two kids of her own, ages 7
and 11 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of times that these kids feel that nobody cares,
and I'm sure she feels that way,'' Burnett said. ``They lose
hope.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flagstaff home of Scott and Kelli Waxman, a finance manager
and math teacher, is licensed as a foster home. The couple also
want to care for the girl. They live on an Arabian horse ranch and
have already adopted one girl from state care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can provide the best schools, constant supervision,
spiritual guidance and modeling of effective parenting,'' they
wrote in a letter to the court. ``We would be glad to have the
court consider us for immediate placement of this young lady and/or
her baby.''
</P>
<P>
   John Jakubczyk, an attorney who represents Arizona Right to
Life, the state's largest anti-abortion group, said he, too, has
received dozens of calls from people from across the country who
want to adopt the yet-unborn baby. Others said they want to give
her money, baby clothes and other items.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's situation has even attracted the attention of
presidential candidates, including Arizona's Republican Sen. John
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a terrible tragedy,'' he said. ``I hope that she
would be assured that thousands of families would adopt her
child.'' &QL;

EDITORIAL NOTEBOOK: THE URBAN UN-JUNGLE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ELEANOR RANDOLPH  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Aug. 28:
</P>
<P>
   To the ordinary ear, the rules on keeping animals in New York
City always seemed perfectly clear. Pets must not be ``wild,
ferocious, fierce, dangerous or naturally inclined to do harm,''
the Health Department code advised for decades. Over time, however,
some residents found such language soft and fuzzy enough to allow
creatures that were undomesticated even for the streets of New
York. Six adult alligators, for example, once were found living in
a Brooklyn brownstone. One renter left behind a python in her
apartment bathtub. Then officials nabbed an illegal rooster in the
Bronx that might well have escaped detection had it not also broken
the city's noise ordinance every morning at dawn.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with so many ferocious arguments about which creatures are
fierce, the city recently banned 150 specific animals. Some of
those named have not been a big problem historically in the city,
but health officials decided not to let any more unwanted life
forms slip, slither or fly through their loopholes. So they banned,
among others, armadillos, polar bears, bees, iguanas, vultures,
prairie dogs, black widow spiders, Tasmanian devils, kangaroos,
pythons, whales _ yes, whales _ and ``all non-human primates.''
</P>
<P>
   So far the noisiest complaints have come not from sleazy dealers
in contraband animals but from tenacious supporters of the equally
tenacious ferret. Ferret owners believe their pets are sweet and
lovable. They shrug off veterinary warnings that ferrets have been
known to bite babies, and they were outraged when Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani suggested that a ferret advocate needed psychiatric help
for ``devoting your life to weasels.'' In truth, many of these
ferrets are actually European stoats, but in the city, stoats are
taboo as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Department, after listing range animals that even
Donald Trump could not hide in his apartment, has decided against
any ``animal dragnets.'' This makes sense given that the department
has more pressing issues. With passions running high, the City
Council is expected to reconsider the city's illegal pet list. If
experience to date offers any guidance, the Council's hearing on
this issue could be a zoo.

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Aug. 28:
</P>
<P>
   Finally, New York City's Charter Revision Commission offers a
flicker of good news. The commission chairman, Randy Mastro,
indicated Friday that it might be time to douse the political
firestorm his group ignited this summer by proposing to change the
way the city replaces a mayor who leaves office early. His move
could end suspicions that a commission loaded with Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's supporters has one overriding purpose _ to limit the
powers of one of Giuliani's least favorite politicians, Public
Advocate Mark Green.
</P>
<P>
   The way the charter works now, a mayor who leaves office early
is replaced by the public advocate. Thus if Giuliani wins the race
for Senate against Hillary Rodham Clinton next year, he will have
to give Green the keys to his City Hall office for a year, until
the next mayoral election in 2001. So this Charter Commission was
considering a referendum asking voters to approve a mayoral
election 60 days after the public advocate becomes mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Mastro hopes to persuade the commission next Wednesday to word
the item on succession so that it would not take effect until after
the mayoral vote in 2001. Fpom the start, this commission has been
a hasty and ill-conceived political exercise. Its hearings have
been held in the dead of August, and the election in November has
no citywide races to attract a cross-section of voters. But if the
commission changes the date on its succession item, at least those
voters who make it to the polls can decide more rationally on
issues, not personalities.

FIRE DANGERS BEFORE HOLIDAY WEEKEND WORRY FOREST, PARK OFFICIALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDD SLIVKA  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A forecast of warm, dry days leading into next week's long Labor
Day weekend has park and forest rangers in Washington state worried
that a careless hiker or camper could ignite the dry underbrush and
start a forest fire.
</P>
<P>
   Campfire restrictions already are in place at three state
campgrounds, including one in the popular San Juan Islands, and may
be expanded into the busiest camping week of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The fire danger west of the Cascades is ``moderate,'' but east
of the mountains, where temperatures have soared into the high 90s,
the risk is approaching ``very high.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the grass along the freeways is tinder dry. Firefighters in
Pierce County were called out twice this week to fight brush fires.
</P>
<P>
   One fire, at Interstate 5 and Pacific Highway South, briefly
shut down southbound lanes of the freeway Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern is man-caused fires. Someone throwing a cigarette
butt out the window. ... People need to be aware if they're going
camping or outdoors that it's getting dry out there,'' said John
Werth, a fire-weather forecaster with the National Park Service in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10,000 firefighters equipped with at least 700 fire
engines battled Western wildfires on Friday, assisted by scores of
helicopters and air tankers. Several of the fires were sparked by
lightning, and some have been burning since last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Colville Indian Reservation in Eastern Washington had two
fires this week, a 350-acre fire believed to have been caused by a
car and a 2,000-acre fire believed to be caused by a power surge in
a transformer. Neither fire caused much damage.
</P>
<P>
   The weather forecast for the next 10 days calls for
higher-than-normal temperatures coupled with little precipitation,
a combination that makes the twigs, grasses and fallen tree limbs
more flammable, Werth said.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of the growing fire hazard, Spencer Spit State Park on
Lopez Island is allowing only small fires in designated fire pits.
Lyons Ferry State Park near Starbuck in Eastern Washington has
banned fires and charcoal briquets, and Steamboat Rock State Park
near Grand Coulee Dam has banned fires in its primitive
campgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's dry spell comes at a time when regional
firefighting resources are beginning to be taxed. The federal
government Wednesday authorized National Guard troops to fight
fires if needed.
</P>
<P>
   While Washington has so far been spared large fires, Oregon and
California have not.
</P>
<P>
   In Oregon's Sheldon-Hart National Wildlife Refuge, 30,000 acres
_ much of it antelope habitat _ were on fire Friday. Authorities
expect to have it contained by Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   In California, the situation is worse. Authorities are fighting
19 fires from lightning strikes 22 miles north of Redding in the
Shasta-Trinity National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   Named the High Complex fire, only 5 percent of the 8,000-acre
fire was contained Friday, and nearly 900 structures were
threatened by the flames.
</P>
<P>
   In California' Modoc National Forest, nearly 18,000 acres south
of Tulelake are on fire. Only 25 percent of the fire had been
contained, and the fire was moving into areas where goshawks were
nesting.
</P>
<P>
   Still, firefighters have been gaining ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been able to handle the new starts and get a better
handle on what they're already fighting. Things are looking better
today,'' said Janelle Smith of the National Interagency Fire Center
in Boise, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Wildfires temporarily chased hundreds of residents from their
homes in California and Nevada early this week but have burned few
homes. There were no mandatory evacuations in effect Friday.

<P>
   Israel and the Palestinians are close to agreement on a
timetable for carrying out last year's Wye River peace agreement.
Similar progress is now needed in reviving talks between Israel and
Syria, which have been suspended for more than three years. Since
Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, took office in early July,
Israel and Syria have been talking through intermediaries like
Jordan and the United States. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
should use her visits to Jerusalem and Damascus next week to speed
the resumption of face-to-face talks.

president, Hafez al-Assad, it is time for the two countries to
begin narrowing their differences on the main issues. These include
the extent of Israeli withdrawals from the Golan Heights, the
precise nature of the diplomatic and economic relations Syria
offers in return and arrangements for assuring Israeli security and
access to water resources after a Golan withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   One issue holding up direct talks was Syria's insistence that
negotiations resume at the point they broke off in 1996. Damascus
claims Israel was prepared at the time to withdraw from the entire
Golan Heights if agreement was reached on all other issues. Israel
has a different view on how much progress was made then. But the
Barak government suggested last month that it was willing to pick
up from where the 1996 talks left off.
</P>
<P>
   If Syria is ready to make a full peace, it may be able to regain
legal sovereignty over the entire Golan. But it will have to accept
security provisions like demilitarized zones and monitoring
stations to assure that Israel's northern towns are not exposed to
surprise attack as they were before 1967. Some Israeli officials
have suggested that an Israeli withdrawal to the internationally
recognized boundary line, which would leave the entire eastern
shore of the Sea of Galilee in Israeli hands, could serve as the
basis for a settlement of water and other issues. It is up to Barak
to decide whether this proposal should be part of an overall
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   If agreement can be reached on Golan issues, arranging an
Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon should be relatively
straightforward. Barak has already declared that he wants to
withdraw all Israeli troops from Lebanon. But he will do so only if
he can be sure that Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas will not use the
border area to launch rocket attacks on northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Assad, who is the real power in Lebanon, can rein in Hezbollah,
but will not do so until he reaches a deal on the Golan. If the
Syrian peace track is going to move forward, Assad must do more
than just sit and listen when Ms. Albright comes calling. He will
have to offer compromise proposals of his own that can lead to
direct talks between Syria and Israel.

EDITORIAL: GUN CONTROL GAINS IN CALIFORNIA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, August 28:
</P>
<P>
   California, the scene of the latest shooting spree by a deranged
gunman, continues to move far out ahead of Washington and the rest
of the country on the issue of gun control. The gun safety measures
that Gov. Gray Davis signed into law Friday were the latest in a
series of initiatives that can only shame _ and with any luck will
inspire _ an indifferent Congress that is nowhere near agreement on
a far more modest package of reforms.
</P>
<P>
   California's progress this summer has been nothing short of
remarkable. Just last month the state enacted the country's
toughest ban on assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition
clips. It also cracked down on gun trafficking by limiting
individual handgun purchases to one a month _ a sensible idea that
has gone nowhere in Washington. Then last week Davis directed all
state agencies to destroy confiscated and other out-of-service
firearms instead of selling them.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's measures include the nation's most comprehensive ban on
so-called Saturday night specials, the cheap, poorly made handguns
commonly used in criminal activity. For the first time all handguns
manufactured or sold in California will have to meet minimum
quality and safety standards. This is a major breakthrough. About
80 percent of all Saturday night specials are manufactured in
southern California, and a similar measure was vetoed by the
previous governor, Pete Wilson. Like Massachusetts, California will
now require that handguns be tested to make sure they do not break
apart or fire when dropped _ a precaution to avoid the accidental
shootings that claimed the lives of 675 children in California
alone last year.
</P>
<P>
   Another new California safety measure will require that all guns
sold in the state after Dec. 31, 2001, be equipped with a
state-approved child-safety lock. This provision stops short of
requiring personalized handguns, those that can be fired only by
the authorized owner. But unlike the weak safety-lock provision
that is now languishing in Congress, California's version at least
requires that firearm safety devices meet reasonable standards of
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's signing ceremony was held at the Los Angeles hospital
where, just 18 days ago, wounded victims of Buford Furrow's assault
on a Jewish community center were brought for emergency treatment.
California's strong action on gun control will save lives. But no
matter how severe its laws, California cannot prevent criminals and
disturbed individuals from obtaining weapons in other states with
much looser gun laws. Gun violence is a national problem. For that
reason the vast majority of Americans, according to every poll, are
demanding national solutions.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress returns to work after Labor Day, it will be
interesting to see how much it has learned from the Furrow rampage,
and from California's brave efforts to stop the violence.

BOEING, MACHINISTS HUDDLE AS DEADLINE FOR FINAL OFFER NEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Weary negotiating teams from The Boeing Co. and its
largest union raced against the clock at a Sea-Tac hotel Friday
night grasping for a new labor agreement that might avert a strike
at the world's largest aerospace company.
</P>
<P>
   Offers and counteroffers were flying across the bargaining
table.
</P>
<P>
   But as a midnight deadline neared Friday night for Boeing to
present the union with its best and final offer, the union's leader
said the two sides remained far apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen some improvement in the day, but we are far apart.
... I'm still not optimistic we are going to avert a labor
dispute,'' said Bill Johnson, president of the Machinists union
that represents 44,000 of Boeing's 207,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing Chairman Phil Condit, who visited with his
negotiating team at the hotel in midafternoon, told reporters
afterward that he thought an agreement acceptable to the company
and the Machinists would be reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can reach an agreement that is good for our
employees,'' Condit said.
</P>
<P>
   Condit said he believed chances ``are reasonably good'' a strike
can be averted.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing planned to post its final offer on its Web site
(www.boeing.com) immediately after presenting it to the union late
Friday night. The union said it would respond by the weekend on its
Web site (www.iam751.org).
</P>
<P>
   Following a recommendation from union leadership, the Machinists
will vote on the contract Wednesday. The current contract expires
at 12:01 a.m. Thursday and a strike could begin immediately if
two-thirds of the Machinists vote to authorize it.
</P>
<P>
   Asked at the news conference what he would like to say to the
men and women of his company who could be on strike early Thursday
morning if the agreement is rejected, Condit said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I would ask them to look at it with great care. Look for what
is important to them, think about what is important to them and the
company and then vote. ... They are going to need to look at it and
say, `This is a fair offer or no it's not.' I believe if they look
at it they will discover its fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's Machinists have gone on strike after rejecting two of
the past three contracts. They last struck for 69 days in 1995. But
Boeing has never had back-to back strikes by its Machinists.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Flinn, a spokesman for the International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers, said Boeing gave the union a
``complete offer'' around noon Friday, but it was not the company's
final offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a compilation of everything,'' Flinn said. That
document served as the basis for negotiations the rest of the
afternoon and into the evening, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides would meet for a while, then break to caucus, and
then head back to the hotel bargaining room to continue the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side last night was willing to talk about details of the
negotiations until the company's final offer was on the table.
</P>
<P>
   But a union member familiar with the complete proposal the
company had presented to the union around noon told the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer it fell well short of what the Machinists need
to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing good in that proposal. We are on strike if
that's the best the company can do,'' the union member said. ``They
are playing hardball. Boeing obviously doesn't want to deliver 620
airplanes this year.''
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson, when interviewed in the early evening, cautioned
that talks would continue into the night until the company made its
final offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company still has time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Boeing, in its complete offer at noon, did not
insist on a flexible work week, one of the key issues that Johnson
had said could result in a strike.
</P>
<P>
   Asked at the news conference how important the flexible work
week is to Boeing, Condit said, ``A lot of people worry about that.
But where we get to in this contract, I don't think is critical at
this point. But it is something that is certainly of interest to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has argued that to become more efficient, it must have
the authority to scatter five-day shifts throughout the week,
including weekends.
</P>
<P>
   The company must now pay overtime for weekend work.
</P>
<P>
   The other key issues are:
</P>
<P>
   _Job security. The union wants a say in work that is outsourced.
Boeing wants the final say.
</P>
<P>
   _Health benefits. Boeing wants union members to begin partial
payment for their health care benefits. The union wants the current
plan left alone. Workers now don't pay anything.
</P>
<P>
   _Pensions. The union wants control over the pension plan and it
wants Boeing to contribute. The company wants to keep control, and
does not want to make payments at this time.
</P>
<P>
   Although not one of the so-called four major strike issues,
wages in the new contract were still considered by union leaders to
be critically important in getting Machinists a contract they could
approve.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the initial wage proposal made by the company
Friday was inadequate. ``It was far from where we need to be,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The average Boeing Machinist earns about $44,000 a year, not
counting benefits or overtime.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail sent to Boeing managers Friday, Jerry Calhoun,
leader of the Boeing negotiating team, said the company's hourly
pay scale is one of the highest in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Post-Intelligencer obtained a copy of the e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the realities is that we have to judge our proposal
against the labor agreements at our competitors and in related
industries,'' wrote Calhoun, the company's vice president of
employee and union relations.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that AlliedSignal, Lockheed Martin and Northwest
Airlines this year negotiated new contracts with Machinists that
called for wage increases of around 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how damaging a strike would be for Boeing, Condit said:
</P>
<P>
   ``No strike that I have ever seen is good for anybody, not the
company and not the employees. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you don't reach an agreement, that's the situation you
face. Then it becomes an issue of how long (a strike). ... The
company is in good financial condition. The fact is, we are a much
better balanced company today. We have a lot of other business.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the last strike in 1995, Boeing has greatly expanded its
military and space business by acquiring McDonnell Douglas in 1997
and the aerospace business of Rockwell in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing is supposed to deliver a record 620 airplanes this
year. A strike would certainly impede production efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Mulally, president of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, was
asked by reporters Wednesday during the rollout ceremony at the
Everett plant for Boeing's new 767-400 if the company could
continue to build airplanes if the Machinists struck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course you can't keep building airplanes when you don't
have the team that's here. ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Boeing's second-largest labor union that represents
about 25,000 engineers said it would support the Machinists if they
strike.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Seattle Professional Engineering Employees
Association, or SPEEA, cannot walk off the job, but they can
decline management requests to perform Machinist' work, said
Charles Bofferding, executive director of SPEEA.
</P>
<P>
   It is generally assumed that Boeing, given its horrible
financial performance the past two years, cannot afford to have its
airplane production disrupted by a strike.
</P>
<P>
   That perception is wrong, according to several industry analysts
interviewed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The union has done its best to make it look like they are in
the catbird's seat and Boeing is behind the eight-ball,'' said Paul
Nisbet, analyst with JSA Research. ``Quite the contrary.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Boeing could defer lost earnings until next year and
easily make up for undelivered planes, since the company only
expects to deliver 480 planes in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are in a build-down mode as Boeing is, it is very
easy after a strike to make up for delinquent deliveries.''

NEWHALL LAND TO OVERSEE CITY RANCH DEVELOPMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY CHARLES F. BOSTWICK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The Newhall Land and Farming Company, which
created Valencia and is planning to build 21,000 more homes on the
Ventura County line, announced it will help develop Kaufman and
Broad's massive City Ranch master-planned development.
</P>
<P>
   Through a joint venture with a Kaufman and Broad subsidiary,
Newhall Land acquired a 50.1 percent interest in the 1,900-acre
parcel in west Palmdale and will act as the master developer, with
day-to-day responsibility to build 4,200 houses, 300 apartment
units and 260,000 square feet of commercial space.
</P>
<P>
   ``This project allows us to diversify our income and asset base
into a nearby, complementary and strengthening housing market, and
establishes a model that could be used in other markets with other
builders, as well,'' said Newhall Land Chairman Thomas L. Lee in
the announcement Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A Newhall Land spokeswoman said construction of streets, sewers,
water lines and other infrastructure will probably begin early next
year on the acreage in the Ana Verde Valley, where cattle now
graze. The company expects to begin selling lots to builders in
late 2000.
</P>
<P>
   As it did in Valencia, Newhall Land will install the
infrastructure and grade the housing pads, then sell lots to
developers who will actually build the homes.
</P>
<P>
   The company expects the last of the lots to be sold within eight
years, if present real estate market trends continue.
</P>
<P>
   Newhall Land officials say the Palmdale development will be
complementary, not competitive, with their Valencia projects
because it will offer homes aimed at first-time and first move-up
home buyers who are priced out of closer-in communities, such as
Valencia.
</P>
<P>
   New home prices average about $153,000 in Palmdale, compared
with $302,000 in Santa Clarita.
</P>
<P>
   City Ranch home prices have not been set, but Newhall Land
spokeswoman Marlee Lauffer said they will be competitive with other
new homes in the Antelope Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Palmdale Mayor Jim Ledford said Newhall Land's interest in the
Antelope Valley is an indication of the growing strength of the
local housing market, and he expects the company to do a good job
of developing City Ranch, one of several large master-planned
communities proposed in the late 1980s in the Antelope Valley but
the only one now moving forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Newhall Land has done an exceptional job in the
Valencia area,'' Ledford said. ``They build real value into the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   City Ranch also will help boost the value of existing homes by
providing new-home prices to which existing homes can be compared
and by drawing in out-of-town buyers, the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   Approved in 1993 after much debate on the development's impact
on roads and city finances, City Ranch will cover what has been
mostly farm and cattle land in an area south of Elizabeth Lake Road
and about a mile west of Tierra Subida Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   City Ranch will comprise approximately 5,000 homes, neighborhood
shopping centers, schools, a lake, parks, riding and hiking trails,
and a public golf course.
</P>
<P>
   Newhall Land's venture does not include some parts of the City
Ranch development, including a 200-home subdivision under
construction by Kaufman and Broad adjacent to Elizabeth Lake Road
near 25th Street West.
</P>
<P>
   Newhall Land's portion will include approximately 4,200
single-family homes, 300 apartment units and 260,000 square feet of
store space.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes as Newhall Land is engaged in a legal
battle over its Newhall Ranch mini-city, planned on a 12,000-acre
tract along the Santa Clara River just east of the Ventura County
line and west of Valencia.
</P>
<P>
   Newhall Ranch won approval by the Los Angeles County Board of
Supervisors in April, but Ventura County filed suit seeking joint
approval authority over the project and a declaration that its
environmental impact report is inadequate.

industries,'' wrote Calhoun, the company's vice president of
employee and union relations.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that AlliedSignal, Lockheed Martin and Northwest
Airlines this year negotiated new contracts with Machinists that
called for wage increases of around 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how damaging a strike would be for Boeing, Condit said:
</P>
<P>
   ``No strike that I have ever seen is good for anybody, not the
company and not the employees. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you don't reach an agreement, that's the situation you
face. Then it becomes an issue of how long (a strike). ... The
company is in good financial condition. The fact is, we are a much
better balanced company today. We have a lot of other business.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the last strike in 1995, Boeing has greatly expanded its
military and space business by acquiring McDonnell Douglas in 1997
and the aerospace business of Rockwell in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing is supposed to deliver a record 620 airplanes this
year. A strike would certainly impede production efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Mulally, president of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, was
asked by reporters Wednesday during the rollout ceremony at the
Everett plant for Boeing's new 767-400 if the company could
continue to build airplanes if the Machinists struck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course you can't keep building airplanes when you don't
have the team that's here. ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Boeing's second-largest labor union that represents
about 25,000 engineers said it would support the Machinists if they
strike.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Seattle Professional Engineering Employees
Association, or SPEEA, cannot walk off the job, but they can
decline management requests to perform Machinist' work, said
Charles Bofferding, executive director of SPEEA.
</P>
<P>
   It is generally assumed that Boeing, given its horrible
financial performance the past two years, cannot afford to have its
airplane production disrupted by a strike.
</P>
<P>
   That perception is wrong, according to several industry analysts
interviewed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The union has done its best to make it look like they are in
the catbird's seat and Boeing is behind the eight-ball,'' said Paul
Nisbet, analyst with JSA Research. ``Quite the contrary.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Boeing could defer lost earnings until next year and
easily make up for undelivered planes, since the company only
expects to deliver 480 planes in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are in a build-down mode as Boeing is, it is very
easy after a strike to make up for delinquent deliveries.''

GAMES FIT THE CLASSIC NAME TO START 1999 SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Wendell Barnhouse 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   These are, for once, games deserving Classic with a capital
``C.''
</P>
<P>
   By tomorrow evening, the winners of the Pigskin and Kickoff
classics will be aglow with the hopes that this season could be
special. Rarely has a college football season started off with such
a double-barreled bang.
</P>
<P>
   It kicks off with two ``preseason'' games of national
significance. Today, No. 4 Arizona is at No. 3 Penn State in the
Pigskin Classic. Tomorrow, No. 9 Ohio State plays No. 12 Miami
(Fla.) in the Kickoff Classic in East Rutherford, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Also on tap today is North Carolina State at No. 17 Texas in the
Black Coaches Association Football Classic, and Kansas at No. 18
Notre Dame in the Eddie Robinson Classic. Louisiana Tech, which
replaced Auburn, plays at No. 1 Florida State in a game set up by
ESPN and which airs on ESPN2.
</P>
<P>
   Today's Arizona-Penn State game is only the second time a
preseason game has matched top five teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you might play a patsy in one of these games, but
that's not the case in these two games,'' Ohio State coach John
Cooper said. ``It should be a pretty interesting weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kickoff Classic has been played since 1983; the Pigskin
Classic since 1990. ``Preseason'' games are exempt from the NCAA
limit of 11 regular-season games and are designed as showcase games
to start the season. Historically, though, the games have had
little impact.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 25 Kickoff and Pigskin classics, two winners have gone on
to win national championships _ Florida State in 1993 and Nebraska
in 1994 from the Kickoff. Colorado won a share of the '90 title
after tying Tennessee in the Pigskin. Nebraska (1994) is the only
team to finish undefeated after playing in a preseason game, and
just five others have finished with one loss.
</P>
<P>
   Today's Arizona-Penn State game matches two teams that are bona
fide national championship contenders. The Wildcats are coming off
the best season (12-1) in school history and return 15 starters.
The Nittany Lions were 9-3 last season and have perhaps the
nation's best defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're a talented team,'' Penn State middle
linebacker Brandon Short said. ``And we'll see how good we are
right off the bat.`
</P>
<P>
   Arizona coach Dick Tomey, whose team plays at TCU on Sunday
night, Sept. 5, sought the trip to Penn State for today's game to
challenge his team for the upcoming season. The Wildcats might be
thinking ``national title,'' but they're not talking about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any way any team in America can talk
about being national champions,'' said Arizona senior Keith Smith,
who shares the team's two-quarterback system with junior Ortege
Jenkins. ``There are so many big games to be played every week.
Shoot, we've got Penn State to start with right off the bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State and Miami are probably a notch below Arizona and Penn
State. The Buckeyes have major holes to fill at quarterback and
linebacker a season after finishing 11-1. The Hurricanes, favored
to win the Big East Conference, are still recovering from the
effects of NCAA-mandated scholarship limitations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can really measure your program when you challenge the
team and play somebody good instead of playing a team you're going
to beat 55-0 where the starters will be sitting down after the
first or second quarter,'' said Miami coach Butch Davis, who is
31-15 in four seasons. ``The Kickoff Classic adds a lot to the
program, it's national exposure and it's already helped our
recruiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Miami also has games with Penn State (Sept. 18) and
Florida State (Oct. 9), Davis joked that ``they're trying to get
the coach fired.'' Ohio State also has a challenging schedule, with
UCLA visiting on Sept. 11 and Big Ten Conference games at Penn
State and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend's losers, though, won't give up hope of a national
title.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to lose, you better lose early,'' said Cooper,
whose team lost late, to Michigan State the first weekend in
November, last season and was painted out of the national
championship picture. ``Then you better win the rest of your games
then hope that you get some help from some other teams.'' nn

MCIVER BEATS ODDS TO PLAY FOR COWBOYS

<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Everett McIver shouldn't even be in the
NFL. Anyone else and his alma mater, Elizabeth City State
University, would have done what it does best: send him out into
the world as a hard-working teacher, not a professional football
player.
</P>
<P>
   Odds, however, have always been outmatched against the 6-foot-5,
330-pound sixth-year pro. Like when he went undrafted, soon to be
followed by being signed and cut by the Chargers, signed and cut by
the Cowboys, and then signed a third time to the Jets' practice
squad, all in an eight-month period.
</P>
<P>
   He experienced tragedy when his 3-month-old daughter, Morquisha,
died during heart surgery in an attempt to reverse a sudden
irregular heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Last season McIver was stabbed in the neck with a pair of
scissors during training camp, then suffered torn ligaments in both
knees on separate occasions.
</P>
<P>
   But McIver has overcome those injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not too much out there that can deter me,'' said
McIver, who explained that his drive to succeed is fueled by his
daughter's death. ``She went into heart surgery and didn't make it
out again. My heart, my focus, my career right now is her. She
didn't know what was going on, of course, but if she can do that, I
can overcome anything out here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been hard work getting here,'' McIver said Tuesday, the
day after returning to practice for the first time since undergoing
major knee surgery Nov. 25. ``I'm not going to leave that easy.''
</P>
<P>
   He came to Dallas after playing two seasons in Miami. McIver has
found a home at right guard and is regarded as a potential
cornerstone on the offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that potentially, and that's a dangerous word many
times, that he is a player of that caliber,'' offensive line coach
Hudson Houck said. ``I am very excited about his future.''
</P>
<P>
   McIver is expected to see his first exhibition action tomorrow
at home against the Denver Broncos. It's unlikely he will play the
entire first half. But it will mark the first time he's played in a
game since Nov. 22 against Seattle when he tore ligaments in his
left knee.
</P>
<P>
   In typical McIver pile-on-the-odds fashion, the ACL injury
occurred during his anticipated return to the lineup following torn
ligaments in his right knee in Week 5. That injury kept him out six
weeks and interrupted a fast start in which he had begun to emerge
as a dominant presence. The injuries limited him to six starts.
However, McIver quickly won over coach Chan Gailey and Houck with
his powerful run-blocking ability and his agility as a pass
blocker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was just getting comfortable when he got hurt,''
Houck said. ``I think he has only touched the tip of the iceberg.''
</P>
<P>
   McIver said he is far from 100 percent, but that his knees feel
well enough to play. He said he will start in the Sept. 12 season
opener at Washington with ``expectations of playing the entire
game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has looked pretty good,'' Gailey said. ``I've been
impressed with how he's moved and hit.''
</P>
<P>
   McIver is expected to be a major part of a retooled offensive
line that dropped left guard Nate Newton and added Mark Stepnoski
at center and moved second-year player Flozell Adams from guard to
tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie tackle Solomon Page has been forced to play guard during
McIver's absence. Gailey said Page will remain there as a backup.
</P>
<P>
   Left guard Larry Allen and right tackle Erik Williams are the
other remaining regulars in their usual positions. McIver's return
upgrades the unit to full strength. Two more preseason games,
against AFC playoff teams Denver and Jacksonville, plus two more
practices, will provide time to meld before heading into game-week
preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you lose time on the field it hurts,'' McIver said.
``It bothers me because I want to get a feel for the guys next to
me. My timing is off, but I don't feel like I'm way off. I'm just
happy to be where I'm at.''

STARS CAP SEASON TICKET SALES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING _ Stars fans will have to battle harder than ever to get
tickets this season as the defending Stanley Cup champions have
capped season ticket sales for the first time in franchise history
and have raised ticket prices at almost every level.
</P>
<P>
   Stars season tickets have reached 14,500, and the Stars have
started a waiting list for season ticket purchases. Individual game
tickets _ now the only way to buy tickets for a Stars game this
season _ go on sale tomorrow for home games in September
(preseason) and October.
</P>
<P>
   Individual game tickets are available at $42, $32 and $20 levels
_ up from $32.50, $22.50 and $14 last season. Ticket prices for
season-ticket renewals were raised 8 to 12 percent and ticket
prices for new season tickets were raised 20 to 30 percent, said
Jeff Cogen, vice president of marketing and promotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have we had some complaints? Sure,'' Cogen said. ``But for the
most part, season ticket holders were not offended, and new season
ticket buyers were lining up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars had the third-highest payroll in the NHL last season
at $40 million, and owner Tom Hicks said the franchise did not make
money, despite playing host to 12 home playoff dates. Raising
ticket prices with the heavy demand was expected, Cogen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put a lot of thought into every change,'' Cogen said. ``But
there are some issues of supply and demand.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars sold out all but three of their 53 home dates last
season and expect to sell out every home game this season. With a
capacity of 17,001, the Stars will make available for sale 2,501
individual seats per home game. nn

NELSON CAUTIOUS ON FORWARD PROGRESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ As expected, the Mavericks signed free-agent forwards
Gary Trent and Cedric Ceballos yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Trent signed a one-year, $2 million contract with an option for
a second year that _ because of the NBA's salary cap rules _ could
pay him more than $2.2 million during the 2000-2001 season.
Ceballos signed a two-year contract for $8.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Mavericks have made their big off-season moves, one
question comes into play: Has this team been improved for the
1999-2000 season?
</P>
<P>
   Asked for his thoughts, Mavericks coach/general manager Don
Nelson said: ``I ain't saying nothing. You got me last year, you
ain't getting me this year. You can be dumb, but you can only be
dumb one time.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson was referring to his bold comments before last season
when he predicted that the Mavericks were good enough to make the
playoffs, or be in the race during the final week of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks did win eight of their final 14 games last season.
The only problem is they won only 11 of their opening 36 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, they played about like how I'd hope they would play
at the end of the year,'' Nelson said. ``I was hoping we'd play
that way all year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's better than not having it happen at all. But it was
still too late for us to make any noise.''
</P>
<P>
   Trent was busy house-hunting in North Dallas yesterday and
didn't stick around to explain how this deal made financial sense
for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very excited to be back with the Mavericks,'' were
Trent's words on a Mavericks press release. ``I had a taste of
success last season and I want to continue to have success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully we can get a jump-start on things and make a good
run this year. Anytime you are part of success it sticks in your
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Termini, Trent's agent,, said the 6-foot-8 forward turned
down several offers from other teams to remain with the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say the entire situation that Gary started in Dallas
last season outweighed other situations that were presented to
us,'' Termini said. ``There's a lot of value put to how you're
being used, and the known factors that exist in a situation where
you're enjoying personal success, and where you see room and
potential for team success.
</P>
<P>
   ``That cannot be discounted, and that weighed heavily in the
decision to reject other situations in order to return to the
Mavericks. But there were a number of elements, and all the
elements that Dallas presented resulted in him making that decision
to return here.''
</P>
<P>
   Forward Samaki Walker's decision to leave is another matter.
Walker, who signed a free-agent contract Wednesday with San Antonio
Spurs, is the only lottery pick in the last seven drafts to leave
his team without that team getting something in return.
</P>
<P>
   The last lottery pick to do so was Shaquille O'Neal _ Orlando's
top pick in 1992 who bolted to the Los Angeles Lakers in 1996. The
Mavericks drafted Walker ninth in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would all hoped that would happen, but you can't predict
the future,'' Don Nelson said. ``I don't want you to make a big
issue out of that. That will take care of itself once the time
comes. Nobody's worried about that.'' ANSTEY ALMOST FREE
</P>
<P>
   Don Nelson said he will not offer Chris Anstey a contract
extension before this season.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he will let the 7-footer play out his third season and
become a free agent next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Anstey, the 18th pick of the 1997 draft, averaged just 2.8
points and 2.3 rebounds last season while shooting a team-low 29
percent from the field. He averaged 5.9 points and 3.8 rebounds
while shooting 39.8 percent from the floor as a rookie. GREEN
UPDATE
</P>
<P>
   Don Nelson contacted A.C. Green's agent, Mark Fleisher,
yesterday to inform him of the team's interest in signing the
free-agent forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a little light in depth upfront, and it'll be nice to
have another bigger player, a veteran,'' Nelson said. ``It looks
like \RGreen's\S got some other offers that he's going to take, but
we just let him know we still love him, and if it doesn't work out
that he should call us.'' nn

FASSERO OBTAINED FOR MINOR-LEAGUER AS STARTER OPTION (For use by
NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The Rangers, hoping to catch lightning in a bottle for
their left-handed-starved pitching rotation, acquired left-hander
Jeff Fassero from the Seattle Mariners yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   They parted with a minor-league player who will be identified in
October. The Rangers accepted responsibility for the remaining
$997,238 of the struggling pitcher's $4.75 million contract this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero, 36, went 4-14 with a 7.38 earned-run average in 30
appearances (24 starts) for the Mariners this season and entered
last night's game leading all American League pitchers in runs
(123) and home runs (34) allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero also shares the league lead in losses with Detroit's
Brian Moehler and ranked among the worst 10 in hits allowed (188)
and walks issued (73).
</P>
<P>
   Fassero will begin his stint with the Rangers in their bullpen,
with an opportunity to join the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the reasons for this move,'' manager Johnny
Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers wanted a left-handed starter for their potential
postseason rotation because possible opponents New York, Cleveland,
Toronto and Oakland have a number of quality left-handed hitters in
their lineups. Left-handed batters have hit only .252 (32-for-127)
against Fassero.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had a lot of success against left-handers this year,''
Oates said. ``That's the reason we got him. A change of scenery
sometimes does a veteran guy good. I know it's been a rough year
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The origin of Fassero's abysmal season might be traced to minor
surgery to remove bone chips from his left elbow after the 1998
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's healthy, but I think it took something out of him,''
Seattle manager Lou Piniella said, ``and it might be a year before
his arm comes back entirely. As a starter, we went with him as long
as we possibly could. I felt we gave him every opportunity. We were
hoping he would turn his fortunes around because he's a good guy
and he works hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers made room for Fassero on their 40-man roster by
transferring left-hander Eric Gunderson (torn labrum/rotator cuff,
left shoulder) from the 15-day to 60-day disabled list. The Rangers
probably will option left-hander Corey Lee to Triple-A Oklahoma
before this afternoon's game to make room for Fassero on the 25-man
roster.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero, who can become a free agent after this season, provides
the Rangers a left-handed long reliever and an option to
right-hander Mike Morgan for the rotation. Morgan has not pitched
more than five innings in any of his past five starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to Mike,'' Oates said. ``Mike knows what's going
on. We'll make our decisions after the Detroit series based on
need.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers claimed Fassero on waivers Wednesday and completed
the trade after reaching an agreement on the minor-league player
involved yesterday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives us some versatility,'' Melvin said of obtaining
Fassero. ``He's got experience. He knows the league. He knows the
hitters.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The seesaw was due to be up for Octavio Dotel, to
bounce the rookie pitcher up high after a troubled start. By Bobby
Valentine's theory, a young pitcher who throws adeptly in one game
is likely to be awful in the next. Emotion and adrenaline combine
with the physical and mental toll that a sterling outing can exact
on those too inexperienced to know how to cope, and Dotel's recent
history proved Valentine's premise.
</P>
<P>
   After taking a no-hitter into the seventh inning two starts ago,
Dotel was knocked around for eight hits and four runs in five
innings in his most recent start. If he had been at the bottom of
the seesaw then, his knees scraping in the dirt, this was _ for the
Mets _ a fortuitous night for his rebound. Dotel, making just his
11th major league start, sprung up and held the Arizona
Diamondbacks, the top team in the National League West, to just
four hits in eight innings en route to a 6-3 victory. The victory
in the first game of a six-game road trip keeps the Mets 1 1/2
games out of first place in the National League East behind the
Braves, who beat St. Louis Friday night, 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's physical,'' Valentine said of Dotel's struggles
after good starts. ``When you start out guys like that and they
have an emotional game, I think it's tough to recover for the next
start.''
</P>
<P>
   Dotel's hangover from the near-miss no-hitter lasted for just
one game. The Mets had been 1-5 against Arizona this season, but
Dotel _ who could lose his spot in the starting rotation when
either Rick Reed or Bobby Jones comes off the disabled list _ was
making his first career start against the Diamondbacks. He
effectively mixed speeds with a curveball, dazzling Arizona with a
sizzling fastball that was clocked as high as 93 mph. In the first
five innings, only one runner _ the first of the game, Tony Womack
_ got to third base and only one other, Andy Fox in the third, got
to second.
</P>
<P>
   Dotel did not give up a run until the sixth inning, and by then
the Mets had already given him a four-run lead and his fastball had
not failed him. On his 102nd pitch, which he used to strike out Fox
in the eighth, Dotel threw 90 mph. He retired the side in that
inning, and as it ended on his 110th _ and final _ pitch, he
pounded the grass in glee. He had thrown 76 strikes and just 34
balls, had walked one and struck out six.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine will not discuss what he will do with his rotation
when Reed and Jones are healthy, and Dotel's inexperience surely
hurts his chances of pitching in the final month of the season. But
the victory _ which Armando Benitez finished after Billy Taylor
failed to retire any of the three batters he faced in the ninth _
improved Dotel's record to 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' offense gave Dotel all the support he needed early in
the game. Arizona starter Omar Daal, who had won his last three
decisions and had already won two this season, against the Mets,
was touched quickly when Rickey Henderson led off the game with a
double to left field and Edgardo Alfonzo, who would finish 3 for 4
with a walk, batted him in with a single.
</P>
<P>
   In the second inning, with one out, Shawon Dunston singled and
went to third on Benny Agbayani's double, then scored when Rey
Ordonez grounded out. In the sixth inning, the Diamondbacks
intentionally walked Agbayani to load the bases and Ordonez hit a
two-run single to short left center field in the sixth inning,
Daal's last, to give the Mets a 4-0 lead. Ordonez's three runs
batted in tied a career high. After Arizona got a run back in its
half of the sixth, the Mets added runs in the seventh and the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   But by that time, Dotel could afford to watch Benitez work while
Dotel bounced against the dugout railing and wondered which way the
seesaw would swing for him next time _ or whether he would still be
perched on it at all.

SOSA SILENT AS DODGERS WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For the Dodgers, the good thing about hosting the
dangerous Sammy Sosa is that he comes attached to pitcher Steve
Trachsel every fifth day.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's assault on Mark McGwire's home run record stalled Friday
night during a 9-0 rout of the Chicago Cubs in front of 44,230 at
Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no stopping the slide of Trachsel, who was
hammered again in his sad run to become baseball's first 20-game
loser since Oakland's Brian Kingman 22 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   While every Sosa at-bat brought cheers and a procession of
flashbulbs from the fans, the most impressive part of the night was
the Dodgers offense, which battered Trachsel (4-16) for seven
earned runs and a season-high 11 hits.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers strung together five consecutive base hits during a
four-run fifth inning that put the game away.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because it has been missing most of the season, the
offense overshadowed an impressive performance by Dodgers
right-hander Ismael Valdes (9-11), who went the distance for his
first victory since July 16 at Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes deserved more attention, but he was pitching against the
last-place Cubs, who are 5-21 in August.
</P>
<P>
   Not even Sosa's 53 homers, which put him eight games ahead of
last year's pace when he hit 66, could pull this team out of its
funk.
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning, Sosa struck out on a 3-2 fastball up around
his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   He tapped to short on the first pitch in the fourth inning and
grounded out in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   And with Mark Grace aboard with no outs in the ninth, Valdes got
Sosa to ground into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, who has battled blisters, a bruised pitching hand and
lower back pain this season, allowed the Cubs just seven hits and
did not walk a batter.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago leadoff hitter Lance Johnson was the only Cub to figure
out Valdes, getting three hits.
</P>
<P>
   He was the only runner to reach third all night, after doubling
with one out in the second and advancing on a fly ball by second
baseman Chad Meyers.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, who needed just 106 pitches for his second complete game
and first shutout of the season, sailed after Johnson's double.
</P>
<P>
   He retired 12 of the next 13 batters and benefited from two
Dodgers double plays that ended the eighth and ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers got to Trachsel in the second inning when third
baseman Adrian Beltre hit an opposite-field two-run homer into the
lower right-field stands. It was his 15th of the season.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, Eric Young opened with a double and Mark
Grudzielanek, Gary Sheffield, Raul Mondesi and Todd Hollandsworth
followed with singles.
</P>
<P>
   Trachsel stayed in the game but lasted just four batters into
the sixth when the Dodgers scored two more.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a winless streak that included four losses and three
no-decisions, Valdes has been one of the Dodgers' most consistent
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   He followed his victory over the Angels by getting battered
against Colorado. But since then, Valdes has allowed just 16 runs
in his last 491/3 innings with an ERA of 2.92.

BIG UNIT MAKING BID TO RECLAIM HIS HALL SPACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Mariners can pat themselves on the back. Ten of
Randy Johnson's record-setting 301 strikeouts in his first 29
starts this season were notched during the Big Unit's 6-0 shutout
back on July 20.
</P>
<P>
   Safeco Field was Johnson's personal strikeout palace for one
night.
</P>
<P>
   So, in a way, Seattle can still consider itself a bit player in
Johnson's still-rising career.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Johnson set a record for posting the quickest 300
K's in one season. He nudged past Pedro Martinez's 1997 mark of 300
strikeouts in 31 games. He also joined Nolan Ryan and Sandy Koufax
as the only three pitchers to reach the 300 mark in three different
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Here's guessing that being in the company of such Hall of Famers
is giving Johnson a sense of baseball immortality. Though it's a
tall order, maybe now he'll bear down on Ryan's 1979 single-season
record of 383 strikeouts. After all, Johnson knows about tall.
</P>
<P>
   Although it took years for Johnson to harness his power and
channel his ornery edge into the psyche of a dominating pitcher, he
is putting an undeniably impressive finish to his career _ although
he would probably glower at the mere inference that his time is
anywhere close to being over.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Johnson can keep this up for the length of his $53 million
contract with the Diamondbacks. (He'll be hard-pressed to match
Ryan's seven 300-strikeout seasons, but you never know.)
</P>
<P>
   Goodness knows the Big Unit can motivate himself like none
other, and certainly just thinking back to how the Mariners refused
to believe big money was a worthwhile investment for a 6-foot-10
power pitcher coming off back surgery is plenty of fuel for
Johnson's fire.
</P>
<P>
   At 35 years old, Johnson has told people this is his best season
ever. Who would doubt him?
</P>
<P>
   If he had gotten run support during those five overpowering
outings that the D-backs lost, Johnson would be one win away from
that coveted 20-win plateau.
</P>
<P>
   While Johnson's 1995 Cy Young season with the Mariners was the
undeniable emergence of the game's premier left-hand power pitcher,
Johnson has since found his career and his reputation in the
hamper.
</P>
<P>
   There was back surgery in '96 that limited his action. In '97,
he was again impressive, but the Mariners were driven out of the
American League Division Series by the Orioles _ with Johnson
losing twice to Mike Mussina.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Johnson let his contract status and the Mariners'
fumbling diminish his concentration. He pitched good enough in
Seattle only on the occasions when he was attempting to bolster his
trade value so that the Mariners could move him.
</P>
<P>
   And while he won games and struck out 300 after moving to
Houston, the Astros, too, lost in the first round of the playoffs,
and Johnson turned out to be a rent-a-pitcher who cost the Astros
three very good players in Freddy Garcia, John Halama and Carlos
Guillen.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after signing with the D-backs, Johnson suffered the
accusations that he was merely taking the money and the convenience
of playing near his family's new Scottsdale palace.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, Johnson is cruising. The D-backs are winning. This
is his best season ever, so he says.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, it is difficult to not pay attention to what Johnson
is up to. Even as the success of Halama and Garcia help erase doubt
that good deals can be made for rare, one-of-a-kind players,
Johnson's ability and accomplishments can not be overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   However, Johnson's declaration that this is his best season ever
will only become fact if his Diamondbacks make it not only to the
postseason, but to the National League Championship Series or,
better yet, the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   It is his time to provide further proof of his dominance.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, when Johnson's accomplishments cause Mariner fans pain
instead of good-natured curiosity, he can take pride in
substantiating his true market value, not to mention staking his
claim for some sort of baseball immortality.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT SPORTS IS REALLY ABOUT: Those Nike ads featuring Tiger
Woods bouncing a golf ball off the face of a club for 27 seconds
before belting it a la Ken Griffey Jr. into the distance have
caused more than just a buzz among TV watchers.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Titleist has filed a lawsuit charging false
advertising and contract interference. Nike admits the young Master
Woods uses Titleist golf balls in the Nike ad, although a new Nike
deal estimated at $80 million could have Tiger solely under
contract to Nike. Indeed, as Nike promised, Woods is changing the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ALL-CENTURY TEAM REVISION: OK, thanks for all the input and
friendly reprisals. Willie Mays was a ludicrous omission, and, yes,
Pete Rose was really a third baseman, but he was listed as an
outfielder. I'm still guessing The Banned One will be on the field
at the World Series, now that commissioner Bud Selig has said Rose
will be invited to attend if he is voted onto the All-Century Team.

VANCOUVER PRODUCT MAKES BIG-LEAGUE DEBUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Robert Ramsay pitched Friday night in the third major
league game he ever attended.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Vancouver, Wash., the Mariners left-hander made
just two trips to the Kingdome, once when he was 14 and again in
1995, when the Minnesota Twins invited him to watch them play in
Seattle after drafting him.
</P>
<P>
   Friday at Yankee Stadium, the 25-year-old left-hander worked
22/3 innings in relief of starter Gil Meche in the Mariners' 8-0
loss to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Words can't describe it,'' said Ramsay, after finding his
locker Friday afternoon. ``I've been looking forward to this moment
ever since I was a kid, and to have my first big-league experience
in Yankee Stadium, it's like a dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to stay down-to-earth, trying to not get caught up
in the moment too much. I've got a job to do.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, that job is middle to long relief, although Ramsay was
a starter at Class AAA Tacoma, where he went 4-1 with a 1.08 earned
run average after coming over from Boston for Butch Huskey on July
26. With Class AAA Pawtucket in the Red Sox's system, he was 6-6,
5.35.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really can't explain it,'' Ramsay said. ``I don't know if it
was the change of scenery or if going from the East Coast to the
West Coast motivated me a little bit. But my last few starts in
Pawtucket were pretty good, and maybe it just carried over into
Tacoma.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramsay, a Washington State alumnus, entered Frida's game in the
fourth inning, with runners at first and third and the Mariners
trailing 4-0. He got ahead of Paul O'Neill, 1-and-2, but his next
two curveballs missed high and a low fastball bounced just past the
plate for ball four, loading the bases.
</P>
<P>
   With Bernie Williams batting, Ramsay uncorked a wild pitch with
the curveball, bringing in a run. After an intentional walk, he
recovered to strike out Tino Martinez, throwing two sharp curves.
Chili Davis singled in two runs, but Ramsay recovered to pitch a
scoreless fifth and sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``My release point on (the curveball) early wasn't where I
wanted it to be at all,'' Ramsay said. ``I got ahead on the
hitters; I just couldn't put them away. ... (But) it was a dream of
mine. You live for that, coming in in a tough situation. I wish I
could have had better results in that first inning, but hopefully
I'll learn from it.''
</P>
<P>
   ROSTER SHUFFLE: The Mariners considered promoting outfielder
Charles Gipson instead of Ramsay, because with Jay Buhner suspended
until Sunday, the club has just three reserve position players. But
with a doubleheader on Monday in Chicago, manager Lou Piniella went
with another pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Frankie Rodriguez is the most likely candidate for a spot start
against the White Sox, although Piniella said there is a ``good
possibility'' Ramsay will get a chance to start in September.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA BASES: Second baseman David Bell was back in the lineup
after leaving Wednesday's game with a migraine headache. Bell took
medication Wednesday and did not travel with the team. The pain
stayed with him overnight, but by Thursday morning it was gone. ...
With Yankees left-hander Andy Pettitte pitching Sunday, Piniella
said Bell will make his season debut at first base that day, with
Rafael Bournigal starting at second. Bell will be the seventh
Mariner to play first since David Segui was traded July 28. Catcher
Dan Wilson became the sixth when he played the eighth inning there
Friday for the first time in his career. ... Yankees bench coach
Don Zimmer was admitted to Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center on
Thursday night for neck pain and evaluation of a minor cardiac
abnormality. The Yankees said Zimmer, 68, has been treated for the
heart condition in the past. ... Saturday is Piniella's 56th
birthday.

MARINERS CAN'T GET OVER THEIR `HICCUPS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's not that the Mariners have been inconsistent
this season. More than anything, they've been streaky, and whether
they're on a winning or losing streak has come down to the same
thing.
</P>
<P>
   When they play also-rans, they win. When they play contenders,
they don't. It's why the Mariners have been at .500, or a few games
below, for almost two months. And it's why a series like the one
that began in the Bronx Friday night tells so much about where the
team stands.
</P>
<P>
   As manager Lou Piniella put it, referring to games with
contenders, ``We can't afford any hiccups.''
</P>
<P>
   In that case, maybe the Mariners should hold their breath, chug
some water or breathe into a bag. They lost 8-0 to Roger Clemens
and the New York Yankees Friday, and hiccupped all the while.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners trailed by seven runs after four innings as the
defending World Series champions took advantage of a pair of
rookies who had never visited Yankee Stadium before. Gil Meche gave
up six runs in 31/3 innings, dropping his record to 4-4, and
newcomer Robert Ramsay allowed a walk and a wild pitch before
recording his first major league out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every pitch I threw I thought I'd like to have back,'' said
Meche. ``I didn't feel like I made any good, key pitches out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   His counterpart encountered trouble of his own early on. In the
first inning, the M's had runners at second and third with one out.
Alex Rodriguez swung at a low Clemens breaking ball, burying it
into the ground. Brian Hunter dashed from third, but Clemens rushed
in, barehanded the ball and made a tumbling flip to catcher Joe
Girardi, who was waiting when Hunter slid head-first into home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made the perfect play,'' Hunter said. ``If he doesn't make
the perfect play, it's 1-0 in the first.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, after a walk that loaded the bases, Clemens got Tom
Lampkin to fly out, ending the inning. The M's never got another
runner to third against the five-time Cy Young Award winner, who
limited Seattle to three singles over the next seven innings.
Clemens (12-6) worked eight innings in all, striking out nine and
walking three.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to get him early, and we didn't,'' said hitting coach
Jesse Barfield. ``That first inning told the story of the ballgame.
We had him on the ropes and didn't capitalize. When you get chances
against a guy like Roger Clemens, you can't let him off the
ropes.''
</P>
<P>
   But lately, the Mariners have been making a habit of that.
They've won three of their last seven games, but have hit .210 and
averaged 2.86 runs per game in that span. Several players have
struggled _ David Bell is 4-for-26, Ryan Jackson 0-for-13 and Dan
Wilson 1-for-15. Russ Davis has one extra-base hit since Aug. 9.
Raul Ibanez is batting .156 in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens pitched well Friday, Rodriguez said. But the shortstop
was careful not to give too much praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our own problems to deal with right now,'' Rodriguez
said. ``We're not swinging the bats particularly well. You have to
give (Clemens) some credit, but at the same time, we're not
swinging the bats well.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez singled and stole second in the fourth, but was thrown
out at third by Bernie Williams while trying to tag up on a fly to
center. The Mariners' other double play was equally crushing: in
the sixth, Ken Griffey Jr. swung at a high pitch for strike three
on a hit-and-run that ended with Bell getting thrown out at second.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees got to Meche early, scoring once in the first on a
ground out and twice in the second on a Derek Jeter single. Meche
worked a scoreless third, but three of the first four Yankees got
hits in the fourth, knocking him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the bullpen, I kind of realized I was throwing my fastball
up,'' Meche said. ``I couldn't throw it down in the zone. I figured
once I got out on the mound, I'd make adjustments. From the get-go,
I couldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither could Ramsay, at least at first. Ramsay, who allowed two
inherited runners to score and also allowed a run of his own before
throwing two scoreless innings, is the 14th rookie pitcher the M's
have used this season. He is Seattle's 27th pitcher overall,
extending a franchise record.
</P>
<P>
   The loss dropped the Mariners to 8-19 against the American
League's first-place teams, and put them a game under .500 overall.

ARIZONA JUDGE GIVES NOD TO LATE-TERM ABORTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KARINA BLAND AND CHRIS MOESER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ A judge on Friday affirmed his decision to allow a
14-year-old girl to have a controversial late-term abortion,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The girl is to go to Kansas for the abortion unless an appeal by
the Arizona Attorney General's Office is successful, sources close
to the case said. No date has been set, but child welfare officials
say they won't take her until all appeals have been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jane Hull first said there was little the state could do to
stop the abortion but changed direction Thursday and asked that the
girl's competency be re-evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's decision had the Governor's Office working late into
the night planning a second appeal, sources said. The appeal was
expected to be filed late Friday or early Saturday, most likely in
Maricopa County Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Napolitano, a Democrat, initially refused
to file an appeal, sources said. But she changed her mind after
Hull threatened to hire former Attorney General Grant Woods and
former attorney general candidate Tom McGovern, both Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Napolitano declined to comment Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Governor's Office on Thursday askedJudge William Sargeant of
Maricopa County Superior Court to reconsider his ruling after
receiving an onslaught of criticism about the decision that would
allow the girl to leave the state to have an abortion, sources
said.
</P>
<P>
   With every day that passes, it becomes less likely that the girl
will get the abortion she wants. Fewer doctors will perform the
procedure the later she goes into her pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the political stalling has forced this young woman to
continue a pregnancy against her will, I think we've all lost, this
girl more than anyone else,'' said Bruce Miller, director of
Arizona Right to Choose, an abortion rights group.
</P>
<P>
   Already, at 24 weeks along, the girl faces a difficult and
taxing procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney John Jakubczyk, who represents Arizona Right to Life,
the state's largest anti-abortion group, said public outcry will be
deafening if the girl is allowed to have the late-term abortion
because the fetus, if born now, has a 50 percent chance of
survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk about backlash,'' he said. ``The people will go nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally, abortions are not performed in Arizona much after the
first trimester because state law prohibits the procedure once the
fetus is considered ``viable,'' although what constitutes
``viability'' varies from state to state and doctor to doctor.
</P>
<P>
   But experts agree that a 24-week-old fetus would have roughly a
50 percent chance of survival if born prematurely, though it likely
would have some sort of disability at this stage. A fetus born
before 24 weeks has no chance of survival.
</P>
<P>
   Each week, a fetus' chance of survival improves. For example,
babies born at 26 weeks stand a 95 percent chance of survival in
the nursery at Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center, said a
Phoenix doctor who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   State officials have the option of sending the girl to either
California or Kansas, the only states that routinely perform
late-term abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas law is the most liberal, allowing abortions well into the
third trimester under certain circumstances, including danger to
the life of the mother and possible impairment to physical and/or
mental health.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are all very dreadful procedures,'' Dr. Carolyn Gerster,
chairwoman of Arizona Right to Life, said of late-term abortions.
``It's really infanticide. It's a living, moving baby right up
until that moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The procedure, Gerster said, could cause long-term physical
problems for the girl, including sterility or complications in
later pregnancies. Gerster also worries the already troubled girl
might face deep depression, drug or alcohol abuse or suicide.
</P>
<P>
   But Beth Weber, director of medical services for Planned Parent
hood of Central and Northern Arizona, said that abortion is no more
risky than childbirth and that the girl faces the same emotional
aftermath if she is forced to give birth to a child she does not
want.
</P>
<P>
   ``This young lady has become a pawn, and we seemed to have
forgotten her,'' Weber said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said the girl likely would be given pain medication and
a general anesthesia during the abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because you're a minor child doesn't mean you're not
covered under the Constitution and the Bill of Rights,'' said Dr.
Brian Finkel of Metro Phoenix Women's Center and an abortion-rights
advocate.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's attorney called him last week, asking if he could
perform the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Finkel does not perform late-term abortions because of what he
calls the ``criminal activities'' of abortion foes. Hospitals are
hesitant to allow doctors to use their facilities for such
procedures for fear they will be picketed, their staff stalked or
their buildings bombed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have personally seen to it that her life is irreparably
damaged, whether she gets the abortion or not,'' Finkel said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he had access to the needed facility, he would not
perform an abortion at 24 weeks because the fetus has a solid
chance of survival.
</P>
<P>
   The safest way to abort a fetus in the later stages of pregnancy
is to open the cervix and remove the amniotic fluid, placenta and
fetus. The fetus is removed in sections.
</P>
<P>
   The fetus also can be allowed to die without the medical
intervention it would need to survive.
</P>
<P>
   In another procedure, doctors begin delivery, insert an
instrument into the base of the baby's head and suction out the
brain.
</P>
<P>
   There are doctors in Arizona who will perform late-term
abortions but only because of complications that threaten the
mother's life or if the baby is not expected to survive anyway. In
those cases, that doctor's decision must be approved by three other
board-certified physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Also, in Arizona, any doctor performing an abortion after 20
weeks must submit a report to the state Department of Health
Services explaining the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Rusty Bowers, R-Mesa, has asked state Senate staffers to
explore the possibility of the state's appointing a guardian to
represent the interests of the 14-year-old's unborn baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to see if a guardian can be appointed for the
baby and push it right to the Supreme Court for an expedited
appeal,'' Bowers said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller called the idea of assigning a guardian to the fetus
``ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arizona Legislature doesn't care about babies after they
are born, only before they are born,'' Miller said. ``It's just
another idea to force this girl into continuing a pregnancy that
she wishes to terminate.'' &QL;

SOSA SILENT AS DODGERS WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He was three outs from his first shutout in 14
months, but the cheers were not for Ismael Valdes.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa commands the stage in every at-bat these days,
especially in Friday's otherwise meaningless 9-0 Dodgers rout of
the Chicago Cubs in front of 44,230 at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes didn't mind that the roar of the crowd was not for him.
It was better to win for the first time since July 16. When Valdes
got Sosa to ground into a double play, he knew he had shut down one
of his baseball gods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody loves Sammy,'' Valdes said. ``How often do you face
someone that can hit a home run every time up? What he has done for
baseball the past two years is incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   What Sosa has done this season is hit a major-league-leading 53
home runs, a pace that puts him eight games ahead of last year's 66
and keeps him head-to-head with Mark McGwire as the premier power
hitters in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sosa says he has been humbled by his accomplishments,
he admitted he wasn't surprised to have the crowd on his side at
the end of Friday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens everywhere I go now,'' Sosa said. ``When you do
this over a period of time, the fans respond. They clap for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Little did the crowd realize that Sosa would go 0 for 4 against
Valdes, who last pitched a shutout on June 27, 1998, at Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   His performance also was obscured by the Dodgers offense, which
strung together five consecutive base hits against the Cubs'
beleaguered right-hander, Steve Trachsel (4-16), in a four-run
fifth inning that put the game away.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes deserved more attention, but he was pitching against the
last-place Cubs, who are 5-21 in August.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, no one has looked worse than Trachsel, who was
hammered again in his sad run to become the majors' first 20-game
loser since Oakland's Brian Kingman 19 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers got to Trachsel in the second inning when third
baseman Adrian Beltre hit an opposite-field, two-run homer into the
lower right field. It was his 15th of the season.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, Eric Young opened with a double, the second of
his three hits, and Mark Grudzielanek, Gary Sheffield, Raul Mondesi
and Todd Hollandsworth followed with singles.
</P>
<P>
   Trachsel stayed in the game but lasted just four batters into
the sixth when the Dodgers scored two more runs.
</P>
<P>
   And how often do the home fans cheer the visiting star?
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't do anything against Valdes,'' Sosa said. ``He was
inside and outside all night. I tip my cap.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning, Sosa struck out on a 3-2 fastball up around
his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   He tapped to short on the first pitch in the fourth and grounded
out in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, who has battled blisters, a bruised pitching hand and
lower back pain this season, allowed the Cubs just seven hits and
did not walk a batter.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a winless streak that included four losses and three
no-decisions, Valdes has been one of the Dodgers' most consistent
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   In his last six starts, Valdes has allowed just 16 runs in his
last 491/3 innings, with an ERA of 2.92.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Sammy, you want to keep the ball up and I did that,''
Valdes said. ``I got some runs and I made my pitches. I feel very
good right now.''

COMMENTARY: ENDLESS POISON 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In October 1985 Louis Farrakhan brought his message of hate to
Madison Square Garden, where he spent a couple of hours ranting
about white people in general and Jews in particular before an
audience of 25,000.
</P>
<P>
   It was a nauseating performance, filled with taunts and threats
and pathetic extremes of self-absorption.
</P>
<P>
   ``I seem to have become quite a controversial fellow,''
Farrakhan would say, smiling. ``Everywhere Farrakhan goes, there's
controversy around this fellow. There has not been a black man in
the history of America that has been as repudiated as Brother
Farrakhan.'' And so on.
</P>
<P>
   Later he would say of himself: ``You can't say the brother's not
articulate. You can't say he's an ugly dude. God makes me pleasant
to look at.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands cheered. It was very weird.
</P>
<P>
   Among his many ugly outbursts that night was the question
Farrakhan raised about whether black leaders who opposed him should
be allowed to live. He mentioned David Dinkins by name. Dinkins was
the city clerk and had issued a public statement that said: ``In
light of Minister Farrakhan's visit to New York, I must say that I
find his blatantly anti-Semitic remarks offensive and I condemn
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Farrakhan wondered if the death penalty might not be appropriate
for such an offense. He told the crowd:
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason David Dinkins would do that is because they (black
leaders) don't fear us. They fear white people. What I'm suggesting
to black people is that the leaders have to begin to fear the
people that they say they represent. Because when the leader sells
out the people, he should pay a price for that. Don't you think so?
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think the leader should sell you out and then live? We
should make examples of the leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, nearly a decade and a half later, comes Khallid Abdul
Muhammad with his act _ a low-budget, street-corner version of the
Farrakhan road show. Muhammad despises _ you guessed it _ white
people in general and Jews in particular, and his supporters
recently took it upon themselves to punish a black leader who had
the temerity to object to their rot.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Bill Perkins, a consistent critic of Muhammad's
so-called Million Youth March, was surrounded and harassed by a
group of Muhammad's followers on Monday night. Perkins said they
were pulling on his arm and yelling: ``We are going to kill Uncle
Toms like you. You are supposed to be supporting us.''
</P>
<P>
   Are we tired of this yet? Have we had our fill? The reason this
sort of thing continues to erupt in places like Harlem is that so
many black leaders have refused for so long to unequivocally oppose
the racists, the anti-Semites and the perpetrators of violence
within the black community.
</P>
<P>
   Almost always there were excuses and rationalizations.
Denunciations of anti-Semitic outbursts by Farrakhan and Muhammad,
for example, were frequently accompanied by expressions of support
for the ``positive'' aspects of their message.
</P>
<P>
   There is no positive aspect. Those who think a hateful approach
might somehow be good for children should check with Perkins'
10-year-old nephew, Kiare, who is being raised by the councilman.
``He was frightened by what he saw on TV,'' said Perkins, ``and
expressed some concern about whether they knew where we lived.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York last week there was some evidence that this
misguided tolerance might be eroding. After the attack on Perkins,
several elected black officials stepped forward to denounce
Muhammad, his message and his march.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Rangel, the congressman, said: ``We hoped last year if
there was an increase in kids coming, the good would overcome the
hatred of the organizers. But after the events of last year, we
could not encourage anyone to get involved in the event.''
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Keith L.T. Wright declared, ``Enough is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   This should never have been a tough call. I don't remember too
many black people looking for the constructive side of George
Wallace or David Duke.
</P>
<P>
   Given our tragic history, the purveyors of hatred and violence
should be pariahs in the black community as nowhere else. We're
making some progress. Muhammad is having a more difficult time than
he ever expected. But we're not there yet.

 COMMENTARY: THE McCAIN MUTINY  
(jt) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ I went up to my hotel room after watching
John McCain make a speech here to 300 high-tech corporate types. I
flipped on the TV.
</P>
<P>
   There was Regis Philbin, quizzing some guy on ``Who Wants to Be
a Millionaire?'' I had never seen the game show before and the
questions seemed pretty silly _ multiple choices on which famous
Washington building has the address 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, and
what sort of work was done by the father of Loretta Lynn, who sang
``Coal Miner's Daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   The contestant sailed up to $32,000 before he got bumped off
with this one: ``What was the shared occupation of the group of men
referred to as the Keating Five?'' Possible answers were
``Musicians,'' ``Bankers,'' ``Senators'' and ``Writers.''
</P>
<P>
   He chose ``Bankers.'' A surprised Regis told him that until the
answer ``senators'' flashed on his screen, he had assumed the
Keating Five were bankers, too.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad McCain, who has been here campaigning for the California
primary, was on a plane back to Arizona. He would have loved to
know that on a game show that is generating more excitement than
the presidential race, no one remembered the most painful episode
of his life.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has said being locked in solitary and savagely beaten as
a POW in Hanoi for five and a half years was a less scalding
experience than the fracas over his role meeting with regulators on
behalf of Charles H. Keating Jr., a savings and loan operator later
convicted of fraud. The Senate Ethics Committee faulted the Arizona
senator only for bad judgment, but he felt ashamed that he had
embarrassed his father and grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 race could have been written by Arthur Miller. Never
have so many men wanted to run, not only to win the Oval Office,
but to prove they are worthy to larger-than-life dads and
granddads.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining over coffee why he is never afraid to mutiny against
party leaders, McCain says he doesn't seek their approval: ``My
father's and grandfather's approving of me is my lasting
ambition.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said for George W. Bush, who belatedly began
trying to leapfrog into the footsteps of his father, the president,
and his grandfather, Prescott, the craggy senator from Connecticut.
And for Al Gore, whose father was the principled senator from
Tennessee. And for Steve Forbes, whose flamboyant father, Malcolm,
made the publishing fortune that Steve has spent prodigally on his
vanity campaign _ even putting the family island in Fiji up for
sale.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Faith of My Fathers,'' his new memoir, McCain recounts his
searing experiences as a Navy flier, and tells the saga of his
father and his grandfather, both Navy admirals. ``It was a family
tradition: boozing on shore, heroics in uniform,'' he writes. ``My
father, like his father, was famous for both.'' As commander of the
Pacific Fleet, his dad had to approve the decision to bomb Hanoi in
1972 while his son was in prison there.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who turns 63 Sunday, still feels he let his family down
and rejects the appellation of hero, because after being horribly
beaten he gave in and read a statement prepared by his captors that
he was ``a black criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Before it happened, he made a couple of ``feeble'' suicide
attempts, looping his shirt through the shutter of his cell and
wrapping it around his neck. ``I'm not sure I could have gone all
the way through with it,'' he says. ``I knew I was going to break.
I didn't want to do that. I did and I failed.''
</P>
<P>
   He watched the presidential campaigns of John Glenn and Bob
Kerrey and Bob Dole collapse, and he knows that a heroic life story
is not a ticket to the White House. In fact, it can make the
candidate seem smaller than his own biography.
</P>
<P>
   Americans crave heroes. But they would still rather hear what a
candidate plans for their future than relive his past. Voters want
a president with character, but in the wake of Bill Clinton, they
define character differently. More weight on values shown in public
life and less on values shown _ or not shown _ in private life.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine with McCain, who says he has made lots of mistakes.
He did not criticize W. about his waffly answers on cocaine, only
observing that if he had not been in the Hanoi Hilton, he might
also have had a swell time in the Age of Aquarius.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nobody selling cocaine in prison,'' he says, with a
rueful laugh. ``When I left to go to Vietnam, Haight-Ashbury was
still just a street corner.''

HEISMAN HOPEFULS AND OTHER FACES IN THE NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JOE DRAPE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not Him Again
</P>
<P>
   If, as in politics, Heisman Trophy campaigns were helped by name
recognition, Ricky Williams might be this year's front-runner to
win college football's most coveted award. Like last year's winner
of the same name, he is a talented running back from the Lone Star
State. But this Williams carries the ball at Texas Tech _ not Texas
_ and sports neither braided hair nor the its-his-to-lose portfolio
that helped the Longhorns' Williams to win last year.
</P>
<P>
   In short, this year's Heisman contest is wide open. Here are the
contenders and their odds of taking home the trophy. &QL; 
 &QL; 
1. PETER WARRICK, senior receiver, Florida State
</P>
<P>
   He passed on the National Football League draft, when he
certainly would have been a top 10 pick, to return to Tallahassee
and take another run at the national title. In 1998, the acrobatic
Warrick averaged 20.2 yards a catch and 102.7 yards a game _
numbers that should be even better with the return to action of
quarterback Chris Weinke, who missed the final two and a half games
of last season due to injury. Warrick will also be aided by weekly
national exposure because his team is the nation's top-ranked team.
Still, only three full-time wide receivers have pulled down the
trophy: Johnny Rodgers, Tim Brown and Desmond Howard.
</P>
<P>
   Odds: 2-1
</P>
<P>
   2. RON DAYNE, senior, running back, Wisconsin
</P>
<P>
   This 5-foot-10-inch, 285-pound pile driver also passed on the
NFL. Dayne needs 1,717 yards to break the Division I-A career
rushing record (6,279 yards) that Ricky Williams of Texas set last
year. Dayne was the most valuable player of the Rose Bowl after
rolling for 246 yards in Wisconsin's 38-31 victory against UCLA.
For Dayne to crush the Heisman competition, he needs to grind out
big numbers in back-to-back games against Michigan and at Ohio
State, and the Badgers need a repeat of 1998's 11-1 season.
</P>
<P>
   Odds: 2-1
</P>
<P>
   3. RICKY WILLIAMS, junior, running back, Texas Tech
</P>
<P>
   At 5-9, 195 pounds, he starts, stops and explodes a la Barry
Sanders, which means exhilarating footage for the highlight reel.
Williams was the nation's fourth-leading rusher in 1998 with 1,667
yards and might just flirt with 2,000 this time around.
Unfortunately, he needs publicity and the Red Raiders are famous
only in West Texas despite being in bowl games in five of the last
six years.
</P>
<P>
   Odds: 5-2
</P>
<P>
   4. DREW BREES, junior, quarterback, Purdue
</P>
<P>
   Like Tim Couch last year, Brees will be the quarterback with
eye-popping statistics because of the Boilermakers' airborne
offense. He completed 63.4 percent of his throws last year and set
Big Ten records for yardage (3,983), touchdowns (39), attempts
(569) and completions (361). Big home games against Notre Dame,
Penn State and Wisconsin will showcase his talents, but he may be a
year away from the Heisman.
</P>
<P>
   Odds: 4-1
</P>
<P>
   5. LaVAR ARRINGTON, junior, linebacker, Penn State
</P>
<P>
   He is more likely to become the first choice in this spring's
NFL draft than to win the Heisman from the defensive side of the
ball _ Charles Woodson had to return kicks and catch passes to woo
Heisman voters in 1997. But it helps that the nation's premier
defensive player (65 tackles, 17 for a loss) is the cornerstone of
``Linebacker U.'' in a year the Nittany Lions play a national title
caliber schedule that includes Arizona, Miami, Ohio State and
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Odds: 10-1
</P>
<P>
   THE FIELD (Odds: 15-1)
</P>
<P>
   JOE HAMILTON, senior, quarterback, Georgia Tech: An explosive
offensive maestro, he has 5,800 career passing yards, 36
touchdowns, more than 1,000 rushing yards. If the Yellow Jackets
upset Florida State in their second game, he vaults into the top
three.
</P>
<P>
   TRUNG CANIDATE, senior, running back, Arizona: He has the right
name for a clever publicist, plays on a national title contender
and rushed for 1,321 yards in an injury-plagued '98.
</P>
<P>
   TEE MARTIN, senior, quarterback and JAMAL LEWIS, junior, running
back, Tennessee: Martin led the Vols to a 13-0 record and the
national title last season. If he does it again? One handicap is
that he might share votes with Lewis, who is back from a midseason
knee injury. Lewis gained 1,364 yards as a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   CHRIS REDMAN, senior, quarterback, Louisville: He threw for
4,378 yards and 30 touchdowns in '98 to lead the Cardinals to a 7-5
record. Best thing to happen to Louisville football since Johnny
Unitas.

<P>
   Locked Longhorns
</P>
<P>
   One has a famous name, the other has a catchy one. Both are
talented quarterbacks vying for the starter's job at Texas. For
now, Major Applewhite has held off the freshman Chris Simms, whose
father, Phil, led the Giants to a Super Bowl victory.
</P>
<P>
   However, the 6-foot-5-inch, 218-pound Simms has lived up to his
high school honors and earned the backup position. At Ramapo High
School in Franklin Lakes, N.J., Simms threw for 7,055 yards and 63
touchdowns. In three scrimmages at Texas, he completed 19 of 40
passes for 403 yards and a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris is certainly one of the best I've ever been around as a
true freshman,'' said the Longhorns' offensive coordinator, Greg
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   But Applewhite is the top returning passer in the Big 12 and was
sixth in the nation as a redshirt freshman last season when he
threw for 18 touchdowns. He has also proved more efficient than
Simms this summer, completing 18 of 23 passes for 264 yards and 3
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The pair have become friends despite what may develop into a
week-to-week, year-to-year quarterback controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Major is the starter; that is not a question,'' Longhorns
Coach Mack Brown said. ``Chris, as the second-team quarterback,
will play some. He will get a series now and then, but right know
I'd hate to throw him into the fire if Major got hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Coaches' Carousel
</P>
<P>
   The moving vans were busy this summer shuttling head coaches _
30 in all _ to fresh sidelines and new teams.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the names are familiar: Rick Neuheisel bolted
Colorado for Washington; Gary Barnett left Northwestern to replace
him in Boulder; and the former Southern Cal and Los Angeles Rams
coach, John Robinson, landed at Nevada-Las Vegas, where the Rebels
didn't win a game last year.
</P>
<P>
   But two of the most famous names in coaching are resurfacing in
the troubled football state of South Carolina: Lou Holtz at South
Carolina and Tommy (Bobby's boy) Bowden at Clemson.
</P>
<P>
   If Notre Dame is the Vatican of college football, Holtz, the
former Irish coach, left the CBS broadcast booth for the gridiron
version of a corner ministry _ one that unfortunately has zero
toehold in the brutal Southeastern Conference. The Gamecocks were
1-10 last season, have won more than eight games only once in their
history and own but a single bowl game victory.
</P>
<P>
   Holtz brought in his son Skip from UConn as his offensive
coordinator and probably as his eventual successor. But what Holtz
says his new team needs immediately is to believe in the gospel
according to Lou.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the most difficult situation I've ever taken
over due to the schedule that we will play and the lack of football
tradition at South Carolina,'' Holtz said. ``Every place has
something you can build on, no matter how successful it may already
be. We must be convinced we can win. I am convinced we can win.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Bowden, on the other hand, sounds downright morose
about the prospects of the 3-8 team that he inherited just weeks
after orchestrating the Bourbon Street Miracle of leading Tulane to
a 12-0 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got the fewest returning starters in the ACC,'' Bowden
said. ``We have an offense that was second to last in every single
category except one, the most important one _ we were last in
turnovers. We lost all five offensive line starters. We probably
have the smallest line in Division I-A. We don't have a
difference-maker at tailback, and we lost six guys off our defense
to the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have five home games and play seven bowl teams _ we ought
to be playing seven home games and five bowl teams. We're the
opposite. Then we don't have a kicker that has kicked in a game.
I'm afraid they're going to wet their drawers, kicking in a game in
front of 85,000 fans. So there's tremendous question marks in every
area.''
</P>
<P>
   To make it worse _ or better, deciding on what side of the
Bowden dinner table you're sitting on _ Tommy's Tigers face
Atlantic Coast Conference rival Bobby's Seminoles on Oct. 23.
</P>
<P>
   If the preseason polls are correct, Florida State will be 7-0
and the older Bowden will be after a career win No. 300 _ a
milestone reached by only six others, including Joe Paterno last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only number I want is 304,'' said Bowden, referring to a
number that would reflect a perfect 1999 season and give him his
second national title. ``I'm just glad Tommy is down there having
to face my old friend Lou and not me.'' &QL;

<P>
   He can barely bend his legs, and he shuffles them along as if
they were stilts. His neck hurts, too. He holds it with one hand,
rubs a grimace off his face with the other. It's 98 degrees, he's
just been hit for the first time at practice this summer, and Peter
Warrick isn't feeling well.
</P>
<P>
   He plops into a couch in the lobby of Florida State's Moore
Athletic Center in Tallahassee _ a room ringed with plaques and
retired jerseys. Fred Biletnikoff. Charlie Ward. All the Seminole
greats. As he sits down, the back of his head bangs against the
concrete wall. Crack!
</P>
<P>
   Meet your Heisman Trophy front-runner. The usually nimble wide
receiver laughs it off, but he can't hide a wince. Then he tries to
explain a day last January when National Football League
executives, agents, even some of his coaches, thought he must have
fallen and hit his head. He had called a news conference in this
building to announce . . . what?
</P>
<P>
   That he was entering the NFL draft? He was a certain top-10 pick
and would most likely be the first receiver selected. He had a
2-year-old daughter, A'Lyric, who was growing out of her clothes
more and more frequently. He was fourth in career receptions at
Florida State and his jersey was destined for the wall of fame.
</P>
<P>
   But Warrick had no idea what he would actually announce. He
paced a hallway. He said a prayer with the strength coach, Dave Van
Halanger. Ten minutes late, he waltzed into a packed room and was
asked, ``Well?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what I would do until it came out of my mouth,''
Warrick recalled. ``Once I said I was going to stay, a peace came
over me.''
</P>
<P>
   Warrick, who is a native of Bradenton, Fla., added: ``This state
is my home. This place is my family. I don't know what it is, but
Florida State has a powerful pull on me. I figured I could delay
sitting in a hotel room in Cleveland or Detroit for another year.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an impulsive decision that means the Seminoles begin this
year's college football season as the prohibitive favorite to win
the national title. Its logic, however, means much more and is
reflected beneath the ``hometown'' category on the rosters for the
Sunshine State's three football powers.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 272 players listed on this season's programs for Florida
State, Florida and Miami, 175 _ nearly two-thirds _ come from
within the state. They grew up near its South beaches, on its Gulf
Coast, in the central horse country or along the Panhandle. They
played football under palm trees or near swamps. They are talented,
and they win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see, you got the weather, the outdoors to run in,''
reasoned Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden, who is an Alabaman.
``This state's so dadgum big, so there's a lot of boys. They have
passion for football and mostly, I don't think they like to leave
their mamas. I don't know how scientific you need to get. We got a
lot of good football players in this state and we try to keep them
here.''
</P>
<P>
   If Pennsylvania forged its football tradition from the sons of
coal miners and steelworkers, and Texas honors its history beneath
the Friday night lights of high school football, Floridians
celebrate their football blessings each week when the national
college rankings are released.
</P>
<P>
   By keeping Florida's ample talent at home in the nation's
fourth-most populous state, the Seminoles, Gators and Hurricanes
have combined to win 273 football games in the 1990s. Each school
has won a national title during that period. Year in and year out,
the teams play rigorous schedules that insure they will have a say
in who plays for the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   This year is no different. The Seminoles are the consensus pick
to reach the national title game in the Sugar Bowl on Jan. 4. To do
so, they will have to beat the hated Gators on the road and the
Hurricanes at home.
</P>
<P>
   Florida also is thinking about New Orleans and the title game.
The Gators get Tennessee, the defending national champion, at home
in the third week of the season and might very well be unbeaten
when they face Florida State on the last weekend of the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is Miami. In the 1980s the Hurricanes captured
three national titles, but they spent the last three years on
probation for major violations that took place while Jimmy Johnson
and Dennis Erickson were coaching them. The sanctions cost the team
24 scholarships in 1996 and '97, but now that the Hurricanes are
back at full strength they are intent on recapturing their form.
They want to win the Big East Championship.
</P>
<P>
   If they don't make it to the Sugar Bowl, they want to handpick
the team that does. They have that opportunity Saturday in the
Kickoff Classic against Ohio State, on Sept. 18 against Penn State
and again on Oct. 9 against Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   When the road to a national championship winds annually through
Florida, it tends to make its coaches and home-grown players
alternately good, bad and ugly, but always downright cocky.

<P>
   Florida State: A Certain Air Of Invincibility
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles have won 10 or more games in 12 consecutive
seasons, have posted a 10-2 bowl record and have never finished the
season ranked lower than No. 4 in the Associated Press poll during
that span. But Florida State has brought only one national
championship back to Tallahassee, in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden, Warrick _ the whole team had banked on winning their
second last year in the Fiesta Bowl against Tennessee. Even with
his team down by 23-9 with six minutes left and the backup
quarterback Marcus Outzen having a miserable night in just his
third career start, Bowden was certain his team was going to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to break open for us sooner or later,'' Bowden
remembered thinking. He explained, ``It's the way we believe around
here.''
</P>
<P>
   It never did break open, though, and, afterward in the locker
room, Warrick doubted for the first time all season that his
Florida State career was over. After catching one touchdown pass
and throwing another in a 23-12 victory over Florida in the last
game of the regular season, he was sure he was going to the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured I had done everything there was to do here and that
I could leave a champion,'' Warrick said.
</P>
<P>
   He had caught 61 passes for 1,232 yards and averaged 20.2 yards
a catch and 102.7 yards a game in the regular season. But in the
Fiesta Bowl, he brought down just one pass for 7 yards and was
frustrated by Tennessee's double teams. Worse, he was upstaged by
the Volunteers' Peerless Price, who caught four passes for 199
yards, including one for a 79-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick fiercely denies that being outplayed in the Fiesta Bowl
figured in his decision. ``If I hadn't caught a ball and we won,
I'd be the happiest guy in the locker room,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, Warrick said, was he moved to stay to win the Heisman. In
the moments before his announcement, the Seminoles' Chris Weinke
was summoned to the hallway to calm his stressed-out receiver.
Weinke is 27, a former minor league baseball player and, until
sustaining a frightening neck injury in Florida State's 10th game,
the Seminoles' quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't talk,'' Weinke said. ``He was panicked. He really
didn't know what he was going to do. I told him if he came back he
could win the Heisman and every other award. I told him to do what
was in his heart, but I promised this was going to be a special
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Warrick's eyes flickered. He didn't know it until he said it,
but Warrick now knows why he stayed: ``I've waited my whole life to
turn pro. I can be poor for another year if it means that I'll take
a national championship there with me.''
</P>
<P>
   There is an air of invincibility surrounding the Seminoles,
partly because of Warrick, partly because 14 starters from the
Fiesta Bowl return and mostly because of Weinke. The quarterback
was an inch from being paralyzed against Virginia. He underwent
surgery in November, spent two months trying to survive
debilitating headaches caused by leaking spinal fluid, then had to
hit the weight room to reclaim the 25 pounds he had lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was lucky to have a second chance when I came here
as a 24-year-old freshman,'' Weinke said. ``I can't believe I'm
blessed to have a third chance. Something really special is going
to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden also believes this is a team like none of his others. He
looks at Weinke the leader, Warrick the playmaker, the best front
four in the nation and finally to his all-America kicker, Sebastian
Janikowski.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm almost too yellow to say it,'' Bowden said. ``But I think
this is the best team I've ever had.'
</P>
<P>
   Florida: Second Best, And Not Liking It
</P>
<P>
   Yes, his visor and his headphones are often hurled to the
ground. Yes, on the field his Gators run up the score. Yes, Florida
Coach Steve Spurrier likes to agitate. He tells it like it is _ the
more upset opposing coaches and fans get, the better. Spurrier's
needle is sharp and thrust often. A sampling:
</P>
<P>
   _ Last year, after the Gators won at Vanderbilt in front of a
half-filled stadium, Spurrier was asked if he was surprised at the
turnout. ``It's Vandy,'' he said. ``There must have been something
good on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   _ When Kentucky Coach Hal Mumme tried several onside kicks
during a 1997 Florida victory, Spurrier remarked, ``If I had a
defense like Hal Mumme has, I'd be trying them on every kickoff.''
</P>
<P>
   _ After his Gators handled their rival Tennessee in 1996 in
Knoxville, the coach dead-panned: ``They said it was going to be
real loud and I admit it was _ during pregame warm-ups.''
</P>
<P>
   But Spurrier's comments can be just as unforgiving when directed
at his own team. The Gators won 10 games last year, but lost the
two most important: to Tennessee and Florida State. Heading into
this season, the coach has let his team know that was unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite losing nine players on defense _ five of them
taken in the first three rounds of the NFL draft _ as well his
defensive coordinator, Spurrier is not worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the books,'' he said. ``I'm not worried. Look at the
last nine years and where Florida has been. With the exception of
Alabama in '92 and the chance that there could be a surprise team
to jump up this year, I expect the usual _ greatness.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Florida is one of only two teams _ Florida State is the
other _ to finish in the top 10 in each of the last eight seasons.
The Gators certainly are not rebuilding, but this is a season of
transition as the new defensive coordinator, Jon Hoke, replaces Bob
Stoops _ now the head coach at Oklahoma _ and Spurrier tries to put
some punch back into an offense that scored the fewest points of
any Gator team since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``The title of underdog shouldn't belong to us,'' defensive end
Derrick Chambers said. ``We are a great team that had a little
trouble last year. Tennessee got lucky. I am sure of our team
chemistry, and I know what we can do. We want to go into games and
prove through our playing that we are a great team. The only way to
get rid of the title `underdog' is to prove on the field that we
are great, and we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier has put a great deal of emphasis on camaraderie for
this year's team. Last spring, seven since-departed members of the
1998 defense were implicated in a scandal that revolved around
accepting improper inducements from an agent. To many, it explained
why some Florida players looked distracted and selfish.
</P>
<P>
   The coach? When asked what the difference was between this
year's defense and last year's star-studded bunch, Spurrier said,
``We don't have as many fancy cars being driven around this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The offense is in the hands of the senior quarterback Doug
Johnson, who finally escaped Spurrier's doghouse by remaining in
Gainesville over the summer to concentrate on football instead of
playing minor league baseball, as he had done in the past. Johnson
has started only 12 games in a Gator career that is notable more
for its low lights than its achievements. He has been suspended for
breaking curfew, missed the beginning of last season with a
shoulder injury and broke his left leg in last season's Orange
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Worse than any tongue-lashing their coach could give them was
the torture the Gators had to endure last Jan. 4 when they watched
two teams that beat them, Tennessee and Florida State, play for the
title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish they both could have lost, but in the end I pulled for
Florida State, because at least they were from Florida _ have to
keep it in the state,'' wide receiver Travis Taylor said. But
Taylor, sounding like his coach, promises never to do it again _
Florida plays host to both teams at home in The Swamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tee Martin has no idea what he is in for,'' Taylor said of the
Volunteers' quarterback. ``Eighty-five thousand fans screaming and
11 guys wanting and trying to rip your head off is not the
atmosphere I think he understands.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Miami: Steady Progress, Not Trash-Talking
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Hurricanes were the team of the 1980s. Three titles
were won under three different coaches: Howard Schnellenberger,
Johnson and Erickson. Vinny Testaverde won the Heisman Trophy in
1986. They added one more of each at the turn into the 1990s _ a
national championship in 1991 behind the Heisman quarterback Gino
Torretta.
</P>
<P>
   While the Hurricanes were compiling a 107-13 record from 1983 to
1992, they also developed an outlaw reputation enhanced by
on-field, helmet-off-in-your-face trash talking as well as
off-field player cameos on the police blotter. No one cried when
the Hurricanes were handed those sanctions _ except Coach Butch
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to South Florida in 1995, the former Dallas
Cowboys defensive coordinator's mission was simply to tread water.
For the first three years, he not only had to contend with reduced
scholarships, but also with the raising of academic standards by
the university. The Hurricanes managed 8-3 and 9-3 records his
first two seasons, but in his third, 1997, Miami drowned with a 5-6
record because 34 freshmen were on the squad.
</P>
<P>
   When the Hurricanes rebounded to 9-3 last year _ including a
thrilling season-ending upset of UCLA that knocked the
then-undefeated Bruins out of the national title game _ the South
Florida message seemed to be that the Canes were back.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't the fifth year of our rebuilding,'' he said. ``It's
more like our second. For my first three years, we were like a
junior college team. More players were graduating or going out
early than we could recruit.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Miami is near its full scholarship base of 85 for
the first time in Davis' reign, the program's atrophy will show _
especially with an ambitious schedule in which Miami faces Ohio
State, Penn State and Florida State within its first five games.
</P>
<P>
   To replace fullback Nick Williams, Mondriel Fulcher was moved
from tight end and Wilbur Valdez was plucked from the linebacking
corps. The rest of the backfield also is brand new.
</P>
<P>
   The sophomore Kenny Kelly will play quarterback and the redshirt
junior James Jackson replaces the two-time 1,000-yard rusher
Edgerrin James. It is the voluble Jackson who best combines the
Hurricane aura of old with Davis' mandate that today's Canes be
about class and classes. He's itching to trash-talk a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no punk, but if someone wants to lip at me he's going to
hear back from me,'' said Jackson, who averaged 6.6 yards a carry
last year. ``So far, people have just hit me and walked back to the
huddle. They better just keep doing that because they don't want to
motivate me any more than I already am. I'm telling you there are
some teams out there that need to start paying attention to us
because we're going to terrify them, just terrify them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who was also recruited by Notre Dame, spent a year in
prep school at Fork Union Military Academy to prepare for college
courses. He will graduate in December with a degree in sociology.
It was during his year in Virginia that the Belle Glades native
decided that South Bend, or anywhere else besides his beloved home
state, was not where he wanted to run or study.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' he said. ``I'm a Florida boy. My family's here. We got
three of the best football programs in the country. There are great
rivalries and we play in big games. I mean  &UR; big games &LR;  played on
national television. Why would I go anywhere else?''
</P>
<P>
   Why, indeed, when surf and sand, palm trees and swamps, are
pleasant enough diversions in January between bowl and national
title games? &QL;

   So Many Words, So Little Time &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The war of words in the ordinarily staid dictionary market
intensified with the publication of Microsoft's upstart new
reference guide, the Encarta World English Dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   London's underground was plastered with Encarta posters of a coy
topless model who was strategically covered by the weighty
dictionary. Rival publishers like Merriam-Webster Inc. in the
United States came out with more subdued full-page advertisements
in People and Time featuring a beaming college student in
sunglasses: ``Will your performance this school year be inspired or
ignominious?''
</P>
<P>
   But the real skirmishes were taking place behind the scenes with
rival publishers collecting examples of mistakes, omissions and
preachiness in the seven-pound print version of Encarta that labels
words like ``handicapped'' or ``harridan'' as offensive terms.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft insisted that all dictionaries have errors and any
mistakes would be corrected. But that didn't still the glee of
rivals who are so wary of Microsoft's financial resources that they
have turned to the weapons they know best: words.
</P>
<P>
   The competition whispered about the Encarta pronunciation of
Niagara Falls _ ``nigara falwz'' or Civil War general George Gordon
Meade, who was mistakenly described as a leader in the
Revolutionary War. There was the inclusion of a photograph of
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates and the absence of a photo of John F.
Kennedy. And there was some bewilderment about the appearance of
Louise Veronica Ciccone, the pop singer, as the first definition of
Madonna, followed by the second, the Virgin Mary.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft editorial director Richard Bready noted that first
editions of dictionaries are known for errors. ``If you are a
lexicographer, it's possible to find this level of error in any
dictionary. This is not the result of haste to publish. This is the
result of publishing a dictionary.''

   The tombs of ancient Egypt have by no means exhausted their
power to astonish.
</P>
<P>
   Years may go by without an eye-popping discovery, but then
archaeologists stumble on something like the 2,000-year-old
cemetery at an oasis 230 miles southwest of Cairo. They gave the
first detailed descriptions of one of the most spectacular Egyptian
discoveries in decades. In the buried tombs were rows of mummies
lavishly prepared for the afterlife with masks and waistcoats
covered in gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never before have such a number of mummies been found in a
single site in Egypt,'' said Dr. Zahi Hawass, director of the
excavations at Bahariya Oasis in what is being called the Valley of
the Golden Mummies.
</P>
<P>
   In the first four tombs explored, archaeologists counted 105
mummies _ men, women and children _ all from the Roman period of
Egypt in the first two centuries A.D. Looking at the painted masks,
Hawass said, ``The eyes of some gazed at me as if they were
alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists were delighted to find they had beaten looters to
the scene. They estimated that the entire cemetery, extending over
two square miles, might yield 10,000 mummies. The remains will be
examined for information on what the people ate, the diseases they
suffered, causes of their deaths and estimates of life expectancy.
They should also provide important insights into the art, religion
and funerary practices of a community of affluent wine makers in
Roman Egypt.

   The California state Supreme Court dealt a bad hand to Indian
gambling tribes, ruling that a ballot measure to allow expansion of
the $1.4 billion tribal casino business violated the state
constitution's ban on Las Vegas-style slot machines and card games.
The tribes are already collecting signatures to put a
constitutional amendment on the ballot next year to exempt tribal
gambling from the ban, and are hoping to work out a compromise with
Gov. Gray Davis. But federal prosecutors have threatened to shut
down the disputed games in six weeks.

   After six years of denials, Attorney General Janet Reno conceded
that pyrotechnic tear gas canisters were used at the Branch
Davidian compound in the 1993 assault that ended with the deaths of
some 80 Davidians near Waco, Texas. While the disclosure does not
alter experts' conclusions that the fire that killed many of the
members was set by them, Reno suggested that the FBI had misled
her. She ordered another inquiry into one of the worst law
enforcement debacles of modern times.

   China has reached the final stage of its campaign against Falun
Gong by revealing plans to prosecute the spiritual movement's top
leaders, who are expected to be charged soon with subversion and
sentenced to life in prison. The authorities are singling out 50 or
more leaders for punishment, while letting ordinary followers off.
The crackdown, intended as a sign of strong Communist Party
authority, is expected to wrap up before Beijing's huge Oct. 1
celebration of the 50th anniversary of Communist China.

   As a murderer, Samuel Sheinbein of Aspen Hill, Md., was an
amateur; after killing an acquaintance in 1997, the 19-year-old
left behind a handwritten note describing the murder plot. But in
manipulating the legal systems of two countries, he seemed like a
pro, fleeing to Israel and claiming citizenship on the basis of his
father's birth in British Palestine. Sheinbein worked out a plea
bargain to serve 24 years in prison, tough by Israeli standards. In
Maryland, he would have faced life in prison without hope of
parole.

   The nation's first program to use public money to send children

<P>
   The action _ an injunction pending a more thorough review _ came
one day before the start of school. Some 4,000 Cleveland children
were to attend 56 private schools using tuition vouchers paid for

been appealed and the case may end up before the U.S. Supreme

   Attorney General Janet Reno has said, that under her
stewardship, the Justice Department would be more worker friendly,
but lawyers at the agency have filed a lawsuit accusing the
Department of knowingly cheating them out of millions of hours of
overtime pay. Internal documents show that even as officials told
lawyers they were ineligible for overtime, top personnel managers
knew otherwise. The Department even kept two sets of books: One
set, on which paychecks were based, credited lawyers with only the
official 40-hour work week; the other precisely tracked overtime
and was used to lobby Congress for bigger budgets _ but not to pay
overtime.

   Chinua Achebe, the Nigerian author whose novel ``Things Fall

fiction in the United States, returned to visit his native country
after a nine-year absence.
</P>
<P>
   Achebe, 69, left Nigeria, which recently inaugurated its first
civilian government in 16 years, to seek medical treatment in
America after a car accident left him paralyzed from the waist
down. Though he is not considered an exile, Achebe's arrival was
seen as a positive development in a country whose military rulers
tolerated little criticism and became international pariahs in 1995
after hanging the writer and political critic Ken Saro-Wiwa.

</P>
<P>
   Last season's record: 11-2
</P>
<P>
   Last season's final New York Times computer ranking: 3
</P>
<P>
   Chris Weinke is an unflappable 27-year-old quarterback and the
senior wide receiver Peter Warrick is the Heisman Trophy
front-runner. The All-American defensive tackle Corey Simon is one
of seven returning starters from the nation's top-ranked defense.
Bottom line: Weinke rehabilitated a neck injury for 10 months and
Warrick passed up the National Football League to try to win the
national title. The season-ending game against Florida is the main
obstacle to a national championship rematch with ...
</P>
<P>

   Quarterback Tee Martin was not allowed to run the full offense
until late in the Volunteers' national championship season. Still,
the Vols averaged 398.8 yards of offense and Martin threw only 2
interceptions in his last 179 attempts. With the return of tailback
Jamal Lewis, who averaged 6.8 yards a carry over the first four
games before sustaining a knee injury, Martin will trigger a
yardage-gobbling machine. Bottom line: The Vols will beat Florida
in Gainesville on Sept. 18 for the first time since 1971, then
square off for the title with the Seminoles again, this time in the
Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   No. 3
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska
</P>
<P>
   9-4
</P>
<P>
   Final NYT ranking last season: 22
</P>
<P>
   Injuries spoiled Coach Frank Solich's debut last year: nine
starters missed a combined 45 games, and there were three different
starters at both quarterback and I-back. Now Nebraska returns 16
starters, and another 8 got seasoning replacing the wounded. If
quarterback Bobby Newcombe and I-back DeAngelo Evans stay healthy,
they will dominate the Saturday highlight reels. Bottom line:
Beware! Nebraska will avenge losses to Kansas State, Texas A&AMP;M and
Texas and could bring a perfect record into the Sugar Bowl should
Florida State or Tennessee falter.
</P>
<P>
   No. 4

</P>
<P>
   Left guard Steve Hutchinson (6 feet 5 inches, 296 pounds) leads
a talented offensive line that will blossom into the best in the
nation. Michigan rolled over the vaunted Penn State defense in a
27-0 victory and finished 10-1 after an 0-2 start. Tom Brady is a
replica of the mistake-free quarterback of the 1997 co-national
champions, Brian Griese. Bottom line: The Wolverines are not as
hyped as Penn State or as sexy as Ohio State, but they are the best
team in a deep Big Ten.
</P>

   Tailback Trung Canidate gained 1,220 yards. Quarterback Keith
Smith completed 69 percent of his passes for 1,732 yards. Both are
back, along with 14 other starters, from a team that averaged 35
points a game. Bottom line: The Wildcats are the best of the West
and, if they get past Penn State in the opener, may have undefeated
bona fides for the Bowl Coalition to compute come title time.
</P>

   Led by defensive end Corey Moore, an All-America candidate, the
Hokies return the entire front seven from the nation's
seventh-stingiest defense. The redshirt freshman quarterback
Michael Vick is a super talent, and Coach Frank Beamer can bring
him along slowly because of the defense and the flawless special
teams: the Hokies blocked eight punts and punter Jimmy Kibble and
place-kicker Shayne Graham were All-Big East. Bottom line: They've
beaten their Big East rival Miami four straight times and get them
at home this year.
</P>
<P>

   Texas A&AMP;M

<P>
   Coach R.C. Slocum brings back 16 starters, including the
1,000-yard rusher Dante Hall and quarterback Randy McCown, who was
6-1 before breaking his collarbone. The Aggies must replace their
leading career tackler, Dat Nguyen, but their swarming scheme
should allow them to duplicate their No. 10 rank in scoring
defense. Bottom line: This is a gritty bunch that wins ugly. Still,
they must beat Nebraska twice, in Lincoln and in the Big 12
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   No. 8

<P>
   The senior Doug Johnson threw for 19 touchdowns; the junior
Jesse Palmer threw for 14. Who gets more snaps? It doesn't matter _
Air Spurrier (358 yards a game) will take flight. It must, because
the defense lost its coordinator, Bob Stoops (now head coach at
Oklahoma), as well as its front seven. Bottom line: Anywhere else
this would be a rebuilding year, but the Gators and Florida State
are the only teams to finish in the top 10 the last eight seasons.

   LaVar Arrington, the front-runner for the Butkus Award as the
nation's top linebacker, is the monster among nine returnees from a
defense that did not let any running back gain 100 yards. Defensive
end Courtney Brown, linebacker Brandon Short and cornerback David
Macklin join him as future first-round draft selections. The
offense is not as distinguished; the senior quarterback Kevin
Thompson threw six touchdown passes against eight interceptions.
Bottom line: The grueling schedule includes Arizona, Miami, Ohio
State and Michigan. Win them all and the Nittany Lions are title
bound, though that's asking a lot.

   The Buckeyes lost eight starters to the pros, so expectations
are low. They do return a pair of All-America candidates on either
side of the ball: linebacker Na'il Diggs had six sacks for the
nation's second-best defense, and running back Michael Wiley gained
1,147 yards and averaged 6.3 yards a carry. Bottom line: If either
Austin Moherman or Steve Bellisari can effectively replace Joe
Germaine at quarterback, Ohio State can quietly pursue its first
national title since 1968.

   Seventeen starters return from a team that kept previously
undefeated UCLA out of the 1998 title game. But it's two
replacements, Kenny Kelly at quarterback and James Jackson at
tailback, who will determine whether the Hurricanes can survive a
big-time schedule. Bottom line: Three of their first five games are
with Ohio State, Penn State and Florida State. The Hurricanes are
potential giant-killers.

   The senior Joe Hamilton is the most exciting quarterback in the
nation. His quick feet and accurate arm (2,166 yards passing, 56
percent completions) led the Yellow Jackets to a 35.5-point scoring
average. Unfortunately, Tech's defense gave up 397.5 yards and 24.3
points a game. Bottom line: Hamilton's highlights will pop him into
the forefront among Heisman candidates. But the shaky defense will
make most games adventures and at least one of them _ against
Florida State _ a loss.

   Running back Ron Dayne needs 1,717 yards to break the career
rushing record Ricky Williams of Texas set last year. He will
probably get them, along with the Heisman. Nine returning starters
from the nation's fourth-best defense will insure Badgers games go
something like this: Dayne 31, Opponents 10. Bottom line: They play
in this year's most competitive conference and must face Michigan
and Ohio State back to back to open the league season.

   Drew Bennett takes over for Cade McNown and will hand off to
DeShaun Foster and Jermaine Lewis, who managed to combine for 1,100
yards rushing in the Bruins' pass-happy offense. But the
All-America candidate Danny Farmer leads one of the nation's best
corps of receivers, and Bennett, sooner or later, will get the ball
to them. Bottom line: Seven starters return from the nation's
99th-ranked defense. Is that good or bad? UCLA will find out in its
second game of the season against Ohio State.

   Jarious Jackson finished 13th in the country in passing
efficiency and his 2,181 yards of total offense was the fourth-best
ever among Irish quarterbacks. The Syracuse offensive coordinator
Kevin Rogers takes over that job in South Bend. Both need to
perform: only center John Merandi and the All-America tight end
Jabari Holloway return on a rebuilt offensive line. Bottom line:
Games at Michigan in Week 2 and at Tennessee in Week 9 will
determine whether the Irish are back in Bowl Coalition form.

   Quarterback Clint Stoerner threw for a school-record 2,629 yards
and 26 touchdowns, Chrys Chukwuma rushed for 870 yards and free
safety Kenoy Kennedy had 95 tackles. All are back and determined to
forget Stoerner's last-minute stumble and fumble that gave
Tennessee its perfect season. Bottom line: The Razorbacks have two
chances to redeem themselves against Tennessee _ at home on Nov. 13

   Last season Quincy Carter was the Southeastern Conference's
freshman of the year; now he is a Heisman contender. The
21-year-old former minor league baseball player threw for 2,484
yards and completed 61 percent of his passes. He also scrambled for
284 yards and 4 touchdowns. The Bulldogs' defense is thin, but
boasts the Butkus Award contender Orantes Grant. Bottom line:
Unfortunately, the talented Bulldogs need to beat Tennessee and
Florida to reach the SEC championship game. Not this year.

   Ricky Williams is gone, but Major Applewhite is not. As a
red-shirt freshman last year, Applewhite reeled off 10 straight
games of 200-plus passing yards. He will often look for Kwame Cavil
(51 catches for 775 yards). Coach Mack Brown lured the nation's
best recruiting class to Austin; one freshman, linebacker Cory
Redding, may have an immediate impact. Bottom line: The Longhorns
will be entertaining on their way to becoming national title
contenders in 2001.

   The Crimson Tide will roll again out of the backfield, where
tailback Shaun Alexander will use his final year of eligibility
after graduating and deciding to pass up the NFL. Four of the five
linemen who helped him gain 1,178 yards in '98 return. Among the
eight returning starters on defense, tackle Cornelius Griffith is
an All-America candidate. Bottom line: The Tide will press Arkansas

   The All-America linebacker Mark Simoneau and six other veterans
of the nation's third-best defense will make the Wildcats tough to
score on. But how will Kansas State replace the Heisman runner-up,
Michael Bishop, at quarterback and the school's career leading
rusher, Eric Hickson? Until a late collapse against Texas A&AMP;M, the
Wildcats were national title contenders. Aaron Lockett, a
sophomore, returns after a sizzling 44-catch, 928-yard debut. But
the offense will not match last year's 48-point scoring average.
Bottom line: They lose at Texas and at Nebraska and finish 9-2.

<P>
   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Sunday, Aug. 29:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   PERU-REVOLUTION (Nunhuaycco, Peru) _ Ayacucho Province, a land
of soaring Andean peaks, aromatic eucalyptus forests, ancient
Indian ruins and desperate poverty that was long ignored by the
government in Lima, was the cradle and epicenter of the Shining
Path uprising. But the social and political changes the Maoist
rebels tried to impose backfired. As the villagers organized to
drive them out, a different kind of revolution took place. By
Clifford Krauss. (With a map.)
</P>
<P>
   DDT-BAN-DEBATE (Washington) _ It has been 27 years since the
United States banned the pesticide DDT, and the payoff is
undeniable. The peregrine falcon, once pushed to the brink of
extinction, came off the endangered species list this month, and
the bald eagle may soon follow. Now the United Nations is drafting
a treaty that may lead to a worldwide ban on DDT. But the
negotiations are drawing opposition from an unlikely quarter:
public health professionals, who say DDT is necessary to stop the
spread of malaria in Third World countries. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg.
</P>
<P>
   TIMOR-VOTE (Dili, East Timor) _ After 24 years of bloodshed and
fear, East Timor has reached its moment of truth, a referendum on
Monday that could lead it into a new era of freedom and
reconciliation or one of even fiercer civil war. By Seth Mydans.
(With a map.)
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-BUSH (Washington) _ The Republican presidential
front-runner, George W. Bush, whose father was accused by candidate
Bill Clinton of ``coddling'' dictators in Beijing, is struggling to
decide how hard a line to take toward China. By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-EUROPE (Istanbul, Turkey) _ When seismologists reviewed
data from last week's devastating earthquake in Turkey, they made a
remarkable discovery. The force of the quake appears to have pushed
Turkey about 4 feet closer to Europe. More significant, though, has
been the fact that since the quake, Turkey and Europe have moved
closer politically and psychologically. By Stephen Kinzer.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-DRUGS (Tehran, Iran) _ The problem of illicit drugs is one
commonly associated with prosperous, liberty-minded societies in
Europe and America, not a theocratic state run by some of the
Islamic world's most conservative mullahs. But Iran is slowly
discovering that it too has a drug problem. It has a drug smuggling
problem. It has a drug violence and kidnapping problem. More and
more, it seems, it has a drug use problem. By Colin Barraclough.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-DRUG-MURDER (Mexico City) _ His fans thought of him as
the Sunday afternoon television comic whose vulgar but ruthlessly
funny jokes about their lives helped them while away tedium and
laugh away woes. But according to a series of murder indictments
handed down in Mexico City late Friday, the much-watched comedian,
Francisco Stanley Albaitero, was also a customer and business
partner of one of Mexico's most notorious narcotics traffickers. By
Julia Preston.
</P>
<P>
   CANADA-IMMIG (Vancouver, British Columbia) _ The image of two
tramp steamers disgorging 254 undocumented Chinese migrants on
beaches here this summer was enough for a local pharmacist to
unleash a tirade about Canada's ``lax'' immigration law and ``silly
excuses'' for refugee status, ending with a harsh finale: ``We are
being treated like suckers!'' But what made the Vancouver
pharmacist's outburst notable is that the speaker is a native of
Fujian Province. By James Brooke.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   HURRICANE-DENNIS _ Hurricane Dennis strengthened early Saturday,
swirling over the northern Bahamas as it headed for Florida's
northern Atlantic coast. (The Times is using a wire story for early
editions, but plans to provide a staff-written story later in the
news cycle.)
</P>
<P>
   ARIZ-ABORTION-FIGHT (Phoenix) _ She has been in state care since
she was 5 years old, and is described by the authorities as a
frequent runaway from foster and group homes. Her mother died in
January. Her father is absent. Now, this 14-year-old ward of the
state is at the heart of a highly charged public debate in Arizona
because a local judge has granted her request for a late-term
abortion. By David Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
   ANTI-CREATIONISM-TEAM _ Drawing on the deep resources of
``creation science'' advocacy groups, American fundamentalists are
arming themselves with the latest books challenging details of
Darwinian theory, getting elected to majority positions on school
boards and learning ways to word curriculums so that creationism
and evolution get equal respect. While they have gotten very good
at making a case for teaching alternative theories, a small group
of scientists and educators stands in their way. By Sandra
Blakeslee.
</P>
<P>
   WEST-WILDFIRES (Sacramento, Calif.) _ The fire season arrived
early this year, allowing no time to brace for its spectacular
tantrums. In the last six days, major blazes raged quickly like a
stampede of elephants, trampling more than 150,000 acres in seven
states, poisoning the air over Northern California and testing more
than 10,000 firefighters. By Evelyn Nieves.
</P>
<P>
   WELFARE-NY (Albany, N.Y.) _ With New York's public-assistance
rolls at their lowest in more than a generation, the state has
built up a $762 million surplus in federal welfare money over the
last three years, spurring a fierce debate over how best to spend
it. By Raymond Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POLITICS &LR;  (Moving in ``p'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   GORE-BUSH-TOBACCO (Washington) _ The presidential campaigns of
Al Gore and George W. Bush have this much in common: Both are
trying to wean themselves from the money and influence of the
tobacco industry, long one of the most generous of political
donors. But neither campaign, nor either of the parties they seek
to lead, has managed entirely to kick the political tobacco habit.
By Don Van Natta Jr. and Jill Abramson.

nation. By B. Drummond Ayres Jr.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (Moving in ``w'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   WELFARE-SURPLUS (Washington) _ Critics of the watershed welfare
law of 1996 forecast any number of problems, from starving children
to dwindling benefits to Depression-era soup lines. But virtually
no one imagined the strange new condition startling the experts
coast to coast: States have more federal money, literally, than
they know how to spend. By Jason DeParle. (With a graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   BIOTECH-CROP-BACKLASH (Washington) _ American farmers paid
premium prices this spring to sow many of their fields with
genetically engineered corn and soybeans, but now as the fall
harvest nears, more of the international buyers they depend upon
are saying they do not want those crops. By Melody Petersen.
</P>
<P>
   COMPUTER-SECURITY (Washington) _ After years of warnings and
efforts to correct the problem, the Defense Department's computer
systems remain disturbingly open to infiltration, according to a
review by the General Accounting Office.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NUNHUAYCCO, Peru _ At the entrance to this village of
Quechua-speaking Indians high in the Andes, residents have built a
children's playground beside six concrete tombs for 40 people slain
by Shining Path rebels eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The sight chills the soul. But villagers say they want to show
their children that life goes on despite the horrors of a war that
is still winding down.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe bricks are stacked everywhere as militiamen who first
mobilized to fight the Maoist rebels rebuild the village house by
house. The women have organized to plant a communal garden and
prepare hearty stews of cabbage, carrots and onions for their
neighbors. And at the recently rebuilt school, the children sing a
new Quechua song that goes, ``Happily we are not going to see any
more terrorists and our people will progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayacucho province, a land of soaring Andean peaks, aromatic
eucalyptus forests, ancient Indian ruins and desperate poverty that
was long ignored by the government in Lima, was the cradle and
epicenter of the Shining Path uprising. But the social and
political changes the rebels tried to impose backfired. As the
villagers organized to drive them out, a different kind of
revolution took place.
</P>
<P>
   Women, who took the lead in protecting their sons from being
drafted by the rebels, are becoming more assertive. Villagers were
emboldened to demand services from the central government, and in
the process village governments are becoming more democratic. Once
isolated Indian villages are developing local banks and building
roads and bridges to become more fully integrated into the national
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Anthropologists and local leaders say the villagers' resistance
to Shining Path's violent tactics and bizarre ideas bred new
attitudes and behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war had many cultural and sociological impacts, and many
were positive,'' said Jaime Urrutia Ceruti, an anthropologist who
has studied the aftermath of the war in Ayacucho. ``The peasants
who resisted Shining Path came out of the war with a new sense of
confidence. And while the primitive methods of production and lack
of investment remain big problems, people learned the benefits of
organizing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shining Path rebellion was born in a university in the
provincial capital in 1980 and spread across scores of impoverished
villages, pitting peasants against peasants, before it began
petering out when the rebel leadership was arrested in 1992. A
total of 30,000 people died and 600,000 more were displaced
nationwide. More than half of the victims came from Ayacucho.
</P>
<P>
   A few hundred Shining Path rebels barely hang on in the
mountains and jungles and attack sporadically, but the Maoist
cultural revolution they tried to install here at gunpoint failed
to take root.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONALL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to create a new society, the rebels banned Indian
and Christian holidays. They stoned communal leaders and replaced
them with rebel officers. To break down traditional family life,
the rebels banned the words ``mama'' and ``papa'' and forced
children to call their parents ``camarada.''
</P>
<P>
   And in many villages like Nunhuaycco that organized self-defense
militias called rondas _ either at the instigation of the Peruvian
army or independently _ Shining Path massacred thousands of people.
Often they used knives and machetes to save bullets.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The cultural change wrought by Shining Path in this province has
turned out to be very different from the upheaval the rebels
intended.
</P>
<P>
   Former militia organizations have become local police forces in
scores of villages, with chiefs elected by villagers, and they have
formed labor pools to rebuild schools, churches and homes set afire
by the guerrillas. They also farm communal plots to feed widows,
orphans and the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic ceremonies banned by the rebels have made a robust
comeback, with villagers dusting off statues of patron saints they
hid from the rebels and parading them down dirt streets during
frequent fiestas. Evangelical churches, declared enemies of the
people by the rebels, have mushroomed across the province as
stalwarts of conservative politics and of institutions that combat
family violence and alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the war's impact was indirect. The guerrilla violence
accelerated migration to the cities, where Indians acquired a taste
for modern luxuries like electricity and potable running water. Now
that thousands have returned to their villages, Indians are making
increasing demands on the government for such services so they can
watch television and their children can do their homework at night.

   In the village of Vicus, where Shining Path attacked 15 times
and slashed and shot 18 people to death during the war, residents
repeatedly went to government officials demanding services as a
token of appreciation for their capture of 30 terrorists. They
received potable water and an electric generator for the first
time, as well as the materials and equipment to build a road and
concrete bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The new infrastructure has brought wholesale buyers from nearby
towns, creating profitable markets for produce from Vicus. Now
residents are demanding the government help them patch up a
crumbling schoolhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Before the war, farmers in Patahuasi, like those in many
villages, lived in huts so scattered neighbors needed to hike half
an hour to see each other. Now the former militia organization is
reconstructing adobe homes in a tightly organized grid that makes
it easier for residents to organize rebuilding efforts and for the
government to deliver education, health and sanitation services.

</P>
<P>
   All told, the central government complied with local demands by
building schools in 95 Ayacucho villages and potable water systems
in 66 villages between 1995 and 1998, according to a government
report. All or part of 137 villages destroyed during the war were
also rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   In many villages, it was the women who first rose up against
Shining Path by hiding their sons from forced recruitment into the
guerrilla ranks. And with so many men killed, women became the
heads of thousands of families. Women also took charge of
cultivating the fields and took a leadership role in communal
assemblies.
</P>
<P>
   So-called mothers' clubs arose in hundreds of villages to plant
communal plots and distribute food donated by the government and
charitable groups. The clubs have recently begun forming village
banks with foreign aid to offer small loans to farmers, mostly
women, and to small entrepreneurs. The clubs also refer women to
government clinics, where many are receiving counseling for the
first time on how to plan their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old system of local and communal authority broke down
during the war and has been replaced by the militias and mothers'
clubs,'' said Jaime Marquez Calvo, a human rights lawyer. ``In the
past women were subordinated, but now they play a central role and
local services are delivered much more democratically.''

<P>
   In the town of Vischongo, for instance, two of the five elected
members of the municipal council are now women. The two are using
their power to set up a center to teach women business skills and
give them credit and health advice. When government officials come
to town, the councilwomen lobby for tougher laws against family
violence and for job opportunities for women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the war, men didn't listen to our opinions,'' said
Councilwoman Francisca Medrano, 35, who was elected to the council
after serving as president of the mothers' club in the village of
Masinga. ``But it was the women who most resisted the terrorists
and that changed everything.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, seven years after the chief Shining Path leaders
were captured and the war began to wind down, poverty and lingering
trauma continue to plague this region. Per capita income for this
province of 550,000 people is only $600, and almost two-thirds of
the children are malnourished.
</P>
<P>
   Such poverty helped fuel the revolution in Ayacucho in the first
place _ before the excess of rebel cruelty became widely known _
and few economic indicators are much higher today than before the
war.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 10,000 Ayacucho women widowed and thousands more
children orphaned by both guerrilla and army massacres, the war
made lives worse for many families. The estimated $40 million of
government and international aid that arrived here between 1996 and
1998 does not nearly meet villagers' needs.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One Indian woman who has benefited from the changes is
Maximiliana Nahui Sanchez, 43, who was widowed nine years ago when
rebels pulled her husband out of their hut and took him away. He
was never seen again. Forced to fend for her four children, she
could barely get by making the equivalent of $30 a month as a day
laborer working for other peasants.
</P>
<P>
   But last year her life took a small turn for the better. The
communal bank run by the mothers' club in her native village of
Osno gave her a four-month low-interest loan of $50 to buy seeds
for a variety of vegetables. Now she and her children grow their
own food and earn $200 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on a pile of her onions near a roadside, huddled under
blankets to protect her against the mountain cold, she sells
produce to merchants from nearby towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that I cultivate my own crops,'' Mrs. Sanchez said, ``all
I need is some rain.''

<P>
   &UR; CONTENDERS &LR;  Only Florida State, which has it all _ dynamic
offense, polished defense, a deeper bench than ever and a winning
tradition. As usual, this is a potential national champion.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LONG SHOTS &LR;  Virginia despite quarterback worries. Georgia Tech,
with a top quarterback in Joe Hamilton, but defensive worries.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; KEY PLAYERS &LR;  TB Travis Minor, WR Peter Warrick, DE Roland
Seymour, DR Corey Simon, DT Jerry Johnson and K Sebastian
Janikowski, Florida State; QB Joe Hamilton and WR Dez White,
Georgia Tech; TB Thomas Jones, Virginia; CB Lloyd Harrison, North
Carolina State; DE Chris Combs, Duke.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PIVOTAL GAMES &LR;  Georgia Tech at Florida State Sept. 11, Miami at
Florida State Oct. 9, Florida State at Clemson Oct. 23 (the rival
coaches are Bobby Bowden and his son Tommy), Florida State at
Florida Nov. 20.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; KEY QUESTION &LR;  Has Chris Weinke, Florida State's 27-year-old
quarterback, fully recovered from surgery for a rupture disk in the
neck?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Atlantic 10 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CONTENDERS &LR;  Massachusetts, the defending national champion in
Division I-AA, is ranked first or second in every preseason
national poll. It averaged 37 points and 471 yards a game, and that
high-powered offense returns. Delaware will create its usual chaos
from an old-fashioned winged-T.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LONG SHOT &LR;  Connecticut if its new coach, Randy Edsall, can
repair a leaky defense to complement a potent offense.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; KEY PLAYERS &LR;  QB Todd Bankhead and TB Marcel Shipp,
Massachusetts; QB Matt Nagy, Delaware; QB Chris Boden and LB Shaun
Lyons, Villanova; LB Paris Lenon, Richmond; DE Jojo Oliphant,

   &UR; PIVOTAL GAMES &LR;  Massachusetts at Villanova Sept. 18,
Massachusetts at Delaware Oct. 23, Delaware at Villanova and
Connecticut at Massachusetts Nov. 20.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; KEY QUESTION &LR;  Can Villanova become a contender despite the
medical-redshirt loss of Brian Westbrook, the first college player
to gain 1,000 yards rushing and 1,000 in receptions in the same
season?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Big East &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CONTENDERS &LR;  Expectations are high for Miami despite a new
defensive scheme and a killer schedule. Virginia Tech, with its
special-teams magic, has quietly climbed into the elite ranks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LONG SHOT &LR;  Syracuse, but only if its sophomore quarterback,
Madei Williams, can occasionally do a good Donovan McNabb
imitation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; KEY PLAYERS &LR;  RB James Jackson, TE Daniel Franks, OG Richard
Mercier, DT Damione Lewis and LB Dan Morgan, Miami; QB Michael
Vick, DE Corey Moore and DE John Engelberger, Virginia Tech; QB

August 28, Penn State at Miami Sept. 18, Miami at Florida State
Oct. 9, Syracuse at Virginia Tech Oct. 16, Miami at Virginia Tech
Nov. 13.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; KEY QUESTION &LR;  Does Miami, still recovering from NCAA-mandated
scholarship losses, have the maturity to survive against all those
national powers and get through its league schedule?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Big Ten &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CONTENDERS &LR;  Penn State is a powerhouse, with a defense good
enough to carry the offense. Ohio State sent eight starters to the
pros and will still be tough if its young quarterbacks mature. If
Michigan can run the ball and develop a secondary, it will be
tough.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LONG SHOT &LR;  Wisconsin, if only because Ron Dayne is a faster
version of Jerome Bettis. Dayne needs 1,717 yards, no big deal for
him, to become history's leading major-college rusher.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; KEY PLAYERS &LR;  DE Courtney Brown, LB LaVar Arrington, LB Brandon
Short and CB David Macklin, Penn State; TB Michael Wiley, OG Rob

Ohio State Oct. 2, Penn State at Ohio State Oct. 16, Michigan at
Penn State Nov. 13, Ohio State at Michigan Nov. 20.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; KEY QUESTION &LR;  Can Penn State give Joe Paterno, its old coach,
his third national championship? ``There is all kinds of potential
there,'' Paterno said, ``but we need more than potential.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Big 12 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CONTENDERS &LR;  Texas A&AMP;M, a perennial defensive power, should be
better than ever. Nebraska, which actually lost four games last
season, gets quarterback Bobby Newcombe and I-back DeAngelo Evans
back from injuries. Texas seems on the way up, Kansas State on the
way down.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LONG SHOT &LR;  Colorado, but only if quarterback Mike Moschetti
doesn't get battered trying to escape the pass rush.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; KEY PLAYERS &LR;  QB Randy McCown, OG Semisi Heimuli and P Shane
Lechler, Texas A&AMP;M; QB Bobby Newcombe, TB DeAngelo Evans and CB

of Florida State, Florida, Penn State, Ohio State and Michigan?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ivy League &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CONTENDERS &LR;  Perhaps four of the eight teams could win the
title. Start with Penn, the defender, which must replace its
quarterback and key runner. Next is Brown, whose quarterback, James
Perry, is about to become the top passer in Ivy history. Yale (good
offense, young defense) could contend.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LONG SHOT &LR;  Harvard, with the Ivy's premier runner in Chris
Menick, but there are holes on defense.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; KEY PLAYERS &LR;  QB James Perry and WR Steve Campbell, Brown; TB
Chris Menick and LB Isaiah Kacyvenski, Harvard; DE David Ferrara,
Princeton; TB Johnathan Reese, Columbia; WR Joe Splendorio,

   &UR; KEY QUESTION &LR;  Will Gavin Hoffman, a quarterback transfer from
Northwestern, make Penn fans forget about the graduation loss of
Jim Finn, last season's Ivy player of the year?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pacific 10 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CONTENDERS &LR;  Arizona, 12-1 last season, may be even better now.
UCLA, unsettled at quarterback and defense, has fine receivers and
will improve this year or next. Arizona State's improved defense
will make it dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LONG SHOT &LR;  Southern California if its productive offense can
keep an uncertain defense off the field.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; KEY PLAYERS &LR;  TB Trung Canidate and LB Marcus Bell, Arizona; WR
Danny Farmer, UCLA; TB J.R. Redmond, Arizona State; QB Carson

   &UR; KEY QUESTION &LR;  Can Drew Bennett, a seldom-used backup to the
departed All-America quarterback, Cade McNown, keep UCLA in the
running in a conference laden with powerful offenses?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Southeastern &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CONTENDERS &LR;  Tennessee, the defending national champion, has a
monster offense with Tee Martin at quarterback and Jamal Lewis and
his reconstructed knee at tailback. Florida should be good although
its quarterback, Doug Johnson, is returning from a broken leg and
the ground game is suspect.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LONG SHOTS &LR;  There are many _ Georgia (must rebuild offense),
Alabama (deep defense, good offense), Arkansas (four new starters
on offensive line), Mississippi State (tough defense) and

Mid-American Conference. Brigham Young and Air Force from the
Mountain West Conference, Fresno State from the Western Athletic
Conference and Louisville from Conference USA.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LONG SHOTS &LR;  Southern Mississippi (Conference USA) if its junior

MOORE LEADS VIRGINIA TECH ON ROAD TO RESPECT _ AND TO THE TOP 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JOE DRAPE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   He is the best defensive player in the nation that nobody knows,
and if Corey Moore has his way, he will become the best lawyer that
nobody knows. Huh? Moore, last year's Big East defensive player of
the year, does not think about playing professional football.
</P>
<P>
   He did not while he was the class president for three years
running at Haywood High School in Brownsville, Tenn., and he did
not while studying enough to graduate from Virginia Tech last May
with a 3.1 grade point average in finance. Now there are graduate
courses to concentrate on and a third Big East title to shoot for.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it happens, great, but there's other things I want to do so
it really has never driven me,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   But he does foresee a future in football, sort of. What he
really wants to do is become a sports agent. National Football
League scouts, however, won't be coming to Blacksburg on Saturdays
to grade forensic ability and talk torts. In 1998, the little-known
defensive end attracted their notice, as well as all-America honors
in his first year as a starter, with 67 tackles and 13.5 sacks to
lead the seventh-stingiest defense in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers were all the more impressive because, at 6 feet
and 212 pounds, Moore often gave away 100 pounds to offensive
linemen. Fortunately, his feet are as agile as his mind. If he
decides to delay law school and deal making, the undersized
defensive lineman will probably become a linebacker in the N.F.L. a
la his boyhood idol, Lawrence Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He goes around people and in between them,'' Virginia Tech
Coach Frank Beamer said. ``He's as quick as anyone we've ever
had.''
</P>
<P>
   While Syracuse learns about life without Donovan McNabb and
Miami embarks on a prime-time schedule, the Hokies may not only
dominate the Big East _ but they may also raise the profile of one
of the most overlooked Eastern powers.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech has gone to six straight bowl games and whipped
Alabama of the Southeastern Conference, 38-7, in last year's Music
City Bowl. The Hokies have also beaten Miami four straight years _
a fact that nettles the resurgent Hurricanes, whom many have picked
to win the Big East.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really eats at me,'' said Matt Sweeney of Miami, a senior
defensive tackle who will face the Hokies one last time on Nov. 13.
``I can't live life, graduate and say I never beat them. That game
is circled.''
</P>
<P>
   By finding players like Moore, Beamer has built a program that
so far only Hokies fans can appreciate. Those in the 51,000-seat
Lane Stadium get on their feet when the defense takes the field and
treat special teams play like scoring opportunities. They should.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Virginia Tech blocked eight punts and kicker Shayne
Graham and punter Jimmy Kibble were all-Big East selections for the
second time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend a lot of time on those units because any time a kick
is involved there's big yardage at stake,'' said Beamer, whose son,
Shane, is a long snapper.
</P>
<P>
   In what was supposed to be a rebuilding year, the Hokies went
9-3 in 1998 _ including final-seconds losses to Temple and
Syracuse. With seven starters back on defense, Virginia Tech is
unknown no more and has made its way into many top-10 lists.
</P>
<P>
   Moore not only believes the Hokies deserve the recognition, but
he says the defense may lead them to a Big East title and beyond.
He is not only the leader of the unit, but its most forceful
advocate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a great defense, the kind that can carry a team,'' he
said. ``I believe we can go undefeated.''
</P>
<P>
   The facts he argues are correct. In truth, he is only half of
the best end tandem in the nation; the senior John Engelberger, a
6-4 former walk-on, has transformed himself into a 269-pound
all-Big East defensive end. The Hokies are solid in the middle,
too. The senior tackles Nat Williams and Carl Bradley and
linebacker Jamel Smith threaten to turn the all-conference team
into a Hokies-dominated unit.
</P>
<P>
   That unit will make it impossible for teams to key on Moore,
though the defensive end anticipates it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get after it,'' he said. ``If you try to stop me,
Engelberger will kill your quarterback. Carl, Nat and Jamel will
take open shots at your running back. I just don't think it would
be too smart.''
</P>
<P>
   He rests his case.

STATES' NEW WELFARE PROBLEM: HOW TO SPEND THE FEDERAL DOLLARS

 By JASON DePARLE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Critics of the watershed welfare law of 1996
forecast any number of problems, from starving children to
dwindling benefits to Depression-era soup lines. But virtually no
one imagined the strange new condition startling the experts coast
to coast: States have more federal money, literally, than they know
how to spend.
</P>
<P>
   That is because the welfare rolls have dropped dramatically
while federal financing remains, by law, fixed at historic highs.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Wisconsin's version of the new welfare math. Five years
ago, the state received about $317 million from the federal
government _ or $4,100 for each family on the rolls. Last year, the
state still got $317 million, even though its rolls had fallen more
than 80 percent. That pushed the federal aid to nearly $22,000 per
case, and with the rolls still shrinking this year it may grow to
$35,000 per case _ a bit more than the cost of a year at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Awash in federal dollars, the state has raised its welfare
benefits 20 percent, created thousands of subsidized jobs, and
offered poor women door-to-door rides to mandatory motivation
classes. It has also used the money to bring new support to needy
families outside the welfare rolls, as the federal law permits _
offering them child care, car loans, counselors, and annual cash
bonuses of up to $1,600.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wisconsin had enough federal anti-poverty money left over
to shift more than $100 million, through some creative accounting,
into a tax cut for the decidedly nonpoor.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Idaho and Wyoming have let their millions gather
dust as their safety nets for the poor contract. Mississippi and
Texas made modest increases in their notoriously low benefits.
</P>
<P>
   New York is increasing the wage supplements it offers low-wage
workers. But it has also used $1 billion of its federal welfare
money simply to sustain existing programs it once financed itself _
a trade that frees state and local dollars but offers no new
services to the poor. While many states have pursued similar
budgetary swaps, few have done so as brazenly as Minnesota, where
Gov. Jesse Ventura of the Reform Party drew arrows in his budget
and spelled out the goal: ``Replace state spending with federal
dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   This flood of federal dollars has created a rare, perhaps even
unprecedented, moment of opportunity in programs for the poor. And
it is almost wholly an unintended one _ a rich new financing stream
for anti-poverty efforts created by the most conservative Congress
in a generation.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to revamp welfare and restrain its costs, a newly
Republican House and Senate reached a grand bargain three years ago
with the nation's governors. The states got new flexibility to run
welfare programs as they choose. In exchange, they accepted five
years of flat federal financing. In the phrase of the time, the
governors, predominantly Republicans themselves, promised to do
more with less.
</P>
<P>
   Instead they wound up with more _ much more, on a per-case basis
_ than anyone predicted as a combination of a strong economy and
tough new rules have pushed welfare rolls to stunning lows. Last
year alone, federal payments to the states were $6 billion higher
than they would have been under the old law, when falling caseloads
meant smaller subsidies. Now in another twist, there is an
intramural Republican dispute between congressional leaders who
want to reduce the windfall and conservative governors who,
protecting their budgets, find themselves in the unusual posture of
championing welfare money.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, the new financing is altering anti-poverty
assumptions in surprising ways. It has created the potential for
new services in pockets of poverty long starved for cash and helped
Florida find a prominent new place among the nation's innovators.
It has left a startling financial imbalance across the
Wisconsin-Illinois border, where welfare disputes have long raged.
It has defined a new Western Mountain regionalism, from Idaho to
New Mexico, where federal financing has brought new bounty but
state services are notably few.
</P>
<P>
   With vast new freedom to use the money as they see fit, states
can intensify services for those left on welfare or extend a new
hand to the working poor, buy drug treatment in the inner city or
build bus lines to job-rich suburbs. But much of this opportunity
is passing by unseized, according to an analysis of state spending
records conducted by The New York Times. While some of the windfall
has brought some new services, at times in the innovative ways
predicted by the proponents of state control, nearly a quarter of
the federal money awarded to date remains unspent.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves a pool of idle anti-poverty money totaling more than
$7 billion, a figure that current trends would push to $22 billion
by 2002 when the welfare law expires. And billions more of the
federal grants has merely replaced state spending, bringing no new
benefits or services to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, progress against poverty cannot be measured solely by
the number of federal dollars spent. Some states have deliberately
created reserves, exercising what they say is appropriate caution
in case of economic downturns; others have squandered new
opportunities through inertia and political infighting. Many say
the unspent money is not as idle as it looks, arguing that large
portions have been earmarked for programs still being developed.
Still the magnitude of the surpluses are commanding increased
attention.
</P>
<P>
   The Times analysis is based on the quarterly financial reports
each state must file with the federal Department of Health and
Human Services; interviews with state officials; and an in-depth
look at three states with markedly different experiences. The
financial reports cover state spending through the end of last
year, the most recent time period available.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis reveals:
</P>
<P>
   _ On average, the federal government now awards states 64
percent more per family than it did five years ago, before the new
law took effect. In 1994, the average federal subsidy per family
was about $3,200 a year. Last year, with the same amount of money
but far fewer people on the rolls, the average subsidy rose to
nearly $5,300 a year. While the money can be spent on any needy
family _ not just those on welfare _ the magnitude of the increase
is a measure of the new opportunity states have to expand
anti-poverty programs.
</P>
<P>
   In 12 states, the federal payment per case more than doubled.
Six of those states are in the South, creating the potential _ as
yet little-realized _ to significantly expand new services in some
of the nation's poorest regions.
</P>
<P>
   In Mississippi, the nation's second-poorest state, the federal
payment per family rose 158 percent, to nearly $3,800 a year. In
Louisiana, the third-poorest state, the payment rose 86 percent, to
just over $3,500.
</P>
<P>
   Even the states with the smallest federal subsidies per family
received a 1998 payment higher than the previous national average.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   _ While every state has seen its federal subsidy grow, the
politically volatile disparities between the states have grown as
well. That increases the likelihood of bitter new fights in 2002
when the current financing formula expires.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the states with the largest subsidy, New York and
Alaska, received about $5,000 per case, while the state with the
smallest subsidy, Mississippi, received about $1,460. That is a
ratio of just over 3-to-1. Federal financing at the time was based
on a complex formula that took into account how poor a state was
and how much of its own money it spent on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with each state's rolls declining at a different pace,
those differences have grown even more exaggerated. By last year
the state with the highest subsidy, Wisconsin, received $21,600 per
case. That is nearly six times the amount the government sends to
its neighbor, Illinois, which received the lowest payment, $3,400 a
case.
</P>
<P>
   Financing emerged as one of the most divisive issues during the
congressional debate over the 1996 law. States with lesser
subsidies brought the process to a halt when they demanded _ and
eventually received _ more money.
</P>
<P>
   _ Much of the windfall has failed to translate into new benefits
or services for the needy. Though federal subsidies for each family
have risen by 64 percent, the rise in actual spending has been much
more modest _ just 28 percent, when total spending is divided by
the caseload.
</P>
<P>
   That is because significant federal sums are going unspent, and
others are being used merely to replace previous state spending.
With federal financing fixed, states cut their own spending last
year by 21 percent or nearly $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Examine the math in Pennsylvania. Last year, the state received
$257 million more than it would have gotten under the old system.
But it left $158 million of the federal money unspent, and it
reduced its own welfare spending by $109 million. The state's
federal subsidy per family rose 56 percent. But its actual
spending, when divided by its caseload, rose much more modestly, by
23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ The states slowest to spend the anti-poverty dollars include
some of the neediest. By the end of last year, New Mexico, the
poorest state, had spent just 69 percent of the money awarded to
date. Mississippi and Louisiana, the next two poorest, spent 61
percent and 63 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   On average, by the end of last year, states had spent 78 percent
of the $34 billion awarded since the new law took hold. Wyoming and
Idaho are are, by far, the most reluctant to use the federal money,
spending 9 percent and 12 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen states had accumulated more than $100 million in
unspent anti-poverty money. They include Texas ($326 million),
Tennessee ($169 million) and Louisiana ($122 million) _ all home to
infamous stretches of entrenched poverty.
</P>
<P>
   At most these ledgers can offer a limited look at the poor. They
measure what states are spending _ not what states are spending on
or whether their spending is effective. They make no distinction
between the $14 million Mississippi spent to raise welfare payments
and the $35 million it spent on new computers for state officials.
(The Mississippi benefit is now $170 a month for a family of three,
a raise of $50.)
</P>
<P>
   No one knows whether new spending will reduce poverty, as
advocates hope, or increase waste and dependency, as critics of
social spending fear. And if states have more money per case, that
is only because the caseloads keep shrinking _ that is the the
central development of the new welfare age, and it can signal
either new progress (for those with jobs) or new distress (for
those merely dropped from the rolls).
</P>
<P>
   As of March, the nation's welfare rolls had dropped 47 percent
from the 1994 peak and in six states they dropped more than 70
percent. Eyeing such numbers, some members of Congress argue that
states now have more money than they need, and they are talking of
taking some back. Among them is House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill., who made a brief pass at reducing the state grants during
congressional budget deliberations last month.
</P>
<P>
   In response, a coalition of unlikely partners has emerged,
serenading the governors (31 Republicans, 17 Democrats, one
independent and Ventura) with a use-it, don't-lose-it refrain. That
group includes liberal advocates with long wish lists of programs
for the poor; Clinton administration officials, from the president
on down, who want to protect domestic spending; and some of the
congressional Republicans who wrote the 1996 law and are eager to
see it produce tangible benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time is rapidly approaching where it will not be possible
to protect these funds,'' wrote Rep. Nancy L. Johnson, R-Conn., in
a March letter to all 50 governors. ``Spend the money.''
</P>
<P>
   While last year's figures are the most recent available, some
analysts say spending has risen in recent months as states grasp
the size of the surpluses and the range of programs they can
create. ``States are recognizing there's money there and they can
do things they never imagined before,'' said Jack Tweedie, a
welfare specialist at the National Conference of State
Legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   But, paradoxically the exhortations to spend have made some
state officials even more reluctant to create new programs, for
fear they will be left to finance them alone. ``Everybody's afraid
the money will be taken away,'' said state Rep. Garnett Coleman of
Texas, a Democrat from Houston who sits on the appropriations
committee.
</P>
<P>
   When states do spend, they are much more likely to expand
services _ like job placement or especially child care _ than to
raise cash benefits. Many states have doubled or even tripled
spending on child care, often broadening eligibility to all
low-income families. Florida has gone even further, adding $66
million in other services for families not on welfare, including
drug and mental health treatment. ``It's a new way of thinking
about welfare _ getting into more of a preventive mode,'' said Don
Winstead, the state's director of welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
   While expanding services, Florida now spends only 30 percent of
its welfare money on monthly grants to the poor and it has not
raised the payment, $303 for a family of three, in seven years.
Nationally the average welfare grant for a mother with two children
has risen by about 5 percent since 1995, to $408 a month.
</P>
<P>
   While states promised to do more with less, some are doing less
with more.
</P>
<P>
   Six states have cut grants, including Idaho, which now offers an
average payment of $3,300 a year. Meanwhile, its federal subsidy
per case soared to more than $17,000 last year, and more than
three-quarters of its money remained unspent.

   In 50 state budgets reside 50 different stories. The bold
spending in Wisconsin, the paralysis in New Mexico, and the
deal-making in Texas offer a representative three.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin: A Windfall Provides Something for All
</P>
<P>
   No one would accuse Wisconsin of ending welfare on the cheap.
But even the state's famously expensive program finished last year
with an eye-popping surplus _ nearly $350 million in unspent
federal money.
</P>
<P>
   The moral of the story that followed is that surpluses can make
strange bedfellows. Inside the Legislature, the program's harshest
critic, state Sen. Gwen Moore, and one of authors, state Rep. John
Gard, went behind closed doors and divided the money in a deal that
delighted them both.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moore got nearly $100 million over the next two years for
new benefits and services for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Gard got just over $100 million for a cut in property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The agencies that run the largely privatized program got nearly
$65 million in profit. And still there was enough left over to keep
nearly $100 million in reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lovefest,'' Ms. Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, the program generating these surpluses, Wisconsin
Works or ``W-2,'' is known for its willingness to spend. Virtually
everyone receiving cash assistance is required to work. But the
state has expanded job-placement services, hired new counselors,
offered guarantees of child care, created thousands of community
service jobs, and raised benefits to $673 a month, higher than
anyplace outside Alaska or Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Costs per case have risen accordingly, to about $21,000 a family
last year, from $7,000 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin has also increased its spending on other needy
families, to reward them for staying off the rolls. It has doubled
the size of its child care program, in part by tapping its welfare
money. And using other pools of state and federal money, it offers
low-wage workers subsidized health care and annual wage
supplements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told Congress, and I've told taxpayers, you can't do this
cheaply,'' said Tommy G. Thompson, the state's four-term governor,
whose support for spending has often raised eyebrows among his
Republican colleagues. ``You have to spend more in the beginning to
save on the back end.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Thompson has been surprised by the caseload declines;
when forced to work for welfare, most recipients have chosen to
fend for themselves. By the end of last year, the state had spent
only 56 percent of the federal money awarded to date.
</P>
<P>
   Among those most alarmed by the falling rolls is Ms. Moore, a
Milwaukee Democrat who represents many former recipients and who
once was on welfare herself. In her view the costly program makes
harsh demands that drive troubled families away while enriching
social workers and subcontractors. ``The people we kicked off the
rolls are still out there, and they're not getting served.''
</P>
<P>
   Spying the surplus, she wanted more money for a long list of
causes, and she won most of them _ child care, drug treatment, job
training, youth services, and higher payments for relatives who
care for abandoned children. (Many of the new services had been
proposed by Thompson, who continues to talk of the need to invest.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moore's longtime adversary, Gard, is a north woods
Republican from a county with a caseload of one. What he wanted was
a tax cut. ``I just believe the average working family needs to see
some benefit,'' he said. Indeed, Gard argues that more money
actually harms the program, by encouraging too much social work and
too little self-reliance. ``The only way to keep the program from
getting out of control is to pull out money when you can,'' Gard
said.
</P>
<P>
   He backed a plan that uses $108 million in federal money to
replace previous state spending on wage supplements for the working
poor. The state money was then converted into a tax cut for
property owners. The deal, embraced by leaders of both parties,
awaits final ratification by the Legislature. ``We both left the
room smiling,'' Ms. Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional budget hawks will no doubt frown at the size of
the state's windfall. But Thompson said any reduction in the
state's grant would punish it for its success. ``We're getting
results,'' he said. ``Isn't that what the federal government
wanted?''

<P>
   New Mexico: Political Fights Yield Little Action
</P>
<P>
   While federal money soothed old fights in Wisconsin, it brought
new ones to New Mexico. And the poor have paid the price.
</P>
<P>
   Three years into the new welfare age, the state newly ranked as
the nation's poorest is still recovering from a constitutional
showdown between a defiant governor, who tried to seize control of
the program, and the state Supreme Court, which found him in
contempt of its order to relent.
</P>
<P>
   Welfare directors have come and gone, leaving the department
without direction. And millions of federal dollars have gone
unspent, while thousands of jobless New Mexicans have been dropped
from the rolls.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict began in the spring of 1997, when the Democratic
Legislature passed a welfare bill that contained an expansion of
employment services. Gary E. Johnson, the state's two-term
Republican governor, vetoed it and unilaterally imposed one of the
nation's most restrictive programs. It cut off thousands of
families already on the rolls _ not by helping them find jobs, but
by changing the formula used to determine their eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   Angry Democratic legislators sued, arguing that the governor
needed their vote to make such changes. The state Supreme Court
agreed in a unanimous decision, ordering him in September 1997 to
end the program. When Johnson defied their order, the justices
returned three months later and cited him with contempt.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson ended the program. But the rolls had already been cut in
half and surpluses were mounting _ though much of the state was
still lacking rudimentary employment services. The Legislature met
in the spring of 1998 and with the governor's help, designed yet a
third program.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, it is rich in new services. It extends job-placement
programs beyond the welfare population, to any poor New Mexican
family. It creates lucrative subsidies for employers who hire
welfare recipients. And it raised welfare benefits by offering a
$100 monthly increase to any family not receiving a housing
subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Department of Human Services now on its third
secretary in three years, bureaucratic progress has been painfully
slow. It took until last October just to hire a job-placement
agency along the state's southern border, where county unemployment
rates are as high as 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Legislature set aside $4.5 million for wage
subsidies, the department has scarcely tapped the fund, creating
just eight jobs. And it has yet to extend its job-placement
services to the nonwelfare poor, as the Legislature directed a year
and a half ago.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Valdez, the department's new secretary-designate, said the
idea remains under consideration. ``That has not been implemented
yet,'' he said, declining further explanation. ``That's as far as I
can go.''
</P>
<P>
   The state did use its federal money to expand its subsidized
child care program, raising the number of children covered to
20,000, from 7,000 just two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But by last spring, the department was facing new turmoil in the
form of escalating rolls. Many of those who had been pushed off
welfare were streaming back in. While the caseloads were still well
below their historic levels, the state suddenly forecast something
unheard of in the new age: a coming welfare deficit. The
Legislature then canceled most of the benefit increase it had
passed the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico finished last year with $67 million in unspend money
and a record of missed opportunity that few are eager to defend.
``The money's been available but no program's been implemented,''
said state Sen. Manny Aragon, a Democrat who serves as the
president pro tem. ``I don't think we've done a very responsible
job.''

<P>
   Texas : Modest Programs In Poverty Aid
</P>
<P>
   Welfare has not grabbed the kind of headlines in Texas that it
has in other states. Though Gov. George W. Bush broadcasts his
identity as a ``compassionate conservative,'' he has left less
personal imprint than other Republican governors on his state's
policies.
</P>
<P>
   The program was designed in 1995 by a Democratic Legislature,
which vested much of its control in 28 local boards, made up of
business leaders, educators and social workers appointed by elected
officials. Their development has been impeded by political fights,
and two are still being formed. As a result, the availability of
social services varies widely from place to place.
</P>
<P>
   Still, caseloads are plunging nearly everywhere. Like most of
the country, the program emphasizes a strict, ``work-first''
philosophy, seeking quick placements in low-skilled jobs as opposed
to education or training. And it makes an energetic effort to
dissuade new applicants from coming on the rolls. Would-be welfare
recipients must first attend an orientation talk _ often requiring
a second trip to another office _ before they can get benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The state actually has more families seeking aid each month than
it had four years ago. But with with welfare harder to get and
harder to keep, the rolls have fallen 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For state Rep. Rob Junell, the chairman of the House
appropriations committee, that has created the kind of problem an
appropriator loves to mull: a projected two-year welfare surplus of
nearly $600 million. Huddling with his committee, Junell, a
Democrat, spent the spring devising a something-for-everyone plan.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 percent of the money went to social programs previously
financed with state dollars. (Some of the freed-up state money was
then reinvested in health programs.) Another 20 percent got placed
in reserve, in case of economic downturn. That left about 40
percent _ or $200 million _ for new benefits and services.
</P>
<P>
   Some were of the kind that many states have emphasized _ more
child care (Texas has nearly doubled the number of children getting
subsidies) and counseling for especially troubled families. But the
package also contained a surprise: $62 million, over two years, to
finance the state's first increase in monthly benefits in 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, it was a modest one. The Legislature raised the
monthly benefits of a mother and two children to $201, from $188.
That is lower than any state but Alabama ($164), Mississippi
($170), Tennessee ($185), or Louisiana ($190). Texas also added an
annual back-to-school payment of $60 for every welfare child.
</P>
<P>
   Small as the raise in benefits was, Junell said, it survived
only by avoiding publicity in an anti-welfare state. ``It was very
quiet, which is how I like it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A windfall for the state, a modest expansion of aid to the poor
_ the Texas experience seems a telling example of the country's
experience as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Bresette, associate director of the Center for Public
Policy Priorities, a research and advocacy group based in Austin,
argues the state has missed a historic opportunity. ``I do want to
give them credit for some of the things they did,'' he said. ``But
they had the chance to dramatically fix things for low-income
families, including working families. In a state with as much
poverty as Texas, we could have done a lot more.''
</P>
<P>
   The new welfare law is doing wonders for the state budget but is
it also helping the poor?
</P>
<P>
   Junell, a Democrat who represents the rural area around San
Angelo, gives a refreshingly candid answer. ``I'm out here in sheep
and goat country _ I may not be the best person to ask,'' he said.
But with the state now getting $300 million a year more than it
would have under the old system, he is firm in one conviction: he
does not want Congress to take any of it back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're gonna fight 'em tooth and nail,'' he said. ``Out here in
Texas, a deal's a deal.''

UMPIRES LEARN THE HARD WAY THAT THERE ARE NO DO-OVERS IN BASEBALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   They said they never really meant it, just kidding, or something
like that. So they think they deserve a do-over. Except not only is
there no crying in baseball but there are also no do-overs.
</P>
<P>
   The umpires' mass resignation, which could go down as one of the
most ill-conceived labor strategies, was merely ``a symbolic
gesture.'' The umpires ``were not actually seeking to or
threatening to terminate their employment.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what the union's lawyers told the National Labor
Relations Board in asking the board to extricate the union from
this fine mess. Alluding to the resignations of more than 50
umpires of the 66-member union, the lawyers said it was a stretch
to conclude that seven-eighths of the bargaining unit, ``actually
intended to sever their employment with the Leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the umpires, the leagues didn't get the joke.
Twenty-two umpires, a third of the membership, will lose their jobs
at midnight Wednesday. Therein lies another misstep by the umpires.
</P>
<P>
   In their July 14 letters, the umpires said their resignations
were effective Sept. 2, which is Thursday. But they didn't specify
that they were resigning after the games of Sept. 2, so their
employers have determined that unemployment for the terminated 22
will begin at the start of that day, depriving them of an extra
payday.
</P>
<P>
   It would all seem like a Leslie Nielsen farce if the
consequences weren't so terrible for the umpires who are losing
their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   After laboring 17 years in the minor leagues, Ed Hickox was
finally added to the American League staff this season, and he
won't even finish it. Paul Nauert spent 11 years working his way up
to a full-time position with the National League, which he gained
this year; he won't have a full first season either.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 22 umpires are men with young children and men who are
presumably too old to start new careers. There are men who have
spent most of their adult lives as major league umpires: Jim Evans,
52 years old, 28 years in the AL; Greg Kosc, 50, 24 years in the
AL; Joe West, 46, 22 years in the NL; Eric Gregg, 48, 23 years in
the NL.
</P>
<P>
   And there are some of the highest-rated umpires: Richie Garcia
in the AL, Frank Pulli in the NL; and some of the lowest-rated: Ken
Kaiser and Dale Ford in the AL, Gregg and West in the NL.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the truly saddest case of all: Drew Coble, a
highly rated AL umpire, who is losing his job and his wife, who is
dying of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The NLRB, which saved the 1995 baseball season and perhaps the
sport as well, is not expected to take any action this week to try
to save the umpires' jobs. Labor experts believe the board will
find no merit in the union's charges, at least none for it to act
on.
</P>
<P>
   The terminated 22 will become a subject for negotiation in
bargaining for a new labor agreement, although the union has become
so split the umpires may find it difficult, if not impossible, to
adopt a unified bargaining position. But the departing umpires
can't count on any act of compassion by Major League Baseball.

   If there was one thing officials wanted to gain in the coming
negotiations, it was control. But they don't have to fight for it.
On that fateful day in Philadelphia, the umpires handed it to them.
</P>
<P>
   Relationships among the umpires will never be the same. A man
not involved in this crisis recently related a conversation he had
with an umpiring crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``If those four umpires are typical, they have no idea how they
got to where they are,'' their visitor said. ``They're mystified.
They don't know who to believe, who to trust.''

   It has not been difficult to find Protestants who believed that
the ecumenical movement among their churches had entered a season
of winter, where new initiatives for formal cooperation among
denominations were frozen like ice in January. But that idea waned
a few days ago when the nation's largest group of Lutherans
approved an agreement for full communion with the Episcopal Church.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which is subject to approval by the Episcopalians next
year, is no merger; each church would keep its structure and ways
of worshiping. But it is remarkable for allying two major
Protestant denominations, the 5.2 million-member Evangelical
Lutheran Church in America and the 2.4 million-member Episcopal
Church. Fully accepting each other's members and sacraments, the
two could hold joint worship services, exchange clergy members
where needed and collaborate on social service projects.
</P>
<P>
   An obvious question is why it happened. Does the Lutheran vote
simply represent something from the past, the last of the
church-to-church agreements of the 20th century? Or does it point
to a new era of formal Christian cooperation in the 21st?
</P>
<P>
   The answer could be argued either way. On one hand, the
Lutheran-Episcopalian agreement has its roots in the 1960s, a more
optimistic era for this sort of venture, when discussions between
theologians on both sides started.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there are reasons to think the future could
produce more pacts of this kind, given the needs of local
congregations, pressure for cooperation from Christian groups
overseas (globalization is an important concept in religion, too)
and the desire for a common front in the face of a somewhat
aggressive secular culture.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has provided rich soil for a multitude of
religious denominations. But along with the divisions, there has
long been a push toward unity. Supporters cite the prayer of Jesus
in the Gospel of John 17:11 that all his followers ``may be one.''
</P>
<P>
   The Evangelical Lutheran Church was itself formed 11 years ago
through the merger of three smaller Lutheran denominations. In
1991, it adopted a policy to move in ``multiple directions'' toward
agreements with churches in different traditions. That policy bore
fruit in 1997, when the Lutherans' biennial Churchwide Assembly
voted for full communion with three churches in Protestantism's
Reformed tradition _ the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), the United
Church of Christ and the Reformed Church in America.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lutherans narrowly rejected a pact with Episcopalians,
after a number of voting members voiced concern about a provision
requiring their denomination to embrace the Episcopalian belief
that bishops possess an unbroken line of spiritual authority
extending back to Christianity's earliest days.
</P>
<P>
   What followed was two years of debate on whether this idea gave
bishops too much power at the expense of laypeople and pastors. On
Aug. 19, as the assembly met in Denver, proponents of the agreement
won out, 69 percent to 31.
</P>
<P>
   Although the process leading to the decision was long and
complex, at least three ideas involved in it seem important for the
ecumenical movement as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense for some congregations to pool their resources
across denominational lines. Financially hard-pressed congregations
in rural areas and inner cities could share a full-time pastor as
well as collaborate on good works, making their dollars and
energies go farther.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was also spurred by international pressures, said
the Rev. Daniel Martensen, the Lutherans' chief ecumenical officer.
Many American Protestant denominations belong to global
associations of churches that share theological and historical
traditions.
</P>
<P>
   The Episcopal Church, for example, belongs to Worldwide Anglican
Communion. The Evangelical Lutheran Church is a member (the
second-largest) of the Lutheran World Federation, an association of
churches with a total membership of nearly 60 million.
</P>
<P>
   Attending the Denver assembly, the federation's general
secretary, the Rev. Ishmael Noko of Zimbabwe, told voting members
that although the decision on full communion was theirs, whatever
they did would be felt in ``sister churches'' worldwide. He said he
expected full communion agreements between Lutherans and Anglicans
in Africa within five years.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, too, there is the incentive of bringing similar faiths
together in a common stand, or ``witness,'' in the face of an
increasingly secular American culture.
</P>
<P>
   This point was made by the Rev. John Thomas, president-elect of
the United Church of Christ, an observer at the assembly.
``Certainly, among Christians, there's less and less legitimacy in
our mission to cling to competitive and isolationist models,'' he
said. ``I think unity itself is a kind of witness and a kind of
mission.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The images are grisly. Gunshot victims surrounded
by paramedics rushing to waiting ambulances outside a school, a
community center, an office building. Little wonder that people
worry that a gunman with an assault weapon and a grudge could loose
a reign of terror on anyone, any time, anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Such incidents reinforce a widespread myth that the number of
shooting deaths in the United States is increasing. In fact, the
number dropped to 32,436 in 1997, the latest year for which
statistics are available, from a peak of 39,595 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But highly publicized shootings, no matter how rare, can prompt
people to buy guns for self-protection, an act that, many experts
say, actually increases the likelihood that the buyer or a member
of his or her family will be shot.
</P>
<P>
   More often the carnage occurs in thousands of small tragedies
too mundane to make national headlines in a country where surveys
have indicated that half the households have at least one gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``The odds that a home will be the scene of a homicide are
substantially greater if there is a gun in the home,'' said Dr.
Arthur Kellerman, head of emergency medicine at Emory University in
Atlanta, who led a team that studied shootings in Memphis,
Galveston and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   And those homicides will have little to do with intruders. A
number of studies have concluded that very few people with guns in
the home ever use them to resist an attacker. In one study, fewer
than two crimes in a thousand were resisted with a gun. The most
likely explanation was that few homeowners have enough warning to
arm themselves with their own weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Even law enforcement personnel who routinely carry weapons are
often inadequately prepared to handle a shooting situation, said
Philip Hayden, a retired FBI supervisor who conducted the agency's
law enforcement training for safety and survival program at the FBI
academy in Quantico, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics on gun use offer cold comfort during what seems like
a summer of high-profile terror shootings. In Atlanta in July,
disgruntled day trader Mark Barton shot and killed nine people
after murdering his wife and two children. In Los Angeles earlier
this month, Buford O. Furrow Jr., a white supremacist, opened fire
at a Jewish community center, wounding five people, and later shot
and killed a postal worker.
</P>
<P>
   But most people are not shot by anti-social loners, assassins or
even by intruders breaking into a home.
</P>
<P>
   Gun violence, experts say, is overwhelmingly dependent on a
single factor: easy access to a weapon. ``On average, the gun that
represents the greatest threat is the one that is kept loaded and
readily available in a bedside drawer,'' Kellerman said. The vast
majority of shooting victims arrive at the hospital as a result of
a trivial altercations that turned deadly because the combatants
could easily resort to weapons, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some facts: Most people are not shot with assault weapons, but
with handguns. Most people hurt or killed by guns are not shot at
schools, offices or their workplaces. In Kellerman's 1994 study of
shootings in Galveston, Memphis and Seattle, nearly half took place
on a street or in a parking lot, and nearly a third took place in
the victim's home. Seven percent were shot in a motor vehicle and
six percent in a bar or nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   Of the cases for which the researchers had information about the
relationship, if any, between the shooter and victim, more than a
third knew each other. Eight percent were gang adversaries or
romantic rivals and seven percent of the victims were shot by a
spouse, close friend or family member.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem with keeping guns for protection is that it is
far more difficult to hit a target than television dramas and
movies may lead people to believe. Even police officers under the
stress of an armed encounter hit their targets with only 17 percent
of their shots, Hayden said. This is true even though most
encounters occur at a range of less than seven feet.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the high number of misses by police reflects new gun
tactics taught by law enforcement agencies in response to higher
powered weapons carried by criminals. In the past, many law
enforcement agencies told recruits to aim deliberately and shoot
once or twice. Now, they teach trainees to aim deliberately, but
shoot until the threat no longer exists.
</P>
<P>
   The average police officer, Hayden said, fires only 65 rounds a
year in training, a number that is probably far more than most
civilians are likely to shoot. Practice shooting and training
exercises on computer simulators are inadequate preparation for
real situations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the FBI's training program has gone to greater
lengths to provide what experts like Hayden said was the essential
ingredient to successful firearms training _ simulated scenarios
that build in the heavy stress, confusion and fear inherent in most
shooting situations when officers' heart rates skyrocket and their
ability to think clearly and act deliberately can diminish.
</P>
<P>
   Hayden introduced the use of guns that shoot paint pellets that
sting when they hit, and realistic shooting situations involving
``armed'' suspects in scenarios drawn from actual experience.
``It's fantasy vs. reality,'' Hayden said. ``If something happens,
you say, `This is how I'll respond.' But unless you're trained,
you're not going to respond the way you think you are.''

CAMPAIGNS SEEK TO WEAKEN TOBACCO TIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr. and JILL ABRAMSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The presidential campaigns of Al Gore and George W.
Bush have this much in common: Both are trying to wean themselves
from the money and influence of the tobacco industry, long one of
the most generous of political donors.
</P>
<P>
   But neither campaign, nor either of the parties the candidates
seek to lead, has managed entirely to kick the political tobacco
habit.
</P>
<P>
   Gore hired a media consultant who had worked for the tobacco
industry, and was promptly denounced for doing so by such health
groups as the American Lung Association. His campaign sometimes
returns contributions from individuals with ties to tobacco, but
not always.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's top political strategist was a consultant to Philip
Morris from 1991 to 1996, and his presidential campaign has
accepted at least $50,000 in individual contributions from tobacco
executives. Although Texas sued tobacco companies during Bush's
first term as governor, he never publicly supported the litigation,
and he is a champion of legislation in Texas that would limit
damages in liability suits against industries. The legislation is
strongly favored by the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Myers, executive vice president of the National Center
for Tobacco Free Kids, said that health groups were certain to make
tobacco's contributions an issue in the 2000 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tobacco industry has been exposed for being different in
terms of its product and wrongful behavior,'' Myers said.
``Association with the industry and its money creates a taint.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the criticism, Bush, Gore and several other presidential
candidates are trying to come up with approaches that allow them to
benefit from some tobacco contributions, but that also insulate
them from accusations that they are beholden to the industry's
interests. Other candidates have also received contributions from
tobacco executives. The maximum campaign gift for an individual is
$1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, contributions from the tobacco industry and individuals
linked to it have been a tiny portion of the money the presidential
candidates have received.
</P>
<P>
   As various states sued the industry to recover money they spent
on smoking-related illnesses, the dominant role of tobacco's money
in politics has become much more closely scrutinized in recent
years.

   In 1995 and 1996, the tobacco industry contributed $5.8 million
in soft money, on which there are no limits, to the Republican
Party and $1.1 million to the Democratic Party. Lobbyists predict
that the industry's support for Republican candidates and the
Republican Party will be even more lopsided in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Democratic National Committee refuses to accept
soft money from the tobacco industry, other Democrat committees,
like the House and Senate and state party committees, have accepted
such contributions in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has decided not to accept contributions from tobacco
political action committees, and he returned a $5,000 PAC donation
to his presidential campaign from Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp.
It is a clear sign that the Bush campaign is sensitive to attacks
that the governor is too cozy with tobacco interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a decision he made in his gubernatorial re-election
campaign because the state was involved in a lawsuit with tobacco
companies in Texas,'' said Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for Bush's
presidential campaign. ``He has carried it over to the presidential
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, that decision has hardly stopped the flow of
contributions from tobacco industry executives and lobbyists to
Bush's presidential campaign. Several tobacco executives and
lobbyists say Bush is viewed as a popular candidate by the industry
because of his stand on limiting liability damages.

<P>
   According to Federal Election Commission records, the Bush
campaign has received at least $50,000 from individuals affiliated
with tobacco concerns, more than any other presidential contender.
Among those who have contributed $1,000 to his campaign are
Geoffrey Bible, president of Philip Morris; Murray Bring, another
top Philip Morris executive, and more than a dozen executives of
United States Tobacco Co.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush refused to accept contributions from tobacco
interests in his two campaigns for governor, before his re-election
in 1998 a public policy group in Austin, Texas, accused him of
accepting contributions from lobbyists who were hired by Philip
Morris and the tobacco industry. ``Accepting money from tobacco
lobbyists raises thorny ethical questions,'' said Craig McDonald,
the director for Texans for Public Justice, a nonprofit advocacy
group.

</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bush's chief political strategist, Karl Rove, and Haley
Barbour, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee
and now a lobbyist, have significant tobacco ties.
</P>
<P>
   Barbour has earned large lobbying fees from the tobacco
industry. And Rove was a $3,000-a-month consultant to Philip Morris
in Texas beginning in 1991. He ended his affiliation with Philip
Morris in December 1996, in part to avoid bringing controversy to
Bush. But from January 1995 to December 1996, Rove worked both as a
political consultant to Bush and as a paid consultant for Philip
Morris.
</P>
<P>
   Rove declined to comment for this article. Rove has said he
ended his affiliation with Philip Morris because he ``felt
awkward'' about working for the tobacco company at the same time he
was Bush's chief political strategist. He also said that Bush told
him specifically not to discuss tobacco issues with him while he
was a consultant for Philip Morris.

   In March 1996, Dan Morales, then attorney general of Texas,
filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry, seeking reimbursement
for billions of dollars the state had spent on smoking-related
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1998, the industry settled the lawsuit with Texas for
$15 billion, a figure that was eventually increased to $17.3
billion, including $2.3 billion in fees to the five lawyers and
firms for the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who had not commented on the case until then, called the
lawyers' fees ``unreasonable'' and tried to block them, prompting
complaints that he was taking the side of the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed that we did not receive active public support
from the governor,'' Morales said. ``And I was troubled from the
outset about Rove's close relationship with Philip Morris and the
governor. My concern was there was a prospect for the sabotage of
our lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's spokeswoman, Ms. Tucker, said that the governor
simply ``did not want the taxpayers to be on the hook for $2.3
billion in legal fees that Dan Morales negotiated with five
attorneys.''

</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has been a vocal critic of the tobacco industry and
delivered an emotional speech at the 1996 Democratic Convention
about his sister's death from lung cancer, does not accept
contributions from the tobacco industry and has returned some
individual contributions this year from tobacco executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our policy is that we do not accept contributions from tobacco
PACs, nor do we accept them from tobacco corporate entities,'' said
Roger Salazar, a spokesman for the Gore campaign. ``It would be
impossible to check individuals and their portfolios.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other presidential candidates who have received
contributions from tobacco executives are Bill Bradley, the
Democratic candidate and former New Jersey senator, who received a
few thousand dollars. A spokesman said that Bradley had a strong
anti-smoking record and championed higher cigarette taxes.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In January, the Gore campaign and its compliance fund, for
covering the legal costs of a campaign, received $2,000 each from
Bennett S. LeBow, the chairman and chief executive of Brooke Group
Ltd., which owns the Liggett Group, and LeBow's wife and a business
associate. The campaign returned the checks of LeBow and his
business associate, but kept Mrs. LeBow's money because she is not
employed the tobacco industry, Salazar said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who is viewed as an enemy of the
tobacco industry because he was the author of federal anti-smoking
legislation, received a $1,000 contribution from another member of
LeBow's group.
</P>
<P>
   For the campaigns, the policy of not accepting contributions
from tobacco company PAC's neatly dovetails with the practices of
some tobacco firms. ``Our PAC, as a matter of policy, does not make
contributions to presidential candidates,'' said Peggy Roberts,
director of corporate communications for Philip Morris.
``Individuals are free to give to whomever they like.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Gore denounced the Republican National Committee as
``just about a wholly owned subsidiary of the tobacco industry,''
because of millions of dollars in soft money that it received from
tobacco companies, including $2.5 million from Philip Morris. In
the last presidential election, Philip Morris was the Republican
Party's largest donor.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, tobacco companies, including R.J.
Reynolds, were directed by Democratic find-raisers to make
soft-money contributions to state Democratic Party organizations,
despite the Democratic National Committee's policy to refuse
tobacco money. Some of the state parties sent these contributions
back to the national committee, according to state and federal
election records.
</P>
<P>
   While he hones Gore's campaign message, Carter Eskew, the
campaign's top media adviser, maintains an affiliation with his
advertising and consulting firm, Bozell/Eskew. Salazar said that
Eskew must have all his client work approved by the campaign and
was prohibited from taking on tobacco work or ``drawing any profits
from any of the firm's tobacco clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Eskew helped design a $40 million advertising blitz for the big
tobacco companies during the congressional fight over federal
anti-tobacco legislation. The legislation was eventually defeated.
Eskew declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   He is not the only member of the Gore team with tobacco ties.
Tina Flournoy, Gore's finance director, is a former Philip Morris
executive, and Jonathan Tisch, one of his top fund-raisers in New
York, is a top executive at Loews Corp., the parent company of
Lorillard Tobacco. The Gore campaign takes pains to point out that
Tisch heads Loews' hotel unit.

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton stepped up to the first tee at
Farm Neck Golf Club on Martha's Vineyard the other day and shanked
the ball into the wrong fairway. ``Aw, I killed it,'' the president
blurted to himself. ``I need help.''
</P>
<P>
   Without hesitation, Clinton fished another ball out of his
pocket, placed it on the tee and lined up a second shot.
</P>
<P>
   In golf parlance, the do-over is known as a mulligan, a benign
term for a shot not endorsed by the U.S. Golf Association. The
mulligan is common among weekend duffers, who will gladly take one
or even a handful of do-overs if their fellow players assent.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton never asked the permission of anyone in his
foursome, which included Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J. Apparently
being president means never having to say double bogey. His second
shot mimicked the crooked path of the first, veering onto an
adjacent fairway. ``Aw, I did it again,'' Clinton said, stomping
toward his golf cart.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the president does it again and again and again. He
grants himself bushels of mulligans _ off the tee, usually, but
presidential mulligans have also been witnessed while Clinton was
ankle-deep in sand or lost in a thicket of evergreen trees. Clinton
jokes that he gives ``presidential pardons'' to his errant golf
balls.
</P>
<P>
   As this vacation season draws to a close, and Clinton pursues
another interlude of golf and fund-raisers, the mulligan presents
itself as the perfect metaphor for his presidency. The voters have
given the Comeback Kid more than one mulligan. Clinton was granted
a second chance by the Senate in February after the House impeached
him for his behavior in the Monica Lewinsky matter. And it can be
assumed that Hillary Rodham Clinton has given Clinton a few
mulligans too.
</P>
<P>
   Most past presidents were golf purists who wouldn't contemplate
even asking for a mulligan (the term's derivation is obscure), let
alone taking one. President George Bush apparently never took a
do-over. For him, it was more important to put the game out of its
misery; he once bragged that he raced through 18 holes in 1 hour,
42 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy, probably the best golfer to occupy the White
House this century, did not need to take mulligans. Richard M.
Nixon, on the other hand, was known to kick the ball out of the
rough to give himself a better lie.
</P>
<P>
   Golf was also a defining metaphor of Dwight D. Eisenhower's
presidency. Ike spent so much time puttering around the links that
his diversion symbolized his entire era of placid postwar
prosperity and conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's game symbolizes something else. Bob Woodward's new
book, ``Shadow: Five Presidents and the Legacy of Watergate''
(Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1999), states that former President Gerald R.
Ford, an avid golfer, was disgusted after watching Clinton
repeatedly take mulligans during a round in Colorado in 1993. After
playing 18 holes with Ford and pro golf great Jack Nicklaus,
Clinton told reporters he had shot an 80.
</P>
<P>
   This claim apparently infuriated Ford and Nicklaus. Woodward
writes: ``Nicklaus leaned over to Ford and whispered in disgust,
`Eighty with 50 floating mulligans.'''
</P>
<P>
   A golfer who routinely takes mulligans is rarely taxed by the
game's cruelties. A handicap aided by second chances allows the
golfer to maintain an optimistic outlook on life. On the other
hand, one who never takes mulligans cannot help brooding about the
game's harshness and unfairness.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bob Dole, who does not play golf, attempted to
transform the mulligan into an issue during the waning days of his
losing presidential campaign in 1996. ``I don't know whether he
shot an 83 or a 283 or a 483,'' Dole growled in response to the
president's claim that he shot an 83 in Albuquerque, N.M. ``You'll
never really know.''
</P>
<P>
   On a glorious spring day in May, Clinton appeared incapable of
getting the kinks out of his swing on the first tee at the Andrew
Air Force Base course. He took one mulligan. Then another. And then
another. Each shot was spectacularly ugly, zig-zagging this way and
that. Finally, the president was satisfied with his fourth shot,
which managed to land in the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Bedard, a writer with U.S. News &AMP; World Report who
witnessed the flurry of mulligans, called it ``the highest-ever
number of cheater's shots the First Duffer has taken before
witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the first tee there are few witnesses. Reporters,
armed with scorecards and little pencils, are forbidden from
following the presidential foursome around the course. Thus, even
though Clinton is far along the back nine of his presidency, it has
been almost impossible to document how many mulligans he takes
during any single round.
</P>
<P>
   Terence McAuliffe, a friend and frequent golfing partner of
Clinton, vouched for the president's claim that he grants
presidential pardons only to balls hit from the first tee. ``And
only rarely,'' he added. McAuliffe said his matches with the
president are far too competitive for either one of them to indulge
in a multitude of mulligans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dogfight out there,'' he said. ``He is as competitive
about golf as he is about life. He doesn't like to lose, and
neither do I. Neither one of us will give the other guy a break.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such assurances, cynics in the gallery continue to
believe that the president's scores _ he claims to shoot around 80
and as low as 75 _ are enhanced by at least a half-dozen mulligans.
Sure, the president is a pretty good golfer, the cynics say. He's
just not  &UR; that &LR;  good.
</P>
<P>
   Skepticism is, of course, understandable. Clinton, after all,
claimed that he did not inhale, and that he did not have sexual
relations with that woman. Why wouldn't the president also put the
spin on his golf score?

   WASHINGTON _ It has been 27 years since the United States banned
the pesticide DDT, and the payoff is undeniable. The peregrine
falcon, once pushed to the brink of extinction, came off the
endangered species list this month, and the bald eagle may soon
follow. Brown pelicans are flourishing in Florida. On the shores of
Long Island, the ospreys are back.
</P>
<P>
   Now the United Nations is drafting a treaty that may lead to a
worldwide ban on DDT. But the international negotiations, set to
resume in Geneva next month, are drawing opposition from an
unlikely quarter: public health professionals, who say DDT is
necessary to stop the spread of malaria, a disease that kills as
many as 2.7 million people each year, mostly children in poor
undeveloped countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``A child dies of malaria every 12 seconds,'' said Dyann F.
Wirth, a malaria expert at the Harvard School of Public Health and
president of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.
``That could go up dramatically if we lose this important control
tool.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wirth is among more than 370 medical researchers in 57
countries who are urging that the treaty allow DDT to be sprayed in
small quantities on the interior walls of homes, where it acts as a
repellant to the disease-carrying insects. The scientists argue
that if the pesticide, which is cheap and effective, must be
eliminated, it should be phased out gradually and only if Western
countries conduct research on the more expensive alternatives and
help pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   Some type of public health exception is likely, said Jim Willis,
director of chemicals for the U.N. Environmental Program, which is
sponsoring the talks. But the specifics are engendering intense
acrimony between the public health experts and environmentalists
and have created some friction in the federal government, as it
tries to formulate its policy for the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This poses an unusual dilemma,'' said a State Department
official involved in the talks. ``Usually the dynamic is protection
versus economics. There, it is very easy for one side to paint the
other as the black hat. But here there is a peculiar tradeoff
between health and the environment, and those are both very
important civil society objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   Most countries no longer use DDT for agricultural purposes (or
do not admit to it if they do), but experts estimate that 23
nations still use it for malaria control. The biggest users are
China and India. Mexico has pledged to stop spraying DDT by 2007.
And the World Bank has loaned India $200 million to help devise
alternatives to DDT.
</P>
<P>
   The DDT dilemma stems from a U.N. plan to eliminate, or greatly
reduce, the use of 12 toxic chemicals classified as persistent
organic pollutants. The group _ the dirty dozen to
environmentalists _ consists of eight pesticides, including DDT, as
well as chemical byproducts and industrial chemicals. All
accumulate in the food chain and can travel thousands of miles
through air, water and bird migrations, causing lasting
contamination.
</P>
<P>
   In her 1962 book ``Silent Spring,'' Rachel Carson, a marine
biologist, chronicled DDT's poisonous effects, showing, for
example, how it killed the robins that ate the earthworms that
dined on the leaves of Dutch elm trees that had been sprayed with
the insecticide. The public outcry was tremendous; the book led to
the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970,
and the U.S. ban on DDT in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty negotiations on the group of pollutants began in 1998
and are scheduled to conclude by the end of next year. The Geneva
meeting, which runs from Sept. 6 to 11, is the third of five
scheduled sessions, but the first to examine each chemical in
detail. Willis of the United Nations predicted ``a rather thorough
discussion of the DDT issue.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Among advocacy groups hoping to influence the talks, that
discussion is already under way, and it is fraught with competing
studies and statistics. Experts are arguing about everything from
whether DDT is harmful to human health (the evidence is
inconclusive) to whether the recent rise in malaria rates in Mexico
is due to cutbacks in spraying or to last year's hurricanes, which
provided fertile breeding grounds for mosquitoes. (The answer is
probably both.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Positions have hardened,'' said Dr. Gerald T. Keusch, director
of the Fogarty International Center, the branch of the National
Institutes of Health devoted to promoting scientific research
overseas. ``In the heat it has not been possible to step back and
look at the light.''
</P>
<P>
   On one side is the nonprofit World Wildlife Fund and Physicians
for Social Responsibility, a doctors' group concerned with
environmental health. They argue that even small amounts of DDT
sprayed inside homes are harmful to the environment and cite
studies suggesting that the pesticide turns up in the breast milk
of nursing mothers and has other ``subtle effects on human
health.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking its cue from Mexico, the wildlife fund is pressing for a
ban on DDT by 2007. But the idea of a specific date is extremely
contentious, and the State Department official said the United
States will not ask for one.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side are two scientists' groups, the tropical
medicine society and the Malaria Foundation International, a
nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting research. Several
months ago, at the behest, curiously enough, of a Vancouver
environmental lawyer and cell biologist, Amir Attaran, the
foundation posted a letter about the negotiations on its Web site,
arguing that ``setting a firm deadline to ban DDT places an
unethical burden on the world's poorest countries.''
</P>
<P>
   As of Thursday, 371 scientists, including three Nobel laureates,
had signed. As the group's founder, Dr. Mary Galinski, a molecular
biologist at Emory University in Atlanta, explained: ``We don't
want a knee-jerk reaction to ban DDT.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate is occurring as malaria is making a deadly comeback,
re-emerging in regions where it was once under control and killing
many more people than it did decades ago, at least partly because
of a reductIon in DDT use. The World Health Organization estimates
there are 300 million to 500 million new cases of the disease each
year and last year launched a new initiative, Rollback Malaria, to
combat it.
</P>
<P>
   There are drugs to treat malaria, but some patients cannot
afford them and drug resistance is an increasing problem. So the
best means of prevention is to keep mosquitoes from biting people.
At least one expert, Dr. Donald R. Roberts of the Uniformed
Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md., argues
that ``DDT is the best insecticide we have today for controlling
malaria.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, Roberts, a medical zoologist, traveled to
Brazil to conduct experiments in malaria control. He built two
houses and sprayed the inside of one with DDT. Hundreds of
mosquitoes entered the unsprayed house, he said. None entered the
sprayed house. In the years since, Roberts has become an ardent
defender of the pesticide. ``We have got to stop pressuring
countries to stop using DDT,'' he said. ``It is immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, including Dr. Galinski, say they have no problem
eliminating the pesticide so long as alternatives are in place. But
that is a frightening thought to Dr. Wen Kilama, a Tanzanian
entomologist who in June presided over an expert panel, convened by
the World Health Organization, to debate the future of the
pesticide in malaria prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Kilama says that to get rid of DDT entirely, now or in the
future, would be a mistake, because one of the biggest challenges
in controlling the disease is that mosquitoes develop pesticide
resistance. ``It's like when you fight, you have a pocketful of
arrows and now you have only one arrow left,'' he said in a
telephone interview. ``If you pull it out and lose it, then you
have lost it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanzania no longer uses DDT; the country cannot afford it,
Kilama said. But with the economy improving, he added, ``I can see
a lot of hope coming up'' that government-sponsored spraying might
resume. In the meantime, some Tanzanians sleep under nets soaked in
pyrethroids, another chemical. But the nets cost $4 to $5 apiece,
too high a sum for many poor villagers, and Kilama said they work
only by ``mass effect,'' which means entire neighborhoods must use
them.
</P>
<P>
   Further south, in Botswana, health officials have also abandoned
DDT, but for a different reason. Only three countries _ China,
India and Mexico _ still manufacture the pesticide, and Thandie
Phindela, a malaria control officer in Botswana's Ministry of
Health, said the country could not get a reliable supply this year.
``The environmentalists are trying to put pressure on the use of
DDT,'' she said. ``We had to resort to pyrethroids.''
</P>
<P>
   But pyrethroids are more expensive. According to Kathleen
Walker, an entomologist with the EPA, the cost of treating one
house with DDT ranges from $1.60 to $8.50, compared with $4.20 to
$24 for pyrethroids. In the end, she said, some countries may have
to abandon house spraying altogether and begin research on other,
cheaper alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   That is the World Wildlife Fund's view: its contaminants expert,
Richard Liroff, urges ``more creative thinking about moving away
from DDT.'' He points to an experiment in India, where gambusia _ a
larvae-eating fish _ were deposited in bodies of water where
mosquitoes breed. But Kilama, of Tanzania, said such steps are not
practical in a country where a hippopotamus footprint after a heavy
rain can create an instant breeding ground.
</P>
<P>
   As the debate continues, the World Health Organization is
drafting its own plan to help countries cut back on DDT. But the
organization has no idea how much the effort will cost; the price
tag will vary from nation to nation. As to who will pay, said Jenny
Pronczuk, a chemical safety expert, ``Well, that's a problem.''

FEARFUL OVER THE FUTURE, EUROPE SEIZES ON FOOD

   (The Week in Review)

   PARIS _ Fist raised, mustache bristling, Jose Bove looked
defiant as he handed himself in to French police in the southern
town of Montpelier a few days ago. ``My struggle remains the
same,'' this farmer declared to an appreciative crowd, ``the battle
against globalization and for the right of people to feed
themselves as they choose.''
</P>
<P>
   A Parisian-turned-sheep-farmer who moved to southwestern France
20 years ago, Bove emerged this month as a sort of Subcomandante
Marcos of the French countryside, the leader of a self-styled,
anti-imperialist revolt over food. His crime, committed Aug. 12,
was to lead the ransacking and demolition of a McDonald's
restaurant nearing completion in the southwestern town of Millau.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the most conspicuous of a rash of recent protests
against McDonald's, targeted not so much for anything the company
has done but as a symbol of the United States and of what Bove has
called ``the multinationals of foul food.'' His efforts have struck
a chord. French labor unions, ecologists, Communists and farmers
have joined to demand his immediate release, burying other
differences in a shared politico-gastronomic outcry.
</P>
<P>
   An army, Napoleon noted, marches on its stomach, and the
European forces gathering this summer in protest against what is
seen as American-led globalization have abruptly focused on food.
Where it was once the deployment of U.S. nuclear missiles that
caused alarm, it is now McDonald's, Coca-Cola, genetically modified
American corn and American beef fattened with growth hormones that
have Europeans up in arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behind all this lies a rejection of cultural and culinary
dispossession,'' said Alain Duhamel, a French political analyst.
``There is a certain allergy in Europe to the extent of American
power accumulated since the Cold War's end, and the most virulent
expression of that allergy today seems to be food.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is not just culture or the kitchen that is at
stake. Enormous economic interests are also involved. Large
quantities of American corn and soybeans, to name just two crops,
have been genetically modified over the years _ that is, rendered
more productive, more hardy, less vulnerable to fungal and viral
pests through scientific alteration, including the addition of
genes.
</P>
<P>
   No discernible harm to Americans has occurred. But if Europe and
possibly other parts of the world reject or ban such products, the
economic consequences may be measured in the billions of dollars.
Already, a federal judge in Brazil has banned sales of Monsanto
Corp,'s Roundup Ready soybean seeds _ gene-altered to resist fungus
and weeds _ and Japan has announced that it will require labels on
genetically modified food.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe seems to be gripped right now by a kind of collective
madness, and we don't want that to spread to the rest of the
world,'' said Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., the head of the Senate
Agriculture Committee, who was in Germany this month. ``In the
United States, we have not seen a scintilla of ill effects, and on
my farm alone we've been modifying corn and soybeans since the
1930s, raising productivity by a factor of three.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the ``madness'' several factors appear to lurk. The
specter of nature being rendered more uniform by scientists in
America has meshed with a wider fear of an increasingly
undifferentiated planet where national distinctions fade. Europeans
see on the horizon a uniform, global culinary culture dominated by
multinationals _ a Hollywood of the kitchen drowning any European
distinctiveness with sheer marketing muscle.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a rash of health scares _ including the
outbreak of mad cow disease in Britain in 1996, and the discovery
this year of dioxin-polluted chicken in Belgium _ has provoked
widespread fear of any tampering with nature. This mood clearly
lies behind Europe's refusal to drop a ban on American beef raised
with growth hormones _ a decision that prompted the United States
last month to impose a 100 percent tariff on some European food
products, including Roquefort and foie gras.
</P>
<P>
   That U.S. decision _ targeting foods that nestle very close to
the prickly French soul _ added fuel to a fire already raging.
</P>
<P>
   Attacks or complaints directed at American food and beverages
have been almost constant lately as American marketers move to
exploit what they see as an underserved European market. The
reasons for the attacks have differed, but not the common thread of
an American target.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola, still reeling from the effects of a poorly handled
health scare that saw supposedly contaminated drinks removed from
shelves in Belgium and France, is now the object of a European
Commission investigation that involved dawn raids on offices in
Germany, Britain, Austria and Denmark last month. The company is
suspected of abusing a dominant market position to damage its
competitors. In Italy, where Coke has an 80 percent share of the
cola market, a separate national investigation was begun this
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no anti-American conspiracy here,'' said Stefan
Rating, a spokesman for Europe's competition and antitrust policy
regulators in Brussels. ``That Coke is American is undisputed, but
not unlawful. What we are looking into are possible abuses.'' Coke
denies any wrongdoing, and is known to be piqued by the extent and
repetitiveness of its recent European travails.
</P>
<P>
   This month in Belgium, a McDonald's near Antwerp was destroyed,
the latest of several attacks, and a number of McDonald's
restaurants in France have had rotting fruit and vegetables dumped
on them since the Clinton administration's decision to apply
punitive duties to French products.

   ``We are attacked because we are a No. 1 global American
brand,'' said Alessandra di Montezemolo, a McDonald's spokeswoman
in Europe. ``But people should understand we are local partners in
the national economies.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's, which operates 750 restaurants in France, tried to
calm protests there by issuing a statement saying that ``80 percent
of the products we serve are made in France,'' adding that they
were ``cooked by local employees.''
</P>
<P>
   But la France profonde _ the heartland of the imprisoned Bove _
was not impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Culinary sovereignty is imperative,'' said Patrice Vidieu, the
secretary-general of Peasant Confederation, the growing farmers'
movement founded by Bove in 1987. ``What we reject is the idea that
the power of the marketplace becomes the dominant force in all
societies, and that multinationals like McDonald's or Monsanto come
to impose the food we eat and the seeds we plant.''
</P>
<P>
   Vidieu's movement derives much of its intellectual inspiration
and direction from Attac, an association founded last year in
France to fight globalization and to campaign for a tax on
international financial transactions that would be used to help the
world's poor and fight social inequality. Among the leaders of
Attac (the French acronym for the Association for Taxation of
Financial Transactions in Order to Aid Citizens) are Viviane
Forrestier, whose anti-globalization book ``The Economic Horror''
has had enormous sales in France, and editors of the prestigious Le
Monde Diplomatique.
</P>
<P>
   It is this merging of militants against global finance and
global food that has given the current outcry some of its curious
virulence. Lugar, who would like to see scientific testing of
genetically modified crops in Europe, confessed to being amazed.
His argument is simple. The population of the world will probably
grow to 9 billion from 6 billion by 2050. Available acreage for
planting has already been identified. So, unless food productivity
is increased _ which will not happen without scientific
intervention _ people are going to go hungry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Europeans think they are protecting humanity,'' he said,
``but we think they want to starve the rest of the world. These are
big issues. I've been telling the Europeans that there's a big
difference between the Kosovo war and genetically modified corn:
For many Americans corn is more important.''
</P>
<P>
   But Philippe Folliot, the mayor of a St. Pierre-de-Trivisy, a
small town in the Roquefort-growing area, is unimpressed by such
arguments. He has imposed a symbolic 100 percent tax on Coca-Cola
sold in the town. ``Here we cannot make plastic cheeses and hormone
beef,'' he said. ``Roquefort is unique, a symbol of our battle
against the globalization of taste.''

   But Philippe Folliot, the mayor of a St. Pierre-de-Trivisy, a
small town in the Roquefort-growing area, is unimpressed by such
arguments. He has imposed a symbolic 100 percent tax on Coca-Cola
sold in the town. ``Here we cannot make plastic cheeses and hormone
beef,'' he said. ``Roquefort is unique, a symbol of our battle
against the globalization of taste.''

   From Out of Nowhere
</P>
<P>
   In his first season as a starting pitcher with the Houston
Astros last season, Jose Lima gained a career-high 16 victories.
With a month of starts remaining in his second season, Lima has 17
victories, not only the most in his career but also the most in the
National League.
</P>
<P>
   ``To think any of us are smart enough to take a player who has
been picked over by many clubs and see him become an All-Star the
next year ... ,'' Gerry Hunsicker, the Astros' general manager,
said without finishing the sentence but also without taking credit
for the discovery of Lima.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander came to the Astros from Detroit in a 10-player
trade in December 1996 after having spent the second half of each
of the preceding two seasons with the Tigers. As a starter in 1995,
Lima had a 3-9 record and 6.11 earned run average. Primarily a
reliever in '96, he had a 5-6 record and 5.70 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   In Hunsicker's opinion, Lima was ``a kid who was initially
rushed to the big leagues before he was ready, put in a negative
environment, put on a bad club in a hitters' ball park.'' He had a
good arm and a good changeup, Hunsicker added, but ``the
environment he was in wasn't conducive to his development.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade, the general manager said, put Lima in a pitchers'
park and gave him a manager and a pitching coach who are good
teachers. Lima obviously was a good student, though the Astros
almost didn't find out how good.
</P>
<P>
   ``We almost released him last spring,'' Hunsicker said, speaking
of March 1998. ``He was horrible last spring. He made our rotation
by default. The week before the season started we called him into
the office and told him we were taking him out of the rotation to
start the season and outlined a list of things he had to do to get
better.'' Two days before the season began, Pete Schourek went down
with an elbow injury. ``We had to put Schourek on the disabled list
and Lima took his place in the rotation by default,'' Hunsicker
said. ``That's how smart we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning by Avoiding Slumps
</P>
<P>
   When Atlanta swept a three-game series from Cincinnati last
week, it marked the first time since the second week of June that
the Reds had lost three in a row. The Mets have had only one
three-game losing streak since they reached the nadir of their
season with an eight-game losing streak in late May and early June.
</P>
<P>
   But for impressive records, no one can beat the Braves, who
despite a seemingly ceaseless rash of injuries have the best
won-lost record in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   How the Rangers Got Their Man
</P>
<P>
   Even with their sights set on Albert Belle last November, the
Baltimore Orioles wanted to keep Rafael Palmeiro, their owner says.
``Belle was not selected over Raffy,'' Peter Angelos said. ``They
were looked upon as a team, lefty and righty.''
</P>
<P>
   And why not? Palmeiro had blasted his way through the five most
productive years in the Orioles' hit-filled history and had shown
no signs of easing his onslaught. But the Orioles did not pursue
Palmeiro with the same urgency, not to mention dollars, with which
they sought Belle.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Belle is having a below-average season for the
Orioles, and Palmeiro is having another remarkable season for the
Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro entered Saturday's schedule with 40 home runs, 124
RBIs, a .341 batting average and a league-leading .659 slugging
percentage.
</P>
<P>
   These numbers could have been the Orioles but for an initially
lukewarm courtship and ultimately a quirk of timing. After offering
three years for $7.5 million a year, then inching up to four years
and finally five _ ``It took forever to get to five years and move
the money up,'' Jim Bronner, Palmeiro's agent, said _ the Orioles
finally got the first baseman's attention with a five-year, $50
million offer, though it was still $3 million a year below the
Belle terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We basically had an agreement on what the terms would be,''
Bronner said. ``But there was one issue Raffy and Peter had to talk
about. They straightened that out, and Raffy called me and said it
was OK. I called Peter at his law offices at about 10:30 at night,
but I missed him. I called his house, but he wasn't there. By the
time he got home, he thought it was too late to call me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bronner and Angelos missed each other the next morning, too.
``If I had been able to get Peter that night or the next morning,
we would have had a deal,'' the agent said.
</P>
<P>
   But as he waited, Palmeiro, who had played in Texas before going
to the Orioles as a free agent in 1994, decided to try the Rangers
again. He and his wife had built a large house in Texas and would
have been happy if he had never left.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had put Palmeiro off this time while they chased
Randy Johnson. Pitching was their No. 1 priority. But Johnson
shunned the Rangers so their general manager, Doug Melvin, agreed
to meet Palmeiro that morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Raffy the other day I'm sure glad I took that half hour
to meet you at the hotel,'' Melvin said. ``He said he was, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Angelos was calling Bronner, but Bronner didn't take the calls
because he was waiting to hear from his client. Once he did and
learned that Palmeiro had his mind set on returning to the Rangers,
they had to wait for Melvin to get clearance from the team's owner,
Tom Hicks, to give Palmeiro $45 million for five years, and Hicks
was on a plane somewhere. ``We knew Angelos was getting antsy; he
was calling every 10 or 15 minutes,'' Bronner said. ``We didn't
want to lose that deal. We called the Rangers and gave them five
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   More than five minutes elapsed, but the Rangers did the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Bronner said it was important for Palmeiro to get five years.
``He has some personal goals that will take some time to achieve,''
the agent said. ``He thinks he has a shot at 500 home runs and
3,000 hits. He needs five, five and a half years to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro went into Saturday's game with 354 home runs and 2,131
hits.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In hindsight, finding the remains of the 229 people
who perished when a Swissair jet crashed a year ago and retrieving
them from the ocean floor off Canada's Atlantic coast may have been
the simple part.
</P>
<P>
   The harder part was deciding how to handle 23 coffins that will
be buried this week, mostly filled with remains so small they have
not been identified. Only in the last few weeks have Nova Scotia
officials and religious leaders of several faiths agreed on a
solution: a mass burial and funeral rites to mark the anniversary
of the Sept. 2 crash.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the families support the decision, but the wrangling
over how much effort should have been devoted to identification and
how best to remember the dead illustrates the difficulty of meeting
the needs of people who in many cases have little in common besides
their grief.
</P>
<P>
   To some people involved in the investigation, it was also a case
of technology creating possibilities and problems faster than
ethics, religion or the human heart could deal with them.
</P>
<P>
   The Swissair McDonnell Douglas MD-11 caught fire in flight, for
reasons not yet determined, and virtually disintegrated when it hit
the water some 40 miles south of Halifax, Nova Scotia. Yet because
of modern engineering and science, including what Canadian
officials say is the largest use of DNA testing thus far, about 90
percent of the recovered remains were identified. The family of
every victim was given at least a fragment to honor in individual
ceremonies, as their feelings or religious traditions dictated.
</P>
<P>
   But in at least five cases, families held funerals and then got
another call from the medical examiner's office saying that more
pieces of their relatives had been identified. Some families said
they could not face it; as a result, some of what will be going
into the mass grave has been identified.
</P>
<P>
   So thousands of fragments _ some 2,300 pounds of flesh and bone
_ are still in Halifax. Burial has been complicated in part by the
conflicting traditions and rites of the many faiths represented on
Flight 111, bound from New York's Kennedy International Airport to
Geneva, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   DNA analysis could probably be used to identify virtually all
the fragments, and there was considerable pressure to do just that.
In this crash and that of TWA Flight 800 off New York's Long Island
three years ago, searchers have gone to heroic lengths to recover
every scrap of the airplane and the people on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the capacity to do extraordinary things,'' said John
O'Donnell, the director of administration at the Roman Catholic
Archdiocese of Halifax, reflecting on the DNA analysis and marine
salvage technology. ``Then there's this relentless, inevitable
trudging on to complete things as fully as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nova Scotia Medical Examiner John Butt said that with divers
recovering fragments by the thousands, he had to draw the line well
short of analyzing everything. Otherwise, he said, the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police would have faced a backlog of cases and
been unable to solve rapes and murders or to identify victims of
other crashes and crimes. And burial of the Swissair remains could
have been delayed for years.
</P>
<P>
   Most families supported Butt's decision to stop the DNA testing,
but some families were distraught.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's disgraceful that there was no further attempt to
identify the remains,'' said Barbara Featherolf of Haverford, Pa.,
whose 16-year-old daughter Tara was on the flight. Ms. Featherolf
hired a lawyer to push for more DNA analysis; she argued that only
money was at issue, and that Swissair should pay.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for the mass burial have created problems, too. O'Donnell
helped design a service with a committee of Anglican, Muslim, Greek
Orthodox, Presbyterian and Jewish clergy members, whose burial
rites are often incompatible.
</P>
<P>
   Lyn Romano, of Goldens Bridge, N.Y., whose husband, Ray, was on
the plane, called the mass burial plan ``an atrocity.''
</P>
<P>
   All that is needed to identify more of the remains is ``time and
money,'' she said, and Swissair has a moral obligation to help do
the work.
</P>
<P>
   Butt said there was no Canadian law to guide him in deciding
when to cease identification, but he did find one relevant
religious rule. Rabbis advising him said the Talmud, which predates
the discovery of DNA by more than 1,000 years, specifies that body
fragments too small for their source in the body to be determined
do not have to be linked to a specific person.
</P>
<P>
   Butt drew a similar line at human remains too small to identify
anatomically, but he said, ``Moral issues are tough to deal with in
the law, and tough to deal with administratively.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not unique to Halifax. The Armed Forces Institute
of Pathology in Bethesda, Md., intermittently receives shipments of
100 or 200 fragments of bone from 30-year-old plane wrecks in
Vietnam, often involving cases where the records indicate there
were two crewmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do DNA on the first 15 or 20 pieces, and it indicates
they're all from the same person,'' said Lt. Col. Brion Smith, the
chief deputy medical examiner. ``So you do another 15 or 20, and
it's still from one person. How long do you keep on going, using
your resources, to look for that second person who may not be
there?''
</P>
<P>
   The nature of the Swissair crash added to the problems in
Halifax. Unlike the TWA Flight 800 crash, which also occurred at
sea, the Swissair crash caused extensive fragmentation. The TWA
plane, a Boeing 747, broke up in flight. While many bodies were
mangled, they remained mostly intact because of the speed and angle
at which the plane entered the water, according to people involved
in the accident investigation. Frank Carven, a vice president of
the Families of the TWA Flight 800 Association, said that as a
result the recovery of unidentified body parts was less of an
issue.
</P>
<P>
   In the crash of a USAir 737 near Pittsburgh in 1994, which also
involved virtual disintegration, the airline buried several coffins
of mixed parts without notifying the families. The incident was one
reason that Congress put the National Transportation Safety Board
in charge of coordinating the treatment of families in crashes in
this country.
</P>
<P>
   In Halifax, Butt used fingerprints, jewelry, dental records and
tattoos to identify many body fragments and then DNA to match other
fragments to them. More than 100 people were identified by DNA
alone, and about 1,400 body fragments were analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell of the archdiocese said many Christians assumed that
the remains would be cremated, but the Muslim and Jewish clergy
members objected. ``I backed off,'' he said. ``We have to do this
in a way to respect as many people as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Coffins were another issue. Jewish tradition is to use only
wood, unadorned and without nails. Such coffins eventually
deteriorate. Nova Scotia officials insisted on metal coffins that
could be exhumed later if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Several memorial events will be held in Halifax this week,
including one in which relatives can meet the people who aided in
the recovery.
</P>
<P>
   But it will not end there. The Transportation Safety Board of
Canada, still investigating the crash, plans to carry out several
more days of dredging, looking for more pieces of the cockpit.
That, Butt expects, will turn up more remains.

   POKEMON-MOVIE (Los Angeles) _ If you haven't hung around
8-year-old boys lately, you probably don't know the next wave of
globalization has already arrived in the form of Pikachu, Raichu
and 149 other animated Pokemon characters. Pokemon _ the Japanese
name for ``pocket monster'' _ is becoming more prominent each day
in the United States with a mind-boggling array of video games,
trading cards, clothing and toys along with its own TV show. And in
a stunning reversal of the usual practice of American hit films
going to foreign markets, a made-in-Japan Pokemon movie will arrive
at U.S. multiplexes on Nov. 12. By Dave McNary. (Will move in the
``f'' financial and ``n'' California news file.)

<P>
   LA-PITBULL (Los Angeles) _ A white pit bull named L.A. was
seized by police checking out a dogfight in Los Angeles in 1996. He
had his ears nearly shredded off and was terrified of other dogs.
He is among the maimed and mangled pitbull, dog-fight veterans that
help make up 40 percent of stray dogs found wandering the San
Fernando Valley and across the city, a population fed by backyard
breeders who trade in dogs for fighting. By Robert Monroe. (Will

   The Smithsonian Institution in Washington last week canceled a

34-year-old, began peddling it to fashionable restaurants in the
'90s.

they've created. In eight years they have turned a bankrupt poultry

</P>
<P>
   I am extremely distressed to learn from my friends at People for

Associates are planning to host a seminar `celebrating' foie gras.
I would like to tell you of the horror taking place on many foie
gras farms today. The male ducks and geese on these farms are
restrained and have their bills forced open. A long metal pipe is
then roughly pushed down their throats. Finally, an air-driven pump
thrusts two to three pounds of corn mixture into their stomachs.
The ducks and geese endure this painful and distressing procedure
three times a day for four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that the birds' livers expand to six to 12 times
their normal size, they can barely walk or stand, their bills
become deformed or broken, and they suffer damage to their pharynx
and esophagus. Sometimes the force of inserting the metal pipe can
rupture their necks. And a percentage die outright from burst
internal organs. ... Female hatchlings are usually simply thrown
away, smothered or ground up.
</P>
<P>
   Even a cursory examination of these methods would make a decent
person shudder. ...

</P>
<P>
   Sir John Gielgud''

enlightened countries, and I have had the opportunity to meet with
British members of Parliament on this very issue. ...

   I now join Sir John Gielgud in urging you to cancel this
upcoming seminar in cruelty.''

<P>
   ``The methods used in producing foie gras have concerned people

techniques.''

PRO FOOTBALL NOTES AND NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Kuharich, the New Orleans Saints' general manager, said his
heart did not drop into his stomach when he first heard that Ricky
Williams, the man the Saints spent eight draft picks to get, had
severely hurt his ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've taken a real even keel in regards to Ricky,'' Kuharich
said. ``Injuries are going to happen. You can't control them.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an intelligent approach, and one that is expected from
Kuharich. But when the franchise limped off the field several weeks
ago after a crushing hit by a Miami defensive player, did not
visions of a wasted draft bounce in his head? Were there not a few
nightmares while he waited for doctors to give a final diagnosis?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, he's a tough player,'' Kuharich said. ``I knew he'd be
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, the team said, should be ready by the season opener
Sept. 12 against Carolina. So the Saints' bold experiment _
swapping their entire draft for one player _ remains alive and
well.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Kuharich said, the Saints have more devastating injury
problems. Their solid defensive end, Joe Johnson, ruptured a
patella tendon and will miss the entire season. The Pro Bowl
offensive tackle William Roaf hurt his knee last week, though he
should be healed in a few weeks. Kuharich remains excited about
this season despite the injuries.
</P>
<P>
   At this point in the year, every team is excited, even the
Philadelphia Eagles, who might be lucky to win five games. The
preseason is still young enough for teams to keep their dreams
intact. Reality doesn't bite for a few more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   There are several interesting stories around the National
Football League, and if the preseason is any indication it might be
a truly exciting year. Here is a look around the league's training
camps.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INDIANAPOLIS &LR;  _ Quarterback Peyton Manning has picked up where
he left off in his rookie season. In training camp, Manning has
shown the poise of a 10-year veteran, and he could put up big
numbers this season. The team will need his skills because the
Colts are in the toughest division in football, the American
Football Conference East. Still, they have an excellent chance of
making the playoffs as a wild-card team, thanks to Manning.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SAN DIEGO &LR;  _ The player chosen second behind Manning last year,
quarterback Ryan Leaf, may be the biggest draft bust of the 1990s.
The good news for the Chargers is that linebacker Junior Seau has
made some of the best catches on the team in practices. Not
interceptions, catches. Seau has been working at tight end and
could make his debut in the final preseason game against Kansas
City on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SEATTLE &LR;  _ The Pro Bowl wide receiver Joey Galloway is serious
about his threat to sit out the season if the Seahawks do not meet
his contract demands. Coach Mike Holmgren, however, remains
confident that Galloway will be there once the season begins.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle offered Galloway a seven-year deal worth $35 million
that included a $7 million signing bonus. It would have made him
the second-highest-paid wide receiver behind Green Bay's Antonio
Freeman, who is arguably the best receiver in the league. Galloway
wants a five-year contract worth $24 million with a $9 million
bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, quarterback Jon Kitna has had a solid camp. What
worries Holmgren is the situation at backup quarterback. Glenn
Foley, the former Jet, has been disappointing so far.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GREEN BAY &LR;  _ The reason Ron Wolf, the general manager of the
Packers, is perhaps the best at what he does is because of his
vision. When Holmgren left for Seattle, Wolf felt that Ray Rhodes,
dismissed as coach by the Philadelphia Eagles, would be a perfect
fit for the Packers, and so far Wolf is correct. The players have
taken to Rhodes. And the offensive coordinator Sherman Lewis said
the Packers' offense is going to be more aggressive than in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JACKSONVILLE &LR;  _ Running back Fred Taylor rushed for 1,223 yards
and 14 touchdowns in 12 starts as a rookie last season. Taylor
thinks that he can break the 2,000-yard barrier this season. He may
be right. Against a good Kansas City defense last Thursday night,
Taylor had touchdown runs of 16 and 86 yards.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SAN FRANCISCO &LR;  _ One of the most amazing stories of the
preseason is defensive lineman Bryant Young. It was thought that
Young might not be ready to play until the middle of this year
after breaking his leg at the end of last season. But he has
recovered faster than expected, and he could get 15 to 20 snaps in
the season opener against Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TAMPA BAY &LR;  _ The Buccaneers know that if they are ever going to
be a serious Super Bowl contender, they must improve their offense.
This preseason the team is using additional offensive formations,
including more four and five wide receiver sets, and increasing the
number of passing attempts on first down. Before their preseason
game yesterday against New England, the Buccaneers were 2-0, the
first time that had happened in the preseason in nine years.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; KANSAS CITY &LR;  _ Quarterback Elvis Grbac has played so poorly in
the preseason that it would not be surprising if Warren Moon is
starting by Game 6 against Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BUFFALO &LR;  _ Just as quarterback Doug Flutie was ready for his
chance last season when the starter Rob Johnson stumbled, Johnson,
now the backup, is ready to step in should Flutie prove a fluke. In
practices, Johnson has been just as efficient as Flutie.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JETS &LR;  _ Defensive players say that subtle, smart changes made
by the defensive coordinator Bill Belichick have made the defense
even better than it was last season. They will not yet say what
those changes are, but they feel the Jets could have the top-ranked
defense this season.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GIANTS &LR;  _ General Manager Ernie Accorsi made a smart move in
selecting offensive lineman Luke Petitgout in the draft in April.
The team has lost the starter Lance Scott to a knee injury for
possibly the entire season, and Petitgout has been moved to Scott's
guard position.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; College vs. Pros, Part I  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   As someone who has had three coaching stints in college football
_ two at Southern California and one at Nevada-Las Vegas _ in
addition to coaching the Los Angeles Rams, John Robinson is highly
qualified to assess the differences between coaching in college and
in the pros. His words on the subject are interesting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the pro athlete, your relationship is pretty much
football,'' Robinson said. ``If he has financial problems or if he
has legal problems or emotional problems, he tends to go somewhere
else.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not what happens in college, Robinson said. There a coach
becomes everything to a player. Most coaches, professional or
college, do not want to be involved in a player's life outside of
football, despite whatever public stance they may take to the
contrary. But unlike professional coaches, college coaches cannot
ignore the difficulties a player may have off of the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``In college, most of a players' problems get dumped in your
lap,'' Robinson said, ``and you take those home and then you become
a surrogate parent whether you want to or not.''

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Environmental activist Aaron Maier surveyed the
abandoned industrial plant that blights his poor neighborhood here
on the banks of the Hudson River. The lot, vacant but for an
abandoned factory building, was overrun by weeds, and the soil was
soaked with toxic chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, he would have called for the standard
environmentalist's prescription: Clean up the property thoroughly,
no matter what the cost to business or government. But today, Maier
is convinced that that approach has frightened off potential
developers and left old industrial tracts like the one here
orphaned. He believes it would be easier to attract a developer if
the law didn't require that the land be cleaned to a pristine
condition, but rather just enough for another industrial plant.
</P>
<P>
   His conversion may sound like heresy to some environmentalists,
but it is easy enough to explain. Like many civic leaders in poor,
largely minority communities across the country, Maier has
concluded that decades of aggressive environmental policy have
failed to solve pollution problems and have contributed to economic
woes.
</P>
<P>
   So Maier, who is black, and some other minority leaders from
poor urban communities have found themselves in an unexpected
alliance with big business as part of a national push by business
interests to ease the cleanup standards for pollution-blighted
properties commonly referred to as brownfields.
</P>
<P>
   This new approach has created something of a crisis for
environmentalists. For two decades, they have courted black and
Hispanic leaders under the banner of ``environmental justice,'' a
movement rooted in the notion that poor communities are burdened
with an unfair share of polluted properties.
</P>
<P>
   But many minority leaders are now saying that while they are
still committed to safeguarding the environment, that objective
should not be achieved at the expense of economic opportunities for
poor urban neighborhoods. They point out that in many poor
neighborhoods, brownfields are neither cleaned up nor put to
productive use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goals should be to promote economic development in these
communities while protecting the environment,'' said Vernice Miller
Travis, a former resident of New York City's Harlem who used to
head the Environmental Justice Initiative at the Environmental
Resources Defense Council. ``Those two concepts are not
diametrically opposed. But it requires some different thinking than
what we are used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, there are about 450,000 brownfields with varying
levels of contamination, according to private and public estimates.
Roughly three dozen states, including New Jersey, Connecticut and
Massachusetts, have adopted new regulations to expedite the cleanup
of such sites as long as they are not deemed so dangerous that they
require extensive work under either state or federal Superfund
programs.
</P>
<P>
   But strict cleanup laws adopted during the 1980s in the wake of
Love Canal still exist in other states, including New York and
California. Environmentalists have argued that abandoned industrial
properties should be cleaned to a relatively high standard, and
that the current owners should pay for the cleanup, even if they
did not cause the pollution.
</P>
<P>
   But business leaders counter that a high cleanup standard is
unnecessary in many cases, particularly when a brownfield will be
used for a factory and not for, say, a home or playground. More
than that, though, they say that holding property owners
responsible for cleanup costs has led many potential investors to
shun brownfields and look elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Bruder is one of those investors. His company, the Brookhill
Group, redevelops roughly 35 brownfields a year across the country,
constructing shopping malls, office buildings and the like. But he
has avoided states like New York, where, he says, environmental
laws discourage brownfield use. ``We'd love to do something in New
York,'' he said. But the economics and the legislation don't
work.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York City Partnership, a business group, has been
pushing to relax the cleanup standards in New York. ``If you set up
cleanup standards that are unachievable, you end up in a no-man's
land, and that's not good for anybody,'' said Jody Kass, an
environmental expert with the group.
</P>
<P>
   Even the staunchest environmentalists concede that more must be
done to help poor urban communities clean up and re-develop
brownfields. But the answer, they insist, is not to do away with
current cleanup standards, particularly those intended to insure
that the most dangerously polluted sites are cleaned up, no matter
the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Brodsky, a Democrat who is chairman of the New York
state Assembly's Environmental Committee, says he is disturbed that
poor communities are being asked to surrender environmental
protections in exchange for the promise of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned that business leaders are using the notion of
redeveloping polluted inner-city sites as a way of gutting existing
public health standards for all sites, now matter how dangerous
they are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be a way to redevelop minority inner-city
communities,'' he added, ``or it could turn into a way to re-poison
minority inner-city communities. The jury is still out.''
</P>
<P>
   But Maier, the environmental activist from Albany, says the
failures of current environmental policy are etched all over the
bleak and empty industrial landscape of his neighborhood. He
believes a change is long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not talking about surrendering,'' Maier said. ``I am
talking about an honest appraisal of what can be done. Urban
environmentalists like myself have been forced to rethink the old
polices that have left the inner cities behind.''

   WASHINGTON _ Toward the end of every year, millions of Americans
go on medical shopping sprees. They get their teeth cleaned and
their eyes checked. They buy designer eyeglasses, orthopedic shoes
and long-term supplies of birth-control pills. Some even make extra
appointments with their analysts.
</P>
<P>
   These people are taking advantage of a tax break called flexible
spending accounts that hardly anyone believes is good public
policy. While the government's goal is to hold down medical costs,
this part of the tax law encourages extra medical spending.
</P>
<P>
   There are probably dozens of other such laws on the books _ laws
that may have been enacted with the best of intentions but that
turned out to work at cross-purposes with government policy.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Butler at the Heritage Foundation says, for example, that
it makes no sense for buildings across the country to remain
dilapidated because the historic preservation law makes it too
costly to restore them.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Hevener, a tax lawyer, says nothing could be more absurd
than tax-subsidized parking, which encourages commuters to drive,
thus consuming fuel and worsening pollution.
</P>
<P>
   John Frydenlund at Citizens Against Government Waste believes
the most ridiculous laws are the federal subsidies for the domestic
sugar, peanut and dairy industries, which cost Americans billions
of dollars in higher food prices.
</P>
<P>
   Each of those is a candidate for a list of laws with unintended
consequences that outweigh whatever benefits exist. But here are
one reporter's favorites:
</P>
<P>
   FLEXIBLE SPENDING ACCOUNTS. Since 1984, the tax law has allowed
employers to offer these accounts to workers. More than 50,000
employers, including almost all large companies and many states and
municipalities, offer the benefit to more than 6 million workers.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the year, employees declare how much money
they want withheld from their pay to cover out-of-pocket medical
expenses _ not just insurance deductibles and copayments but also
expenses not covered by insurance. Since the workers do not pay
federal or state income or payroll taxes on this money, they can in
effect save 30 to 50 percent on their medical expenses. The richer
they are, the more they save.
</P>
<P>
   The catch is that at the end of the year they must forfeit to
their boss all the money in their account that has not been spent.
This use-it-or-lose-it aspect leads participants to go on spending
binges at the end of every year to clean out their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The Employers Council on Flexible Spending, the lobby behind the
law, would like to eliminate the use-it-or-lose-it rule, but that
would cost more than politicians are willing to allocate. Others
would like to abolish the accounts altogether on the ground that
people who are well off and work for large employers should not get
a tax benefit unavailable to those who are less affluent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only two words by which you can characterize this _
venal and stupid,'' said Uwe Reinhardt, a health-care economist at
Princeton. He has such an account himself, and last December, he
discovered he had money left in it. So he and his wife went to the
doctor on Christmas Eve and got colonoscopies.
</P>
<P>
   FLOOD INSURANCE. The original idea was to give subsidized
insurance to people in areas that often flooded. In return, the
communities were required to enact strict controls on land use and
building codes that would reduce the likelihood of flood damage.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, this has worked. But in many others, a study by
the National Wildlife Federation found, the availability of
inexpensive insurance ``encourages development and rebuilding in
areas with a predictably high risk of future catastrophic loss.''
The federation found 32,000 insured properties in 300 communities
that had been flooded and repaired at least twice. A house in
Houston worth about $100,000 was flooded 16 times, with $800,000 in
insurable repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Pasterick, a spokesman for the Federal Insurance
Administration, said it was a ``misperception'' that cheap
insurance led people to build in flood-prone locales. But he
conceded that federally subsidized premiums on new structures
averaged less than 40 percent of what private insurance would cost.
</P>
<P>
   CONSUMER COMPLAINTS. When Congress created the Consumer Product
Safety Commission in 1972, the law specified that the new agency's
mission was ``to assist consumers in evaluating the comparative
safety of consumer products.'' But the law added a zinger. It
prohibited the agency from making public any consumer complaint
about a product without first getting permission from the
manufacturer. It is the only regulatory agency that has such a
restriction.
</P>
<P>
   ``This allows companies to control the information flow,'' said
Ann Brown, the head of the commission. ``Those who ought to control
the flow are consumers. Our hands are tied.''
</P>
<P>
   Commission officials said that, in fact, only a handful of
companies take advantage of their ability to block publicity. Which
companies are those?
</P>
<P>
   It is against the law, the officials said, for them to reveal
that information.

<P>
   As the price of gold hits a 20-year low, diehard gold bugs and
others are rushing in to buy the precious metal as a hedge against
the day the bear wakes from his prolonged hibernation on Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always advise our clients to invest a portion of their
portfolios in gold-related investments because gold is a contrarian
investment in that it has a negative correlation to stocks and
bonds,'' said Harry Bingham, president of Van Eck Institutional
Advisers in New York City, which has been urging clients to take
advantage of declining prices.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine for those dabbling in bullion or gold futures, but
what about the rest of America? Haven't the collective contents of
jewelry boxes taken a nose dive? The price an ounce has slid 11
percent since January alone. Wouldn't people be better off buying
Beanie Babies than bracelets and belly rings?
</P>
<P>
   The market value for gold has been declining for several years
as global economies have collapsed and central banks have sold off
tons of bullion in a time of low inflation. The Bank of England,
the latest to sell, in July unloaded 25 tons of 415 tons it plans
to sell to raise money to invest in U.S., European and Japanese
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Gold once traded for nearly $500 an ounce, but the influx of
bullion on the market has depressed the price to about $255 an
ounce from $325 a year ago. Mine operators in South Africa and
elsewhere have shut down or laid off workers.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, consumers' demand for gold is at an all-time
high. U.S. retail sales last year increased more than 8 percent to
$13.7 billion, according to the World Gold Council, which
represents the seventh consecutive year of revenue increases.
</P>
<P>
   Synonymous with status and self-expression for millenniums,
adorning the heads of royalty, the fingers of newlyweds and the
necks of fashion victims, gold historically rises and falls in
cycles like the stock market. When it comes to the price of jewelry
relative to gold values, consumers are ``just oblivious,'' said
Judith Langer, president of Langer Associates, a market research
and trend consulting firm in New York City. ``It's sort of like
fur. When fur becomes less expensive, consumers consider it an
affordable status symbol rather than thinking it's cheap and,
therefore, worthless.''

<P>
   Although jewelry accounts for 80 percent of the gold demand
worldwide, consumers won't see any devaluation soon. Retail prices
can take up to six months to reflect market fluctuations; merchants
may take that long to sell off their old inventories. This year's
holiday sale prices may be very low because retailers are
restocking at cheaper rates.
</P>
<P>
   But all that glitters is not not marked down. Craftsmanship
counts. ``It's kind of like weighing an Escada silk blouse and
saying `how much silk is in it,''' said Mark Seelig, vice president
of sales for Ourafin Llc., a large gold jewelry manufacturer and
importer.
</P>
<P>
   As an investment, ``gold is insurance against economic,
financial and political uncertainty,'' said Richard Scott Ram,
chief portfolio strategist at the World Gold Council, who has been
advising pension fund managers to include more gold as a part of a
diverse portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone, though, sees much value in purchasing gold for
more than its snob appeal. ``If somebody wants to have precious
metals in their portfolio, we want them to keep it at a small
portion,'' said Ray Russolillo, director of personal financial
services for PricewaterhouseCoopers. ``One of the big reasons is
there is no current income generated from it, there is often a cost
to holding the metal and typically it has been a long-term hedge
against inflation.'' Russolillo prefers cushions that are more
liquid.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over whether gold and gold futures are an investment
bargain these days may make stimulating conversation on the
cocktail circuit, but jewelry lovers, it seems, have little sense
of what all the fuss is about.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the research we've done about who knows about the gold
price, 15 percent state that they knew what the price was,'' said
Anne DiNuzzo, jewelry manager for the World Gold Council, ``and
half that 15 percent were wrong.''

<P>
   As the price of gold hits a 20-year low, diehard gold bugs and
others are rushing in to buy the precious metal as a hedge against
the day the bear wakes from his prolonged hibernation on Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always advise our clients to invest a portion of their
portfolios in gold-related investments because gold is a contrarian
investment in that it has a negative correlation to stocks and
bonds,'' said Harry Bingham, president of Van Eck Institutional
Advisers in New York City, which has been urging clients to take
advantage of declining prices.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine for those dabbling in bullion or gold futures, but
what about the rest of America? Haven't the collective contents of
jewelry boxes taken a nose dive? The price an ounce has slid 11
percent since January alone. Wouldn't people be better off buying
Beanie Babies than bracelets and belly rings?
</P>
<P>
   The market value for gold has been declining for several years
as global economies have collapsed and central banks have sold off
tons of bullion in a time of low inflation. The Bank of England,
the latest to sell, in July unloaded 25 tons of 415 tons it plans
to sell to raise money to invest in U.S., European and Japanese
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Gold once traded for nearly $500 an ounce, but the influx of
bullion on the market has depressed the price to about $255 an
ounce from $325 a year ago. Mine operators in South Africa and
elsewhere have shut down or laid off workers.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, consumers' demand for gold is at an all-time
high. U.S. retail sales last year increased more than 8 percent to
$13.7 billion, according to the World Gold Council, which
represents the seventh consecutive year of revenue increases.
</P>
<P>
   Synonymous with status and self-expression for millenniums,
adorning the heads of royalty, the fingers of newlyweds and the
necks of fashion victims, gold historically rises and falls in
cycles like the stock market. When it comes to the price of jewelry
relative to gold values, consumers are ``just oblivious,'' said
Judith Langer, president of Langer Associates, a market research
and trend consulting firm in New York City. ``It's sort of like
fur. When fur becomes less expensive, consumers consider it an
affordable status symbol rather than thinking it's cheap and,
therefore, worthless.''
</P>
<P>
   Although jewelry accounts for 80 percent of the gold demand
worldwide, consumers won't see any devaluation soon. Retail prices
can take up to six months to reflect market fluctuations; merchants
may take that long to sell off their old inventories. This year's
holiday sale prices may be very low because retailers are
restocking at cheaper rates.

SPORTS COLUMN: NEW PRESIDENT ALREADY HAS LEGACY AT ASHE STADIUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Judy Levering sat in her hotel room in the middle of
the night and jotted down four or five pages' worth of notes.
</P>
<P>
   Her prep work was worth it. Levering's arguments the next day
finally convinced her colleagues that the new stadium at the
National Tennis Center should be named after the late Arthur Ashe.
</P>
<P>
   The name is now an ancient tradition, as American stadiums go
these days, heading for its third U.S. Open on Monday. Saturday,
the place was bustling with Arthur Ashe Kids' Day, for fun and
charity, and Levering promises that the name will stand, unblighted
by the name of some transient corporate sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   In her first Open as the first female president of the U.S.
Tennis Association, Levering now has another challenge _ filling
the ludicrously oversized 21,000-seat stadium with actual tennis
fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get more people in here,'' Levering said the
other day.
</P>
<P>
   She was standing on the floor of the handsome new stadium.
Workmen were bustling at the south end, installing a contraption
that will allow a television camera to zoom from one corner to
another (but not during points).
</P>
<P>
   Jim Courier was preparing for a workout on the main court.
Levering waved at him, a favorite for his devotion to Davis Cup
competition. Then she nodded at the seats just a few feet away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players love to have an audience,'' Levering said.
</P>
<P>
   That does not always happen. For the first eight or nine days of
the Open, thousands of fans flock to the downsized Louis Armstrong
Stadium, thousands flock to the intimate grandstand, and thousands
more flock to the outer courts to literally peer over the players'
shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   What is worse, thousands of wine-sippers and shrimp-ingesters
hide out in the air-conditioned sanctums of the luxury boxes to
watch the soaps, to check up on their flitting fortunes in the
market, anything to avoid sitting in the elements and watching
tennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put the stars in the stadium court, very often they
have easy matches in the early rounds,'' Levering said. ``People
might go to the hotly contested matches, and the stadium is
one-third empty.''
</P>
<P>
   Or one-third full. Like her friend and predecessor, Harry
Marmion, Levering seems genuinely committed to not doing what the
three other Grand Slam events have been doing, which is selling out
the secondary arenas, packing the grounds, and fairly forcing
people to stay in the main stadium.
</P>
<P>
   This is going to be hard to believe, given New York's
well-deserved reputation for venality and cacophony, but the Open
is now the most pleasant of Grand Slam events _ the courts more
accessible, the aisles less jammed, the services more available.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived in London from 1976 through 1979 and it was just
starting,'' Levering said, with all due respect. ``This year at
Wimbledon I wanted to go over to watch Alexandra Stevenson, but I
had some duties in the Royal Box, and I could not even get to the
reserved area at the second court.''
</P>
<P>
   This year the Open will make available 1,000 grounds tickets for
each of the first nine days, at prices from $25 to $35, on sale
that day, theoretically making it easier for locals to get a
glimpse.
</P>
<P>
   Levering reminds New Yorkers that the center, open year round,
``is the best public facility in the country.'' She thinks, as the
first female president, that she can make tennis more popular on
the grass-roots level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men and women approach issues differently,'' she said the
other day. ``Women generally don't have big egos. We generally
don't always have to be right. Now that will change as women get
into situations where men have been. But in general, women
understand how things work at the community level because that's
how we've lived it. We've looked at values differently, been
involved in the rearing of children.''
</P>
<P>
   For all her interest in the care and handling of young people,
Levering has not yet persuaded recalcitrant youths named Sampras
and Agassi to come out for all Davis Cup play. She has had better
success with her peers in the USTA, who nicknamed her The Velvet
Hammer for her perseverance.
</P>
<P>
   This mannered white-haired grandmother (from Kansas City, Mo.,
and Lancaster, Pa., now living with her husband in Stowe, Vt.)
pushed board members to think beyond the lucrative but grubby
practice of courting a corporate name. She was convinced it should
be named for the Open and Wimbledon champion who was activist,
scholar, businessman, Davis Cup captain and hero for the way he
faced his early death from AIDS, acquired from a blood transfusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have named it USTA Stadium or we could name it after
a person,'' Levering said. ``If it would be an outstanding player,
well, that is debatable, but Arthur was a champion who transcended
the sport. Every other sport would have loved to have Arthur Ashe
play that sport. We were lucky to have Arthur.''
</P>
<P>
   After writing down her thoughts, Levering convinced Marmion and
the others the next day. If she does nothing else, the name will be
a monument to her volunteer work with the USTA.
</P>
<P>
   During her two summers as president, Levering will search for a
method _ bribes or point of a gun or moral coercion _ to induce
denizens of the luxury boxes to emerge from the shadows to watch a
bit of tennis. They might even enjoy it.

SAMPRAS AIMS TO COLLECT A 13TH GEM AT U.S. OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ROBIN FINN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Perhaps he was an aerialist in another incarnation,
because Pete Sampras, not weighed down at all by his baggy shorts
and graphite racquet, surely has no fear of flying. Hitting new
heights has become part of his daily routine.
</P>
<P>
   On the grass at Wimbledon, his horizontal swan-dive volleys
mimic Superman taking off on a mission. On the hardcourts, his
vertical leaps pay out-of-context homage to the slam dunks of his
role model, Michael Jordan. And in the record books he is
attempting to hit the stratosphere during the next two weeks at the
U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   If Sampras, top-seeded as usual when the Open gets under way
Monday at the National Tennis Center, collects his fifth career
Open championship two weeks from Sunday, he will not only equal
Jimmy Connors' Open record but will become the only man to win 13
Grand Slam singles crowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason why I can't do it,'' a confident Sampras
said late last week on Long Island after a pre-Open hiatus at home
on his couch in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The rest was designed to heal the right hip flexor injury that
curtailed his formidable midsummer winning streak at 24 victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm back on hardcourts,'' he said. ``I love this time of year.
I'm right where I want to be, and it certainly would be nice to
break the record here where it all started.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to the 1990 Grand Slam breakthrough that made
him the Open's youngest men's champion at 19.
</P>
<P>
   Now at age 28 and top-ranked for a record six years in
succession, Sampras, whose game possesses a completeness and
complexity his contemporaries have been able to challenge only in
spurts, has just entered his 275th week at No. 1 after eclipsing
Lendl's record of 270 weeks this summer.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Sampras handcuffed the 29-year-old Andre Agassi, this
year's French Open champion, in a stirring Wimbledon final that
earned Sampras his sixth title there and his 12th Slam over all.
The feat tied him with Roy Emerson for the career Grand Slam
record.
</P>
<P>
   Emerson, who earned half of his dozen titles on home turf at the
Australian Open, said it would be unrealistic to not expect Sampras
to break his 32-year-old record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously it's going to be done,'' the 62-year-old Emerson
said last week from Newport Beach, Calif. ``I think Pete is a great
champion. His strokes are terrific on both sides. He can serve like
crazy. He can also play the net. He's great for all the young
players in America to emulate. The only way I think you can get to
Pete is if his serve goes off a bit. He's a tough customer.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Sampras regrouped after yet another dismal exit from
the French Open, the only Slam to thwart him, he has been the
toughest customer in tennis. Just ask his closest rivals, the
two-time U.S. Open champion, Patrick Rafter, seeded to meet Sampras
in the semifinals. Or ask the 1994 Open champion Agassi, seeded to
face Sampras in the final.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's starting to become scary for the rest of the players and
becoming a habit for Pete; you know if he's in that sort of form
going into the Open, it's going to be tough,'' Rafter said about
Sampras' summer tear.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-match tear started with his Wimbledon tuneup at Queens
and carried him to hardcourts titles at Los Angeles and Cincinnati,
and included the closure of worrisome losing streaks against Rafter
(three matches) and the 1996 Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek
(four) before ending in a default because of injury in the
quarterfinals at Indianapolis after he tweaked his hip performing
an airborne maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got everything; we all know that,'' said Rafter, who
admitted to being ``intimidated the whole time'' by Sampras' serve
in their Cincinnati final.
</P>
<P>
   ``I beat the guys I needed to beat this summer,'' said Sampras,
whose recent conquests include three victories against his
archrival, the second-ranked Agassi.
</P>
<P>
   Now 10-16 against Sampras, with losses to him in the 1990 and
1995 Open finals, Agassi provided a letter of recommendation for
the game Sampras brings to the Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can hit four corners with a number of various spins as well
as pace,'' Agassi said. ``He can cover the forehand, run better
than anybody in the game. He can go from defense to offense in the
matter of a split second. He can stay back and rally with the best
of them or chip and come in like he's Pat Rafter.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi also finds a panorama of personalities in the
Californian's style. ``He can take on a lot of faces out there and
you never know which one he's going to bring to which point,''
Agassi said. ``He's obviously made himself the guy to beat again.
He played inspired tennis at Wimbledon and he hasn't stopped
since.''
</P>
<P>
   The only Slam where Sampras has not played up to his potential
is the French Open. Emerson is convinced Sampras should have won it
by now, as is Rod Laver, the only man to twice win all four Grand
Slams in a calendar year, hence his positioning in the record books
as the greatest player of the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Laver has summed it up pretty well, that if Sampras is
going to go down as the greatest ever, the experts say he's got to
win a French Open,'' Rafter said. ``But on every other surface,
he's probably the greatest ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Laver said he did not think Sampras had to win the
French to prove himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``His career stands up pretty good on its own,'' Laver said.
``That doesn't mean he can't win it, but it's a tough row to hoe.
And I don't believe in that greatest ever stuff, anyhow. I think
you have to stay in your own era, and certainly he is the best of
his, even without the French. He's already done so much he's
complete without it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras' successful retention of the year-end No. 1 ranking in
1998, which broke a tie with Connors, and his successful defense of
his 1998 Wimbledon title, which fulfilled his personal prerequisite
of collecting at least one Slam a year, have landed him at the Open
in a sanguine frame of mind.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras said: ``Will I be able to go to sleep at night and eat
my meals if I'm not No. 1? The answer is yes, because I haven't
been No. 1 every week of my career. It's not an obsession. But I
feel like if I'm playing the tennis I should be playing, and I'm
healthy, I should be there. As far as this Open goes, it's open but
not that open. I've played the kind of tennis going into it to make
me feel like I'm in serious contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I win it? Sure I can, but if I don't, I'll still feel like
this has been a good year for me. It was a big relief winning
Wimbledon, because I felt like I achieved my main goal. Now I'm
just riding the wave and I hope that wave doesn't crash anytime
soon.''  &QL;

THERE'S NO USE CRYING OVER RUINED 12-YEAR-OLD ARMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The people who every August give us the opportunity to watch the
spectacle of 12-year-old boys crying on national television boast
of Hall of Famers who played in their leagues across the country,
the leagues with the capital L's.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan Ryan, George Brett and Robin Yount, the newest Hall of
Famers, we are told, played Little League Baseball. So did Catfish
Hunter, Tom Seaver, Jim Palmer and a few others. Chances are,
however, these players would be in the Hall of Fame if they had
played pickup baseball in their neighborhood playgrounds or parks.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, how many more good players could have come
out of those playgrounds and parks over the years if left to their
own devices and not restricted by the straitjacket practices
engendered by Little League and other youth organizations?
</P>
<P>
   ``In the generations we grew up in,'' said Larry Rothschild,
manager of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, ``when you wanted to play
baseball, you went to the park and played all day long and threw
and threw and threw. I remember being told just come home when the
street lights go on. The only way kids play baseball today is
organized baseball. Moms drive them to practice and pick them up.
You never see kids with their glove on the handlebars of their
bicycle going to the park. You don't see kids playing without
supervision.''
</P>
<P>
   What is seen in Little League games is pitchers dazzling
opposing hitters with curveballs. Those 12-year-old curveballs are
so impressive ESPN announcers wax poetic about them while ESPN
cameras zoom in on the hitters they struck out and now are in tears
from the humiliation of letting their teams down on national
television.
</P>
<P>
   So much has been studied and written about the dangers of
pre-teen-agers throwing curveballs that by now Little League might
have listened and imposed rules outlawing the pitch just as it
mandates the maximum number of innings a youngster can pitch, oh,
that is, unless it's tournament time and then the limit rises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the bone plates have closed, generally around 14 or 15,
you have to be very careful with the curveball,'' Rothschild, a
former pitcher, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When can he or she learn to throw a curve?'' asks one recent
publication, The Physician and Sportsmedicine. The answer:
</P>
<P>
   ``Throwing a curveball increases the risk of injury because
forceful supination and ulnar deviation places more medial stress
on the forearm. Safe mechanics for throwing the curveball are
difficult to master before the age of 13 or 14.''
</P>
<P>
   David Osinski, executive director of the American Baseball
Foundation in Birmingham, Ala., agrees. ``When you release the ball
throwing any pitch, the hand turns outward from the body,'' Osinski
said in a telephone interview. ``Most people who teach the curve
require that the pitch be thrown turning the hand in toward the
body. You're asking your body to do something that's not normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normal movement is for the hand to go away from the body once
the ball is released. By doing it the other way purposely, you're
putting more stress on the shoulder and the elbow. So for a young
child who can barely control his body, to ask him to change the way
he moves his hand is quite demanding.''
</P>
<P>
   What is a safe age for youngsters to start tinkering with the
curveball?
</P>
<P>
   ``The trite way,'' Osinski said, ``is to say when you're old
enough to shave. The idea is to wait until you have a
well-developed young athlete and his bones have fused. We probably
inhibit the competitiveness of the pitchers who come to us because
we don't teach them the curve until they're 14.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach of the Toms River, N.J., Little League team defended
the use of curveballs by his pitchers, including his son, saying
that he has his pitchers apply ice to their throwing arms after
games. He has evidently discovered a secret that physicians and
professionals haven't, that the application of ice hastens the
fusing of bones.
</P>
<P>
   But Little League coaches love the curveball as much as their
pitchers. ``Kids can't hit breaking balls,'' Rothschild said, ``so
pitchers throw it and strike out hitters. They like it so much they
don't throw enough fastballs and don't develop their arm that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   That's another element that works against the development of
modern-day Seavers and Palmers. Dave Duncan, the noted St. Louis
pitching coach, said fewer and fewer power pitchers are coming
along, and he attributed the decrease to the decline of throwing in
general and playing long toss in particular.
</P>
<P>
   When kids pick up a ball only for Little League purposes, they
are doing their arms a disservice, he and other professionals said.
</P>
<P>
   Adding a variation on that theme, Rothschild said: ``If you
don't play by yourself and have a chance to experiment, it's
putting everyone in a little box. You get a lot of similarities.
Little League coaches don't let kids develop their own
personalities.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing all day long with friends rather than uniformed
teammates, the Devils Rays' manager said, is where the creativity
comes in, ``the uniqueness in a delivery or a batting stance.''
</P>
<P>
   Rothschild added: ``There has to be some personality playing the
game. We've lost that.''
</P>
<P>
   The losers even cry alike.

   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ It is common to refer to earthquakes as
natural disasters, but the one that took thousands of lives in
Turkey this month was more than that. Many of the victims would
have survived if their homes had been built in accordance with
basic safety standards. Instead they were built with cheap
materials by contractors who had learned they could make up in
corruption what they lacked in skill and experience.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey is home to some of the world's most respected
construction companies, which have built hotels, airports and
housing projects not only here but across Asia, North Africa and
the former Soviet Union. The earthquake showed, however, that there
are also many ignorant and unscrupulous contractors. They have made
their way to success through bribery and other forms of dishonesty,
and the system that brought them wealth must now share the blame
for the tragedy that has brought Turkey to its knees.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption in Turkey is not as pervasive as it is in many nearby
countries. Government jobs are not for sale to the highest bidder,
as they are in Azerbaijan. Teachers and doctors do not demand
payoffs for their services, as they do in Georgia. Theft is still
uncommon, and there have been remarkably few cases of looting in
the aftermath of the quake. This reflects a culture in which
murderers are sometimes esteemed because they are presumed to have
acted in defense of family honor, while thieves are despised for
violating one of God's most elemental laws.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, the kind of corruption that has crippled
many nations' development efforts has begun to take hold in Turkey.
It is a trend this country will have to confront and reverse if it
hopes to join the European Union and become a fully trusted partner
of the West.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey was for years an inward-looking country where foreign
travel was discouraged, possession of many imported items was a
crime and private enterprise was choked by a host of regulations.
These restrictions effectively cut Turkey off from the world, but
they also insulated the country against worldwide trends like
corruption. National leaders valued propriety above economic
growth, and most ordinary people followed their example.
</P>
<P>
   All that changed in the mid 1980s with the emergence of Turgut
Ozal, a giant political figure who proved to be the most
revolutionary leader Turkey had seen since Mustafa Kemal Ataturk
half a century before. As prime minister and later as president,
Ozal flung open doors and windows that had been tightly shut for
decades, freeing what proved to be the enormous energies of Turkish
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   It was a profoundly important step, and it brought Turkey into
the international mainstream in a very short time. But as Ozal
urged Turks to free themselves from the outmoded rules that had
held them back for so long, he also seemed to send a subtle message
that rules in general were bad. Some ambitious Turks understood him
to say that getting rich was such an important and wonderful goal
that it didn't matter how one accomplished it.
</P>
<P>
   What sort of business could an unschooled and capital-poor Turk
launch to propel him on the road to wealth? Thousands chose to
start construction companies, relying on the help of friends in
local politics to win contracts. In a wide-open economy that was
growing at an astonishing rate, many of these contractors quickly
became rich.
</P>
<P>
   The price that society paid for their rise to wealth became
tragically clear when this month's earthquake struck. The
contractors had built countless apartment blocks with sandy
concrete and reinforcing rods far too weak to withstand the forces
of nature that regularly shake the country.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the blame must be apportioned to a social system in
which everything is negotiable and friends always help each other.
If a mayor or other public official has a friend or relative who
owns a construction company, tradition dictates that they make some
arrangement so both can prosper. To allow such deals to founder
simply because the contractor lacks capital or experience or
training would seem hard-hearted.
</P>
<P>
   In the days following the earthquake, furious survivors sought
to lynch several contractors who had made careers of building poor
housing that collapsed like cards when the ground began to shake.
But the contractors, realizing that they would become targets, had
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The contractors are not the only guilty parties. Buyers of homes
are also complicit in the system that led to the unnecessary deaths
of so many people. Turkey has suffered great social dislocation
over the last two decades, with millions of migrants streaming out
of the impoverished and war-torn southeast to prosperous western
towns. Many were eager to buy new apartments for $15,000 or less,
and didn't worry about safety. Inspectors were never around to
spoil the party, and as a result, many of those apartments became
tombs.
</P>
<P>
   In many countries, the popular anger that this quake has
produced might have led the government to fall. But in Turkey,
everyone realizes that it is not simply the current government that
is responsible. It is the state itself, and the culture of
irresponsibility it has fostered.
</P>
<P>
   Turks have traditionally maintained an exaggerated respect for
the state and its institutions. That respect began to crumble in
1996, when a spectacular scandal revealed the state's involvement
with gangsters, assassins and drug smugglers. Now it has suffered
another blow, which deeply disturbs some senior political and
military leaders because it weakens their psychological hold on
their people.
</P>
<P>
   But if the earthquake leads Turks to recognize the need to
accept and obey rules in order to promote the general good, if it
leads them to demand more accountability from their leaders instead
of assuming that ``devlet baba'' _ Daddy State _ always knows best,
it may turn out to be a turning point for this highly dynamic but
still unformed country.

IRAN CONFRONTS A LONG-HIDDEN PROBLEM: DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By COLIN BARRACLOUGH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ The problem of illicit drugs is commonly
associated with prosperous, liberty-minded societies in Europe and
America, not a theocratic state run by some of the Islamic world's
most conservative mullahs.
</P>
<P>
   But Iran is slowly discovering that it too has a drug problem.
It has a drug smuggling problem. It has a drug violence and
kidnapping problem. More and more, it seems, it has a drug use
problem. And increasingly Iranian authorities have begun to grapple
with this problem in the open.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the revolution, our leaders thought that the idea of
drug use was imported from the West, so it was necessary to protect
our society from outside,'' said Afarin Rahimi, an Iranian who
works for the United Nations Drug Control Program, which opened an
office in Tehran in June. ``Now it's being understood that the
problem is a domestic one.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Iran's religious rulers were loath for many years to
deal with the problem publicly, an increase in the amount of drugs
entering the country, growing pressure from the West, and a more
liberal government under President Mohammad Khatami have brought
the issue to the fore.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past five years, the Iranian authorities have stepped
up their battle against well-armed smugglers who transport much of
the world's illegal supply of opium, heroin and hashish through
Iran to markets both here and in the West from sources in Pakistan
and Afghanistan. In Afghanistan, two decades of war have made the
country a haven for drug runners linked to various armed factions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The production of illicit drugs in Afghanistan is
astonishingly high,'' said Mohammad Fallah, the director of Iran's
Drug Control Headquarters, the country's national anti-narcotics
bureau. ``It flows from the country like water from a tap. We are
having greater success in cutting down the flow, but our task is
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   That task is harder still because Iran's location and its
1,200-mile eastern border make it the first line of defense against
the traffickers, and it has not been an easy line to hold.
</P>
<P>
   Some 2,700 Iranian law-enforcement personnel have died in Iran's
quiet drug war since the 1979 Islamic revolution _ so many that the
country's Drug Control Headquarters has even published a book of
``martyrs'' with photographs and eulogies to the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such losses, Iran's reported seizure rates would astound
anti-narcotics forces in North America or Europe. Since 1979,
authorities say they have seized more than 1,300 tons of contraband
drugs, more than half in the past five years. Indeed, the country
now accounts for 85 percent of opium seizures and more than 30
percent of heroin and morphine seizures worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, the smugglers are fighting back. This month, drug
traffickers kidnapped four European tourists in southern Iran, in a
daring effort to exchange them for jailed comrades, a tactic they
used successfully in June and that has escalated their challenge to
authorities. The hostages have yet to be released.
</P>
<P>
   The smugglers, mainly drawn from the Baluchi people, a tribal
group straddling the Iran-Pakistan border, possess a fearsome
arsenal of weapons, many obtained from the Afghan mujahedeen who
fought an American-backed war against Soviet invaders in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say that heavy machine guns mounted on all-terrain
vehicles often protect drug convoys, while the traffickers
themselves are sometimes armed with rocket-propelled grenades or
mortars. Iranian officials say that some groups have shot down
Iranian helicopters and warplanes with surface-to-air weapons,
including, Fallah says, American-made Stinger antiaircraft
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traffickers are so heavily armed that Iran's response has
quite properly been a military one,'' said a Western diplomat in
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations estimates that most of the 3,500 tons of
opium produced annually in Afghanistan is exported through Iran; an
additional 500 tons originates in Pakistan. Most is smuggled across
Iran's eastern border region through arid, inhospitable terrain
that provides perfect cover for the traffickers, who employ a wide
array of smuggling techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Some vehicles, packed with opium and heroin, are driven across
remote border areas at night. ``The drivers travel only in
darkness, using night-vision goggles to see their way,'' said
Fallah, a former intelligence officer with the Iranian police
force.
</P>
<P>
   The traffickers are also known to use methods that do not rely
on technology but are nonetheless effective. Fallah described one
in which traffickers employ a mother camel that has recently given
birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They separate the mother from its young, leaving the baby in
Iran but taking the mother to Afghanistan,'' he said. ``They place
this female at the head of a camel caravan, each animal loaded down
with drugs. The mother will walk night and day, leading the whole
caravan, and will not stop until it reaches its young.''
</P>
<P>
   Armed traffickers simply monitor the caravan's progress from a
safe distance through binoculars. ``Even if we intercept the
caravan, there is no one to arrest, only camels,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the drugs that enter Iran leave for markets abroad, and
the recent opening of the United Nations drug-control office here
has served to highlight a growing demand for opium and heroin
within Iran itself, particularly among the 70 percent or so of the
population that is under 30 and frustrated by Iran's strict social
codes and high unemployment. Indeed, officials estimate that as
many as 1.2 million Iranians may be addicts.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's prisons hold so many drug offenders _ 60 percent of
inmates are jailed on drug possession, dealing or trafficking
offenses _ that the judiciary has recently quit jailing offenders,
opting instead for fines, lashes and long-term treatment at one of
the 40 or so outpatient centers throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   While the drug issue is one of the few that Iran and Western
countries might agree on, Iranian officials complain that they have
borne the brunt of the fight against drug trafficking with little
recognition or outside help. Cooperation is complicated by the fact
that most Western countries have legislated against supplying
military goods to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Britain recently provided 3,000 flak jackets to Iran's
beleaguered border guards, but only after the government gained
special parliamentary approval for the shipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fight has cost Iran dear and yet the West doesn't care,''
said Mohammed Ali Tayarani, a deputy in Iran's 270-seat Parliament.
``Prime Minister Tony Blair gave us flak jackets; we provided the
guys to wear them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which is more expensive?'' he asked.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, Indonesia _ After 24 years of bloodshed and fear, East
Timor has reached its moment of truth, a referendum on Monday that
could lead it into a new era of freedom and reconciliation or one
of even fiercer civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The referendum offers a choice between independence or an
autonomous relationship with Indonesia, which invaded this former
Portuguese colony in 1975 and has fought against separatist rebels
ever since.
</P>
<P>
   But as the vote has drawn near, what should have been an
election campaign in this tiny, remote territory has been instead a
campaign of terror by brutal, rag-tag militias that oppose
independence.
</P>
<P>
   The militias, backed and organized by the Indonesian military,
have largely ignored appeals for calm from the United Nations,
which deployed here in May to organize the referendum. On Friday,
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he was ``appalled'' by the
continuing attacks and demanded that Indonesian forces fulfill
their obligation to maintain order.
</P>
<P>
   If they lose the vote and East Timor becomes free _ as most
analysts now predict _ leaders of these militias proclaim that they
will turn this South Pacific territory into ``a sea of blood.''
</P>
<P>
   With East Timor's history of warfare and revenge, both sides in
the conflict are more likely to return to battle rather than to
accept defeat, a number of Indonesian and foreign analysts predict.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath the fear that has gripped East Timor's 800,000
people, there is a tremor of hope, seen most vividly on Wednesday,
when thousands of people gathered in the streets to cheer
independence, waving the green, blue and white flag of East Timor,
which had been banned.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Alexandre Gusmao, the jailed separatist leader who could
become head of an independent East Timor, said last week while
under house arrest in Jakarta that he would declare an amnesty for
combatants in the long-running conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian officials say they will allow Gusmao to return to
East Timor shortly after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   If the military withdraws its support, the tough-talking militia
leaders could find that their best option is accommodation. ``There
is a feeling that we are on the verge of something that could be
marvelous for East Timor, a release from 24 years of hurt _ but
people are afraid to hope too much,'' said James Dunn, who was the
last Australian consul to a Portuguese-controlled East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1975 invasion, at least 200,000 people are believed to
have died in the endless fighting, a proportion of the population
that Dunn compared to the mass killings by the Communist Khmer
Rouge in Cambodia in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   For Indonesia, too, East Timor has been an open sore, costing as
much as $100 million a year to subdue and administer, arousing
continuing condemnation abroad and requiring, at the peak of the
fighting, the deployment of as many as 40,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia seems to have been able to do nothing right in East
Timor, and the endgame that has arrived now with unexpected
suddenness seems as clumsy and self-defeating as the long-running
occupation.
</P>
<P>
   The referendum is the brainchild of President B.J. Habibie, who
surprised many in his own government by announcing in January that
if East Timor rejects his offer of autonomy he will simply let it
go free.
</P>
<P>
   Under his proposal Indonesia would continue to be responsible
for the territory's external defense, foreign policy, parts of the
judicial process and currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not want to be burdened with the problem of East Timor
after Jan. 1, 2000,'' Habibie said.
</P>
<P>
   This quick timetable ignored most proposals for solving the
problem of East Timor. Even the territory's separatist leaders had
argued that it would need a transition period of several years
before voting on independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``By ignoring confidence-building measures from both sides, he
is making a new hell in East Timor,'' said J. Kristiadi, a
political scientist in Jakarta.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The change in policy also ignored the deep commitment of
Indonesia's armed forces to East Timor _ the only battleground in
their history, the proving ground of most top generals and the
graveyard of thousands of their comrades.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many in the military fear that if East Timor is
allowed to break away, separatist demands could be accelerated in
other troubled regions of Indonesia, particularly Aceh, Irian Jaya
and the Moluccas.
</P>
<P>
   The military has repeatedly disavowed any involvement in the
violence here, but its denials have taken on a slapdash quality in
the face of clear evidence that includes open gatherings of militia
fighters in military compounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most disturbing aspect of what we see here is that there
seems to be, from what I can see, not even any pretense by the
military to be operating under the civilian government,'' said a
Jakarta-based diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately after Habibie's announcement in January, the
military began recruiting and organizing the armed militias, a
collection of farmers and unemployed young men with greater or
lesser commitments to or understanding of their political cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pattern is to try and intimidate people from voting either
by direct threats of physical violence now or by threatening dire
consequences after the vote,'' said David Wimhurst, the spokesman
for the United Nations in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   For much of this year the militias have carried out attacks on
villages deemed to be strongly in favor of independence and have
forced as many as 60,000 people to flee their homes _ nearly 15
percent of the 450,000 registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has taken pains to allow these displaced
people to participate in the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   As the vote nears, the violence has escalated along with a quiet
campaign of terror in which people have been kidnapped, threatened
and forced into hiding.
</P>
<P>
   If Habibie was trying to remove an irritant from Indonesia's
public image, his policy seems to have backfired. Both Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and members of Congress have condemned the
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Jimmy Carter _ whose human rights and diplomacy
organization, the Carter Center, is monitoring the referendum here
_ said this month that ``Some top representatives of the government
of Indonesia have failed to fulfill their main obligations with
regard to public order and security.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Indonesian military and other government agencies
are supporting, directing and arming pro-integration militias to
create a climate of fear and violence.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as its past has been violent and harsh, the future of
East Timor is a troubled one, even under the best of scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   Remote and poverty-ridden, with few natural resources other than
coffee plantations, East Timor would have difficulty surviving on
its own, even with promised infusions for foreign aid. Indonesia
currently provides about 90 percent of East Timor's operating
budget.
</P>
<P>
   The territory's human resources are just as thin. During its
years of occupation, Indonesia has imported administrators to run
government agencies, schools, utilities and transport. Virtually
all of these people are expected to depart if East Timor becomes
independent.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent conversation, one pro-independence leader talked
hopefully about the example of Singapore, a tiny resource-poor
island nation that survived and prospered by its wits.
</P>
<P>
   It is an example that only underscores the hardships faced by
East Timor: As many as 80 percent of the people here are
illiterate.

   UNITED NATIONS _ The East Timorese are voting Monday on whether
to sever ties with Indonesia, and if they opt for independence,
where would this brand-new country rank among the U.N.'s 188
members? For those Indonesians who argue that East Timor, occupying
only a half of one of Indonesia's 13,000 islands, is too small to
be viable, the facts may be surprising.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor, with 871,000 people and an area of 7,336 square
miles, is bigger in population and size than the three newest
members of the United Nations. The newcomers, which are expected to
take their seats in the General Assembly this fall, are all Pacific
island nations: Tonga, with a population of about 98,000 and 268
square miles of land; Nauru, with 11,000 people and 8.1 square
miles; and Kiribati, with 82,000 people scattered over 316 square
miles of islands.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, at least three dozen members of the United Nations,
many created in the decades of anti-colonialism that shattered
European empires after World War II, have populations smaller than
East Timor's. Most are island nations in the Caribbean, Pacific or
Indian Ocean, but there are also a few in Central and South
America, including Guyana, Suriname and Belize. Among older
countries, Iceland's population is smaller, as are those of
Liechtenstein and Luxembourg. So is the population of Brunei, with
its collection of oil wells at the edge of Borneo in the South
China Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Many small nations struggle because they do not have oil or
other money-earning natural resources. But there are believed to be
petroleum reserves in the ocean south of East Timor. A decade ago,
Australia and Indonesia agreed to explore the area jointly.
Political pressure on the Australian government could insure that
money earned there in the future flows at least in part to the East
Timorese.
</P>
<P>
   Nauru has thrived on something less often talked about: the
phosphates derived from the dung of sea birds. Other small nations
fight to stay economically solvent on fish. Or foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal, which abandoned East Timor as a colony in 1974, has
offered to finance the nation's budget for five years, and other
countries have also offered aid. Independence will not be instant,
though, even if voters back it resoundingly. Indonesia will wait
for a new parliament and a new president to take office late in the
year before making a final decision.
</P>
<P>
   But other nations must be wondering: If East Timor makes it into
the United Nations, who's next? Other territories with aspirations
to independence _ among them Kashmir, Kosovo and Tibet _ are
watching closely this week as the United Nations, which is
organizing and monitoring the elections, helps East Timor take this
important step.

for Sunday, Aug. 29, moved Saturday.

   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   FOOD-GLOBALISM-REVIEW (Paris) _ The European forces gathering
this summer in protest against what is seen as U.S.-led
globalization have abruptly focused on food. Where it was once the
deployment of U.S. Pershing missiles that caused alarm, it is now
McDonald's, Coca-Cola, genetically modified American corn and
American beef fattened with growth hormones that have Europeans up
in arms. By Roger Cohen. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-SECONDCHANCES-REVIEW (Washington) _ As a golfer, Bill
Clinton is famous for mulligans, or hitting a second ball to
substitute for a previous shot gone awry. The mulligan may be the
perfect metaphor for his presidency. The voters have given the
Comeback Kid more than one mulligan. Clinton was granted a second
chance by the Senate in February after the House impeached him for
his behavior in the Monica Lewinsky matter. And it can be assumed
that Hillary Rodham Clinton has given Clinton a few mulligans too.
By Don Van Natta Jr. (`a' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   GUNS-REVIEW (Washington) _ Statistics show that gun violence is
declining, but highly publicized shootings can prompt people to buy
guns for self-protection, which actually increases the likelihood
that the buyer or a member of his or her family will be shot. More
often the carnage occurs in thousands of small tragedies too
mundane to make national headlines in a country where surveys have
indicated that half the households have at least one gun. By David
Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   LUTHERAN-EPISCOPAL-REVIEW (Undated) _ In recent years, the
prospects for the ecumenical movement among Protestant
denominations had seemed dim. But that view recently changed when
the nation's largest Lutheran denomination approved an agreement
for full communion with the Episcopal Church. Historically, the
U.S. has provided rich soil for a multitude of denominations. But
alongside the divisions, there has long been an impulse toward
unity. By Gustav Niebuhr.
</P>
<P>
   SWISSAIR-REMAINS-REVIEW (Washington) _ Finding and retrieving
the remains of the 229 people who died when a Swissair jet crashed
a year ago off Canada's Atlantic coast may have been the simple
part. The hardest part may have been deciding how to handle 23
coffins filled with remains so small they have not been identified.
Only in the last few weeks have Nova Scotia officials, religious
leaders of several faiths and the people of Halifax agreed on a
solution: a mass burial and funeral rites this week to mark the
anniversary of the Sept. 2 crash. By Matthew L. Wald.
</P>
<P>
   INEPT-LAWS-REVIEW (Washington) _ A look at some of the laws on
the books that have been enacted with the best of intentions but
that turned out to work at cross-purposes with government policy.
They have unintended consequences that outweigh whatever benefits
they may provide. For instance, a tax break called flexible
spending accounts encourages extra medical spending on
non-essentials while the government's goal is to hold down medical
costs. Government flood insurance emboldens people to build and
occupy homes in flood-prone areas, which the government is trying
to discourage. By David E. Rosenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   URBAN-ENVIRON-REVIEW (Albany, N.Y.) _ Minority leaders from
inner-city communities have found themselves in an unlikely
alliance with big business as part of a national campaign to make
it easier for industry to develop pollution-blighted properties,
commonly referred to as brownfields, by easing the costly clean-up
standards that currently exist. This new approach has created
something of a crisis for the environmental movement. By Raymond
Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   GOLD-REVIEW (Undated) _ As the price of gold hits a 20-year low,
diehard gold bugs and others are rushing in to buy the precious
metal as a hedge against the day the bear wakes from his prolonged
hibernation on Wall St. A look at the pros and cons of this idea,
and the background of gold as a precious metal. By Dana Canedy.
</P>
<P>
   FOIE-GRAS-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Smithsonian Institution in
Washington has canceled a celebration of foie gras, a delicacy
produced by the forced feeding of ducks and geese, after a torrent
of complaints from animal rights advocates. A look at some
statements about the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-QUAKE-CORRUPT-REVIEW (Istanbul) _ The earthquake that
killed tens of thousands of people in Turkey was more than a
natural disaster. Many of the victims would have survived if their
homes had been built in accordance with elemental safety standards.
Instead they were built with cheap materials by contractors who had
learned they could make up in corruption what they lacked in skill
and experience. By Steven Kinzer.
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-TIMOR-REVIEW (United Nations) _ If the East Timorese
vote Monday to sever ties with Indonesia and opt for independence,
where would this brand-new country rank among the United Nations'
188 members? Indonesians who argue that East Timor is too small to
be viable may be surprised to learn that there are indeed a number
of tiny countries that have been successful. By Barbara Crossette.

DISLIKE OF GENE-ALTERED FOOD IS PROVING CONTAGIOUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. farmers paid premium prices this spring to sow
many of their fields with genetically engineered corn and soybeans,
but now as the fall harvest nears, more of the international buyers
they depend upon are saying they do not want those crops.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers and food companies in a growing number of countries
are shunning the new crops created by genetic engineers at such
companies as Monsanto, DuPont and Novartis. Foreign consumers say
they do not wish to eat the new foods, like corn that have been
altered to produce their own pesticide, and some companies are
reacting quickly to consumers' desires even though no clear
evidence exists that the crops are unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   This week in Japan, for example, Kirin Brewery Co. announced
that starting in 2001 it would use only corn that has not been
genetically engineered. While bowing to customers' concerns, Kirin
made clear that it did not think the products were unhealthy. A day
later, Kirin's competitor, Sapporo Breweries, announced that it,
too, would revert to traditional corn, which is an ingredient in
some types of beer.
</P>
<P>
   The biotechnology industry plays down the recent decisions of
some food companies, saying they are overreacting to threats that
aren't real. Most consumers, the industry says, do not mind these
new products.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few months ago, opposition to genetically altered foods
was largely confined to Europe, and trade officials in the United
States have been battling the European Union, which has stopped
buying all U.S. corn. But this summer, the Clinton administration's
efforts have grown increasingly urgent, in an attempt to contain
the aversion to these crops that is leaping from continent to
continent.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, which now wants mandatory labeling of gene-altered
products, is the largest importer of U.S. crops, and Mexico, whose
top producer of corn flour for tortillas is avoiding altered grain,
is the second largest importer of U.S. corn.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very significant trade threat,'' said Peter Scher,
who directs the agricultural negotiations for the U.S. Trade
Representative's Office. ``The only thing I can tell farmers is
that we are doing everything we can to sell their products
overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   About a third of U.S. crops, including soybeans and corn, are
exported. This year, U.S. farmers planted an estimated 60 million
acres (the size of the United Kingdom) with genetically engineered
corn and soybean seeds, accounting for nearly half of all soybeans
in the United States and about a third of all corn.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Most farmers still expect that they will find a market for much
of this year's corn and soybean crops, industry officials say. But
they have already been told that seven varieties of gene-altered
corn, representing about 5 percent of the expected harvest, will be
rejected by corn exporters. Most of that will be ground into animal
feed.
</P>
<P>
   Next year's harvest looms as more troublesome, with public
sentiment changing, foreign markets shrinking and the agriculture
industry struggling to adjust.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For the first time this summer, many corn growers are dealing
with costly new issues.
</P>
<P>
   Local grain elevator operators, who buy and store wagonloads of
corn to sell to the exporters, have begun asking farmers to
separate some types of gene-altered corn from ordinary corn to
appease international buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Mitchell, a farmer in Houghton, S.D., has been an
enthusiastic producer of gene-altered corn, and he planted 600
acres this spring, 80 percent of which is a crop altered to produce
a toxin that kills the European corn borer.
</P>
<P>
   He boasts that the new seeds have increased his yield by at
least 15 percent, and he has received assurances from local
elevator operators that he will be able to sell his grain this
year.
</P>
<P>
   But he is paying close attention to the tremors in the
marketplace, especially now that U.S. companies like Gerber and
Heinz baby foods have announced that they will not use genetically
altered corn or soy ingredients. And he is uncertain what he will
do next year when spring planting season arrives. ``I wish we could
get this cleared up,'' he said. ``I certainly can't raise anything
I can't market.''
</P>
<P>
   Such uncertainty only adds to the problems of U.S. farmers, who
point out that this year's crop prices are the lowest in more than
a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is such a hard time for us, and then you compound that
with this uncertainty,'' said Gary Goldberg, the chief executive of
the American Corn Growers Association, a group that has been
opposed to some practices of the biotechnology industry. It
represents 14,000 independent farmers. ``Farmers are going to get
caught in the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials have repeatedly assured
consumers that all of the genetically engineered crops that have
been approved in the United States are safe for people to eat. And,
indeed, there is no compelling scientific evidence that shows the
foods are unsafe. But the crops are so new that there is not enough
evidence to prove the foods' safety to a minority of scientists who
say further studies need to be done.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Glickman, the secretary of agriculture, said that the
consumers' concerns seemed to be spreading like ``an infectious
disease.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This technology,'' he said, ``got a little bit ahead of the
politics.''

   He and federal trade officials have spent the summer pressing
European leaders and agricultural ministers to reconsider what is
essentially the European Union's moratorium on new types of
gene-altered crops. They have threatened some countries with
intercession by the World Trade Organization, arguing that
restrictions on these foods run counter to the current science
supporting their safety.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic engineering is a process in which scientists splice one
organism's genes into another. For example, scientists created the
pesticide-producing corn by inserting a gene from a bacterium.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the corn and soybeans have been altered to either
produce their own pesticides or to be resistant to herbicides. The
first gene-altered seeds were offered to farmers in 1996, and
growers snatched them up, quickly making the new biotechnology into
a multibillion-dollar business for the seed companies.

   The biotechnology companies say that the food companies are
caving in to pressure from environmental advocates who have written
letters saying that consumers do not want these products.

   ``Consumers are turning away from these foods in enormously
smaller numbers than the activists would have you believe,'' said
L. Val Giddings, a vice president for food and agriculture at the
Biotechnology Industry Organization, a trade group of more than 800
companies in Washington.

   Still, farmers and trade officials point to new problems. In
Mexico, which bought $500 million of U.S. corn last year, Grupo
Maseca, the company that is the leading producer of corn flour,
said recently that it would avoid importing genetically modified
grain. The corn flour is made into tortillas, the Mexican staple.
</P>
<P>
   In South Korea, another large importer of U.S. grain,
corn-processing companies said they were considering buying corn
from China instead of the United States because of concerns about
the gene-altered crop.
</P>
<P>
   And, in Japan, the government passed a law requiring food
companies to label products that have been genetically engineered.
(In the United States, federal officials have only recently said
they will consider voluntary labeling.) Preparing for awareness
generated by the labeling in Japan, a subsidiary of Honda Motor Co.
said this week that it would build a plant in the United States and
hire farmers to supply it only with unaltered, conventional
soybeans. The soybeans, which would be exported back to Japan,
would be made into tofu.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, where there has been little uproar over
the foods, the baby food makers Gerber and H.J. Heinz were the
first large food companies to reject the new products. Then Iams,
the pet food company, said it would not buy the seven varieties of
gene-altered corn that have not been approved by European
regulators. Iams' announcement shut down an alternative route that
farmers had for corn that exporters will not accept.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The agricultural industry has begun responding, with exporters
trying to devise new methods to bridge the growing gap between
farmers and consumers. A two-price system _ higher prices for
conventional crops and lower prices for genetically-altered crops _
is clearly developing. For example, this year, Archer Daniels
Midland Co. has been paying some farmers an extra 18 cents for each
bushel of non-altered soybeans.
</P>
<P>
   The American Corn Growers Association, which represents mostly
family farms, told its members last week that they should consider
planting only conventional seeds next spring, unless a host of
questions can be answered, including whether the United States will
be able to export the genetically altered crops.
</P>
<P>
   The National Corn Growers Association, which is about twice as
big as the American Corn Growers Association, and has a financial
partnership with Monsanto and some of the other agricultural
companies, has not followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Keith, the group's senior director for public policy, said
that the association, which is based in St. Louis, was keeping
farmers informed of what types of genetically altered corn could be
the hardest to sell, but had not suggested that they consider
planting only conventional seeds.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The worries about international trade have deepened farmers'
fears of a bleaker economic future.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for most crops are the lowest in 10 years, and farmers
say they are concerned that grain prices are falling even further
now that foreign consumers are turning away from genetically
altered crops. But experts say prices have mostly been affected by
the larger harvests in other countries, which have reduced the
demand for grain from the United States. In addition, the financial
crisis in Asia caused exports to fall last year and prices to drop.
And overproduction of some crops continues to hurt prices.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For now, uncertainty about the next planting season is
bedeviling the nation's farmers. They cannot predict where the next
food backlash will surface and sometimes, even if they do, it is
too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't until May that farmers got word that Europe had not
approved certain kinds of corn,'' Goldberg said. ``By then, the
corn was in the ground.''

ACROSS THE LAND, A GROUP MOUNTS COUNTERATTACKS ON `CREATION
SCIENCE' 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By SANDRA BLAKESLEE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Drawing on the deep resources of ``creation science'' advocacy
groups, American fundamentalists are arming themselves with the
latest books challenging details of Darwinian theory, getting
elected to majority positions on school boards and learning ways to
word curriculums so that creationism and evolution get equal
respect. While they have gotten very good at making a case for
teaching alternative theories, a small group of scientists and
educators stands in their way.
</P>
<P>
   Most of America's children are not being taught that the world
might have come into existence only 10,000 years ago, versus the
nearly 4.5 billion years advocated by scientists, and this is
largely because of the SWAT-like efforts of the National Center for
Science Education.
</P>
<P>
   The center, based in Berkeley, Calif., has four full-time
employees and 4,000 members. Within 24 hours of a call for help,
Eugenie C. Scott, the executive director, jumps into action.
</P>
<P>
   Operating on a ``frayed, shoestring budget,'' the center can
help mount a counterattack on creationism in public schools. The
center supplies concise articles and pamphlets refuting the claims
of creation science, legal advice and summaries of court cases
involving creationism, tips on writing letters to the editors of
local newspapers, advice on how to explain issues to reporters,
phone numbers of national experts on evolution, links to dozens of
organizations that can offer help, and the phone numbers of other
people in their state who are willing to get involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the only group providing this kind of information for
people who need it,'' said Dr. Ronald Numbers, a professor of
medical history and ethics at the University of Wisconsin in
Madison and an expert on the creationist movement.
</P>
<P>
   Since the center was founded in 1981, to provide a grass-roots
response to creationist challenges, it has been active in all 50
states, Scott said. Most fights over creationism vs. evolution
happen at the local level, in small towns in rural states where
populations are fairly homogeneous. ``You don't see it in large
cities where people come from diverse backgrounds,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ken Miller, a professor of biology at Brown University in
Providence, R.I., likened the center to ``a national fire
department.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever the scientific integrity of biology teaching is under
fire or compromised,'' he said, ``the center goes there to provide
support and lend resources to people who are actually fighting the
fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a creationist challenge can be ``nipped in the bud''
with just a few well-chosen maneuvers, Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, last year the school board in Post Falls, Idaho, at
the behest of creationists in the community, wrote a policy
statement that would have allowed creation scientists considerable
latitude in making their views known in public schools. The Center
for Science Education, contacted by a member of the community,
reviewed the statement and discovered that the school district was
opening itself to a violation of the laws of church and state. The
suggestions made by the center kept the school district from
running afoul of those laws, and the school curriculum did not
change.
</P>
<P>
   In other situations, creationists prevail. A year ago a
committee of educators in Kansas began a routine update of the
state's science standards and called on the center for help on what
they knew would be a delicate task. The statewide committee of 27
science teachers, which submitted the new standards to the Kansas
Board of Education, was stunned two weeks ago when the Board
decided to drop evolution from the required state curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   The battle to keep evolution in the classroom is a David vs.
Goliath struggle. The Center for Science Education has an annual
budget of $250,000, collected from members, compared with the $3
million of the Institute of Creation Research in Santee, Calif.,
one of several fundamentalist groups trying to discredit the
teaching of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   But Scott has a powerful slingshot in the form of clergy members
who believe in evolution and scientists who believe in God. When a
local resident steps up before the microphone at a public hearing,
says he a faithful Christian and also believes in evolution, people
are mightily impressed. According to several polls, including one
reported recently in Scientific American, about 40 percent of
scientists believe in God. In local school board battles, members
of the center will find such scientists in the community to
testify.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, for example, is both a scientist and Roman Catholic who
has testified before numerous school boards on behalf of evolution.
``The fact that I'm a practicing Christian takes away their
unspoken fear that everyone in science is either an atheist or
agnostic,'' he said. ``I tell them why I believe evolution doesn't
threaten the faith of young people.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Certainly, the Center for Science nettles advocates of
creationism. Duane Gish, senior vice president of the Institute for
Creation Research, accused the center of intimidation and of
``always threatening to sue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are censors and bookburners,'' he said in a telephone
interview. ``They were organized for the sole purpose of fighting
creationists and to keep any evidence for creation science out of
public schools.'' But, he acknowledged, ``They're effective.''
</P>
<P>
   The face-offs have changed over the years as creationists have
adjusted their tactics. Early in this century, Scott said,
creationists tried to ban the teaching of evolution and lost. In
1987 the U.S. Supreme Court struck down laws giving equal time to
the teaching of creationism alongside evolution. ``Instead of
fighting for equal time, they've decided to teach the evidence
against evolution to balance it out,'' Scott said. ``If nothing
else evolves, creationism does.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, creationists have turned their attention to gaps in
the fossil records and an older argument that life is so intricate
and complex it could not have evolved by chance. Their rubrics are
intelligent-design theory, abrupt-appearance theory and irreducible
complexity theory.
</P>
<P>
   These new challenges against evolution are being made by
conservative Christians at secular universities who are upset over
the secularization of American society, Scott said. They are not
trying to ban evolution so much as to undermine it.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled that teachers could teach secular and
scientific alternatives to evolution, Scott said. So the new
battles in Kansas and elsewhere pit theory against theory _
intelligent design versus Darwin.
</P>
<P>
   John Richard Schrock, director of biology education at Emporia
State University in Kansas and a member of the committee that
worked on the state's science standards, said the center had helped
them be aware of how their choice of wording could open doors for
intelligent-design theorists and other creationists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to remove ambiguity,'' he said. ``They helped us with
our definition of evolution as theory,'' Schrock said. They also
helped change wording in a tolerance statement _ promoting respect
for alternative views _ that would not open the door to teaching
religious creationism in history classes.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the School Board ignored the committee's work and
voted in its own viewpoints, Schrock said. But Scott and her staff
are continuing to fight back. The American Civil Liberties Union
may decide to bring a lawsuit against the Kansas School Board,
Scott said, even as other pressures are put to bear on the state.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one leading software company that is looking to
expand took Topeka off its list. ``That gets peoples' attention,''
she said.

(Los Angeles: episodes per week) The emerging consensus: the movie could be a significant hit for
boys between the ages of 3 and 13, an audience that can be
decidedly powerful. Many of the repeat customers for ``Star Wars:
Episode 1'' were from that demographic.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``There's always one thing that kids have to have and right now
that's Pokemon,'' said Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel
Source forecasting service. ``This film definitely has a lot of
potential and could do $60 million domestically, which would be
great for a dubbed movie. If everything breaks right for it and
it's marketed well, I could see it doing maybe $100 million at the
outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Does all this mean Disney should be worried about ``Pokemon''
cutting into its audience for ``Toy Story 2''? No way, analysts
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because the market is competitive, that doesn't mean both
movies won't do well,'' Slaban said. `` `Toy Story 2' is going to
be phenomenal. People are already educated about it and the toy
industry is going to give it excellent support.''
</P>
<P>
   Prudential Securities analyst Katherine Styponias noted the
overall market for animated movies has grown stronger in recent
years. She pointed out that four animated films -- ``Antz,''
``Rugrats,'' ``A Bug's Life'' and ``Prince of Egypt'' -- upset
conventional wisdom that the market could absorb only one such film
per season. They drew most of their combined domestic gross of
nearly $450 million in the last three months of '98.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think `Pokemon' will affect `Toy Story 2,' ''
Styponias said. ``Last year's crowded schedule showed it's not a
mutually exclusive game. There's definitely room for more than one
during the holiday season.''
</P>
<P>
   For Warner, success with ``Pokemon'' would represent a measure
of redemption after losing out on the movie animation boom with
``The Iron Giant,'' ``The King and I'' and ``Quest for Camelot.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, ``Pokemon'' has not yet generated a massive prerelease
publicity campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the concept is fresh and the awareness is high, there's no
reason to overhype it,'' Bucksbaum said. ``That's why `Star Wars'
was so successful -- they didn't throw it down people's throats.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Garrity, chief financial officer for New York-based
licensor 4 Kids, promised the marketing push for Pokemon goods
still has plenty of gas in the tank. ``The licensing program is
going to be very extensive leading up to the opening of the
movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, aside from seeing their wallets deflated, adults
have little to complain about when it comes to Pokemon. The actual
game calls for players to act as ``Pokemon trainers'' of the
individual characters with rules much like the old
rock-scissors-paper game.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Pokemon represents is very significant, because Japanese
culture revolves around cooperation and common goals,'' Skislock
said. ``It also shows how entertainment product is much more
accessible globally.''
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Princess Mononoke,'' the film is a much more iffy
proposition even though it carries impressive credentials. It won
Japan's Academy Prize for the best film of 1997 and sparked a boom
in that nation's animation business. But success overseas won't
mean much to American audiences.
</P>
<P>
   First off, ``Princess Mononoke'' doesn't offer the feel-good
comedy-and-music that's the hallmark of U.S. animated films;
instead, it's an epic drama. The story, set in 14th century Japan,
revolves around two warring clans and the gods of the forest with
the title character raised by wolves; she wears animal skins and a
necklace of bones with war paint smeared on her face.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, ``Princess Mononoke'' runs 133 minutes, far longer
than any mainstream animated film. Miramax, Disney's specialized
films distributor, has produced a dubbed version with voices from
Billy Crudup, Minnie Driver, Claire Danes, Billy Bob Thornton and
Gillian Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Princess Mononoke' will be more of an art-house film and
only appeal to an older audience,'' Bucksbaum predicted.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, ``Princess Mononoke'' can't be written off
entirely. If ``The Blair Witch Project'' can gross $130 million
domestically, it's not completely far-fetched to conceive of the
novelty of Hayao Miyazaki's animation becoming the Next Hip Thing.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the Miramax factor: The distributor certainly
knows how to turn critically acclaimed movies -- ``The Crying
Game,'' ``Pulp Fiction,'' ``Il Postino'' and ``Life Is Beautiful,''
to name four -- into commercial successes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Globalization and ease of entry of nontraditional product have
started becoming very important in the entertainment business,''
Skislock said. ``There is a huge opportunity in filmed
entertainment today for creative product like `Blair Witch.' The
scepter of power used to be capital; it's going to shift toward
creativity because the product is more accessible globally.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Miramax is taking a low-key approach. ``It could be an
art-house breakout hit, but by no means could we open this at 2,000
theaters nationwide,'' said Mark Gill, president of Miramax's Los
Angeles office. ``It's not as accessible as `Blair Witch.' ''

PREPARE FOR THE POKEMON INVASION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- If you haven't hung around 8-year-old boys
lately, you probably don't know the next wave of globalization has
already arrived in the form of Pikachu, Raichu and 149 other
animated Pokemon characters.
</P>
<P>
   Pokemon -- the Japanese name for ``pocket monster'' -- is
becoming more prominent each day in the United States with a
mind-boggling array of video games, trading cards, clothing and
toys along with its own TV show. And in a reversal of the usual
practice of American hit films going to foreign markets, a
made-in-Japan Pokemon movie will arrive at U.S. multiplexes Nov.
12.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, ``Pokemon'' won't be the first Japanese animated movie
to show up in theaters this fall. ``Princess Mononoke,'' Japan's
second-highest grosser of all time after ``Titanic,'' will open in
the 20 biggest U.S. markets Oct. 29. But it's ``Pokemon'' that has
emerged as a potential sleeper hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pokemon is the only thing kids are talking about these days,''
said Merrill Lynch analyst Andrew Slaban. ``The movie could do very
well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pokemon the Movie: Mewtwo Strikes Back,'' made by Shogakukan
Productions Co., was the fourth-highest grosser in Japan last year.
Warner Bros. has renamed it ``Pokemon: The First Movie'' for its
U.S. release and recently began a low-key ad campaign with trailers
and lobby posters. A sequel for next summer is already in the
works.
</P>
<P>
   More impressively, the studio assigned ``Pokemon'' a valuable
opening date -- one where the target audience of kids 5 to 13 are
still in school but on the verge of having vacation time around
Thanksgiving and the winter holidays. What's especially bold about
Warner's move is that the slot is a mere dozen days before Disney
debuts its expected holiday season blockbuster, ``Toy Story 2.''
</P>
<P>
   But trackers believe the craze over Pokemon -- which mostly
resemble plush-toy versions of cats, hamsters and dogs -- will be
even hotter at that point. ``I suspect that Pokemon has not yet
crested in this country,'' said Martin Brochstein, editor of the
Licensing Letter. ``It's been big, but the real thrust of
merchandise has only started to hit shelves.''
</P>
<P>
   Pokemon is already a certifiable marketing bonanza. As children
return to school this month, rest assured they will be wearing
Pokemon T-shirts and carrying Pokemon trading cards, toys, comic
books and Game Boy videos. Some schools already have barred Pokemon
cards from campuses as being too much of a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as adults may be a little naive about the true extent that
U.S. kids nowadays have gravitated to Japanese culture,'' asserted
entertainment analyst Kevin Skislock of Laguna Research Partners.
``Japanese-sourced entertainment product is a much bigger part of
the lives of kids under 16 than people over 16 realize.''
</P>
<P>
   For those wondering what the fuss is about, here are the facts:
</P>
<P>
   ----The Pokemon craze is 4 years old in Japan and still going
strong. Need proof? Three All Nippon Airways jumbo jets are
decorated with Pokemon characters.
</P>
<P>
   __Nintendo Co., which owns the property, already has sold more
than 4 million Pokemon-based games in this country.
</P>
<P>
   __New York-based 4 Kids Entertainment, the exclusive licensing
agent for Nintendo in countries outside Japan, has signed 90
licensing deals in this country.
</P>
<P>
   __The ``Pokemon'' TV show became the top-rated syndicated
children's program within a few months of its launch; it now is the
highest-rated series for kids on Saturday mornings.
</P>
<P>
   __The WB Network will become the exclusive broadcaster of
``Pokemon'' in U.S. markets with the fall season and plans to
telecast a dozen new episodes per week.

14-YEAR-OLD GIRL IS FOCUS OF DEBATE OVER A LATE-TERM ABORTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DAVID SCHWARTZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ She has been in state care since she was 5 years old,
and is described by the authorities as a frequent runaway from
foster and group homes. Her mother died in January. Her father is
absent.
</P>
<P>
   Now, this 14-year-old ward of the state is at the heart of a
highly charged public debate in Arizona because a local judge has
granted her request for a late-term abortion. The case is being
watched by those on both sides of the abortion issue because of the
girl's age and the controversy over late-term abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona officials confirmed this week that Judge William
Sargeant of Maricopa County Superior Court had ordered state child
welfare workers to send the girl, who is 24 weeks pregnant, out of
state to have the abortion. State law allows late-term abortions,
but doctors in Arizona generally do not perform them past 20 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It remained uncertain Saturday whether the abortion would take
place. The case has unleashed impassioned protests by abortion
opponents and state lawmakers since word of it was leaked to an
anti-abortion group. The Arizona Republic reported on Friday that
Sargeant was reconsidering his decision.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives including Republican presidential candidate Steve
Forbes and Dr. Laura Schlessinger, the syndicated talk show host,
have weighed in to oppose the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very unfortunate situation that's really sad,'' said
Francie Noyes, a spokeswoman for Gov. Jane Dee Hull. ``Nobody is
happy about this, but it's a court order. The girl requested this,
and it's been carefully evaluated by experts close to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Details of the case remain sketchy because of the
confidentiality granted juveniles. Court records are sealed, and
all hearings have been closed.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have disclosed that the girl asked for the abortion
several months ago and then ran away, and that it was not until
recently that she was back in state custody.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's request was granted after the court was told that the
pregnancy was the result of rape and that the mother had since used
``myriad illegal drugs,'' said Maurice Portley, the presiding
juvenile court judge, in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said the girl was again counseled on her options
late this week, and she told them that she still wanted to have an
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a 14-year-old kid,'' Ms. Noyes said. ``Everyone wants
to make sure that we have done everything we can. And we think we
have.''
</P>
<P>
   The abortion would be paid for with federal money, which can be
used in cases where a pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, or
poses a threat to the health of the mother.
</P>
<P>
   But abortion opponents say the state has no business in this
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state should have an interest in fostering life, not in
supporting, sanctioning and otherwise becoming involved in
fostering the death of a child,'' said John Jakubczyk, president of
Arizona Right to Life, the anti-abortion group that was told of the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Jakubczyk said the impact of the abortion would be lasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you destroy a child, that has to be a negative for
the person involved,'' he said. ``You can't even imagine what the
psychological impact will be on her life.''
</P>
<P>
   An official from Planned Parenthood of Central and Northern
Arizona said the case was no different from sending a patient
elsewhere because care was not available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were this heart surgery and the facilities were not there to
treat her, we would not hesitate to take her to another state for
care,'' said Joseph Feldman, the group's education and counseling
director. ``This is the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Providers of abortion said pregnant women regularly were forced
to cross state lines for a variety of reasons to be able to obtain
the procedure.

BUSH CARRIES SOME BAGGAGE IN DEVELOPING CHINA STANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republican presidential front-runner, Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, whose father was accused by candidate Bill
Clinton of ``coddling'' dictators in Beijing, is struggling to
decide how hard a line to take toward China.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of China is a particularly sticky one for the
Republican candidate, who is caught between hawkish conservatives
on one side of his party and pro-business interests on the other.
The shadow of his father, who during his presidency claimed China
as a special area of expertise, compounds the problem.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton accused President Bush of being soft on China in
the 1992 presidential race, today it is the Clinton administration
that is under attack for its policy of ``strategic partnership,''
which critics consider too accommodating, particularly after recent
charges of nuclear espionage by Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   In the current squabble that erupted between China and Taiwan
after Taiwan's leader asserted greater independence, Bush's
advisers accused the Clinton administration of a ``tilt toward
China,'' all but assuring that the issue would be locked into the
current campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But exactly how hard to hit the issue is a matter of some debate
within Bush's circle of advisers, his aides say. Asked on
television recently whether U.S. troops might be required if China
attacked Taiwan, Bush said: ``It could. We need to honor our
commitments in the Far East.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer was not tough enough to satisfy Republicans who
believe that the Clinton administration is too soft on Beijing and
who argue that the administration should make unequivocal
declarations to the Chinese that the United States will respond if
Beijing attacks Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The Weekly Standard, a conservative political magazine edited by
William Kristol, has made this stand clear in several recent
editorials. ``The best way to avert a crisis now is for the United
States to make absolutely clear that it will respond to any
military action by Beijing aimed at intimidating Taiwan,'' said an
editorial signed by Kristol and Robert Kagan, an analyst at the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Bush issued a stronger statement on China. It
appeared to stop short of The Standard's position but went beyond
his television reply. It was critical for Beijing to understand
that if it attacked Taiwan, ``the United States will act in
accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act and join with Taiwan in
insuring Taiwan's defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Taiwan Act is not an alliance between the United States and
Taiwan and does not explicitly call on the United States to defend
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's foreign policy team is headed by Condoleezza Rice, who
was a member of President Bush's National Security Council and is
an expert on Russia. On Asia, Bush has listened to Paul Wolfowitz,
a former ambassador to Indonesia, and Richard L. Armitage, who was
a senior official in the Pentagon during the Bush presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfowitz, Armitage and a third adviser, Richard Perle, were
among 22 signators to a strong policy statement on Taiwan put out
by two conservative research institutes, The Heritage Foundation
and The Project for the New American Century. The statement said
unequivocally that the United States should declare it would come
to Taiwan's defense in the event of an attack or a blockade against
Taiwan, including the islands of Matsu and Kinmen.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's position on China was based on some basic precepts, Ms.
Rice said. ``China is not an enemy and not a partner,'' she said.
There were some areas where cooperation was desirable, such as
China's membership in the World Trade Organization. There were
other areas, such as strategic interests in Asia, where China was a
competitor of the United States, she said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Armitage, who has been to the campaign
headquarters in Austin, Texas, several times to consult, said that
Bush viewed China in the context of America's major alliance in
Asia, Japan, a country the candidate knew ``a lot about.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he had signed a statement calling for the United
States to come to Taiwan's defense in event of an attack, Armitage
suggested it was unfair to expect a presidential candidate to give
a definitive answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the question of the use of force, anyone sitting in the
presidency is going to have to make the decision at the time,'' he
said. ``It's very bad business to answer hypothetical questions on
force when you may be there to do it.'
</P>
<P>
   On the relationship between China and Taiwan, which is currently
embraced by the Clinton administration in the ``one China policy''
to which every administration has adhered since 1979, Armitage said
it is essential that any change in that policy should be with the
full accord of the Taiwanese.

EARTHQUAKE MOVES TURKEY CLOSER TO EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ When seismologists reviewed data from last
week's devastating earthquake in Turkey, they made a remarkable
discovery. The force of the quake appears to have pushed Turkey
about 4 feet closer to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Due to steady pressures beneath Turkish soil, the country had
already been moving westward at a rate of about one-tenth of an
inch per year. The shock of the earthquake produced a sudden
acceleration in that movement.
</P>
<P>
   More significant, though, has been the fact that since the
quake, Turkey and Europe have moved closer not just geologically,
but also politically and psychologically.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every European country has rushed to send relief aid to
Turkey. The most recent was Sweden, which announced on Friday that
it would contribute $4.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union sent $3.8 million in emergency humanitarian
aid last week and has announced that it will allocate another $41.8
million to build housing for survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Private fund raising in Europe has also been remarkably
successful. A two-hour television appeal in Germany raised $7
million, and a similar campaign in the Netherlands produced $13
million.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts are under way to convert this wave of sympathy into a
permanent policy change that could help heal the breach between
Turkey and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac of France has sent a letter to leaders
of the other 14 member states of the European Union urging that the
union take this opportunity to develop a ``new strategy'' for
dealing with Turkey. Responses in may capitals were favorable,
suggesting that the 2-year-old freeze in dialogue between Turkey
and Europe may soon end.
</P>
<P>
   The freeze began after the European Union decided in December
1997 to exclude Turkey from the group of countries negotiating for
European Union membership. Although full membership for Turkey is
still a distant prospect, the tone of statements from both sides
has become much warmer since the quake.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most significant has been the change in the attitude of
Greece, which for years has blocked hundreds of millions of dollars
in European Union funds earmarked for Turkey. Greece offered quick
and generous aid to earthquake victims, and many ordinary Greeks
joined government leaders in suggesting that this might be an ideal
moment for the two historic rivals to move toward friendship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this disaster will mark the start of peaceful
coexistence between our two nations,'' Mayor Dimitris Avramopoulos
of Athens said during a visit to Istanbul this week. ``Chasms
opened by the earthquake can also lead to new roads.''
</P>
<P>
   A visit by the mayor of Greece's biggest city to Turkey's
biggest city would have been all but unthinkable before the
earthquake. It symbolized the sudden warming in ties between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
   There are reports that Greece will make a more substantial
gesture toward Turkey next month, when European Union foreign
ministers meet in Helsinki. Greek leaders are reportedly discussing
either lifting their veto of European Union funds that have been
earmarked for Turkey, or proposing a generous aid package for
reconstruction in the earthquake zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope this tragedy can increase understanding between Turkey
and the EU, and that some of the funds that have been held could be
released,'' Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen of Finland, which holds
the rotating presidency of the European Union, said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Among Turkish leaders who welcomed recent gestures from Greece
was Mesut Yilmaz, who as prime minister in 1997 ordered the freeze
on political dialogue with Europe. He said he hoped the new warmth
between the two countries would quickly be translated into
``general government policy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Turkey and Greece will be neighbors forever,'' Yilmaz said in
a televised interview. ``There are no problems that cannot be
solved, no fields than cannot be shared.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe solutions can be found to the Cyprus problem and the
Aegean problem as long as the two sides don't always try to get the
upper hand,'' he said. ``I see this as an improvement that is not
temporary, but permanent.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even more surprising than the welcome given to Greek
relief workers here was the welcome given to three doctors from
Cyprus. The three had at first hesitated to leave Istanbul, fearing
that as representatives of the pro-Greek government on Cyprus, they
would be reviled and perhaps attacked. But they put aside their
fears, traveled to the earthquake zone, and later said they were
overwhelmed by the kisses and embraces with which Turks greeted
them.
</P>
<P>
   Even Armenia, whose relations with Turkey have been even
frostier than Greece's, extended a hand of friendship after the
earthquake. After some hesitation in both countries, including a
statement by Turkey's right-wing minister of health that Turks
should not accept aid from such a historic enemy, Armenia on Friday
sent a plane load of aid.
</P>
<P>
   Although neither Cyprus nor Armenia are members of the European
Union, they have lobbied hard against Turkish efforts to win
acceptance in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   With the euphoria with which many Turks and Europeans are
greeting news of their reconciliation, there have been some words
of caution. Issues that have divided the two sides for years,
including European complaints about human-rights abuses in Turkey,
have faded from the limelight but still have not been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Tunca Toskay, a minister without portfolio in the Turkish
government, warned that Turkey would not accept aid from Europe if
it is conditioned on changes in Turkish domestic policy. ``We will
break the half-loaves of bread that we have into fourths, and
refuse that kind of aid,'' he asserted.
</P>
<P>
   The next sign of Turkey's new-found friendship with Europe may
come on Thursday, when the Greek soccer team PAOK Salonika will
face the Istanbul team Galatasaray in a hastily arranged match. All
profits are to be donated to an earthquake relief fund.

INDICTMENTS UNVEIL THE DARK SIDE OF A MEXICAN TV COMEDIAN
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ His fans thought of him as the Sunday afternoon
television comic whose vulgar but ruthlessly funny jokes about
their lives helped them while away tedium and laugh away woes.
</P>
<P>
   But according to murder indictments handed down in Mexico City
late Friday, the much-watched comedian, Francisco Stanley
Albaitero, was also a customer and business partner of one of
Mexico's most notorious drug traffickers. And his satire was so
demeaning to those close to him, the police said, that his sidekick
conspired in his murder.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley, who was known as Paco, borrowed heavily from the vast
cash reserves of the drug lord, Luis Ignacio Amezcua Contreras. And
when the star fell behind on his payments, the police said, Amezcua
hired someone to kill him.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans have heard so many stories of corruption in high places
that they shrug off most of them. But they were shaken to learn
that the country's most powerful drug barons had extended their
grip to the world of television entertainment, and that the man
they switched on for lighthearted relief was apparently another
narco-criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Amezcua, along with his brothers Adan and Jesus, is accused in
Mexico and the United States of running an international network
that moved some cocaine but specialized in methamphetamines, an
illegal stimulant. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration calls
the Amezcuas ``top echelon'' traffickers. American authorities
eager to extinguish the relatively new methamphetamines trade have
pressed Mexico to extradite them. Luis Amezcua has been in jail
fighting separate narcotics charges.
</P>
<P>
   The hidden history of Paco Stanley began to emerge on June 7
when the gunman, accompanied by an accomplice, blasted four lethal
rounds into the comedian's face as he waited in his car under a
midday sun outside a popular taco joint in Mexico City. A bystander
who had just finished eating in the restaurant was also killed, and
four people were injured.
</P>
<P>
   The police said that on April 22, Luis Amezcua had summoned a
group of conspirators to his jail cell, where he grumbled, ``He
owes me too much money,'' according to confidential witnesses cited
in the indictments.
</P>
<P>
   Justice officials said that Stanley got to know Amezcua first as
he searched for supplies to maintain his own cocaine addiction, and
then when he became a retail dealer of drugs to friends in
television.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the officials said, Amezcua loaned Stanley about
$65,000 to build a television and music production studio called
``ST Productions.'' The deal gave Stanley investment capital he
lacked while Amezcua laundered some of his huge trove of dirty
cash.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators did not explain why Stanley did not pay back his
dangerous investor.
</P>
<P>
   The indictments charge that Amezcua secured the help of
Stanley's longtime television straight man, Mario Rodriguez
Bezares, called Mayito. The trademark style of the comic pair was
for Stanley to heap abuse on his cowed, long-suffering sidekick,
who always called him ``sir.'' But the police said that not all of
Stanley's derision was a joke to Bezares (the public knows him by
his second last name).
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be hard for him to have more motives to murder
Stanley,'' said Samuel del Villar, the Mexico City attorney
general. ``I can't imagine public treatment more offensive to human
dignity than that which he received from Paco Stanley.''
</P>
<P>
   In sworn testimony, two bodyguards who protected the comic team
recalled Bezares' dark rage after a television program on Feb. 11
that was supposed to celebrate his birthday. Stanley opened the
show with Bezares' toddler son, Alan, in his arms, comparing the
boy's blue eyes to his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, who does this kid look like, you or me?'' Stanley
needled. The unhappy child began to call out ``Papa!'' and Stanley
quickly answered, ``Here I am!''
</P>
<P>
   ``You remember that time you went away on a trip?'' Stanley
asked as the boy wailed. Then he whirled Bezares' wife, Brenda,
around the studio floor in a tight embrace and refused to allow his
straight man to dance with her.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley's death left Bezares positioned to take full control of
the production company that both men owned. The indictments said
that Amezcua agreed to forgive all of the debts the production
company owed his syndicate if the comedian was murdered.
</P>
<P>
   Bezares is accused of setting Stanley up by faking a limp and
using other tactics to stall his comic partner outside the
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Amezcua and Bezares were charged with first-degree murder.
Erasmo Perez Garnica, alias El Cholo, a man with a clean-shaven
head and a long criminal record in the United States who is said to
have pulled the trigger, was also arrested. Others charged and
jailed are Paola Durante Ochoa, an actress who played minor roles
on Stanley's show, the comedian's chauffeur and one bodyguard. All
five have denied the charges.

to charges of hypocrisy, not to mention a substantial bit of
snickering. Some of that's deserved. The man who decried what he
called ``a multicultural, nihilistic hedonism that is inherently
destructive of a healthy society,'' and who blamed liberals for
Woody Allen's affair with his stepdaughter and for Susan Smith's
murder of her two children, can't expect much sympathy when the
chickens come to roost on his own bedpost. However, on the most
specific and damaging charge of hypocrisy _ that Gingrich was
bashing Bill Clinton for immorality even while he himself carried
on with a House employee _ the issue is a little more complicated.
Because even as other Republicans were calling Clinton everything
up to and including rapist, Gingrich largely refrained. The record
of that period instead reveals Gingrich struggling with a deeply

CRISIS DEEPENS IN VENEZUELA AS LEGISLATORS SPURN ACCORD
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ The political and constitutional crisis
here deepened Saturday as an agreement to avoid a confrontation
between Congress and a new constitutional assembly, both of which
claim to have supreme legislative authority, appeared to have
foundered. Legislators vowed to take steps to cripple the rival
constitutional panel.
</P>
<P>
   Stripped of their right to pass laws or even to meet as a result
of a decree the assembly handed down on Wednesday, members of
Congress retaliated by saying they would exercise one of the few
powers left to them and refuse to authorize the funds the
constitutional panel needs to operate.
</P>
<P>
   They also said they would withhold the legal permission
President Hugo Chavez needs to leave Venezuela for state visits
scheduled for next month.
</P>
<P>
   Elected last month, the constitutional assembly is dominated by
supporters of Chavez, a 45-year-old former army paratrooper who in
1992 led an unsuccessful coup attempt. After his release from jail,
Chavez promised to lead a ``peaceful social revolution'' that would
sweep away existing institutions like Congress and the Supreme
Court. He won an overwhelming victory at the polls last December
and took office in February.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Chavez has argued that only a new constitution
will enable him to transform Venezuela. But since beginning its
deliberations early this month, the assembly charged with that duty
has sought to expand its powers, decreeing first a ``judicial
emergency'' that gives it power over the courts and then a
``legislative emergency'' that all but dissolves Congress, in which
opposition parties have a majority.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement brokered by the Roman Catholic Church and announced
Friday afternoon was supposed to diminish tensions by setting up a
commission to discuss the differences between Congress and the
assembly.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday night, members of Congress, which had been in
recess, returned to their building, defying threats by government
security forces that they would be expelled.
</P>
<P>
   The legislators have quickly found an ally in the mayor of
Caracas, Antonio Ledezma. A member of Accion Democratica, one of
the two traditional political parties Chavez describes as corrupt
and useless, Ledezma offered the chambers of the city council, just
around the corner from the Congress building, to the lawmakers and
criticized Chavez for what he called ``usurpation of powers.''
</P>
<P>
   Furious, some Chavez supporters have responded by pressing for a
new, tougher decree that would formally dissolve Congress. Luis
Miquilena, president of the constitutional assembly and the
president's closest political adviser, said it was premature to
talk of such a step, but added, ``At this moment, given the
irrational attitudes, nothing can be ruled out.'' He accused
legislators of acting in bad faith.
</P>
<P>
   Miquilena complained that it was impossible to negotiate with
people who ``make a commitment, sign it and three hours later turn
their back on it.'' He said it might be necessary to ``amplify some
aspects'' of the original decree to avoid what he termed ``a power
vacuum.''
</P>
<P>
   Legislators, however, said that they had never authorized their
leaders to sign an agreement, especially one that, in their view,
offers them so little.
</P>
<P>
   They also threatened to replace the president of the Senate, who
is a Chavez ally, and the speaker of the House, accusing them of
failing to protect the interests of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of parliamentarians do not accept the terms of
the agreement because the constitutional assembly commits itself to
nothing, while we promise we will not hold any sessions,'' said
Mireya Rodriguez, a member of the lower house from the right-center
Project Venezuela party.
</P>
<P>
   This week, in an action likely to increase tensions, the
constitutional panel is expected to expand its powers further by
decreeing a state of ``executive emergency.'' Such a measure would
give an 11-member committee designated by the assembly the
authority to fire the governors of Venezuela's 23 states as well as
mayors like Ledezma.
</P>
<P>
   According to a draft of the proposal, all governors and mayors
would be ordered ``not to take any acts of governance or
administration contrary to the authority of the assembly.'' Those
dismissed by the assembly would be replaced by ``regional governing
councils composed of three or five members who enjoy high prestige
and honor in the community.''
</P>
<P>
   But efforts to solve the worsening crisis without further
confrontation are also under way. Henrique Capriles Radonsky, the
27-year-old speaker of the lower house of Congress, said he would
go to the Supreme Court this week and ask for a formal judgment on
the state of legislative emergency.

CANADA IS LEERY OF A RISE IN REFUGEES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ The image of two tramp steamers
disgorging 254 undocumented Chinese immigrants on beaches here this
summer was enough for a local pharmacist to unleash a tirade about
Canada's ``lax'' immigration law and ``silly excuses'' for refugee
status, ending with a harsh finale: ``We are being treated like
suckers!''
</P>
<P>
   Around the Pacific Rim, historically European societies have
long had a visceral fear of unchecked immigration from China, the
region's population behemoth. In the Russian Far East, the police
often deport Chinese migrants. In Australia, jail terms were
doubled last month for the crime of smuggling humans into the
country. This summer, the United States and Canada have stepped up
patrols in the Western Pacific, seeking to intercept boats filled
with clandestine human cargo.
</P>
<P>
   But what made the Vancouver pharmacist's outburst notable is
that the speaker, Derick Y.J. Cheng, is the owner of a Chinatown
drugstore, chairman of Vancouver's Chinese Cultural Center and a
native of Fujian, the home province of the undocumented immigrants
whose arrival this summer caused such furor.
</P>
<P>
   With ethnic Chinese people accounting for 20 percent of greater
Vancouver's population and Asians accounting for half of this
fall's freshman class at the University of British Columbia, it is
hard to accuse this city of anti-Asian intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   But Cheng's anger, echoed repeatedly this month in letters to
Vancouver's three Chinese daily newspapers and on talk shows on
local Chinese radio and television stations, reflects how attitudes
toward immigration are shifting sharply across Canada, a nation
that probably has the world's most liberal immigration policies.
</P>
<P>
   On a per capita basis, Canada receives more immigrants than any
country in the world. As a result, about one in six Canadians is
foreign born, double the ratio in the United States. Aiming to meet
a target of 225,000 immigrants a year, Canada admits aunts, uncles,
nieces, nephews, fiances, common law spouses, and same-sex
partners. On arrival, landed immigrants immediately are entitled to
the same menu of health, welfare and university benefits as
lifelong Canadian citizens.
</P>
<P>
   But this summer's smuggling boats suddenly exposed a latent fear
among Canadians that, because of their famous generosity and
courteousness, they are becoming a nation of doormats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feed our people first,'' read protest signs held as one
boatload of undocumented Chinese were herded into a navy base near
Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   The local newspaper, The Times Colonist, advised the asylum
seekers: ``Go home. By plane. By boat. Just Go.'' The newspaper
said that 97 percent of 3,362 respondents to its own poll wanted
the clandestine migrants to be deported.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has really gone off the charts,'' said Gary Lunn, a
member of Parliament from the area for the conservative Reform
Party. ``We have had over 1,000 people contacting my office to sign
petitions. The phones have been jammed for weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   This fall, Lunn said, the Reform Party planned to introduce
legislation to tighten Canada's immigration laws. He predicted that
what he termed ``the public outcry'' would be so great that the
governing Liberals would have to vote to restrict immigration.
</P>
<P>
   It is too pat to dismiss the angry mood as limited to the
Anglophile retirees of Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   Two thousand miles to the east, in Toronto, a city that recently
won a U.N. award for its racial tolerance, The Globe and Mail, the
tribune of Canada's liberal establishment, published an editorial
condemning loopholes in the immigration law with the headline,
``The back door's open, come o-o-n in.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of the two boats, one on July 20 and the other on
Aug. 11, drew into sharp focus a larger, but fuzzier illegal
immigration problem. Every year, about 5,000 people flying to
Canada tear up their documents on airplanes, and then apply for
refugee status.
</P>
<P>
   An increasingly popular practice is to apply for refugee status,
and then disappear during the one year review period. That abuse
has increased 20-fold during the 1990s, reaching 4,203 documented
cases last year. Among nationalities, Chinese are the worst abusers
of the system, with 53 percent of claimants vanishing after being
released on refugee status during the first half of this year.
During that time, 95 percent of Chinese claimants in Montreal and
72 percent of Chinese claimants in Vancouver disappeared. Most are
presumed to have sneaked or been smuggled across the border to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 600 under review, only 200 show up, what do you
think happened to the 400?'' Cheng said, citing the estimates for
Chinese refugee claimants in Vancouver last year. ``They join the
American underground economy. It's not fair to the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In light of that, Vancouver immigration officials claimed
victory when only five out of 77 Chinese boat people released
failed to show up Wednesday, one week after their initial release.
While one arm of the government is seeking to deport the
undocumented Chinese, government-paid lawyers try to block them at
every turn.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to get the 53 minors in the group, mostly teen-age
girls, to agree to go home voluntarily, the province's top
child-protection official wrote them letters, saying, ``I have been
told that if you go to the United States, children of both genders
will be forced to work as prostitutes or forced to work in a
factory by the smugglers.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the children denounced the letter as an infringement
on their right to seek refugee status.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Several victories of immigration lawyers across Canada have
become notorious in the debate over who should get to stay in the
country. Critics' favorites include an American woman given refugee
status in Canada because her husband was violent and a convicted
Guatemalan pedophile allowed to return to Canada after his
deportation was ruled illegal.
</P>
<P>
   But the national press repeatedly returns to undocumented
Chinese as the threat. Saturday's National Post, for example,
reported a government estimate that two thirds of student visa
applications received at the Canadian Embassy in Beijing are
fraudulent.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Canada's Pacific province, which has the nation's
second-highest tax rate and 8.6 percent unemployment, economic
factors fuel local anger. Newspapers dwell on the fact that the
two-year cost of housing, feeding, and eventually deporting the
Chinese could easily reach $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   While the general discontent has acquired some racial overtones,
even Victor Y. Wong, a Chinese-Canadian activist here, admits that,
in modern Vancouver, the debate swirls more around class than on
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are working-class peasant farmers,'' Wong, said of the
impoverished immigrants. ``We have well-heeled Hong Kong Chinese,
Canadian-Chinese and Taiwanese Chinese looking down their noses at
them. They feel these people water down the community.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mason Loh, a regular spokesman for Vancouver's 300,000-member
ethnic Chinese community on English- and Chinese-language talk
shows here, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a feeling we are kicking out the business people and
taking in the boat people,'' the Taiwan-born lawyer said. He said
that the number of ethnic Chinese businessmen moving to Canada had
dropped in recent years, partly because Canada has raised the
minimum amount of investment money needed to get a visa. ``The
immigration system is not smart enough,'' he said. ``We are pushing
out the good quality people who can help Canada _ and we are taking
in the freeloaders.''

   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ The fire season arrived early this year,
allowing no time to brace for its spectacular tantrums.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six days, major blazes raged across more than
150,000 acres in seven states, poisoning the air over Northern
California and testing more than 10,000 firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   By the weekend, more than two dozen serious wildfire clusters,
containing hundreds of individual fires, were burning in
California, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the fires tore through Northern California, where
3,000 lightning strikes early last week torched the parched scrub
lands and forests.
</P>
<P>
   Six acres of grass, brush or timber were ablaze for every
available firefighter, officials said, leaving no choice but to let
some fires burn. Yellow-brown plumes of ashy air settled over
hundreds of miles of the northern third of California, causing what
air quality monitors called some of the worst pollution in the
state in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Gov. Gray Davis asked President Clinton to declare a
state of emergency in four northern counties. Many of the biggest
fires had simmered down, the California Department of Forestry and
Fire Protection said, but officials warned that the ordeal was far
from over and could become worse if hot, dry weather persisted.
</P>
<P>
   The fires were blamed for one death. In Butte County, in the
northeastern part of the state, a woman died on Tuesday when she
apparently became confused by the black smoke she was driving
toward and veered her truck into flames.
</P>
<P>
   No other injuries were reported, and the rash of blazes had
torched relatively few structures. But about 40,000 residents in
Butte County, where fires were consuming more than 20,000 acres,
were advised to stay on the alert for possible evacuation, said a
spokeswoman for the Department of Forestry.
</P>
<P>
   Fire departments around the country, from Alaska to Maine, have
brought teams and supplies to control the blazes. But resources
have been stretched so thin that requests for 800 additional
firefighters remained unfulfilled, the forestry department said.
</P>
<P>
   Jolene DeGroot, a department spokeswoman, said officials were
prepared to request additional assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we can always turn to Canada and the military,'' Ms.
DeGroot said, ``if more help is necessary.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In northern Nevada, where fires have been breaking out for
weeks, firefighters stopped the spread of blazes that scorched
1,500 acres near Carson City, the state capital, and successfully
contained other fires near Elko and Winnemucca. They were close to
besting the fires over 30,000 acres about 45 miles west of Reno,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But in California, red flag warnings, the highest level of
alert, remained in effect Saturday for the entire northern part of
the state except for the coastline, said David Rowe, a fire weather
specialist at the National Weather Service here.
</P>
<P>
   Davis declared emergencies in Tehama, Butte, Tuolumne and Shasta
counties on Thursday, when it was clear that firefighters were
outgunned by the blazes, and ordered the California National Guard
to assist. The Guard brought in Blackhawk helicopters and C-130
cargo planes to carry supplies and firefighters into thick dense
forests and mountain land too difficult to reach by truck.
</P>
<P>
   Smoky air from the fires in Butte County drifted as far as
Oakland, 160 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Teresa Lee, a spokeswoman for the Bay Area air quality
management district, said that the air filled with particulates
from the Butte fires had combined with the already smoggy air of
August to create the worst combination of pollution that reached
from the Bay Area to Sacramento that she had seen in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unusual combination,'' Ms. Lee said, because usually
the kind of smoke now hovering in the air is a winter phenomenon,
caused by wood-burning stoves and fireplaces.
</P>
<P>
   In Sacramento, about 65 miles south of the Butte County blazes,
the air combined with temperatures above 90 degrees on Thursday to
make stepping outside a test of endurance. The skyline was obscured
by a menacing fog, hospitals were inundated with calls from asthma
and allergy sufferers and the streets were empty.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, following overnight rains, the air was visibly
cleaner and brighter. But people were still talking about what a
jewelry vendor called ``black Thursday.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm suffering today because of yesterday,'' said the vendor,
who sells Navajo jewelry and crafts in Old Sacramento. ``My
sinuses, my headaches, my allergies _ they're all going now. No one
has to tell anybody here that the fires in the Sierras are bad.''

   Fraud Worries Greet a Vote-Delivery Bill
</P>
<P>
   Voter turnout lags in California, as in most states. But give
the Golden State credit for trying to improve participation.
</P>
<P>
   Registering to vote is easy. Sometimes newspapers distribute the
forms.
</P>
<P>
   Too busy, or lazy, to go to the polls on Election Day?
</P>
<P>
   Send in an absentee ballot, so readily available that many
candidates distribute the forms for requesting one and even offer
to deliver the completed application forms to election officials.
In the process, of course, the candidates usually manage to get in
a campaign pitch.
</P>
<P>
   One of every four Californians now votes by absentee ballot, a
participation rate six times what it was two decades ago when
absentee voting was restricted to voters who were hospitalized or
away on a trip. That already impressive rate would spurt even
higher if a few minor changes were made in state regulations, some
California legislators and get-out-the-vote advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, absentee ballots must be mailed in, or if
sent in at the last minute, must be delivered by a family member.
But what would absentee participation be like if the law were
changed to allow someone other than a family member to make a
last-minute delivery?
</P>
<P>
   That seemed like a good idea to two Assembly members, Kevin
Shelley and Carole Migden, San Francisco Democrats whose districts
include many homebound elderly, many people involved in unmarried
or same-sex relationships and many young people living in group
houses. So earlier this summer, each put in a bill that would
authorize such a change, with the Migden measure being somewhat
more restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   Both measures were passed and forwarded to the Senate. That's no
great surprise because Democrats control the Assembly, and
California Democrats, like Democrats in most states, are always
looking for ways to increase voter participation.
</P>
<P>
   Over on the Senate side, Democrats are also in control. But the
legislative-going there for an election law change could be more
difficult. Since the Assembly voted for change, concern has spread
that if the law is modified to allow absentee ballots to be
delivered to election officials by someone other than a family
member, the door will be opened for widespread voting fraud.
</P>
<P>
   What would happen, wonders Secretary of State Bill Jones, if
candidates not only began organizing efforts to get people to
request absentee ballots but then began pushing to have the ballots
filled out and, at the same time, offered to deliver the marked
forms to election officials?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to keep a fire wall up between campaigns and voters
when it comes to delivery of ballots,'' contended Jones,
California's top election official and also the top elected
Republican in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The Shelley and Migden bills, he warns, would open up loopholes
that candidates might use to slip in and begin controlling the
absentee balloting process.
</P>
<P>
   Shelley and Ms. Migden say they are as opposed as any Republican
to voting fraud. But they argue that ways must nevertheless be
found to increase voter participation, which has never been a
front-burner issue with many Republicans. They reason that the
people least inclined to vote are often the Democratic poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never been a perfect bill to expand voter
participation,'' Shelley said.
</P>
<P>
   Off-Year House Race Intrigues Both Parties
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Rep. George E. Brown Jr., the veteran Democrat who
represented California's 42nd Congressional District, died last
month, Republicans have viewed the Sept. 21 special election that
will choose his successor as an opportunity to strengthen their
slim hold on the House. Democrats have seen the contest as a way to
weaken that hold.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides also think that a win in the 42nd, which lies east of
Los Angeles in the San Bernardino area and is closely divided
between Democrats and Republicans, could help give the victorious
party a jump-start heading into next year's House elections.
</P>
<P>
   But the September contest also seems likely to be important for
another reason. In the wake of last Monday's vote by the California
Legislature to outlaw production and sale of so-called Saturday
night special handguns, gun control has become an issue in the
race, maybe one of the bellwether issues for Election 2000.
</P>
<P>
   One of the leading Democratic contenders for the Brown seat,
state Sen. Joe Baca of Rialto, abstained on that vote, although he
has been an outspoken opponent of gun controls for many years. Only
a few weeks earlier he had voted against passage of a similar
control measure.
</P>
<P>
   Why the shift?
</P>
<P>
   Baca, closely allied with the National Rifle Association, is not
saying. But the other leading Democrat in the race, Marta Macias
Brown, Brown's widow and an advocate of gun controls, says she has
the answer: A poll released last weekend by Emily's List, a liberal
women's group that advocates gun controls, found that voters in the
42nd District favored her over Baca by 2-to-1 when told where both
she and he stood on guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an especially important issue to women in both parties,''
said Bobi Johnson, Mrs. Brown's campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of recent shooting rampages in California,
Colorado and Georgia, it is an issue that now transcends many
others, contends Luis Tolley of Handgun Control Inc., which has
endorsed Mrs. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's now touching ordinary people,'' he said. ``It's moved
beyond violence in the inner cities.''
</P>
<P>
   The leading Republican in the September race, Elia Pirozzi,
Brown's opponent in 1998, is more conservative than Mrs. Brown but
has not yet become embroiled in the gun debate. He ran slightly
better than Baca in the Emily's List poll.
</P>
<P>
   Should none of the 10 candidates in the contest win a clean
majority in the September voting, a runoff between the top finisher
from each party will be held on Nov. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a New Episode of the Fordice Saga
</P>
<P>
   Now for our latest installment of the Fordice saga, in which we
learn that while rekindled love for an old high school flame
brought Kirk, the governor of Mississippi, all of his troubles, it
was not the heat in that love that saw him through the hard times.
It was politics.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier installments, the governor menaced nosy reporters who
pestered him about his spring trip to Paris with the old flame, Ann
Creson of Memphis ... he sloughed off criticism of his subsequent
demand that Pat, his wife of 44 years, decamp the Executive Mansion
in Jackson and grant him a divorce so he could wed Ms. Creson ...
he saw nothing amiss in using the state jet to rendezvous at the
beach with Ms. Creson, and accused those who saw something amiss of
hounding him.
</P>
<P>
   But today we discover that all that was largely bluster.
</P>
<P>
   The governor confesses that though he may have appeared to be
hanging tough back then, on the inside he was so weary and fed up
with all the questioning and carping about matters he considered
private that he came close to resigning rather than be ``tortured''
out of office. The way he began to see things, he now says, he had
less than six months left to serve in his second and final term, so
it would make little difference if he cut out a bit early.
</P>
<P>
   Except for one catch: He is a Republican, while the man who
would fill out his term, Lt. Gov. Ronnie Musgrove, is a Democrat _
and the Democratic Party's big hope to defeat the Republican
candidate, Mike Parker, in next year's governor's race.
</P>
<P>
   If Musgrove were permitted to run the state for a few months as
acting governor, Fordice began to worry, Musgrove just might get
the political lift needed to win. So the governor decided to ride
out the storm, explaining to The Associated Press on Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
   ``If I hadn't been preventing Ronnie Musgrove, who is
archliberal, anti-business and very bad for the state, from being
the incumbent in this race, I'd have been out of here six months
ago. No human being needs the stuff I'm taking. And if he wins,
I've just wasted a bunch of time and taken a lot of misery I didn't
need.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile ... Pat Fordice has still not decamped the Executive
Mansion, the divorce is still pending, and the governor has
concluded that the better part of stonewalling on the plane ride to
the beach is to send the state auditor a personal check for $865.
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Dennis will affect the Southeast Coast in a more
serious way Sunday. The strengthening storm will be near the north
Florida shoreline, allowing its gales and squalls to move onshore.
The persistent flow from the east combined with large swells
generated by the hurricane will produce dangerous surf at the
beaches from Georgia to North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The wind circulation associated with a disturbance at 15,000
feet over Mississippi should continue to draw the hurricane toward
the mainland. Should Dennis accelerate during the next 24 hours, it
could be drawn into the Carolinas by a departing trough of low
pressure over the Northeast. Odds favor the hurricane being left
behind and pursuing an erratic course near the Florida and Georgia
coasts.
</P>
<P>
   Burgeoning high pressure in Manitoba will influence the weather
in the northern third of the nation early this week. A surge of
much cooler, drier air on the east side of the fair weather system
cause pleasant late summer conditions from the Great Lakes to New
England, though a few sprinkles are expected in the northern
Appalachians. The Gulf states and southern Plains will stay mostly
sunny, hot and humid.
</P>
<P>
   Low pressure in the Black Hills will be supplied with moisture
from the south and west. Clusters of thunderstorms will soak parts
of the northwest Plains and eastern Rockies, while afternoon
thundershowers form over the southern Rockies and southeast
California. The hot weather in the Northwest will be pushed inland
by a surge of marine air west of the Cascades.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Easing the Deficit
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, a deluge produced 2.03 inches of rain in
Washington, marking the most rain to fall in one day since August
of 1997. The Wednesday into Thursday rainfall of 3.40 inches was
the greatest two-day total in over 5 years. After a parched spring
and first half of the summer, numerous rainfalls have helped to
ease the drought across the Middle Atlantic States, though long
term water deficits remain quite high. With some computer models
suggesting that moisture from Hurricane Dennis will reach the
region this week, the deficit may be further erased. &QL;

QUARTERBACKS FACE FIRST TEST IN THE KICKOFF CLASSIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ohio State Coach John Cooper said he sees a lot of similarities
between his team and the University of Miami team that the Buckeyes
will play at Giants Stadium Sunday afternoon in the Kickoff
Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both teams have good wide receivers, good tight ends, both
teams have young quarterbacks and both teams can burn you deep,''
Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether those young quarterbacks will be able to
get the ball deep to the receivers.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes' quarterback is Kenny Kelly, a sophomore who
plays baseball in the Tampa Bay Devil Rays' minor-league system.
The Buckeyes' quarterback is Austin Moherman, a sophomore who was
in close competition during training camp with Steve Bellisari.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said he has every confidence in Moherman, who is
replacing the departed Joe Germaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He calls a pass and gets the ball to the best receiver,''
Cooper said of Moherman. ``That's the thing he does best.''
</P>
<P>
   Moherman's two main targets are Reggie Germany, the team's
leading returning receiver, and Ken-yon Rambo, one of the fastest
players on the team. The Buckeyes will welcome single coverage on
either one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they play us in man coverage, we'll see how good they
are,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   With the speedy receiver Santana Moss, the Hurricanes are
looking for the same opportunity to exploit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got four or five great wide receivers, and to see those
guys out there one-on-one with any defensive back is something that
we're real comfortable seeing,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State's defense is hoping to make things uncomfortable for
Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely going to get after him early,'' said Ohio
State linebacker Na'il Diggs. ``We're going to get in his face and
make him think. We need to keep him contained in the pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes' defense will be missing two starting linebackers,
Chris Kirk and Courtland Bullard. Kirk is academically ineligible,
and Bullard was suspended for one game this past Tuesday for
violating a team rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really affects us depth-wise,'' Cooper said. ``It leaves us
with a big void. It was not only losing those guys, but the timing
of it with Bullard. We didn't have a chance to bring anybody else
with us on this trip.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes are looking at this game as the launching pad for
an outstanding season. They are looking to regain the swagger that
they once had when they were routinely in the national championship
picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some teams would shy away from the Kickoff Classic, because it
could hurt your season if you don't play well,'' said the
Hurricanes senior guard Richard Mercier, who wore a black T-shirt
with the team's new motto ``Bigger, Stronger, Faster'' on the back.
``But we look at this season as something that will be good for the
program. We have the opportunity to leave on top and have our own
swagger.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State has high aspirations as well. They have an unrequited
national championship desire that has been stewing since 1968 _ the
last time they won a national title. The Buckeyes fell one game
short of going undefeated and vying for a national championship
last year.
</P>
<P>
   After a 24-14 victory over Texas A&AMP;M in the Sugar Bowl, the
Buckeyes finished the season ranked No. 2 in the nation with an
11-1 record. A late-season loss to Michigan State knocked them out
of the No. 1 spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were disappointed,'' Cooper said. ``We were ranked No. 1
for 10 straight weeks. But disappointment lasts only as long as you
let it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said there has been no carryover to this year, because it
is a fresh season. It may have been one of the reasons why Cooper
decided to play in the Kickoff Classic game. It gives teams an
extra 10 days of practice. The Ohio State players seem to have
embraced that idea. But last season is still fresh in their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were one play away,'' the senior fullback Matt Kelly said.
``It makes you sick. But you have to look at the season we had. We
played in the Sugar Bowl, and we finished No. 2. It's very hard to
go undefeated. It takes some luck. A few teams are able to stick it
out. But we just have to go out there and play the best we can and
see what happens.''

PENTAGON'S COMPUTERS STILL HAVE THEIR GUARD DOWN, STUDY SAYS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
(Eds: No byline cq.) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After years of warnings and efforts to correct the
problem, the Defense Department's computer systems remain
disturbingly open to infiltration, according to a review by the
General Accounting Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serious weaknesses in Department of Defense information
security continue to provide both hackers and hundreds of thousands
of authorized users the opportunity to modify, steal,
inappropriately disclose, and destroy sensitive DOD data,'' said
the report, which was released on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result,'' the report said, ``numerous Defense functions,
including weapons and supercomputer research, logistics, finance,
procurement, personnel management, military health, and payroll,
have already been adversely affected by system attacks or fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert F. Dacey, the director of computer security issues for
the General Accounting Office, said the agency had warned of the
problems several times in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about the security of federal computer systems were
heightened this spring, when hackers broke into the Web sites of
the White House, the FBI and the Senate, posting inappropriate
photos and text and leading the government to shut down the sites
temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department has persistent problems with computer
security, said the accounting office, the investigative arm of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department's Information Systems Agency, which
operates data-processing systems around the country, is the only
unit that has begun a comprehensive security review. In January
1998, the Pentagon announced that it intended to consolidate its
security efforts departmentwide. But the program has still not been
fully developed.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, the department set up a task force to attack part
of the security problem, monitoring computer networks and defending
against hacker attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those efforts, the General Accounting Office found a
number of security flaws. For example, management of passwords on
Defense Department computer systems had improved, but users were
not required to change their passwords often enough, if at all.
Computer users often had easily guessed passwords. And a single
password was sometimes used by a group of people.
</P>
<P>
   The report also found that some personnel had enough programming
and security clearance to change programs or data _ for example,
adding unauthorized paychecks _ and then cover their tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Department officials generally agreed with the findings.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Hansen, a spokeswoman for the Department of Defense, said
the Pentagon was ``working to shore up computer security as fast as
time and resources will allow.'' But the Defense Department has
more computer users than any other organization in the world, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The department has 2.1 million computers, with more than 10,000
networks linking computers both in the Pentagon and around the
world.

SURPLUS PUTS NEW YORK AT CENTER OF A DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Conn.)  (With WELFARE-SURPLUS) 
(js) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ With New York's public-assistance rolls at their
lowest in more than a generation, the state has built up a $762
million surplus in federal welfare money over the last three years,
spurring a fierce debate over how best to spend it.
</P>
<P>
   The administration of Gov. George E. Pataki is determined to set
aside some of the money in a reserve fund to provide a cushion for
the next economic downturn, when the welfare rolls will most likely
grow again. But advocates for the poor say that more money should
be spent on job training, transportation, child care and other
programs that would help make the transition from welfare to work
permanent for recipients.
</P>
<P>
   The surplus is largely the result of widespread changes that the
federal government made to its welfare program in 1996. Under those
changes, the government stopped paying states according to the
number of welfare recipients they have on their rolls. Rather, the
government now gives states an annual allocation based on previous
years when their welfare caseloads were high _ and before a booming
economy and stiffer eligibility requirements pushed hundreds of
thousands off the rolls.
</P>
<P>
   The new welfare law allows states to carry over the unspent
portion of their grant from one year to another. But unlike New
York, other states in the metropolitan region have either spent all
their federal welfare money or say they plan to do so.

   New Jersey, for example, has received $751 million since the new
welfare law was enacted in 1996. By the end of last year, it had
$242 million left in a federal account, or roughly 32 percent of
its total grant. But state officials there say they have plans to
spend the entire reserve on various programs for the poor, such as
expanding child-care for low-income workers.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, state officials have spent all $590 million they
have received since 1996, making the state one of just five that
have used all their federal money. The other four are Illinois,
Nevada, Delaware and Maine.
</P>
<P>
   New York has spent 85 percent of the welfare money it has
received since 1996, but $762 million remained in its federal
account at the end of 1998. New York officials point out that about
$260 million of that reserve has been earmarked for new programs
like an expansion of child-care subsidies for the poor.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Like other states, New York contends that the number of people
on welfare had dropped much faster than it expected, making it
difficult for the state to use all the federal money it was
entitled to. That said, state social service officials point out
that the state continues to make large investments in anti-poverty
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the budget that was recently approved by Pataki and the
Legislature includes a $125 million expansion of a tax credit for
1.1 million low-wage workers. The budget also nearly doubled the
amount that the state spends to subsidize child care for low-income
working parents, to $839 million this year from $460 million last
year.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, officials say, the state has been able to
accomplish two other important goals: providing additional money to
local governments so that they can reduce the amount they spend on
services to the poor and establishing a reserve fund to increase
benefits during an economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a prudent use of the money,'' said John Madden, a
spokesman for the state's Office of Temporary and Disability
Assistance. As it is, he added, ``New York state spends more than
$6 million a day on services for people on public assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   But advocates for the poor say the state is squandering an
opportunity to invest in programs aimed at helping recipients enter
the work force. They say that such investments are particularly
important now that the state and federal governments have set
strict limits on the amount of time people are allowed to receive
cash assistance under the welfare program.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Erickson, the legislative coordinator for the Greater
Upstate Law project, an advocacy group for the poor, was pleased
that the state had made some investments in expanding child care
and tax credits for the poor. But, she says, she is troubled that
the state is using much of its money _ about $1 billion by the
state's estimates _ to help counties reduce the amount they spend
on poverty programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``These funds were intended to help the poor make a solid
transition to employment,'' Ms. Erickson said. ``By investing it in
fiscal relief for local governments, the state is clearly missing
an opportunity to make long-term improvements in the lives of poor
people.''

   Receiving a phone call from Carol Detweiler has been like
winning the lottery for a group of Albanian refugees from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   What she has to offer is something few Americans can fathom: a
free college education in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I joke with my cousin and I say: `Wake up, Wake up. Maybe
we're dreaming,''' said Milot Hajzeraj, 21, who recently learned
that he and his cousin, Mentor Ferataj, 23, had both received full
scholarships to Hartwick College in Oneonta, N.Y., with the help of
Mrs. Detweiler, 53.
</P>
<P>
   The two cousins arrived in New York in late June after an
odyssey that began six months earlier in Pristina, where they were
attending the state university.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, as 4,000 refugees were given shelter at Fort Dix,
N.J., Mrs. Detweiler and her husband, Richard Detweiler, the
president of Hartwick College, were trying to figure out how they
could help. Mrs. Detweiler said she was moved by news reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought of them being thrown out of their homes, their
lives,'' she said. ``And many of them were college students and
they couldn't continue their college.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she knew they could not possibly afford to go to
college in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   She asked her husband if Hartwick, a 1,500-student college
founded in 1797, could accommodate at least two refugees. After he
said it could, she began looking for other schools that could do
the same. Twenty-two small liberal arts colleges across the nation
responded to her call, offering to waive tuition and provide
housing for refugees who qualified. In the meantime, 145 refugees
applied for the program. As of Friday, the Detweilers had found
places for 45.
</P>
<P>
   For its two students, Hartwick will absorb the cost of four
years of tuition. College officials hope to cover additional
expenses by soliciting donations from community organizations and
religious groups. Mrs. Detweiler said the gift amounts to about
$100,000 over four years for each student.
</P>
<P>
   Other colleges will cover the costs with donations and asking
some students to pay for living expenses through work-study
programs. Mrs. Detweiler said some schools intend to help students
apply for federal aid available for refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Other schools that are providing scholarships to refugees
include Chatham College in Pittsburgh; Rockhurst University in
Kansas City, Mo.; George Fox University in Newberg, Ore.; Quincy
University in Quincy, Ill; and Manchester College in Manchester,
Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Greensboro College, a 1,000-student college in Greensboro, N.C.,
which is affiliated with the United Methodist Church, has accepted
six Kosovar refugees. When the college's president, Craven E.
Williams, heard about the Detweilers' project, he responded
immediately, said his spokesman, Mike Clark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our president said, `These students are living history and
we're a college of the church; we can't give money or food or
shelter, but we can give education,''' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Ferataj and Hajzeraj were packing their bags and
preparing to attend the international student orientation at
Hartwick. It will be a far cry from what they left behind. In
Kosovo, they said, Albanian students were not allowed to attend
classes on campus or study in the Albanian language. They took
classes in private homes instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be like night and day,'' said Hajzeraj, who was
studying veterinary science in Kosovo but may concentrate on
computer science at Hartwick. ``When I used to go to school, I
never took a bag with me because if the police would find our
books, they would beat us and say: `Why are you studying in
Albanian? This is a Serbian land.'''
</P>
<P>
   In April, shortly after the NATO airstrikes began, the two men
were rounded up by Serbian paramilitary forces wearing masks and
carrying machine guns and told to leave on the next train to
Macedonia, they said.
</P>
<P>
   They were not allowed to return to their homes in Istog, in
northwest Kosovo, they said, but went directly to Macedonia, where
they joined thousands of other refugees living in tents and under
the open sky.
</P>
<P>
   In June, they were allowed to come to the United States under
the sponsorship of a cousin who lives in the South Bronx. Since
then, they have been learning English, have found jobs and moved
into an apartment in the Pelham Park section of the Bronx. And now
Hartwick is the next stop in their journey.
</P>
<P>
   Even though classes are already under way at some schools, Mrs.
Detweiler said, she was still receiving calls on Friday from
students and colleges interested in participating in her program.
And she is still receiving calls of thanks. ``I've gotten phone
messages where students say, `Thank you, thank you, thank you a
million times,''' Mrs. Detweiler said. ``I save those messages.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferataj, who will continue his studies in economics at Hartwick,
was one of those callers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know you have a lot of opportunities in the United States,
but we never thought it would be like this,'' he said.

TULANE MEDICAL CENTER'S CHIEF WILL LEAD SUNY DOWNSTATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La.)  (js) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John C. LaRosa, the chancellor of the Tulane
University Medical Center, a researcher in cholesterol and heart
disease and a passionate jazz pianist, will become president of the
State University of New York's Health Science Center in Brooklyn on
Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Although hospitals and medical schools have undergone enormous
change in recent years, LaRosa, 58, says he sees a period of
opportunity for the center, also known as SUNY Downstate, which is
``primed to take off.''
</P>
<P>
   As chancellor of Tulane's medical center for five years, he has
tried to improve patient services, broaden the school's research
and raise money. He also presided over the 1996 transfer of
Tulane's hospital and clinic into a joint venture with Columbia/HCA
Healthcare.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a tremendous loss for Tulane,'' said Kenneth E. Thorpe,
who taught at Tulane's Medical Center until he moved this summer to
Emory University as chairman of the department of health policy and
management. ``He's a real visionary in terms of research.''
</P>
<P>
   LaRosa said that some of the same priorities he had for Tulane
should hold for Downstate. He wants to improve patient services and
to raise money but says he has no preconceived notion of whether
the medical center would be better served by some structure other
than the current one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know enough to know how Brooklyn should go,'' he said.
``I have an open mind about that.''
</P>
<P>
   One of four health science centers at SUNY, Downstate is
somewhat larger than the Tulane center. Established in 1860, the
Brooklyn center includes the 15th-largest medical school in the
United States and University Hospital of Brooklyn, with 376 beds.
It also includes a college of nursing, a college of health-related
professions and a school of graduate studies, and is noted for its
research in areas like AIDS, alcoholism and organ transplants. Last
year, an emeritus professor, Dr. Robert F. Furchgott, received a
Nobel Prize.
</P>
<P>
   One of LaRosa's preoccupations is how to improve what he calls
customer service in health care. He says that most academic medical
centers _ and health centers generally _ ``don't do a very good
job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of improvement doesn't cost much in terms of money, but
requires changes in attitude,'' he said. ``Your dentist calls you
the day before an appointment to remind you of your appointment.
Your service station calls a day or two after your car comes out of
service. Imagine if you got that kind of service at a hospital.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He said he had had ``mixed success'' at making improved patient
service a priority at Tulane. ``It's a cultural change,'' he said.
``It doesn't happen by edict.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he also hoped he could generate more support from
Downstate's alumni, former patients and community members by paying
more attention to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a core of alums who have been very supportive,'' he
said. ``But there is a lot of that building that we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   LaRosa, who will be paid $225,000 a year, said that part of the
attraction of the new job, where he succeeds Eugene B. Feigelson,
Downstate's interim president since 1997, was New York and its
cultural life.
</P>
<P>
   Raised in Pittsburgh (he graduated from the University of
Pittsburgh summa cum laude and from its medical school), he did
postgraduate work at the National Institutes of Health and spent 20
years at the George Washington University Medical Center, where he
rose to dean for clinical affairs and then dean for research. His
wife, Judith, is still chairwoman of Tulane's department of
community health sciences in its public health school and director
of the Tulane-Xavier Center of Excellence for Women's Health.
</P>
<P>
   LaRosa said he had been dreaming about taking in some of New
York's cultural offerings when he arrives in Brooklyn. High on his
list are events at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and some opera and
jazz _ and playing jazz piano with local musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like New Orleans,'' he said last week. ``But I really miss
the cultural vitality of the Northeast.''

 &HT;    New TV season may be best debut in years
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm looking forward to the new fall TV season.
</P>
<P>
   There, I said it. I feel much better now.
</P>
<P>
   There are 36 new network programs coming your way in the next
few months. Of those, I'd say a good dozen actually forced me to
sit up and pay attention. Even such syndicated shows as ``Richard
Simmons' Dream Maker;'' the Indiana Jones-like ``Relic Hunter'' and
a new ``Family Feud .''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last year's dismal crop (''Encore! Encore!,''
``Costello,'' ``The Brian Benben Show''), this season, which
officially begins the week of Sept. 20, is brimming with potential
and good buzz. ``Once and Again,'' ABC's tender new adult drama
from the thirty(ITAL)something(END ITAL) producers, is the year's
best new show. The key word is (ITAL)adult.(END ITAL) We don't see
many new adult shows on TV. It's obvious the TV suits have bought
into the ``Logan's Run'' theory: Once you hit 30, you die. All
Madison Avenue really cares about are young, money-dropping kids
wearing J.Crew threads. That's why you'll see more teen-skewing
shows than ever before this fall.
</P>
<P>
   TV needs a banner season more than it ever has. Just look at
what's been happening the last few years. More and more, viewers
are defecting to cable, where the shows are often edgier and
better. It's no accident that The Sopranos, HBO's mob drama, nabbed
16 Emmy nominations. Such shows as ``Behind the Music,'' ``Sex and
the City,'' ``Oz,'' ``La Femme Nikita'' and ``Any Day Now'' have
made cable hip and happening. Network TV often looks like the geeky
loner by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Cable continues to influence how the broadcast networks do
business. Take Fox, for example, ``Action,'' an envelope-shoving
spoof about an arrogant movie producer (Jay Mohr), was developed
for HBO. And it still (ITAL)feels(END ITAL) like an HBO show.
Mohr's character uses salty language only a hardcore sailor would
love (all obscenities are bleeped) and he has a hooker as an
assistant. And the network's upcoming oddball comedy, ``Malcolm in
the Middle,'' could easily air on Showtime. After all, how many
times on network TV do you see a naked dad getting his thighs
shaved by his wife in front of his breakfast-eating kids?
</P>
<P>
   Networks are also less skittish about putting more gay
characters on TV. Remember when Ellen DeGeneres' character came out
a few years ago? It generated more controversy than Bill and
Monica. Now gay characters are becoming as common as the wacky next
door neighbor. Such new ABC shows as ``Then Came You,'' ``Oh Grow
Up'' and ``Wasteland'' feature prominent gay characters.
</P>
<P>
   While network executives acknowledge shows need to get edgier to
keep pace with cable, they admit they can only go so far. ``HBO's
job is different than my job,'' says Les Moonves, CBS' president
and CEO. ``HBO's purpose is to get subscribers. When we put on a
program on CBS, we have to get viewers. We don't have to get people
to put down $29.95 a month. We have to be a little bit more broad
than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Not UPN. The identity-challenged network may have finally found
a niche: young males. Its wrestling show, ``WWF Smackdown!,'' is
the network's cornerstone to helping pump up sagging ratings.
Wisely, UPN choose to launch its new fall shows in August before
the competition heats up in September. Last year, UPN's shows
debuted in October and no one cared.
</P>
<P>
   TV does care about one thing: copying success. ``Providence,''
the NBC drama about a female doctor moving back home, was a
surprise midseason hit. That means we'll see more shows boasting
strong female characters. Enter CBS' ``Judging Amy'' about a judge
(''NYPD Blue'''s Amy Brenneman) who moves back in with her mom, and
``Family Law,'' which stars Kathleen Quinlan as a marital attorney
with marital woes.
</P>
<P>
   TV will be no laughing matter this season. Twenty-two new dramas
will be launched. That probably can be directly traced to the
success of such shows as ``The Practice,'' ``Felicity'' and
``Providence.''
</P>
<P>
   Like cable, broadcast TV is becoming more niche oriented. And
that's not a good thing. The networks used to be broadcasters. Now
they're narrowcasters, concerned only with a thin demographic.
Quick, think of a network. You can automatically attach an audience
demo to it. CBS: old; NBC: white, upscale; WB: young, hip; Fox:
young, hip; UPN: young males.
</P>
<P>
   You don't see any people of color, do you? Out of the 36 new
shows on the six networks, only two _ ``Grown Ups'' and ``The
Parkers'' _ feature a minority lead. And both of those are on UPN,
which means their chances of becoming hit shows lies somewhere
between slim and never. Forget about Latinos, Asians and American
Indians. You see more aliens on TV than you see of those ethnic
groups. Of course, the problem isn't a new one. But the NAACP
brought more attention to TV's abysmal track record after publicly
blasting ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox. The organization also threatened to
boycott and sue the networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never been a particularly great year for minorities on
TV,'' laments ``Moesha'' creator Ralph Farquhar. ``But when you
have four, five of the seven networks making a complete about-face,
it becomes ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's happening now is simply insulting. Just about every
producer is scrambling to add minority characters to their shows.
``Sabrina, The Teenage Witch,'' for instance, added a hunky Latino
guy who'll play Harvey's best friend. The writers also added a
black female witch whom Sabrina will mentor. ``Wasteland'' tapped
Jeffrey D. Sams (''Cupid'') to play an assistant D.A. who might
have an interracial relationship with his assistant, played by the
yummy Rebecca Gayheart.
</P>
<P>
   At the recent Television Critics Association press tour in
Pasadena, it was almost comical watching the networks rushing out
token minority producers as if to say, ``See, we're doing the right
thing!'' Yvette Lee Bowser was one. The ``Living Single'' creator
is developing a drama pilot for the WB. You could tell she was
delighted with her deal when she made this ill-informed comment:
</P>
<P>
   ``The WB is the network I believe is the most enthusiastic about
showcasing actors of multicultural backgrounds in a dramatic
form.''
</P>
<P>
   Really? Bowser was asked which WB dramas she was talking about.
The last time I checked, there are (ITAL)no(END ITAL) WB dramas
boasting black leads.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm not saying they've done well in the past, I'm saying
that I have a strong belief that they (ITAL)will(END ITAL) do
well,'' she clarified.
</P>
<P>
   Why do networks continue to whitewash TV? The answer isn't as
obvious as you think.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood is not racist. Well, it can be. But that's not the
primary reason why there are so few minority shows. Warped
Hollywood works like this: If the awful Homeboys In Outer Space
became a top 10 hit, we would have seen a slew of clone shows
featuring blacks in space. The industry wants to make money. It's
that simple. Upscale white shows sell on Madison Avenue.
Minority-themed shows don't sell as well.
</P>
<P>
   Green is the main color in Tinseltown, not white.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racism isn't an issue,'' notes Steven Bochco, who created
``City of Angels,'' a black medical drama scheduled to air on CBS
in January. ``Economics is the issue. When things that you try
don't succeed, there's a reluctance to try them again. When they do
succeed, you try them over and over again. That said, if I'm a
black artist in this community, I don't give a s--- what the reason
is. The reality is, I don't have a job.''

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: ONE SERB'S STRUGGLE TO AWAKEN HER COUNTRY

<P>
   The killings in Kosovo of Serbs who stayed after the war _ many
of them elderly _ has made it even harder for their countrymen to
confront the far more widespread killings and other crimes that
Serbs committed against Kosovo's Albanians. Even the opposition to
Slobodan Milosevic has shown little interest in acknowledging these
atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   Natasa Kandic is a lonely exception. Ms. Kandic, 51, is the
director of Belgrade's Humanitarian Law Center. She is now
documenting abuses against Serbs in Kosovo. But during the NATO
bombing, she made several trips into Kosovo, driving to various
towns and cities at great personal peril to take testimony from
victims and try to protect her Albanian associates there.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the independent Belgrade daily Danas published a
long, detailed and horrifying interview with her about the bodies
she saw and the gruesome stories of extortion and mass murder she
heard. A few other small publications have also interviewed her.
During the war she tried to interest Serbian journalists in her
reports, but the censorship was too tight and the climate too
hysterical. She published them in Western Europe. That Serbs can
read her information now, even in small-circulation publications,
is positive.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Kandic's account, and that of a Serbian Orthodox priest
from a monastery in Kosovo that had shielded Albanians, make up the
bulk of, if not the only, in-depth accounts of atrocities against
Kosovar Albanians to appear in Serbian media. This is in part
because it is dangerous for Serb journalists to go there. The
response, according to Ms. Kandic, has been disbelief and lack of
interest, even among her fellow activists. Her struggle shows the
distance Serbs must yet travel in coming to terms with their
nation's crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kandic's outspokenness requires more than physical courage.
Her criticism of Serb atrocities isolates her even from the
democracy activists who are her closest friends and colleagues.
``My son even accused me of protecting everyone except Serbs,'' she
told me in a phone call, although she said she later overheard him
defending her concern for the weak.
</P>
<P>
   She does, in fact, fight for Serb victims. In mid-July she made
another dangerous trip to Kosovo, this time taking testimony from
Serbs and arguing with local Kosovo Liberation Army commanders
about the abuses.
</P>
<P>
   In Serbia today, if you listen hard you can hear mention of what
Serbs did in Kosovo. Significantly, the Orthodox Church, which has
called for Milosevic's resignation, has criticized ``crimes
committed in our name.'' The opposition's political rallies center
on the impoverishment Milosevic has brought to Serbia, and the most
popular opposition leader, Vuk Draskovic, has been just as
nationalist as Milosevic. But some speakers at the rallies of the
Alliance for Change, an opposition group, do allude to what
happened to Albanians. The independent newspapers have printed some
statements from international prosecutors and reprinted a few
articles from European papers about the atrocities being uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   But these mentions are brief and bloodless next to the in-depth
reports in the press about the mistreatment that Serbs in Kosovo
are suffering today. However, the stories of Serb victimization,
while important, give an incomplete view of the war.
</P>
<P>
   No one in public life, Ms. Kandic said, contacted her after her
interviews for more information. Many of her friends, she said,
merely told her that they had not believed it, and left it at that.
``These are normal, human feelings,'' she said. ``They are all
occupied by their own situation. They say, `My house is here in
Belgrade.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kandic has studied how other societies dealt with past
crimes. ``Germans faced it because they were forced to,'' she said.
The Allied occupation of West Germany was certainly a factor, but
so was the Nuremberg tribunal, which revealed the horrors of
Auschwitz _ but allowed most Germans to lay blame exclusively on
the Nazi leaders in the dock. While isolated voices in West Germany
wrestled with war guilt in the 1940s and '50s, it was not until a
new generation came of age in the rebellious '60s that West German
society really examined, and expressed its revulsion for, what it
had done.
</P>
<P>
   The task in Serbia may be even harder. There will be no Western
occupation. More important, Serbians, unlike Germans, are oppressed
by a strong victimization mentality. Serbs have genuinely suffered
throughout their history _ most recently in World War II _ and
their fears are fanned by unscrupulous leaders to mobilize Serbs to
lash out at others.
</P>
<P>
   It would help, Ms. Kandic said, if some of the army reservists
who witnessed crimes in Kosovo would come forward. She would also
like more contact between the outside world and Serbians. ``We see
our situation only from the local perspective,'' she said. ``People
think that society will change with new elections. We've had
elections before. No one understands that our problem is not a new
election, but facing our realities.''  &QL;

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, August 29,
1999:
</P>
<P>
   A federal district court in Ohio last Tuesday issued an
injunction blocking a Cleveland voucher program that gave
low-income families up to $2,250 per child in public money to pay
for tuition at private and parochial schools. To minimize turmoil,
on Friday Judge Solomon Oliver Jr. allowed students who
participated in the program last year to receive the vouchers for
one more semester or until a final judgment in the case is issued.
But no new children will be allowed into the program. The
injunction is the most recent in a spate of litigation on the
constitutionality of using taxpayer-financed vouchers for parochial
schools. The legal confusion surrounding these important cases
should compel the Supreme Court to resolve this national
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver, in issuing the injunction, said it is likely that the
Cleveland program violates the constitutional mandate of separation
of church and state. He noted that the schools participating in the
Cleveland program, which provides vouchers to about 4,000 students,
were overwhelmingly religious, some with pervasive religious
missions. The judge found that the program has the primary effect
of advancing religion. The ruling is of broad national interest
because many cities, including New York, are debating similar
voucher proposals that will face the same constitutional challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the Supreme Court turned down an opportunity last
year to clarify the constitutional question in a case in Milwaukee.
The Milwaukee voucher program, which also finances students in
religious schools, was upheld by the Wisconsin Supreme Court. The
court's refusal to review that case means that parochial schools in
Milwaukee continue to benefit from public tuition vouchers. By
contrast, a federal appeals court ruled in May that Maine families
are not entitled to public subsidies for religious school tuition.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Supreme Court reasserts itself in this arena,
conflicting rulings among various courts will continue. The law has
grown more complicated as the Supreme Court, in recent decades, has
allowed limited types of public aid to religious educational
institutions. But the court has never overruled its 1973 decision
that a New York program giving tuition reimbursement grants to
low-income parochial school students violates the establishment
clause of the First Amendment. The Cleveland program in effect is
practically indistinguishable from the banned New York scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver's injunction properly relied on that 1973 decision. The
Supreme Court should reaffirm its earlier ruling and declare
voucher plans supporting religious education unconstitutional.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, Aug. 29:
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell loves to invoke the First Amendment to
justify the way politicians squeeze money from special interests.
He and other Republican fund-raisers defend campaign contributions
from businesses, unions and rich people as free speech. As it turns
out, where they see free speech, others _ including some donors _
see extortion. A group of business leaders is now lobbying Congress
to stop the shakedowns and approve campaign finance reform
legislation banning ``soft money'' donations to the parties. Some
even suggest that business donors just say no. McConnell is trying
to get these executives to shut up. Evidently, for him, free speech
has its limits.
</P>
<P>
   A bill to ban soft money comes before Congress this fall. Most
House members and senators favor the bill, but Speaker Dennis
Hastert and Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, plan various
means to intimidate the rank and file or gut the legislation if it
cannot be blocked. That is why it is encouraging to see business
and academic leaders step forward. The Committee for Economic
Development, led by Edward Kangas, chairman of Deloitte Touche
Tohmatsu, and George Rupp, president of Columbia University, has
enlisted scores of business executives to support various reforms,
including the soft-money ban. Among those demanding change are
current or retired executives at General Electric, the Sara Lee
Corp., the Pennsylvania Power and Light Co. and many other
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   These businessmen have already drawn blood, as demonstrated by
the wounded and threatening tone of a letter from McConnell
demanding that various businesses resign from the committee.
McConnell accused some of the committee leaders of trying to
``eviscerate private sector participation in politics'' by imposing
``anti-business speech controls.'' He also warned that banning
corporate contributions would ``render the Republican Party
powerless to defend pro-business candidates from negative TV
attacks by labor unions, trial lawyers and radical
environmentalists.'' The inference drawn by some donors is that if
they do not behave, Republicans will not fight for their interests.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that campaign reform is some sort of plot against
Republicans is absurd. The soft-money ban has won support from
former Presidents Gerald Ford and George Bush, as well as from Bob
Dole and Howard Baker. But McConnell's letter, which one recipient
characterized as ``thuggish,'' at least clarifies what this fight
is about. The Committee for Economic Development put it well when
it replied to McConnell that ``we find it ironic that you are such
a fervent defender of First Amendment freedoms but seem intent to
stifle our efforts to express publicly our concerns about a
campaign finance system that many feel is out of control.''
Businesses are not demanding radical reform. They want a system in
which the quality of the candidates and their positions, not their
fund-raising skills, determines outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   The House plans to act in September on campaign reform
legislation sponsored by Reps. Christopher Shays of Connecticut and
Martin Meehan of Massachusetts. The Senate plans to act on its
version a month later. With public disgust rising, members of
Congress must remember why they were elected in the first place,
which was to pay heed to the voters, not to the clanging of
campaign cash machines and the intimidating tactics of McConnell.
As the Committee for Economic Development points out, campaign
reform will not eliminate donations. The goal is to place
reasonable curbs on a system that is now ``out of control.''

TOWNS COLUMN: HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL FAME REQUIRES SUMMER
SACRIFICES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)  (js) 
 By IVER PETERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIRFIELD, Conn. _ It is still summer, after all. The stores may
be advertising back-to-school specials, but they've been doing that
since June, practically, so that doesn't prove anything. Deep in
bed and denial, most teen-agers are still sleeping late and
pretending that September is weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   But not Bernard Thompson and Roy Gless and Andy Dwyer and the
rest of the Notre Dame Catholic High School football team. While
their friends are still hitting the beach, they and thousands of
other high school students are back on practice fields, hitting
each other and running through plays in the ancient tradition that
says the first ones back to school each year are the football
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody said something about the rites of spring, but to me,
this is the rites of summer,'' said Jeffrey Bevino, Notre Dame's
new football coach and athletic director. ``It's easy to remember
why these guys show up to play during the season: It's for Friday
night lights, to get all that glory and attention. But to get
there, they still have to show up early for camp, and they're still
doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   This has been a season of worry about teen-agers, especially
about boys. School shootings, postures of alienation and violent
music and video games seem to belong to a youth culture that stands
deliberately at odds with parental dreams and ambitions, and
certainly the violence and swagger of football players have
attracted some of that glare. But not to the people who see it up
close, people like the Rev. Bill Sangiovanni, the principal of
Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things we have been seeing on the news, capped off by
Littleton, have brought a kind of fear about kids into people's
minds,'' he said. ``I wish they could see some of our football
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Thompson, a senior and one of the team captains, worked
at a camp for city youths this summer and quit only to put in one
more season as a linebacker for the Lancers. Ask him what he's
doing suited up on a hot afternoon for the second practice session
of the day, and he will talk of the simplest and most complicated
emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play it because I love it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Gless, another senior, hinted at the work-today,
reward-tomorrow connection that generations of parents have tried
to drum into their children's heads. ``I think it teaches you
things,'' he said. ``Like, it's a lot of work, but it's worth it on
Friday or Saturday when you're in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The sacrifices that boys make to play football are not all about
selflessness and motivation, of course, nor are they as universal
as they once might have been.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame used to get as many as 70 boys to show up for summer
camp, Bevino said, and this year there are between 30 and 40 _ the
number is still shaky because who knows how many will stick?
Players will show up one day and disappear the next, without saying
a word, without even properly returning equipment. Not like when he
was coming up, sigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids have a lot of options that we didn't use to have,''
the coach said. ``Their parents are hiring special trainers who
tell them to focus on one sport _ nothing but basketball, or
nothing but baseball. Whatever happened to the three-letter man?
The football-basketball-baseball guy, bing bing bing. He used to
define the high school athlete, but you don't see him that much
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   And, to be truthful, not every recruit who pulls on a helmet and
shoulder pads is there 100 percent voluntarily. Sometimes fathers,
thinking of college applications and manhood memories, are more
interested in their sons' football careers than the sons are
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was forced to play,'' Bruce Gay, a sophomore from Stratford,
said in a kind of grumpy teen-age shorthand. ``My Dad. I wanted my
summer to last, then I had to come here.'' He doesn't care that a
handful of other sophomores are chuckling at his griping, or notice
that while they tend to exaggerate their height and weight, when
asked, he minimizes his. A good 130-pounder if he's an ounce, he
insists that he can't top 115.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like my summer ended a week ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, sometimes the dads have to push them a little, Bevino
agreed. ``Sometimes they need a little help getting going.'' And
with a 6-4 season last year, 5-6 the year before, Notre Dame is not
the powerhouse its university namesake is. But nobody brings that
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not thinking about winning or losing right now,'' said
Mike Romano, a sophomore. ``I just love football.''

 &HT;    DENNIS SPINS TOWARD SOUTHEAST COAST
 &HT;    Editors Note: This story requires updates in the second graf as
indicated below. The National Hurricane center will be issuing
advisories that should move on all available wires shortly after 5
PM. 8 PM. and 11 PM. Saturday.

<P>
   COCOA BEACH, Fla. - A strengthening Hurricane Dennis spun toward
the Southeastern coast Saturday with growing winds and falling
pressures, sending coastal residents from Florida to the Carolinas
scrambling to prepare for a landfall that experts still sought to
predict.
</P>
<P>
   (insert material required here)
</P>
<P>
   At xx p.m., the storm was located about xxx miles southeast of
Cape Canaveral with sustained winds of xxx miles an hour. Dennis
was moving northwest at xx miles an hour. Forecasters expected the
storm to continue on its northwesterly track, which make it a
threat to the coasts of North or South Carolina, perhaps by
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   (end inserts)
</P>
<P>
   Dennis was expected to grow into a Category 3 storm by the time
it makes landfall, with winds of 111 miles an hour or greater,
meaning it would be capable of major damage.
</P>
<P>
   But the predictions were complicated by the storm's slow
movement, coupled with uncertainty over the impact of weak upper
level weather systems that could still help kick the hurricane out
to sea.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the National Hurricane Center worried that Dennis
might stall again as it had done on Friday, giving it the chance to
grow even stronger while making its track even less predictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fear of a stall is that it makes the storm surge much
larger because it sits there and pushes water up onto the coast for
a long period of time,'' Jerry Jarrell, the center's director, told
the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane watches were posted along 200 miles of Florida's coast
from Sebastian Inlet north to the Georgia state line. But it
appeared Dennis would brush past Florida, narrowly missing its long
coastline on its way to landfall somewhere further north.
</P>
<P>
   Winds along Central Florida beaches gusted to 40 miles an hour
Saturday afternoon as Dennis' outer bands swept near.
Six-to-ten-foot waves pounded the beaches, eroding sand dunes and
keeping all but adventurous surfers out of the water.
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday, Dennis had already done some damage in the Bahamas,
toppling trees and pounding beaches on the islands of Great Abaco
and Grand Bahama, as well as several smaller keys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seas were very bad,'' said Martin Havill(cq), manager of
the Bluff House Beach Hotel on Green Turtle Cay just off Great
Abaco. ``But it really was not a problem. We had a couple of roofs
with some shingles off, a lot of trees down and our pool is full of
leaves. But we had everybody up for breakfast.''
</P>
<P>
   Early reports indicated some damage to buildings in Marsh
Harbour, Great Abaco's largest town, where two buildings under
construction had collapsed walls. But there were no early reports
of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis packed sustained winds of about 80 miles an hour when it
roared over Great Abaco, with some reports of gusts as high as 115
miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   After clearing the islands early Saturday, the storm began to
strengthen, with pressures falling and winds jumping to 100 miles
an hour. Forecasters worried that the storm would continue building
as it moved across the warm Gulf Stream waters off the Florida
coast.
</P>
<P>
   Florida coastal residents were not ordered to evacuate, although
emergency officials kept a close eye on the storm. Along Central
Florida's beaches, dozens of sightseers drove to overlooks to watch
the powerful waves kicked up by Dennis.
</P>
<P>
   Surfers were out by the hundreds, some paddling out before the
sun came up Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at the pier this morning at 6 a.m. and there were
hundreds of kids scrambling around,'' said Doug Monda, 30, a Cocoa
Beach surfer. ``This is big surf for Florida, so everybody's
excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Up the coast in coastal towns of Georgia and Charleston, S.C.,
residents and officials nervously watched the storm's progress,
mindful of powerful Hurricane Hugo, which lashed South Carolina in
1989, doing extensive damage.

   BBO-STADIUMS _ One by one in the 1960s or 1970s, their sacred
walls were rocked by wrecking balls instead of baseballs. Crosley,
Ebbets and Forbes fields. The Polo Grounds, Sportsman's Park and
the rest. They were replaced by multi-purpose flying-saucer
stadiums or domed facilities. Now, the trend is for new-old
ballparks that resemble their distant forefathers _ minus the bad
sight lines, sparse restrooms and lack of luxury boxes. Of
baseball's six oldest major-league ballparks, three will be gone
after this year: Tiger Stadium in Detroit, Milwaukee County Stadium
and San Francisco's 3Com Park, formerly known as Candlestick. In
Boston, Fenway Park is fading fast, and although New York's Yankee
Stadium and Chicago's Wrigley Field are safe now, both could vanish
in a flash. (Moore, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   BBO-STADIUMS-CANDLESTICK _ SAN FRANCISCO _ Mark Twain died
nearly five decades before the Giants moved from New York to San
Francisco. To paraphrase the noted humorist, however, the coldest
winter that anybody could spend would be to attend a baseball game
at Candlestick Point. No ballpark in the majors is more affected by
Mother Nature than Candlestick _ or 3Com, as it's been known since
1995 _ where games often are played in swirling winds, brutal
temperatures, blinding fog or all three. (Moore, Atlanta

   BBO-STADIUMS-COUNTY _ MILWAUKEE _ It doesn't have Wrigley's ivy
or the legendary right-field porch of Tiger Stadium. A Green
Monster? The most striking thing involving that color inside County
Stadium was the Packers, but they eventually left to play all of
their games in Green Bay. Imagine an often chilly and an eternally
gray building in the middle of a parking lot. It's either one of
the city's abandoned breweries or County Stadium. (Moore, Atlanta

   BBO-STADIUMS-FENWAY _ BOSTON _ One of baseball's myths is that
everybody loves Fenway Park. Many do, of course. In fact, most who
know the difference between Carl Yastrzemski and a bowl of clam
chowder tend to view this quaint home of the Red Sox as perfection
on earth. But more than a few New Englanders say it's time to rid
their historic landscape of a relic that is cramped and rickety.
(Moore, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   BBO-STADIUMS-TIGER _ DETROIT _ With apologies to Fenway Park,
Tiger Stadium is the most magical ballpark this side of Wrigley
Field. They have played baseball at the corner of Michigan and
Trumbull avenues for 103 years, including the last 88 seasons in
Tiger Stadium. (Moore, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

<P>
   BBO-STADIUMS-WRIGLEY _ CHICAGO _ It's the All-Star Game in
Boston, and Ernie Banks loses his smile for the first time ever. A
guy from Atlanta just asked the Hall of Famer if he thinks somebody
will do the unthinkable some day by yanking the ivy _ and
everything else _ out of Wrigley Field. ``I don't think they'll
ever tear down Wrigley Field,'' Banks says. ``It will withstand the
test of time and the history of baseball.'' (Moore, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   BBO-STADIUMS-YANKEE _ NW YORK _ The new Yankee Stadium isn't the
old Yankee Stadium. For decades, the House that Ruth Built featured
a copper facade along its majestic roof. This was long before they
altered the ballpark in the mid-1970s, lowering the playing field,
shortening the home-run distances in all but right field and adding
escalator towers. What didn't change was the ghosts. Next to Notre
Dame Stadium, no American sports facility has more ghosts than
Yankee Stadium. (Moore, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

making the 2000 Sydney Games, where she wants to become the oldest
swimming gold medalist in history. Because there is no 50-meter

from 5:45 a.m. until nearly 10 p.m. A former NASCAR champion now
drives a forklift that can't go faster than 15 mph. When White
filled out an application at Jones Transportation, he didn't list
his racing career under ``previous employment.'' Many of his 30
co-workers didn't learn of his accomplishments until last year,
when NASCAR named White one of the 50 greatest drivers of all-time.
He is not one to brag about his 1960 Winston Cup championship, the
Most Popular Driver award he got that year or some of his
impressive racing statistics, including 110 top-five finishes in

NEWS ANALYSIS: IN THIS SENATE RACE, SCRUTINY IS PERSONAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Quick: Was Sen. Alfonse D'Amato divorced from his wife? Where
does D'Amato's successor, Charles Schumer, live _ and does his
house have a swimming pool? What is the name of Schumer's wife?
Where does Schumer like to go on vacation?
</P>
<P>
   Even the most devoted followers of New York politics would be
hard pressed to answer such personal questions about these two
familiar politicians, even though they were the headliners of what
was arguably the most widely watched Senate contest of 1998. For
all the intensity of the Schumer-D'Amato race, this was one area of
inquiry that was barely touched _ ignored by candidates, voters and
the media alike.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, many people would have little difficultly
answering similar questions about Mayor Rudolph Giuliani or Hillary
Rodham Clinton, the two likely contestants in New York's next race
for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Their marital difficulties have already been examined in
newspapers and magazines. Giuliani has expounded from a City Hall
lectern about why he has not tried marijuana or cocaine. A squadron
of reporters is tracking the first lady this weekend as she
vacations in the Hamptons and looks at houses in Westchester
County.
</P>
<P>
   Inquiries into the lives of White House candidates, from the
most mundane to the most searingly personal, have been a staple of
the presidential selection process at least since 1987, when a
Washington Post reporter asked Gary Hart at a news conference if he
had ever committed adultery. By contrast, in congressional
campaigns the personal has usually taken a back seat to the
political.
</P>
<P>
   But the prospect of a Clinton-Giuliani race is challenging this
familiar political calculus. Everything about these two, from
youthful indiscretions to intimate accountings about their
upbringing and family lives, now seems sure to be fully explored in
the year ahead, filling what appears to be a huge public (or at
least media) hunger for information.
</P>
<P>
   At this early date, it is far from clear how much this will
matter come November 2000. Several analysts contended that it
seemed unlikely, given the political differences between Giuliani
and Mrs. Clinton, that personality would trump ideology in the end.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, workers in both campaigns are nervously gearing up
for exhaustive reviews of their candidates' lives, and even taking
steps to try to head them off. That may account for Mrs. Clinton's
pre-emptive interview about her marriage with Talk magazine this
month or Giuliani's scolding of reporters for their inquiries into
rumors about past drug use by George W. Bush, the Texas governor
and a Republican candidate for president.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, these early developments are raising questions
about the direction U.S. politics may be heading. Are the rules of
play for presidential races now seeping down to the congressional
level or is this a onetime phenomenon? Will a Clinton-Giuliani race
be to congressional politics what Hart's candidacy was to
presidential races? And should someone running to be one of 100
members of the Senate be subjected to the same personal scrutiny as
a candidate running for the White House?
</P>
<P>
   This new environment results, at least in part, from the fact
that the New York contest is likely to include on the Democratic
side the highest-profile first lady this nation has seen in 50
years, a woman whose political and personal evolution has been
minutely chronicled since the Clintons came to the nation's
attention at the start of 1992.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, both Mrs. Clinton and Giuliani are at once
electrifying and polarizing figures. And they are running in a
state that many political strategists view as the toughest
political environment in the nation and are already enduring the
kind of saturation coverage that typically does not begin until the
week before an election.
</P>
<P>
   It is a matter of debate how much this is driven by the news
media's fascination, as opposed to the genuine curiosity of voters.
But whatever the reason, the laserlike focus on both candidates is
unlike anything political consultants can recall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, can you tell me whether Chuck Schumer's been divorced
or not?'' said Kieran Mahoney, the Republican consultant who ran
D'Amato's unsuccessful campaign last year. ``Most people can't. The
point is, this isn't a Senate race, this is a presidential race. In
a Senate race, nobody would care. They wouldn't even question it.
It would never get to that level. You're lucky if they know the
names of the candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, pollsters say, voters use different criteria in
considering congressional candidates versus candidates for the
White House. A president is seen as a symbol of the nation; thus
his values, morals and public presence are critical factors in
electoral decisions. ``The president has the button to blow up the
world,'' said Dick Morris, the political consultant who once worked
for the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, voters in a Senate race are choosing members of a
deliberative body. They are likely to give more weight to a
candidate's beliefs, party affiliation and agility at fighting for
their state. ``Issues and ideology are more important for senators
because they are seen as acting primarily as members of a team,
more so than governors and presidents,'' said Whit Ayres, a
Republican pollster based in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in last year's New York contest, Schumer
relentlessly highlighted D'Amato's opposition to abortion rights
and some forms of gun control, while D'Amato presented himself as
New York's advocate in Washington. Neither candidate made mention
of his opponent's personal life. (Yes, by the way, D'Amato is
divorced; Schumer is not. Schumer lives in Brooklyn with his wife,
Iris, without a pool. His preferred vacation destination, an aide
says, is any of the national parks.)
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Mrs. Clinton and Giuliani, while holding similar
opinions on gun control and abortion rights, clearly have different
views about the role of government. That means both candidates have
the potential to drive the campaign away from themselves and toward
their ideologies, and their advisers say that is what they intend
to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``At different times, people are intrigued and curious about
personal aspects of candidates,'' said Mandy Grunwald, a longtime
consultant to Mrs. Clinton. ``But I think, ultimately, this is an
issue-based decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Shrum, a Democratic consultant who worked for Geraldine
A. Ferraro in the 1998 Senate race and for David N. Dinkins in both
his mayoral bids, said there was a matter of political
self-preservation at play here. ``I think the voters will severely
punish anyone who tries to drag personal stuff into the New York
Senate race,'' Shrum said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if there is one thing Giuliani and Mrs. Clinton seem to
agree on, it is that they do not want the campaign to be too much
about them. In an interview on MSNBC last week, for example,
Giuliani served notice that he considered inquiries about his own
life off limits. ``When people ask me about my private life, I
don't tell them about it,'' Giuliani said. ``It's none of their
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, after Mrs. Clinton discussed her troubled marriage
with Talk magazine, she declared she would not answer any more
questions on the subject. Her aides said they hoped that would put
an end to the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Will that work?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a race like no other,'' said James Carville, the
Democratic consultant whose clients have included Mrs. Clinton's
husband. ``I can't tell you how many stories I've seen on her
buying the house _ just the normal things that people do. Do I
think it's going to affect a voter? No. But we don't know. Because
nothing like this has ever happened before.''

RENEWED EFFORTS TO CHANGE HOW POLICE DISCIPLINE THEIR OWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After separate police corruption investigations more
than two decades apart, the Knapp and Mollen commissions arrived at
an identical finding: There was a serious defect in the city law
that governs how the New York City Police Department disciplines
its own.
</P>
<P>
   The only two sanctions that could be imposed in cases of severe
misconduct _ the forfeiture of 30 days' pay or outright dismissal _
were either too lenient or too strong in many instances, the panels
found, so officers, and at times, justice, suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran officers with otherwise untarnished careers risked being
fired for their first serious offense because there was no middle
range of punishment. Others found guilty of serious misconduct
might escape with the loss of just 30 days' pay.
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani administration sought to amend the law in 1994,
introducing legislation that would allow the police commissioner to
impose demotions, fines as high as $25,000 and suspensions of up to
one year.
</P>
<P>
   But 27 years, 11 police commissioners and several thousand
misconduct cases after the Knapp Commission issued its findings,
the law remains untouched. And this month, as efforts to amend the
law resume, officials cannot agree on who is responsible for the
inaction.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir
blame Councilman Sheldon Leffler, the chairman of the City Council
committee in which the bill has gathered dust for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Leffler, who says he strongly supports the bill, says it is
Council Speaker Peter Vallone, who largely controls the legislative
process, who has been stalling.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Vallone, who also says he supports the legislation,
said the mayor had not pushed very hard or very consistently for it
until the recent negotiations began anew.
</P>
<P>
   As speaker, however, Vallone did not need either the mayor's
enthusiasm or Leffler's consent to move forward with the bill.
Vallone's aides acknowledge that the bill's legislative pace has
been leisurely, to say the least, in part because they have been
occupied with other possible police reforms, and in part because
they sought to carefully evaluate the opposition of the police
unions, who complain that it is unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to do a cooperative effort that takes in the
concerns of the administration and tries to address the concerns
that the unions have raised,'' said Michael Clendenin, a spokesman
for Vallone.
</P>
<P>
   The unions are vehemently opposed to the legislation. They say
that Safir can already mete out middle-range punishments and does
so often, using the threat of termination to extract negotiated
plea agreements from officers who have been charged with serious
misconduct. Even though Safir cannot, by law, impose suspensions
longer than 30 days, union leaders said officers routinely accepted
harsher punishments to avoid losing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is asking for powers that he already has,'' said Patrick
Lynch, the president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association.
</P>
<P>
   But Safir said there are many cases in which officers refuse to
negotiate and he is left with ``either an option that is too
stringent or not stringent enough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy,'' he continued, ``to do justice when you have
only two options for everybody, because some people who commit what
really are 30-day offenses get 30 days, and some people who commit
an offense that exceeds 30 days, but does not rise to termination,
are not getting punished adequately.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir fired 74 officers last year, a fact he often cites when
civil rights advocates accuse him of being too soft on misbehaving
officers. Although the number of dismissals has had an impact on
the rank and file, who clearly view Safir as a disciplinarian, the
department is often criticized for being too lenient in many
misconduct cases.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in 1998 the Commission to Combat Police Corruption
cited in one of its reports an instance in which the department had
allowed a police officer who beat his girlfriend and aimed his gun
at her to negotiate a 30-day suspension and remain on the job.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The graveyard business is just not what it used to
be. So Green-Wood Cemetery, the huge and historic burial ground in
Brooklyn, is taking its first slow steps toward a new identity:
tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
   This is not as goofy _ or as ghoulish _ as it might sound. A
century ago, Green-Wood was a tourist attraction, ranking right up
there with Niagara Falls on the 19th-century must-see list.
</P>
<P>
   Modern visitors who do not share the Victorians' obsession with
death _ or their admiration for mawkish statues of angels and urns
_ could be swept away by the magnificent landscape at Green-Wood.
Another lure is the colorful stories of the politicians and
gangsters, Civil War generals and industrial magnates, victims of
disasters and stars of scandals whose tombs cover most of the 478
acres.
</P>
<P>
   So the cemetery's management recently began trying to entice the
public to enter its faux-Gothic gates. ``I'd like to see us become
one of the highlights of the Brooklyn tour circuit,'' said Richard
J. Moylan, president of Green-Wood, which opened in 1840.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Green-Wood published a lively history chronicling the
deeds (and misdeeds) of its denizens. This summer, it held its
first concert, featuring the music of composers buried on site.
Next month, it will start selling a guide that visitors can use to
find the graves of everyone from Boss Tweed to the original Brooks
Brothers, and will sponsor a booth at the annual New York Is Book
Country fair in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Green-Wood is hardly the only historic American cemetery trying
to lure visitors and raise its public profile. In Cleveland, there
are trolley tours of cemeteries. In Rochester, N.Y., Mount Hope
Cemetery has an ``adopt-a-grave'' program. Woodlawn, in the Bronx,
has a concert series _ next month it will hold its first
performance of Latino music _ and is considering an Easter egg hunt
for the spring. Mount Auburn, in Cambridge, Mass., bills itself as
an arboretum as well as a burial ground, and has developed a number
of programs for the public.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons _ historical, sociological and financial
_ for these efforts.
</P>
<P>
   With fewer people choosing burial, cemeteries find themselves
needing to advertise the benefits of having a memorial. Cremation,
which is less lucrative for cemeteries than burial, has increased
in popularity, as has the scattering of ashes and burial at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the belief that graveyards full of visitors may
discourage thieves intent on stealing their Tiffany glass windows
or bronze statues. And cemeteries are searching for money to
restore some of their moldering monuments.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't expect current sales dollars to cover 100 years of
history,'' said Thomas G. Roberts, president of the Allegheny
Cemetery in Pittsburgh and chairman of the historic cemeteries
committee of the International Cemetery and Funeral Association.
Almost 20 years ago, Allegheny set up a foundation and began
raising money for historic preservation, he said. ``Foundations
have been very understanding, once we get past what I call the
laugh factor.''
</P>
<P>
   But in New York, in death as in life, the clincher is real
estate. Green-Wood, like other burial grounds around the city, is
running out of space.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in our twilight years as an active cemetery,'' Moylan
said. The space problem is not yet acute, he added; the cemetery,
which buries the remains of about 2,000 people a year, probably has
enough room for another decade's worth.
</P>
<P>
   But that is only because the cemetery has taken to removing some
of its miles of roads and pathways, and using that space to bury
the dead. Only a few more scenic paths can be replaced with graves
before the overall appearance of the cemetery is affected, he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even after the last $5,000 plot is sold, Green-Wood will
continue to make money from the services that provide much of its
income. Each grave can hold as many as three coffins, stacked, so
family members can be buried together. Some tombs have a lot of
empty slots; the piano-building Steinway family built a huge tomb
in the 1870s, with space for more than 150 bodies, according to
Jeffrey I. Richman, the author of the book the cemetery published,
``Brooklyn's Green-Wood Cemetery: New York's Buried Treasure.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, however, the cemetery will have to live off the
income from its investments, already its largest source of revenue.
Green-Wood had almost $200 million in its various funds at the end
of 1998, according to its filings with the state Division of
Cemeteries. It is one of the best endowed of the state's 1,900
nonprofit cemeteries, said Richard D. Fishman, director of the
division.
</P>
<P>
   But Green-Wood is also one of the most expensive cemeteries to
maintain. It takes 135 people to manicure its steep slopes, trim
its trees and shrubs and rake its leaves. The cemetery spent more
than $4 million on maintenance last year, according to its filings.
</P>
<P>
   Although the cemetery, which is just south of Park Slope, looks
pristine _ the grass neatly cut, the monuments well kept _ some of
the historic markers and statues are in sore need of conservation
and restoration. At the Soldiers' Monument, the four life-size
statues of Civil War soldiers are missing pieces _ a hand here, an
ax there, a rifle over there _ and the bronze is split in places.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the severe damage has occurred to monuments made of
marble, which has not held up well in the face of acid rain and
salt breezes. (Green-Wood has a view of New York Harbor and the
Statue of Liberty.)
</P>
<P>
   At the monument to composer and pianist Louis Moreau Gottschalk,
for example, ``you can't make his name out and, if you touch the
marble, it comes off on your hand like salt,'' said John J.
Cashman, a retired police sergeant who, with Frank Mescall, leads
tours at the cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, Cashman's tours were pretty much the only way to
see the cemetery, which for much of the 20th century has maintained
a low-key stance, welcoming only lot owners and their families. In
this century, visitors who were not discouraged by the cemetery's
miles of spiky iron fencing, topped here and there with razor wire,
had to get a special pass to walk the grounds, and were strictly
forbidden to take photographs. ``I've been turned away at the
gate,'' said Kenneth T. Jackson, a professor of history at Columbia
University.
</P>
<P>
   Until early in this century, Jackson noted, the sort of people
who built the elaborate, expensive monuments at Green-Wood and
Woodlawn expected sightseers. ``You would only be spending that
kind of money if you thought someone would come to see it,'' he
said. He added that in the 19th century, having a fancy cemetery
was a point of civic pride, much as having a major-league baseball
team is today.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, the lots are private property and the monuments are
not the responsibility of the cemetery, but of the families of the
dead. But for historic cemeteries, even those family members who
are still nearby may not have the means to repair the marble bust
of Great-Great-Uncle Horace or to fill the cast-iron urns with
begonias.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Mount Hope in Rochester created the adopt-a-grave
program, in which volunteers care for the plantings and flower
beds, said Nancy M. Hilliard, director of cemeteries for the city.
Churches, garden groups and individuals maintain about 75 graves at
the 196-acre cemetery, which is 160 years old and has the graves of
Susan B. Anthony and Frederick Douglass.
</P>
<P>
   At Green-Wood, the management has established a fund to be used
for restoration; Cashman donates $1 of the $6 he charges for his
tours, which he leads on Sunday afternoons in the spring and fall.
</P>
<P>
   Moylan is learning about fund-raising and grants, and is
investigating that '90s concept, corporate sponsorship, to restore
monuments with strong ties to New York companies. Among the
well-known corporate names represented at Green-Wood are Tiffany,
Brooks (as in Brothers), F.A.O. Schwarz, Eberhard Faber of pencil
fame, and the Browns of the investment firm Brown Brothers
Harriman.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors lucky enough to tour with Richman, a lawyer who became
an author and passionate Green-Wood fan, can hear about all these
and more. Leonard Bernstein is buried at Green-Wood, and so is
actor Frank Morgan, who played the Wizard of Oz.
</P>
<P>
   There are artists _ both Currier and Ives _ and newspapermen,
including Horace Greeley. Inventors abound, and are credited by
Richman with creating everything from the telegraph and typewriter
to safety pins and hotel room service.
</P>
<P>
   Most entertaining, perhaps, are Richman's stories of the
outrageous, extravagant and eccentric celebrities of 19th-century
New York. Richman describes the miser who left his fortune to the
American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals., the
mining magnate with a heated tomb, and the woman who vowed to give
the most lavish party ever, which she did _ and then fled the
country a step ahead of the tax man.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of people go on his tours? History hounds, Brooklyn
buffs, Civil War enthusiasts, bird-watchers and genealogy mavens,
Richman said. And then there are the increasing number of Americans
who just love cemeteries.
</P>
<P>
   Katie Karrick said that when she started a newsletter called
``Tomb With a View'' in 1995, ``I got 60 subscribers, and I was
flabbergasted.'' Today, she has 500 paying customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Victorians really glorified death; we try to ignore it,''
Ms. Karrick said. But that may be changing as the baby boomers
think about dying and want to make sure they are noticed even after
death, she said. The new fashion in headstones is to include a lot
of information about the deceased, like their occupations and
hobbies, as well as photographs. ``I call them resume stones,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Karrick leads a tour in Cleveland called ``Stones and
Bones,'' which is one of the graveyard trips run by Trolley Tours
of Cleveland. ``If you do it in a reverential, pleasant way, and
with a sense of humor, people are very receptive,'' said Sherrill
Paul, president of the tour company, which takes more than 500
people a year on cemetery trips.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Auburn in Cambridge has produced a cassette tape, titled
``Reflections,'' that guides drivers around its 12 miles of roads.
It also has maps showing the locations of unusual trees. As many as
125,000 people a year visit the cemetery, said Janet Heywood,
director of interpretive programs for Mount Auburn, though some of
those are mourners, not tourists.
</P>
<P>
   So Moylan may be right when he predicts that people will start
visiting Green-Wood again, the way they did a century ago. ``I
don't know if we can get back to the picnic baskets around the
lake,'' he said, ``but we can hope.''

UNION LEADERS SAY THEY SUPPORT BOEING'S FINAL CONTRACT OFFER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash.)  (js) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leaders of the International Association of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers endorsed a contract proposal from Boeing Co. on
Saturday, greatly reducing the chances that its 44,000 members will
strike on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   After 12 days of intense negotiations at a hotel outside
Seattle, Boeing submitted its final contract proposal to the
machinists early Saturday, offering several concessions and a wage
increase of nearly 16 percent over three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this contract is the best contract in aerospace,
period,'' said Bill Johnson, a union negotiator who is also
president of the Seattle local that represents 31,000 Boeing
workers. ``They gave us everything we wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   But the endorsement of the leaders of the union, which
represents nearly one-quarter of Boeing's 207,000 workers, does not
guarantee that a strike will be averted. The union leadership also
backed a company proposal in 1995, only to see it rejected by the
workers, leading to a 69-day strike. In 1992, the leadership was
neutral about the company's offer that was subsequently approved by
the membership.
</P>
<P>
   Union members will vote on the proposal on Wednesday, the last
day of their 44-month contract. A majority is needed to approve the
offer. If that vote fails, a two-thirds majority is needed to
initiate a walkout that could begin as early as 12:01 a.m. on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A strike would cripple the Seattle-area factories that produce
Boeing's flagship commercial jets at a time when the company is
beginning to recover from a costly production foul-up that forced
it to halt production for a month in 1997 and caused the company to
post its first annual loss in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that we have a contract we can be proud of,'' Philip
M. Condit, Boeing's chairman and chief executive, said in an

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One hour after the union's midnight Friday negotiating deadline
had passed, Boeing caved in on several important issues. The
company withdrew its effort to introduce alternative work schedules
that would have forced union members to work weekend shifts without
earning overtime pay. It also dropped a proposal that union members
contribute to health insurance premiums, which are now fully paid
by Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Boeing agreed to increase retirement benefits by 25
percent, raising the monthly benefit to $1,500 for a worker who
retired after 30 years of service. The final proposal also promised
that no jobs would be cut as a result of subcontracting, a major
concern of the machinists, who fear that Boeing will try to
increase its profits by shifting work to outside suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Workers are especially jittery because after expecting to
produce a record 680 airplanes this year, Boeing is planning to
make only 480 next year. Last December, the company said it planned
to lay off 48,000 union and nonunion employees by the end of next
year. More than 30,000 jobs have been cut in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing executives said the new contract would make union members
among the best-paid workers in the nation. Today the average
machinist at Boeing earns $21.07 an hour, or about $44,000 a year,
the company said, although that figure can more than double with
overtime earned during peak production. Over the course of the
proposed contract, the average wage would rise to $24.35 an hour.
Boeing is also offering a 10 percent signing bonus, or about $4,400
per worker, if the contract is ratified by Wednesday.

 &HT;    BAHAMA REPAIRS STORM DAMAGE.
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) - As Hurricane Dennis churned toward the southeastern
U.S. coast Saturday, residents of the northern Bahamas were
repairing the damage caused by a near direct hit from Dennis'
eyewall in the early hours of Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The winds were terrible, gusting to 115 miles an hour,'' said
Martin Havill(cq), general manager of the Bluff House Beach Hotel
on Green Turtle Cay, just off Great Abaco. ``It started about 10
p.m. last night (Friday) and about 5 a.m. this morning it reached
its apex. We have a lot of trees down and a couple of boats sunk,
but other than that we're okay. Thank God nobody was hurt,'' Havill
reported in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Weather officials said the center of Dennis passed within a few
miles of Great Abaco's eastern tip, pummeling the sparsely
populated island with sustained winds of 80 miles an hour and gusts
to 115 miles an hour. Huge seas thrashed the rocky Atlantic coast,
with waves to 20 feet pounding the outer reefs of several smaller
islands that lie just off Abaco's shores.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seas on the outer reef were unbelievable,'' Havill said.
``The waves were probably 20 feet plus.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the reefs along resort beaches, however, early reports
listed the damage as minor, with smaller waves pushed in by the
storm causing some erosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had one large boat who stayed in the sound all night,''
Havill said. ``He had to run his engines just to stay in place over
his anchor. He reported winds in excess of 100 miles an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Havill and other hotel workers reported little damage to
buildings other than some missing roof shingles. The worst damage
appeared to be to foliage, with trees toppled and downed limbs
littering the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are coconut trees down everywhere,'' said Avis Miller,
who works at Treasure Cay Beach Hotel about 20 miles northeast of
Marsh Harbour. ``But nobody was hurt and we had nothing
disastrous.''
</P>
<P>
   About 20 guests stayed in the hotel overnight, Miller said,
spending the night without electricity, listening to the winds
howl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The electricity is out and that's the worst of it, but
everybody is okay,'' she said. ``They're all taking coffee and
eating rice krispies. Everybody is quite safe and happy.''
</P>
<P>
   There were reports of damage to buildings in Marsh Harbour,
Great Abaco's largest town, with the walls of two buildings under
construction toppled by the gusting winds. There were no immediate
reports of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Bachewicz(cq), flew over to Great Abaco from his home in
Fort Lauderdale before the storm to secure his 50-foot sailboat,
which he keeps at the Treasure Cay Marina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through several hurricanes here and this was the
worst because the eyewall passed right over us,'' he said. ``My
wife was scared. Last night you had to hang onto stuff when you
were walking.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said that while the winds were powerful, the damage
remained surprisingly light.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could've been much worse,'' said Havill. ``We'll have
everything cleaned up in a day or two. Tell people who had plans to
visit that everything is fine.''

   COCOA BEACH, Fla. _ A strengthening Hurricane Dennis spun toward
the Southeastern coast Saturday with growing winds and falling
pressures, sending coastal residents from Florida to the Carolinas
scrambling to prepare for a landfall that experts still sought to
predict.
</P>
<P>
   (insert material required here)
</P>
<P>
   At xx p.m., the storm was located about xxx miles southeast of
Cape Canaveral with sustained winds of xxx miles an hour. Dennis
was moving northwest at xx miles an hour. Forecasters expected the
storm to continue on its northwesterly track, which make it a
threat to the coasts of North or South Carolina, perhaps by
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   (end inserts)
</P>
<P>
   Dennis was expected to grow into a Category 3 storm by the time
it makes landfall, with winds of 111 miles an hour or greater,
meaning it would be capable of major damage.
</P>
<P>
   But the predictions were complicated by the storm's slow
movement, coupled with uncertainty over the impact of weak upper
level weather systems that could still help kick the hurricane out
to sea.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the National Hurricane Center worried that Dennis
might stall again as it had done on Friday, giving it the chance to
grow even stronger while making its track even less predictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fear of a stall is that it makes the storm surge much
larger because it sits there and pushes water up onto the coast for
a long period of time,'' Jerry Jarrell, the center's director, told
the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane watches were posted along 200 miles of Florida's coast
from Sebastian Inlet north to the Georgia state line. But it
appeared Dennis would brush past Florida, narrowly missing its long
coastline on its way to landfall somewhere further north.
</P>
<P>
   Winds along Central Florida beaches gusted to 40 miles an hour
Saturday afternoon as Dennis' outer bands swept near.
Six-to-ten-foot waves pounded the beaches, eroding sand dunes and
keeping all but adventurous surfers out of the water.
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday, Dennis had already done some damage in the Bahamas,
toppling trees and pounding beaches on the islands of Great Abaco
and Grand Bahama, as well as several smaller keys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seas were very bad,'' said Martin Havill(cq), manager of
the Bluff House Beach Hotel on Green Turtle Cay just off Great
Abaco. ``But it really was not a problem. We had a couple of roofs
with some shingles off, a lot of trees down and our pool is full of
leaves. But we had everybody up for breakfast.''
</P>
<P>
   Early reports indicated some damage to buildings in Marsh
Harbour, Great Abaco's largest town, where two buildings under
construction had collapsed walls. But there were no early reports
of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis packed sustained winds of about 80 miles an hour when it
roared over Great Abaco, with some reports of gusts as high as 115
miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   After clearing the islands early Saturday, the storm began to
strengthen, with pressures falling and winds jumping to 100 miles
an hour. Forecasters worried that the storm would continue building
as it moved across the warm Gulf Stream waters off the Florida
coast.
</P>
<P>
   Florida coastal residents were not ordered to evacuate, although
emergency officials kept a close eye on the storm. Along Central
Florida's beaches, dozens of sightseers drove to overlooks to watch
the powerful waves kicked up by Dennis.
</P>
<P>
   Surfers were out by the hundreds, some paddling out before the
sun came up Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at the pier this morning at 6 a.m. and there were
hundreds of kids scrambling around,'' said Doug Monda, 30, a Cocoa
Beach surfer. ``This is big surf for Florida, so everybody's
excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Up the coast in coastal towns of Georgia and Charleston, S.C.,
residents and officials nervously watched the storm's progress,
mindful of powerful Hurricane Hugo, which lashed South Carolina in
1989, doing extensive damage.

<P>
   _ Frank Sinatra
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One by one in the 1960s or 1970s, their sacred walls
were rocked by wrecking balls instead of baseballs. Crosley, Ebbets
and Forbes fields. The Polo Grounds, Sportsman's Park and the rest.
</P>
<P>
   They were replaced by multipurpose flying-saucer stadiums or
domed facilities. Now, the trend is for new-old ballparks that
resemble their distant forefathers _ minus the bad sight lines,
sparse restrooms and lack of luxury boxes.
</P>
<P>
   However, even with the Braves' Turner Field and the Orioles'
Camden Yards leading the explosion of new-old ballparks into the
next century, the old-old places still exist.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Of baseball's six oldest major-league ballparks, three will be
gone after this year: Tiger Stadium in Detroit, Milwaukee County
Stadium and San Francisco's 3Com Park, formerly known as
Candlestick. In Boston, Fenway Park is fading fast, and although
New York's Yankee Stadium and Chicago's Wrigley Field are safe now,
both could vanish in a flash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all like new things, but baseball history is starting to
pass us by,'' said Billy Williams, who spent most of his Hall of
Fame career at Wrigley with the Cubs. ``When you think of these
ballparks, you go back to the turn of the century. You think of all
of the players who sat on those benches and dressed in those
clubhouses.''
</P>
<P>
   Others aren't as sentimental. Past and current players at
Milwaukee County Stadium say the home clubhouse reeks after heavy
rains from an eternal sewage problem. Former Red Sox catcher
Carlton Fisk suggests that ``the varmints and rodents'' at Fenway
are bigger than the Green Monster. Jack Clark often spoke during
his Giants days of praying for an earthquake to destroy windy and
chilly Candlestick Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Tiger Stadium, the dugouts are so low that you walk in and
hit your head on the ceiling,'' said Harmon Killebrew, the former
Twins slugger. ``People would say, `Don't feel bad. Ty Cobb did the
same thing.' That's when I first came into the league (in 1954),
and they were even talking about a new ballpark in Detroit back
then.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Orioles great Brooks Robinson shrugged, saying, ``Hey,
it's sad to see all of these places go, but after a while, you
really don't think a whole lot about it. I'll miss them, though.''

 &HT;    Candlestick's cold creates home-field advantage
 &HT;    By Terence Moore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark Twain died nearly five decades before the Giants moved from
New York to San Francisco. To paraphrase the noted humorist,
however, the coldest winter that anybody could spend would be to
attend a baseball game at Candlestick Point.
</P>
<P>
   No ballpark is more affected by Mother Nature than Candlestick _
or 3Com, as it's been known since 1995 _ where games often are
played in swirling winds, brutal temperatures, blinding fog or all
three.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, the weather actually has gotten better for
us,'' says Dusty Baker, an expert on the horrors of Candlestick
Point. This season is his seventh as the Giants' manager. He
visited San Francisco for 14 years as a Brave or Dodger, and he was
a Giants outfielder for a season and a Giants coach for five more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind isn't as bad as it has been, because we play more day
games,'' Baker says, smiling. Then he quickly frowns, because he
knows pleasant days at Candlestick Point don't help his team retain
baseball's most striking home-field advantage.
</P>
<P>
   It is an advantage only when Giants players realize it. Except
for brief periods, most of those on the home team have loathed the
place more than their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Right-handed slugger Willie Mays quietly adjusted his swing to
take advantage of the wind gusts to right field before the park was
enclosed at that end. But many former Giants, particularly Jack
Clark and Johnnie LeMaster, spent most of their careers ripping
Candlestick between chattering teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Given the location near the coldest part of San Francisco Bay,
even the builders knew that the ballpark would become a freezer
with a diamond in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   A radiant heating system was installed in the reserved-seating
area, but it rarely worked. A fan once sued the Giants, saying he
was forced to leave his seat during rallies because his feet were
freezing. A jury awarded him $1,597.
</P>
<P>
   ``On those cold nights, we put on hot Vaseline and baby oil,
stuff like that, to make us warmer,'' says Hall of Famer Juan
Marichal, a Giants pitcher during the 1960s. ``Some guys, they
really hate that place. But I loved it. I had so many great games
there, I cannot complain. If the opposing player didn't like it,
I'd take advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a decade after Marichal's retirement, former Giants
manager Roger Craig's no-griping philosophy helped turn a
struggling franchise into a playoff contender.
</P>
<P>
   Baker worked for Craig, and has kept the old philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our players really don't complain about the weather,'' Baker
says. ``It is a great advantage for us. If a team is on a West
Coast swing, and if their star needs a day off, you know what will
happen? He won't take that day in Los Angeles or San Diego, where
the weather is sunny, warm and bright. He'll take it in San
Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   So, when the Giants move next season, will Baker be
disappointed? ``Not really,'' Baker says, laughing. ``Unh-uh.''
</P>
<P>
   MEMORABLE MOMENTS
</P>
<P>
   July 11, 1961: The Giants' Stu Miller is blown off the mound by
raging winds during the first of two All-Star Games.
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 22, 1965: Pitcher Juan Marichal uses a bat to bash Dodgers
catcher John Roseboro in the back of the head during a brawl.
</P>
<P>
   July 3, 1966: Braves pitcher Tony Cloninger becomes the first
National League player to hit two grand slams in the same game.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 17-18, 1968: The Giants' Gaylord Perry and the Cardinals'
Ray Washburn throw consecutive no-hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 17, 1989: Before Game 3 of the World Series, an earthquake
strikes. The Series returns to Oakland and the A's complete a 4-0
sweep.
</P>
<P>
   CANDLESTICK (3COM) PARK
</P>
<P>
   Opening day: April 12, 1960. The Giants beat the St. Louis
Cardinals 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Location: On Candlestick Point, just southeast of downtown San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Capacity: 63,000.
</P>
<P>
   Status: This is 3Com's final season. Next year the Giants will
move into Pacific Bell Park, an open-air stadium located downtown
near the China Basin area around San Francisco Bay.
</P>
<P>
   History lesson: When city officials held a contest to name the
stadium, they received more than 20,000 entries. The sports editors
of San Francisco's four daily papers served as judges, and they
chose the name because of its location on Candlestick Point.

 &HT;    At County Stadium, Braves memories prevail
 &HT;    By Terence Moore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It doesn't have Wrigley's ivy or the legendary right-field porch
of Tiger Stadium. A Green Monster? The most striking thing
involving that color inside County Stadium was the Packers, but
they eventually left to play all of their games in Green Bay, Wisc.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine an often chilly and an eternally gray building in the
middle of a parking lot. It's either one of the city's abandoned
breweries or County Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The ballpark was built during the early 1950s, and it
accommodated the Braves after their swift move from Boston in 1953.
When the Braves scooted away before the 1966 season to play in
Atlanta, County Stadium was mostly vacant until the Brewers arrived
four years later.
</P>
<P>
   Braves. Packers. Brewers. It hasn't mattered. Courtesy of
Wisconsin's brutal winters, County Stadium isn't aging gracefully.
``You definitely have to say that, aesthetically, it isn't the
greatest thing to see from the outside,'' says Hall of Famer Robin
Yount, who spent his career with the Brewers. ``It's also pretty
straightforward on the inside. It doesn't have any of those goofy
little things that would give you an advantage over the opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, County Stadium manages to glow despite its physical
gloom, and it has nothing to do with the large barrel beyond the
center-field bleachers featuring Bernie Brewer. He's the team
mascot who slides into a stein of balloons after a Brewer hits a
homer.
</P>
<P>
   Two things rank County Stadium among the game's special places:
food and memories.
</P>
<P>
   County Stadium is peerless when it comes to making the perfect
hot dog, bratwurst and Polish and Italian sausages. The concessions
serve a distinctive German mustard, and they have a ``secret
sauce'' for meats that is so popular that local stores sell it by
the gallon.
</P>
<P>
   A bakery turns out cookies, cinnamon rolls and pecan rolls fresh
by the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Also common at County Stadium are memories _ especially the ones
that broke an entire state's heart 34 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers have been here 30 years and reached the World Series
in 1982, but fans feel the 1950s Braves when they walk through the
gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought (County Stadium) was good to pitch in,
because the people of Milwaukee and of Wisconsin were such great
fans,'' says Warren Spahn, who helped the Braves of Hank Aaron and
Eddie Mathews capture two National League pennants and a world
championship. ``The atmosphere was one of camaraderie. They made us
feel at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewers great Paul Molitor says, ``What makes that ballpark
magical . . . is that you always realized what took place back when
the Braves were there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a small town, Milwaukee is almost the Green Bay of
baseball. You have a greater sense of community in that stadium.
People take pride in that they are the underdog. The tailgate
parties are so much bigger than any other ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't have the uniqueness of a Fenway or the intimacy of
a Wrigley, but Milwaukee County Stadium has emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   MEMORABLE MOMENTS
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 23, 1957: Hank Aaron's homer in the bottom of the 11th
wins the pennant for the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   May 26, 1959: The Pirates' Harvey Haddix pitches 12 perfect
innings but loses 1-0 to the Braves in the 13th.
</P>
<P>
   April 30, 1961: The Giants' Willie Mays hits four home runs in a
game against the Milwaukee Braves.
</P>
<P>
   July 20, 1976: Hank Aaron slams the 755th and final home run of
his career.
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 10, 1982: The Brewers become the first team in the history
of the League Championship Series to win the pennant after losing
the first two games of a best-of-five series. They beat the Angels
3-2 in the decisive game.
</P>
<P>
   COUNTY STADIUM
</P>
<P>
   Opening day: April 14, 1953. The Braves beat the St. Louis
Cardinals 4-3 in 10 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Location: On Milwaukee's west side, about five miles from
downtown, near I-94.
</P>
<P>
   Capacity: 53,192.
</P>
<P>
   Status: The Brewers were scheduled to move next season into
Miller Park (under construction, above), but a major construction
accident with the retractable roof has left the move in limbo.
</P>
<P>
   History lesson: This ballpark was the first built with public
money. Even though Milwaukee didn't have a team, the city broke
ground for a $5 million facility in 1950. The ballpark was nearly
finished when the Braves announced on March 18, 1953, that they
were moving from Boston to Milwaukee.

 &HT;    Fenway: Historic but humble
 &HT;    By Terence Moore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of baseball's myths is that everybody loves Fenway Park.
Many do, of course. In fact, most who know the difference between
Carl Yastrzemski and a bowl of clam chowder tend to view this
quaint home of the Red Sox as perfection on earth.
</P>
<P>
   But more than a few New Englanders say it's time to rid their
historic landscape of a relic that is cramped and rickety.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Skusevich and Paul Mahoney are Boston natives, best buddies
and lifelong Red Sox fans. They are chatting in the narrow
concourse in Fenway's lower grandstands, where they prefer to stand
rather than to squeeze down the narrowest rows in the major leagues
to reach their season-ticket seats.
</P>
<P>
   As is the case throughout Fenway, their seats are comfortable
only for munchkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the Sox, but this place stinks. It really does,'' says
Mahoney, 43, laughing and shaking his head. ``I've been coming here
since the Sox's Impossible Dream season of 1967, but I'll tell you
something. Since I'm getting older, wiser and wider, I need bigger
seats.''
</P>
<P>
   Skusevich, 47, chuckles. ``All I can tell you is that I'll be
very proud of the next ballpark in Boston,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   So you think these are just disgruntled fans, still distraught
about the sale of Babe Ruth to the Yankees, Bucky Dent's homer and
Bill Buckner's gaffe?
</P>
<P>
   Well, listen to Carlton Fisk, the former Red Sox catcher, who
kept jumping and waving until his home run in Game 6 of the 1975
World Series sailed fair, high over Fenway's left-field foul pole.
``Leaving Fenway will be a good thing,'' Fisk says, ``and I
certainly won't miss all of the varmints and rodents that crawl
around that place.''
</P>
<P>
   If Fisk isn't persuasive, how about Ted Williams, the greatest
Red Sox player of all? Asked if he holds the same sentiments of the
group known as Save Fenway, Williams says, ``Forget trying to
remodel. Get a new ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't get the wrong idea. Fenway definitely has its pluses.
There are many of them inside and outside the ballpark, whose debut
was pushed off the front pages of Boston newspapers by another big
story in April 1912. Something about the Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fenway has marvelous memories, and in the process of creating
the brand-new `old' Fenway, those memories won't disappear,'' says
Fisk, a New England native. ``The home runs will still have been
hit. The wins and the losses, along with the exciting times that
happened in that park, they all will remain. They will be in your
head forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Fenway is more than the Green Monster, the left-field wall that
is 37 feet high and 240 feet long. It's more than the quirky angles
and curves along the outfield wall.
</P>
<P>
   Fenway is the Citgo sign in the distance beyond left. Fenway is
Lansdowne Street, where drinking holes are packed, and fans gather
to wait for homers that sail over the 23-foot-high net above the
Monster. Fenway is Helen Robinson, telephone receptionist for the
Red Sox for 57 years. Fenway is the epidemic of pigeons that once
caused Williams to draw the ire of the humane society becaue he
shot some of them with his rifle.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, according to a surprising number of observers, Fenway is
a creaky ballpark whose time has come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody really wants to leave Fenway Park,''
American League president Gene Budig says. ``Even so, it must be
done, and I think people have come to accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Yankees manager Joe Torre, ``Fenway Park certainly
is one of the great places to watch baseball, but its time for a
change, and it's time for an upgrade.''
</P>
<P>
   Skusevich and Mahoney agree. Emphatically.
</P>
<P>
   MEMORABLE MOMENTS
</P>
<P>
   June 18, 1953: The Red Sox set a major-league record by scoring
17 runs in an inning against the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 28, 1960: Williams homers in his last at-bat in the
majors, circles the bases and heads to the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 22, 1975: Carlton Fisk hits the left-field foul pole in the
bottom of the 12th inning against the Reds to win Game 6 of the
1975 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 2, 1978: The Yankees' Bucky Dent hits a home run to left to
knock the Red Sox out of the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   FENWAY PARK
</P>
<P>
   Opening day: April 20, 1912. The Red Sox defeated the New York
Highlanders, later known as the Yankees, 7-6 in 11 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Location: Corner of Yawkey Way and Van Ness Street in the Fenway
section of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Capacity: 33,871.
</P>
<P>
   Status: The Red Sox have announced plans for a $545 million
ballpark to be built next door to Fenway, although no timetable has
been set. Parts of the old park would become a museum.
</P>
<P>
   History lesson: Fenway's left-field wall was not known as the
Green Monster until 1947, when large advertisements were painted
over. Before, left field was notorious for a 10-foot embankment in
front of the wall, and fans sometimes were allowed to sit there.
Boston's Duffy Lewis was so skilled at playing balls hit to the
hill that it became known at ``Duffy's Cliff.''

 &HT;    Tiger Stadium: Cozy, magical
 &HT;    By Terence Moore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Moisture glistens in Al Kaline's eyes as he stands near the
batting cage at Tiger Stadium discussing his deepest love in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I saw this ballpark was when I was 18,'' says
Kaline, a Hall of Fame outfielder who joined the Tigers in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came in right over there,'' he says, pointing toward an
entrance behind the seats along the third-base line. ``It was a
bright, sunny day, and all of the seats were a dark green. And it
was the most beautiful thing that I ever saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grass was so green. The dirt was so brown. I remember the
reflection of the sun against the green seats, and I still get
chills.''
</P>
<P>
   As Kaline chats with a visitor, never has the late-afternoon
Michigan sky been so lovely. Seagulls glide through the upper deck.
Ernie Harwell delivers pretty words about his ``Tig-ehs'' over the
airwaves. This is Tiger Stadium, and all is well with the world.
</P>
<P>
   With apologies to Fenway Park, Tiger Stadium is the most magical
ballpark this side of Wrigley Field. They have played baseball at
the corner of Michigan and Trumbull avenues for 103 years,
including the last 88 seasons in Tiger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The place is so cozy, you nearly step onto the field when you
walk through the turnstiles. The distant seats, amongst the
seagulls, seem just a couple of arm-lengths from second base.
</P>
<P>
   The flagpole in center field sits in fair territory. When you're
on the infield, it is evident that the legend about home plate
leaning toward right field is true.
</P>
<P>
   A porch of seats hangs over the field in right. The light
standards along the roof could tell stories, none greater than the
one about the home run that Reggie Jackson blasted there during the
1971 All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   And Kaline, always Kaline. ``I've spent every summer here for 46
years now,'' says Kaline, 64, who played for 22 seasons and now is
color commentator for the Tigers' TV network. ``This place really
has been a major part of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaline was a perennial Gold Glove winner, noted for falling over
the low wall down the right-field line in pursuit of foul fly
balls. The fans called it ``Kaline's Corner,'' and the Tigers
removed several box seats from that area to keep their star player
from a premature death.
</P>
<P>
   Good thing, or Kaline wouldn't have been around to help the
Tigers soothe a riot-torn city in the fall of 1968, after they beat
the St. Louis Cardinals in a thrilling World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'll actually remember more is the day we clinched the
'68 pennant here,'' Kaline says. ``I'm looking around now, and I'm
sensing the presence of guys like Ty Cobb, Charlie Gehringer, Babe
Ruth, Hank Greenberg. It's great to know that you played on the
same field as those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   But this field of dreams is just weeks from its final memory.
Tiger Stadium will be replaced next year by one of those new-old
ballparks in the middle of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to televise the last game, and I just hope I can
get through it,'' Kaline says. ``I'm sure they'll have special
festivities. They'll bring back former players. So many teams. So
many guys who are no longer with us.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things will be going through my mind. I hope I'm not
too emotional, but I know I will be.''
</P>
<P>
   MEMORABLE MOMENTS
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 9, 1934: Enraged fans throw fruit, garbage and shoes at St.
Louis outfielder Joe Medwick after he spiked Tigers third baseman
Marv Owen in a World Series game. Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain
Landis has Medwick removed from the game for his safety.
</P>
<P>
   May 2, 1939: Lou Gehrig's streak of games played ends at 2,130.
</P>
<P>
   July 13, 1971: Six future Hall of Famers _ Johnny Bench, Hank
Aaron, Reggie Jackson, Frank Robinson, Harmon Killebrew and Roberto
Clemente _ homer during the AL's 6-4 All-Star Game victory.
</P>
<P>
   June 28, 1976: Pitcher Mark ``The Bird'' Fidrych thrills a
packed house by talking to the baseball on the mound during a
nationally televised victory over the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   July 8, 1941: Ted Williams ends the most dramatic All-Star Game
with a three-run homer in the bottom of the ninth inning, giving
the American League a 7-5 victory.
</P>
<P>
   TIGER STADIUM
</P>
<P>
   Opening day: April 20, 1912. The Tigers defeated the Cleveland
Indians 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   Location: The corner of Michigan and Trumbull avenues in
Detroit's Corktown neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Capacity: 46,945.
</P>
<P>
   Status: This season is Tiger Stadium's last. Next year, the team
will move into Comerica Park, an open-air stadium being built one
mile southeast of Tiger Stadium in Detroit's theater district.
</P>
<P>
   History lesson: They've played baseball on what is known as
``The Corner'' since 1896. The original structure was called
Bennett Park. The facility was reconstructed into its basic current
shape in 1912 and was named Navin Field the following year. It was
changed to Briggs Stadium after another expansion project in 1938
and to Tiger Stadium in 1961.

 &HT;    Wrigley: The only ancient ballpark that still works
 &HT;    By Terence Moore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the All-Star Game in Boston, and Ernie Banks loses his
smile for the first time ever. A guy just asked the Hall of Famer
if he thinks somebody will do the unthinkable some day by yanking
the ivy _ and everything else _ out of Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   Inquiring minds want to know. After all, most of baseball's
magic places of yore are gone or on the endangered list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they'll ever tear down Wrigley Field,'' Banks
says. ``It will withstand the test of time and the history of
baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, these are the final days of Tiger Stadium, and Fenway
Park is going the way of the British in New England. When they're
gone . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Wrigley would be the last of the great ballparks, wouldn't
it?'' Banks says, slowly regaining the happy face he owned during
19 seasons as Mr. Cub.
</P>
<P>
   Wrigley is the only ancient ballpark that still works, thanks to
renovation over the years. Former Cubs owner Philip K. Wrigley
replaced many of Wrigley's seats in the 1950s to angle them toward
home plate. The Tribune Company bought the Cubs in 1981 and have
added new clubhouses and luxury boxes. They also added lights in
1988 for a limited number of night games.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wrigley remains Wrigley. The concourses and the rows
between seats are strikingly wide for a place of Wrigley's age. The
hand-operated scoreboard in center field rises 27 feet and
stretches 75 feet wide. Fans watch games from rooftops of homes
just yards from the outfield. Sailboats glide along Lake Michigan.
The distinctive Chicago skyline can be seen everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   And the ivy is thick and green across the red bricks of
Wrigley's outfield walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been walking into that ballpark for 38 years,'' Banks
says, ``and it's better-looking now than it was when I played
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Williams agrees. Like Banks, Williams is a Hall of Famer,
and he spent 16 years at Wrigley after joining the Cubs in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, people didn't cherish Wrigley like they do
now,'' Williams says. ``When I first walked inside, it wasn't
nearly as beautiful as it would become. You had the old coal
furnaces. The dirt was black. It didn't seem as if the sun shined
that much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, you see all of the changes. It's not just the things on
the inside that attract people but things on the outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Street musicians play, the acts ranging from fancy saxophones to
a guy using tree limbs to beat a plastic garbage can. Old men on
bikes sell ice cream. Kids are everywhere. People talk Cubs
baseball until closing time at the many bars and restaurants nearly
as ancient as Wrigley's foundation. ``One of the great things about
Wrigley is that it is full of novelties, and that gives you so many
opportunities for different things to happen,'' says former
Phillies third baseman Mike Schmidt, who once hit four homers in a
game at Wrigley.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs announcer Chip Caray says, ``Wrigley is like walking back
into time. People like that. It's a sense of consistency in an era
of turmoil and uncertainty. Imagining Cub baseball without Wrigley
Field is like trying to imagine baseball without a bat.''
</P>
<P>
   MEMORABLE MOMENTS
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 1, 1932: Babe Ruth allegedly points toward the center-field
bleachers in Game 3 of the World Series, then slams the next pitch
from the Cubs' Charlie Root there for a homer.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 28, 1938: Gabby Hartnett's ``Homer in the Gloamin' ''
beats the Pirates and wins the pennant for the Cubs, just before
umpires would have called the game because of darkness.
</P>
<P>
   May 12, 1970: Ernie Banks slams his 500th career homer off
Atlanta's Pat Jarvis.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 8, 1985: Pete Rose raps his 4,191st career hit, which ties
him with Ty Cobb for the most in baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 9, 1988: Wrigley Field becomes the last team in the major
leagues to host a night game. Cubs win, beating the Mets 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   WRIGLEY FIELD
</P>
<P>
   Opening day: April 20, 1916. The Cubs beat the Cincinnati Reds
7-6 in 11 innings before a crowd that included a bear cub.
</P>
<P>
   Location: Corner of Clark and Addison streets on the north side
of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Capacity: 39,957.
</P>
<P>
   Status: Great. Given the improvements at Wrigley over the last
17 years, the ballpark is nearly as profitable as some of its
new-old counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   History lesson: Originally known as Weeghman Park, Wrigley Field
was built in 1914 as a home for Chicago's entry in the Federal
League. When the league folded after the 1915 season, owner Charles
H. Weeghman bought the Cubs and moved them into his two-year-old
ballpark. The stadium was renamed Cubs Park in 1920 after the
Wrigley family purchased the team, and the name was changed to
Wrigley Field in 1926 in honor of William Wrigley Jr.

 &HT;    Yankee Stadium has changed, but the ghosts remain
 &HT;    By Terence Moore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new Yankee Stadium isn't the old Yankee Stadium. For
decades, the House that Ruth Built featured a copper facade along
its majestic roof. This was long before they altered the ballpark
in the mid-1970s, lowering the playing field, shortening the
home-run distances in all but right field and adding escalator
towers.
</P>
<P>
   What didn't change was the ghosts.
</P>
<P>
   Next to Notre Dame Stadium, no American sports facility has more
ghosts than Yankee Stadium. They're everywhere, as prevalent on
that side of the Bronx as the monuments behind the left-field fence
to honor Henry Louis Gehrig, Miller James Huggins, Mickey Charles
Mantle, Joseph Paul DiMaggio and George Herman Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-one years later, Bobby Cox still tingles when he talks
about the first time he walked into Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my first year in the big leagues, and I was in the
starting lineup for the Yankees,'' the Braves' manager says. ``I'll
never forget how I got chills when they began to play the national
anthem.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had that old safe in the clubhouse, where Gehrig and Ruth
used to put their valuables. It was exactly the same safe. You knew
those great Yankee players went through that same door to the
clubhouse. The dugout was exactly the same, too. You just had the
feeling of what had taken place before. You felt the Yankee
mystique.''
</P>
<P>
   You still do. Underneath Yankee Stadium is a wonderful maze. A
series of tunnels take you to both clubhouses, various equipment
rooms and other places of mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Your heart pumps faster. You imagine those ghosts. Maybe this
dent in the floor came from Lou Gehrig's spikes. Did Babe Ruth
smoke cigars in that room over there? Which one of these door knobs
has Mickey Mantle's fingerprints?
</P>
<P>
   ``You really can't do that, because that area was redone during
the renovation,'' says Marty Appel, 51, a Yankee historian and
former public-relations director. Like Cox, Appel cherished the
Yankees' old safe. It dated to 1903, when the franchise was known
as the Highlanders. Its drawers featured the names of star players,
from Wee Willie Keeler to Jack Chesbro.
</P>
<P>
   Appel made it a personal mission to make sure the safe would be
preserved during renovation. But soon after the final game of the
1973 season, wrecking balls ripped into the stadium's sacred walls,
and Appel's worst fears were realized.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people I talked to about removing the safe forgot about
it,'' Appel said. ``The safe probably was destroyed. It's been 25
years. So, if somebody stole it, it would have shown up by now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry to say this, but you can't say that anything at
Yankee Stadium now is the way it was when Ruth and Gehrig played.''
</P>
<P>
   That sound you hear isn't Ruth or Gehrig flipping in their
graves. It is their ghosts, moaning as they walk unfamiliar
hallways in the new Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   MEMORABLE MOMENTS
</P>
<P>
   July 4, 1939: A dying Lou Gehrig tells the crowd, ``Today, I
consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 8, 1956: Don Larsen throws the only perfect game in World
Series history against the Brooklyn Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 1, 1961: Roger Maris' 61st homer breaks Babe Ruth's single
season record.
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 18, 1977: Reggie Jackson slams three home runs in Game 6 of
the World Series against the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   May 22, 1963: Mickey Mantle sends a pitch against the facade
above the third deck in right field. According to an engineer, the
shot could have reached 620 feet.
</P>
<P>
   YANKEE STADIUM
</P>
<P>
   Opening day: April 18, 1923. The Yankees beat the Boston Red Sox
4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Location: On 161st street at River Avenue in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Capacity: 57,768.
</P>
<P>
   Status: The Yankees have a lease through 2002, but owner George
Steinbrenner often threatens to move the team to New Jersey or
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   History lesson: Before Yankee Stadium opened, the Yankees shared
the Polo Grounds with the Giants for 10 years. When the Yankees
became more popular than the Giants, as Babe Ruth started to grab
the nation's attention, Giants manager John McGraw told the Polo
Grounds' other tenant to get lost.

 &HT;    Rex White: A modest racing legend
 &HT;    By Al Levine

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Rex White lives a quiet, humble life in Forest Park,
Ga. He has a house trailer a few blocks from his job at a trucking
company, where at age 70 he works seven days a week from 5:45 a.m.
until nearly 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Work is good for you, no matter how old you are,'' White said.
``If you sit around and feel sorry for yourself, you're gonna hurt;
you're gonna ache.''
</P>
<P>
   It is incongruous: A former NASCAR champion now drives a fork
lift that can't go faster than 15 mph. But White, who speaks with a
Southern-fried drawl, prefers life in the slow lane now.
</P>
<P>
   When White filled out an application at Jones Transportation, he
didn't list his racing career under ``previous employment.'' Just
mentioned that he had owned his own truck. Many of his 30
co-workers didn't learn of his accomplishments until last year,
when NASCAR named White one of the 50 greatest drivers. He is not
one to brag about his 1960 Grand National (later Winston Cup)
championship, the most popular driver award he got that year or
some of his impressive racing statistics, including 110 top-five
finishes in 233 career starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is such a quiet man,'' his boss, Ed Whitworth, said. ``His
background came out in little pieces. Whenever the guys would be
talking about racing, Rex would say something that gave us the idea
he had been involved.''
</P>
<P>
   When the picture of the top 50 drivers arrived from NASCAR,
Whitworth asked if he could frame it and hang it in his office.
``Rex said, `Sure,' without hesitation,'' Whitworth said. ``His
wife is dead; his daughter is dead; we're his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I would bet that if someone came in and offered him a
million dollars for the picture, and I said, `Remember, Rex, you
said I could have it,' he'd tell them it wasn't for sale. He's that
kind of guy. If you called him at midnight and said you had a flat
tire, he'd be right there to fix it. But if you called him at
midnight and said you wanted him to come out for a beer with a
bunch of other stock-car drivers, he'd hang up on you; he just
doesn't want that kind of exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   So when NASCAR invited White to Daytona Beach, Fla., as part of
its 50th anniversary celebration last year, he respectfully
declined. It meant he probably would be under the spotlight,
probably would have to wear a suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``That ain't me,'' he said. ``I didn't go at all. Everybody
started to hop on it, wanting to get me dressed, wanting to take me
to Daytona and do different things. Finally, I told 'em, `I ain't
even gonna go.' . . . I wasn't up for buying clothes, getting
dressed up, going down there and getting in all that mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Unrecognized at AMS
</P>
<P>
   A dozen years ago, White decided he would like to attend a race
at Atlanta Motor Speedway and called someone at the track for a
pass. He was told that he would have to pick up the credential at
the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went down there, went to where the people pick up their
press passes and told this woman my name,'' he said. ``She said,
`I'm sorry. You have to apply two weeks in advance to get 'em.'
When she said that, well, I just left.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't make a fuss about it, but Neil Bonnett, now deceased,
heard about the incident, told the track employee about White and
sent the highway patrol to find him and give him his pass.
</P>
<P>
   White didn't go unnoticed when he won the 1960 championship, and
he was unprepared for all the attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning that championship was like becoming a movie star,''
White said. ``Everybody's wanting your autograph; everybody's
wanting to talk to you on the phone. You can't have a telephone.
You can't go nowhere; you can't do nuthin'. Being Jeff Gordon,
that's a tough job.''
</P>
<P>
   He even dressed up to receive his award.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to Daytona to be at the dinner, a lot of people
had even come down there in T-shirts to collect their awards,''
White said. ``Everybody that participated in my crew, even if they
didn't get paid nuthin', I bought 'em all suits.''
</P>
<P>
   White prefers his low-key life, with few reminders of his racing
career. He can't remember when he sold his race cars. ``I did my
racing stuff just like I do everything else; when I'm done with it,
I get rid of it.''
</P>
<P>
   He never made huge paydays in racing. ``When I won the
championship in 1960, what I collected at Daytona was $13,500,'' he
said. ``In my whole racing career, I think they got me down winning
only $85,000. I don't think that includes the old style modifieds _
just in Winston Cup or Grand National. All together, it might have
been over $100,000, I forget. But it wasn't much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Didn't get rich racing. I probably got more money right now
than in any time in my racing career. I know I have, in the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   He was in the parts business once and regrets not staying in it.
``For some reason or other, my hindsight has always been better
than my foresight,'' he said. ``And I ain't never had a lot of
foresight, really. I don't think about things; I just do 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Overcame childhood polio
</P>
<P>
   Not that he regrets having to work at his age.
</P>
<P>
   His consolation is that he did pretty well for a kid with polio.
White was stricken when he was 11. ``One leg is shorter than the
other,'' he said. ``I don't have any leg hardly at all on my right
leg; there ain't nothin' but bone. There's certain things with the
throttle I had to do to make it so my crippled foot could work it.
You'd jump in somebody else's race car, and if it wasn't fixed up
it makes it tough. Can't do it like everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   White grew up in Taylorsville, N.C.,destined to be a race
driver. ``It's 15 miles from North Wilkesboro. Alexander Wilkes
County was the bootleg capital of the United States, of making
white liquor. Everybody hauled it; everybody sold it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This revenuer comes into town, and he asks this guy on the
sidewalk, `Where can you buy some white liquor?' He said, `You see
that building over there. That's the post office. That's the only
place in town you can't buy it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up around a lot of fast cars,'' White said. ``I never
hauled an ounce of liquor in my life. I've rode with guys hauling
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1941, at age 12, he was helping deliver chickens to Maryland,
without a driver's license. Seven years later, while working at a
gas station, he decided to become a racer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to race sometimes six times in one week, twice on
Sunday,'' White said. ``In New Jersey and Pennsylvania, there's
race tracks everywhere. We lived in the car, just went race track
to race track, slept in the car. Took baths in the creek. There
were no such things as motels.''
</P>
<P>
   Racing under two names
</P>
<P>
   By 1954, at age 25, he was running in NASCAR events. ``If you
joined NASCAR, you can't run no other car,'' White said. But
Manassas, Va., had two tracks. He won on Friday night, then ran at
the other track on Saturday under an assumed name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran as Johnny Nalon,'' White said, ``and won the race. They
had a race driver at Indianapolis called Duke Nalon, and that's
where I got the name. They published it in the paper. So I went to
Marlboro Raceway and I won on Sunday. I run down there under Johnny
Nalon also. The sportswriters would come up to me and say, `Who are
you tonight?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, he was hired by General Motors as a
short-track specialist.
</P>
<P>
   He won his only points title in 1960 and was well on his way to
repeating when he was penalized for altering the position of his
engine. He said Ned Jarrett, whom he had helped get a Chevrolet
ride, and another driver for whom he'd built a car, Emanuel
Zervakis, turned him in to officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``To start with, it was somethin' picky. It didn't mean nuthin'.
It didn't change nuthin'. It didn't make me win or lose,'' White
said. ``In the rear cross-member in the Chevrolet, there's two bolt
holes that hold the rear motor mount. . . . I didn't change
nuthin'. All I did was slide the engine to the back of the bolt
hole, about three-quarters of an inch.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Darlington, they complained about it, which would have been
fine. We had to go there a week for inspections. . . .Norris Field
was the head inspector for NASCAR and he waited 'til Sunday morning
to tell me I was disqualified. I couldn't fix the car. I started a
car for Jack Smith, but I couldn't do no good with it and finished
dead last. That race would have won the championship for me the
second time.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett won the 1961 title, by 830 points. ``It don't bother me
that much,'' White said. ``If he wants to be that way, that's fine.
I still outrun him more times than he ever outrun me.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Jarrett, a TV commentator, saw White at
Talladega and approached him for an interview. White declined. ``It
is still a sore spot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Short and with a grin that resembled that of George Gobel, a
corny comedian of the day, White was admired for his natural feel
for a car and the way he set up a chassis. Old-timers still kid
about his difficulty getting a driver's license in South Carolina.
Unlike most states, you had to have a regular street license to
race there, and White had trouble parallel parking. But it has been
years since he's seen any of the old gang. Maybe, he has started to
think, it's time. ``I might go to that old-timer's banquet in
Daytona next year,'' White said. ``I just may buy me a . . . suit
and go on down there.''

 &HT;    Martino aims at Games comeback
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILLEDGEVILLE, Ga. _ The Martino family has your typical
backyard pool: just big enough to splash around in, with a diving
board and some lounge chairs.
</P>
<P>
   The Martinos also have what might be the world's most atypical
backyard pool: 50 meters long, two lanes wide and erected above the
ground so that from the side it looks like a marooned barge.
</P>
<P>
   That, pool, which holds 84,000 gallons, could accommodate the
whole neighborhood, but only one person swims in it. That's
stay-at-home mom Angel, who happens to be the Olympian next door.
</P>
<P>
   After winning six Olympic medals _ a gold and a bronze in
Barcelona; two golds and two bronzes in Atlanta _ having a baby and
taking nearly three years off, Martino, 32, is back in the swim for
next year's Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's just in my blood,'' said Martino, who at age 29
in Atlanta became the oldest female to win a gold medal in
swimming. ``(Husband) Mike and I miss it; we check all the results.
This is it. At my age, I'm already pushing the envelope as far as
physiology.''
</P>
<P>
   Martino began her comeback _ although she never officially
retired _ about six months ago. She had no plans to swim when they
moved to Milledgeville two years ago so Mike could become an
assistant professor in health sciences at Georgia College and State
University. But after seeing the results from last year's spring
nationals, Martino said, ``It was worth giving it a try.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a 50-meter pool in Milledgeville was ``a major
obstacle,'' however. Martino had to commute four hours round-trip
to her hometown of Americus, two hours round-trip to Athens or swim
in a smaller local pool.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare properly for Australia, she needed the right place to
train, the closer to home the better to care for 2-year-old
Michael.
</P>
<P>
   New sponsors pitched in for a pool that Mike Martino estimates
would have cost $50,000-$60,000. Splash Super Pools donated the
structure, Sta-Rite the filters and pumps and Magnetizer the
chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're lucky we live in a small town, or we wouldn't be able to
have a big enough yard to do it,'' said Mike Martino, who maintains
the pool and coaches his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Fountains cool the pool in the summer, and heaters will be
installed this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Each morning, Angel opens the back door and crosses the yard
while dew is still on the grass. When she goes inside at 8:30 a.m.
after her two-hour workout, Michael has just awakened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll come in wet, and he'll be like, `Swimming?' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The new pool was ready only a week before the U.S. National
Championships in Minneapolis. Representing Georgia Coastal, Martino
placed 12th in the 100-meter freestyle, but her time of 57.43
seconds qualified for next year's Olympic Trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just getting started,'' said Martino, whose immediate goal
is to transform five pounds of fat into five pounds of muscle.
``I'm in it for the long haul. I've been there before, and I know
what it takes. I'm willing to do that for the next year. I think I
have just as good a shot as anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, she's less ambitious this go-round.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to make the relay,'' said Martino, who would have
to place in the top six in the 100 freestyle, ``and if I make the
individual (event), of course, I'd be more than thrilled.''
</P>
<P>
   However, if Martino isn't in the 100 freestyle, she finally
would be able to go to Opening Ceremonies, which were off-limits
when she had to swim the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't enjoyed an Olympic experience, really, like it was
meant to be,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Martino, then Angel Myers, qualified for her first Olympics in
1988 by winning three events in the Trials, but she was removed
from the team after a positive drug test. Her family argued
unsuccessfully that the test showed metabolized birth-control
pills. Years later, Mike Martino still finds evidence supporting
the claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter now _ I'm so far removed from all that,''
Angel said. ``I think I've proven myself over the last two
Olympics. I've put in the time, gone faster and faster. I guess
that's all I needed to say.''
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, Martino made the the humanitarian gesture of the '96
Games when she presented her first bronze medal to friend Trisha
Henry, a volunteer who was battling cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's doing great,'' said Martino, who visited Henry at the
University of Illinois a few months ago to present her with a
spirit award.
</P>
<P>
   Martino also found out months after the Olympics that she should
have had another bronze: an official told her that bronze-medalist
Sandra Volker of Germany had false-started in the 50 free but the
race was allowed to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you know, I think I have enough medals,'' Martino said.
``I'm not swimming to get another medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, I just want to see if it's possible. It's a challenge
to see if it's possible to come back after all that time off and
having a baby and at this age.''
</P>
<P>
   Martino admits to being a little more tired than she remembers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of that has to do with having to keep up with
Michael in between,'' she said. ``People who are seriously doing
this, all they do is train and rest.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Operation Olympics is as temporary as the backyard
pool. Some members of the local Milledgeville swim team will join
Martino next summer, getting used to a pool that could be theirs
eventually.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to take it down after next summer,'' Martino said,
``and probably just donate it to the team here.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the little pool will suffice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to jump in that pool for fun,'' Martino said. ``Now,
that's the last thing I want to do.''

BOMB KILLS AT LEAST 4 IN DIPLOMATIC QUARTER OF YEMENI CAPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANA, Yemen _ A powerful car bomb that exploded early Saturday
in a diplomatic quarter of the Yemeni capital killed several
people, sparked a fire that gutted a supermarket used by the city's
foreign residents and severely damaged several diplomatic
buildings, including the Turkish Embassy and the French
ambassador's residence.
</P>
<P>
   Early indications were that no diplomats or foreign aid workers
were among the dead and seriously wounded, although many appeared
to have narrow escapes. A U.N. official said some staff members
living in the area woke to find windows shattered and doors askew.
The U.S. Embassy, situated several miles from the blast, was not
affected, although officials there reported hearing the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen hours after the 2 a.m. blast, government officials said
four people had died, and possibly several others, with a total
death toll that could rise as high as 10. The officials said the
confirmed dead included four Yemenis, including a guard at the City
Center supermarket, which appeared to have been the main target of
the attack, and a resident living nearby. A guard at the offices of
Canadian Occidental Petroleum, one of many foreign-owned companies
in the area, was also killed.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, at least two other, minor bombings were reported
elsewhere in this nation of 16 million people, which is still
struggling with the aftereffects of a 1994 civil war and with other
tensions, including sporadic violence by a radical Islamic group
known as the Islamic Army. Earlier this month, an appeals court
upheld a death sentence on the leader of the Islamic militants, Abu
al-Hassan al-Mirdar, who has threatened reprisals by his followers
if the sentence is carried out.
</P>
<P>
   In the southern port city of Aden, a blast that was detonated
before the Sana explosion slightly damaged the local headquarters
of the state-owned National Bank but apparently caused no injuries.
In Zinjibar, a town near Aden where Mirdar was tried, residents
reported another blast in front of the prosecutor's office, again
with no reported casualties. Officials in Sana, who claimed to have
arrested several suspects in the blast there, said it was unclear
whether there was any link between the explosions.
</P>
<P>
   A Cabinet minister, speaking privately, said the fact that the
blasts were detonated at night suggested that they had been
intended mainly as warnings and not as means of causing large
numbers of casualties. ``If the bomb outside the supermarket had
been detonated in daylight, we'd have had dozens of casualties,
possibly more,'' he said. ``It could have been a warning.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But officials acknowledged that the placing of the bomb outside
a supermarket used by diplomats and aid workers, including dozens
of Americans, was probably not coincidental. Foreigners have been
advised to increase security precautions in recent months in the
wake of heightened tensions between the government of President Ali
Abdullah Saleh and militant opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the unrest has been among discontented tribal groups
that have taken foreigners hostage to press demands for more
government spending. A spate of recent attacks has severely reduced
tourism, which had become an important income source here.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, hostages are released unharmed. But in December, the
Islamic Army kidnapped 16 tourists on a desert highway. In an
ensuing shootout with government forces, four tourists died,
including two Britons.

EARTHQUAKE MOVES TURKEY CLOSER TO EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: SUBS lede to fix time element, quake was Aug. 17, sted last
week.) 
(lh) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ When seismologists reviewed data from the
devastating earthquake in Turkey, they made a remarkable discovery.
The force of the quake appears to have pushed Turkey about 4 feet
closer to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Due to steady pressures beneath Turkish soil, the country had
already been moving westward at a rate of about one-tenth of an
inch per year. The shock of the earthquake produced a sudden
acceleration in that movement.
</P>
<P>
   More significant, though, has been the fact that since the Aug.
17 quake, Turkey and Europe have moved closer not just
geologically, but also politically and psychologically.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every European country has rushed to send relief aid to
Turkey. The most recent was Sweden, which announced on Friday that
it would contribute $4.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union sent $3.8 million in emergency humanitarian
aid last week and has announced that it will allocate another $41.8
million to build housing for survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Private fund raising in Europe has also been remarkably
successful. A two-hour television appeal in Germany raised $7
million, and a similar campaign in the Netherlands produced $13
million.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts are under way to convert this wave of sympathy into a
permanent policy change that could help heal the breach between
Turkey and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac of France has sent a letter to leaders
of the other 14 member states of the European Union urging that the
union take this opportunity to develop a ``new strategy'' for
dealing with Turkey. Responses in may capitals were favorable,
suggesting that the 2-year-old freeze in dialogue between Turkey
and Europe may soon end.
</P>
<P>
   The freeze began after the European Union decided in December
1997 to exclude Turkey from the group of countries negotiating for
European Union membership. Although full membership for Turkey is
still a distant prospect, the tone of statements from both sides
has become much warmer since the quake.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most significant has been the change in the attitude of
Greece, which for years has blocked hundreds of millions of dollars
in European Union funds earmarked for Turkey. Greece offered quick
and generous aid to earthquake victims, and many ordinary Greeks
joined government leaders in suggesting that this might be an ideal
moment for the two historic rivals to move toward friendship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this disaster will mark the start of peaceful
coexistence between our two nations,'' Mayor Dimitris Avramopoulos
of Athens said during a visit to Istanbul this week. ``Chasms
opened by the earthquake can also lead to new roads.''
</P>
<P>
   A visit by the mayor of Greece's biggest city to Turkey's
biggest city would have been all but unthinkable before the
earthquake. It symbolized the sudden warming in ties between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
   There are reports that Greece will make a more substantial
gesture toward Turkey next month, when European Union foreign
ministers meet in Helsinki. Greek leaders are reportedly discussing
either lifting their veto of European Union funds that have been
earmarked for Turkey, or proposing a generous aid package for
reconstruction in the earthquake zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope this tragedy can increase understanding between Turkey
and the EU, and that some of the funds that have been held could be
released,'' Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen of Finland, which holds
the rotating presidency of the European Union, said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Among Turkish leaders who welcomed recent gestures from Greece
was Mesut Yilmaz, who as prime minister in 1997 ordered the freeze
on political dialogue with Europe. He said he hoped the new warmth
between the two countries would quickly be translated into
``general government policy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Turkey and Greece will be neighbors forever,'' Yilmaz said in
a televised interview. ``There are no problems that cannot be
solved, no fields than cannot be shared.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe solutions can be found to the Cyprus problem and the
Aegean problem as long as the two sides don't always try to get the
upper hand,'' he said. ``I see this as an improvement that is not
temporary, but permanent.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even more surprising than the welcome given to Greek
relief workers here was the welcome given to three doctors from
Cyprus. The three had at first hesitated to leave Istanbul, fearing
that as representatives of the pro-Greek government on Cyprus, they
would be reviled and perhaps attacked. But they put aside their
fears, traveled to the earthquake zone, and later said they were
overwhelmed by the kisses and embraces with which Turks greeted
them.
</P>
<P>
   Even Armenia, whose relations with Turkey have been even
frostier than Greece's, extended a hand of friendship after the
earthquake. After some hesitation in both countries, including a
statement by Turkey's right-wing minister of health that Turks
should not accept aid from such a historic enemy, Armenia on Friday
sent a plane load of aid.
</P>
<P>
   Although neither Cyprus nor Armenia are members of the European
Union, they have lobbied hard against Turkish efforts to win
acceptance in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   With the euphoria with which many Turks and Europeans are
greeting news of their reconciliation, there have been some words
of caution. Issues that have divided the two sides for years,
including European complaints about human-rights abuses in Turkey,
have faded from the limelight but still have not been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Tunca Toskay, a minister without portfolio in the Turkish
government, warned that Turkey would not accept aid from Europe if
it is conditioned on changes in Turkish domestic policy. ``We will
break the half-loaves of bread that we have into fourths, and
refuse that kind of aid,'' he asserted.
</P>
<P>
   The next sign of Turkey's new-found friendship with Europe may
come on Thursday, when the Greek soccer team PAOK Salonika will
face the Istanbul team Galatasaray in a hastily arranged match. All
profits are to be donated to an earthquake relief fund.

ATHLETES MAKE THE LEAP OVER NATIONAL BORDERS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SEVILLE, Spain _ Eunice Barber stood happily on the medal podium
last week with gold around her neck after winning the heptathlon
and sneaked self-conscious peeks at her image on the giant-screen
television as La Marseillaise, France's national anthem, played
over the loudspeakers. One day later, Niurka Montalvo stood on the
same podium with the same color medal after her victory in the long
jump and listened to the Spanish anthem.
</P>
<P>
   Both Barber and Montalvo had grown up imagining such a moment,
but neither had grown up imagining it would be accompanied by the
music they heard last week in Seville.
</P>
<P>
   Barber is from the tiny west African nation of Sierra Leone;
Montalvo from Cuba, and until this year, neither was competing for
France or Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Barber became a French citizen in February; Montalvo became a
Spanish citizen in May, and they are just the two most recent and
salient examples of the burgeoning hyphenation in track and field
and sport. Montalvo is a Cuban-born Spaniard. Fiona May, who
unhappily finished second to her in the long jump at this world
championship meet, is a British-born Italian.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson Kipketer, the reigning men's 800-meter champion, is a
Kenyan-born Dane. Ludmila Engquist, the hurdler who has shrugged
off chemotherapy to compete here, is a Russian-born Swede.
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes in an increasingly fluid, post-Cold War world
where borders are often not barriers to those with the potential to
answer the demand for higher, faster, stronger.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of Chinese competing in table tennis for other
nations; hundreds of athletes who grew up in the former Soviet
Union competing in myriad sports for other more economically
affluent and politically stable nations such as Australia, France,
Germany and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, all three of the medalists in the men's pole vault
were born and raised in one of the republics of the former Soviet
Union, and only the champion Maksim Tarasov still represents one of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Silver medalist Dmitri Markov, formerly of Belarus, is now an
Australian. Bronze medalist Aleksander Averbukh, formerly of
Russia, is now an Israeli, and it is telling that Tarasov does not
live in Moscow or St. Petersburg or any other Russian city. He
lives and trains in Budapest and does not rule out switching
nationalities himself if financial and moral support for sport in
Russia continues to deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things in sport are getting worse and worse in Russia: that's
my feeling,'' he said last week. ``They only care about politics,
the president and how bad the economy is, nothing else.''
</P>
<P>
   But if and when Tarasov decides to change national teams along
with his address, it will not be as straightforward for him as it
was for his peripatetic predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   After years of relative laxity, in which the International
Amateur Athletic Federation required athletes only to reside in a
country to be eligible to represent it, the organization voted last
Thursday that athletes must be full-fledged citizens of their new
nations to switch.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have competed previously in Olympics or world
championships for their former nation must wait three years from
their last participation before they can represent their new
country. If both countries agree, that waiting period can be cut to
one year.
</P>
<P>
   The vote brings the IAAF into line with International Olympic
Committee rules, which has long had stricter regulations about
national allegiances, but not quite in line with soccer's governing
body, FIFA, which does not allow a player to change nations at all
after he or she has represented one.
</P>
<P>
   Some migrants move for love, like May, who switched allegiances
after marrying Italian pole vaulter Gianni Iapichino; or Li
Donghua, a Chinese men's gymnast who married a Swiss tourist he met
near Tiananmen Square and won a gold medal in the pommel horse for
Switzerland in the 1996 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Some move for marketing, like former Canadian hurdler Mark
McCoy, the 110-meter Olympic champion in 1992 who later became an
Austrian because his agent, Robert Wagner, felt there were better
business opportunities there.
</P>
<P>
   Some even move because they want to compete: Kareem
Streete-Thompson, who competed in the long jump for the United
States at the 1992 Olympics, is now sprinting and jumping for the
Cayman Islands, the nation where he spent the first 18 years of his
life and where there is no Maurice Greene to worry about in the
national championships.
</P>
<P>
   But the majority of the migrants make the switch in search of a
better life and better training conditions, and most of them follow
the now-traditional flow from the third world to the developed
world.
</P>
<P>
   It might come as a surprise to know that Montalvo and May were
not the only long jumpers who merit a hyphen. Marion Jones, the
American superstar, has double nationality: her mother comes from
Belize. And though she once debated representing that small Central
American nation in her mid-teens, the odds are now much longer than
her jumps that she will be wearing anything other than ``USA'' on
her jersey in world championships and Olympics.

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ With New York's public-assistance rolls at their
lowest in more than a generation, the state has built up a $762
million surplus in federal welfare money over the last three years,
spurring a fierce debate over how best to spend it.
</P>
<P>
   The administration of Gov. George E. Pataki is determined to set
aside some of the money in a reserve fund to provide a cushion for
the next economic downturn, when the welfare rolls will most likely
grow again. But advocates for the poor say that more money should
be spent on job training, transportation, child care and other
programs that would help make the transition from welfare to work
permanent for recipients.
</P>
<P>
   The surplus is largely the result of widespread changes that the
federal government made to its welfare program in 1996. Under those
changes, the government stopped paying states according to the
number of welfare recipients they have on their rolls. Rather, the
government now gives states an annual allocation based on previous
years when their welfare caseloads were high _ and before a booming
economy and stiffer eligibility requirements pushed hundreds of
thousands off the rolls.
</P>
<P>
   The new welfare law allows states to carry over the unspent
portion of their grant from one year to another. But unlike New
York, other states in the metropolitan region have either spent all
their federal welfare money or say they plan to do so.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey, for example, has received $751 million since the new
welfare law was enacted in 1996. By the end of last year, it had
$242 million left in a federal account, or roughly 32 percent of
its total grant. But state officials there say they have plans to
spend the entire reserve on various programs for the poor, such as
expanding child-care for low-income workers.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, state officials have spent all $590 million they
have received since 1996, making the state one of just five that
have used all their federal money. The other four are Illinois,
Nevada, Delaware and Maine.
</P>
<P>
   New York has spent 85 percent of the welfare money it has
received since 1996, but $762 million remained in its federal
account at the end of 1998. New York officials point out that about
$260 million of that reserve has been earmarked for new programs
like an expansion of child-care subsidies for the poor.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Like other states, New York contends that the number of people
on welfare had dropped much faster than it expected, making it
difficult for the state to use all the federal money it was
entitled to. That said, state social service officials point out
that the state continues to make large investments in anti-poverty
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the budget that was recently approved by Pataki and the
Legislature includes a $125 million expansion of a tax credit for
1.1 million low-wage workers. The budget also nearly doubled the
amount that the state spends to subsidize child care for low-income
working parents, to $839 million this year from $460 million last
year.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, officials say, the state has been able to
accomplish two other important goals: providing additional money to
local governments so ey can reduce the amount they spend on
services to the poor and establishing a reserve fund to increase
benefits during an economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a prudent use of the money,'' said John Madden, a
spokesman for the state's Office of Temporary and Disability
Assistance. As it is, he added, ``New York state spends more than
$6 million a day on services for people on public assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   But advocates for the poor say the state is squandering an
opportunity to invest in programs aimed at helping recipients enter
the work force. They say that such investments are particularly
important now that the state and federal governments have set
strict limits on the amount of time people are allowed to receive
cash assistance under the welfare program.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Erickson, the legislative coordinator for the Greater
Upstate Law project, an advocacy group for the poor, was pleased
that the state had made some investments in expanding child care
and tax credits for the poor. But, she says, she is troubled that
the state is using much of its money _ about $1 billion by the
state's estimates _ to help counties reduce the amount they spend
on poverty programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``These funds were intended to help the poor make a solid
transition to employment,'' Ms. Erickson said. ``By investing it in
fiscal relief for local governments, the state is clearly missing
an opportunity to make long-term improvements in the lives of poor
people.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Critics of the watershed welfare law of 1996
forecast any number of problems, from starving children to
dwindling benefits to Depression-era soup lines. But virtually no
one imagined the strange new condition startling the experts coast
to coast: States have more federal money, literally, than they know
how to spend.
</P>
<P>
   That is because the welfare rolls have dropped dramatically
while federal financing remains, by law, fixed at historic highs.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Wisconsin's version of the new welfare math. Five years
ago, the state received about $317 million from the federal
government _ or $4,100 for each family on the rolls. Last year, the
state still got $317 million, even though its rolls had fallen more
than 80 percent. That pushed the federal aid to nearly $22,000 per
case, and with the rolls still shrinking this year it may grow to
$35,000 per case _ a bit more than the cost of a year at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Awash in federal dollars, the state has raised its welfare
benefits 20 percent, created thousands of subsidized jobs, and
offered poor women door-to-door rides to mandatory motivation
classes. It has also used the money to bring new support to needy
families outside the welfare rolls, as the federal law permits _
offering them child care, car loans, counselors, and annual cash
bonuses of up to $1,600.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wisconsin had enough federal anti-poverty money left over
to shift more than $100 million, through some creative accounting,
into a tax cut for the decidedly nonpoor.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Idaho and Wyoming have let their millions gather
dust as their safety nets for the poor contract. Mississippi and
Texas made modest increases in their notoriously low benefits.
</P>
<P>
   New York is increasing the wage supplements it offers low-wage
workers. But it has also used $1 billion of its federal welfare
money simply to sustain existing programs it once financed itself _
a trade that frees state and local dollars but offers no new
services to the poor. While many states have pursued similar
budgetary swaps, few have done so as brazenly as Minnesota, where
Gov. Jesse Ventura of the Reform Party drew arrows in his budget
and spelled out the goal: ``Replace state spending with federal
dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   This flood of federal dollars has created a rare, perhaps even
unprecedented, moment of opportunity in programs for the poor. And
it is almost wholly an unintended one _ a rich new financing stream
for anti-poverty efforts created by the most conservative Congress
in a generation.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to revamp welfare and restrain its costs, a newly
Republican House and Senate reached a grand bargain three years ago
with the nation's governors. The states got new flexibility to run
welfare programs as they choose. In exchange, they accepted five
years of flat federal financing. In the phrase of the time, the
governors, predominantly Republicans themselves, promised to do
more with less.
</P>
<P>
   Instead they wound up with more _ much more, on a per-case basis
_ than anyone predicted as a combination of a strong economy and
tough new rules have pushed welfare rolls to stunning lows. Last
year alone, federal payments to the states were $6 billion higher
than they would have been under the old law, when falling caseloads
meant smaller subsidies. Now in another twist, there is an
intramural Republican dispute between congressional leaders who
want to reduce the windfall and conservative governors who,
protecting their budgets, find themselves in the unusual posture of
championing welfare money.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, the new financing is altering anti-poverty
assumptions in surprising ways. It has created the potential for
new services in pockets of poverty long starved for cash and helped
Florida find a prominent new place among the nation's innovators.
It has left a startling financial imbalance across the
Wisconsin-Illinois border, where welfare disputes have long raged.
It has defined a new Western Mountain regionalism, from Idaho to
New Mexico, where federal financing has brought new bounty but
state services are notably few.
</P>
<P>
   With vast new freedom to use the money as they see fit, states
can intensify services for those left on welfare or extend a new
hand to the working poor, buy drug treatment in the inner city or
build bus lines to job-rich suburbs. But much of this opportunity
is passing by unseized, according to an analysis of state spending
records conducted by The New York Times. While some of the windfall
has brought some new services, at times in the innovative ways
predicted by the proponents of state control, nearly a quarter of
the federal money awarded to date remains unspent.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves a pool of idle anti-poverty money totaling more than
$7 billion, a figure that current trends would push to $22 billion
by 2002 when the welfare law expires. And billions more of the
federal grants has merely replaced state spending, bringing no new
benefits or services to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, progress against poverty cannot be measured solely by
the number of federal dollars spent. Some states have deliberately
created reserves, exercising what they say is appropriate caution
in case of economic downturns; others have squandered new
opportunities through inertia and political infighting. Many say
the unspent money is not as idle as it looks, arguing that large
portions have been earmarked for programs still being developed.
Still the magnitude of the surpluses are commanding increased
attention.
</P>
<P>
   The Times analysis is based on the quarterly financial reports
each state must file with the federal Department of Health and
Human Services; interviews with state officials; and an in-depth
look at three states with markedly different experiences. The
financial reports cover state spending through the end of last
year, the most recent time period available.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis reveals:
</P>
<P>
   _ On average, the federal government now awards states 64
percent more per family than it did five years ago, before the new
law took effect. In 1994, the average federal subsidy per family
was about $3,200 a year. Last year, with the same amount of money
but far fewer people on the rolls, the average subsidy rose to
nearly $5,300 a year. While the money can be spent on any needy
family _ not just those on welfare _ the magnitude of the increase
is a measure of the new opportunity states have to expand
anti-poverty programs.
</P>
<P>
   In 12 states, the federal payment per case more than doubled.
Six of those states are in the South, creating the potential _ as
yet little-realized _ to significantly expand new services in some
of the nation's poorest regions.
</P>
<P>
   In Mississippi, the nation's second-poorest state, the federal
payment per family rose 158 percent, to nearly $3,800 a year. In
Louisiana, the third-poorest state, the payment rose 86 percent, to
just over $3,500.
</P>
<P>
   Even the states with the smallest federal subsidies per family
received a 1998 payment higher than the previous national average.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   _ While every state has seen its federal subsidy grow, the
politically volatile disparities between the states have grown as
well. That increases the likelihood of bitter new fights in 2002
when the current financing formula expires.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the states with the largest subsidy, New York and
Alaska, received about $5,000 per case, while the state with the
smallest subsidy, Mississippi, received about $1,460. That is a
ratio of just over 3-to-1. Federal financing at the time was based
on a complex formula that took into account how poor a state was
and how much of its own money it spent on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with each state's rolls declining at a different pace,
those differences have grown even more exaggerated. By last year
the state with the highest subsidy, Wisconsin, received $21,600 per
case. That is nearly six times the amount the government sends to
its neighbor, Illinois, which received the lowest payment, $3,400 a
case.
</P>
<P>
   Financing emerged as one of the most divisive issues during the
congressional debate over the 1996 law. States with lesser
subsidies brought the process to a halt when they demanded _ and
eventually received _ more money.
</P>
<P>
   _ Much of the windfall has failed to translate into new benefits
or services for the needy. Though federal subsidies for each family
have risen by 64 percent, the rise in actual spending has been much
more modest _ just 28 percent, when total spending is divided by
the caseload.
</P>
<P>
   That is because significant federal sums are going unspent, and
others are being used merely to replace previous state spending.
With federal financing fixed, states cut their own spending last
year by 21 percent or nearly $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Examine the math in Pennsylvania. Last year, the state received
$257 million more than it would have gotten under the old system.
But it left $158 million of the federal money unspent, and it
reduced its own welfare spending by $109 million. The state's
federal subsidy per family rose 56 percent. But its actual
spending, when divided by its caseload, rose much more modestly, by
23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ The states slowest to spend the anti-poverty dollars include
some of the neediest. By the end of last year, New Mexico, the
poorest state, had spent just 69 percent of the money awarded to
date. Mississippi and Louisiana, the next two poorest, spent 61
percent and 63 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   On average, by the end of last year, states had spent 78 percent
of the $34 billion awarded since the new law took hold. Wyoming and
Idaho are are, by far, the most reluctant to use the federal money,
spending 9 percent and 12 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen states had accumulated more than $100 million in
unspent anti-poverty money. They include Texas ($326 million),
Tennessee ($169 million) and Louisiana ($122 million) _ all home to
infamous stretches of entrenched poverty.
</P>
<P>
   At most these ledgers can offer a limited look at the poor. They
measure what states are spending _ not what states are spending on
or whether their spending is effective. They make no distinction
between the $14 million Mississippi spent to raise welfare payments
and the $35 million it spent on new computers for state officials.
(The Mississippi benefit is now $170 a month for a family of three,
a raise of $50.)
</P>
<P>
   No one knows whether new spending will reduce poverty, as
advocates hope, or increase waste and dependency, as critics of
social spending fear. And if states have more money per case, that
is only because the caseloads keep shrinking _ that is the the
central development of the new welfare age, and it can signal
either new progress (for those with jobs) or new distress (for
those merely dropped from the rolls).
</P>
<P>
   As of March, the nation's welfare rolls had dropped 47 percent
from the 1994 peak and in six states they dropped more than 70
percent. Eyeing such numbers, some members of Congress argue that
states now have more money than they need, and they are talking of
taking some back. Among them is House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill., who made a brief pass at reducing the state grants during
congressional budget deliberations last month.
</P>
<P>
   In response, a coalition of unlikely partners has emerged,
serenading the governors (31 Republicans, 17 Democrats, one
independent and Ventura) with a use-it, don't-lose-it refrain. That
group includes liberal advocates with long wish lists of programs
for the poor; Clinton administration officials, from the president
on down, who want to protect domestic spending; and some of the
congressional Republicans who wrote the 1996 law and are eager to
see it produce tangible benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time is rapidly approaching where it will not be possible
to protect these funds,'' wrote Rep. Nancy L. Johnson, R-Conn., in
a March letter to all 50 governors. ``Spend the money.''
</P>
<P>
   While last year's figures are the most recent available, some
analysts say spending has risen in recent months as states grasp
the size of the surpluses and the range of programs they can
create. ``States are recognizing there's money there and they can
do things they never imagined before,'' said Jack Tweedie, a
welfare specialist at the National Conference of State
Legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   But, paradoxically the exhortations to spend have made some
state officials even more reluctant to create new programs, for
fear they will be left to finance them alone. ``Everybody's afraid
the money will be taken away,'' said state Rep. Garnett Coleman of
Texas, a Democrat from Houston who sits on the appropriations
committee.
</P>
<P>
   When states do spend, they are much more likely to expand
services _ like job placement or especially child care _ than to
raise cash benefits. Many states have doubled or even tripled
spending on child care, often broadening eligibility to all
low-income families. Florida has gone even further, adding $66
million in other services for families not on welfare, including
drug and mental health treatment. ``It's a new way of thinking
about welfare _ getting into more of a preventive mode,'' said Don
Winstead, the state's director of welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
   While expanding services, Florida now spends only 30 percent of
its welfare money on monthly grants to the poor and it has not
raised the payment, $303 for a family of three, in seven years.
Nationally the average welfare grant for a mother with two children
has risen by about 5 percent since 1995, to $408 a month.

   Six states have cut grants, including Idaho, which now offers an

per case soared to more than $17,000 last year, and more than
three-quarters of its money remained unspent.

   In 50 state budgets reside 50 different stories. The bold
spending in Wisconsin, the paralysis in New Mexico, and the
deal-making in Texas offer a representative three.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin: A Windfall Provides Something for All
</P>
<P>
   No one would accuse Wisconsin of ending welfare on the cheap.
But even the state's famously expensive program finished last year
with an eye-popping surplus _ nearly $350 million in unspent
federal money.
</P>
<P>
   The moral of the story that followed is that surpluses can make
strange bedfellows. Inside the Legislature, the program's harshest
critic, state Sen. Gwen Moore, and one of authors, state Rep. John
Gard, went behind closed doors and divided the money in a deal that
delighted them both.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moore got nearly $100 million over the next two years for
new benefits and services for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Gard got just over $100 million for a cut in property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The agencies that run the largely privatized program got nearly
$65 million in profit. And still there was enough left over to keep
nearly $100 million in reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lovefest,'' Ms. Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, the program generating these surpluses, Wisconsin
Works or ``W-2,'' is known for its willingness to spend. Virtually
everyone receiving cash assistance is required to work. But the
state has expanded job-placement services, hired new counselors,
offered guarantees of child care, created thousands of community
service jobs, and raised benefits to $673 a month, higher than
anyplace outside Alaska or Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Costs per case have risen accordingly, to about $21,000 a family
last year, from $7,000 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin has also increased its spending on other needy
families, to reward them for staying off the rolls. It has doubled
the size of its child care program, in part by tapping its welfare
money. And using other pools of state and federal money, it offers
low-wage workers subsidized health care and annual wage
supplements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told Congress, and I've told taxpayers, you can't do this
cheaply,'' said Tommy G. Thompson, the state's four-term governor,
whose support for spending has often raised eyebrows among his
Republican colleagues. ``You have to spend more in the beginning to
save on the back end.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Thompson has been surprised by the caseload declines;
when forced to work for welfare, most recipients have chosen to
fend for themselves. By the end of last year, the state had spent
only 56 percent of the federal money awarded to date.
</P>
<P>
   Among those most alarmed by the falling rolls is Ms. Moore, a
Milwaukee Democrat who represents many former recipients and who
once was on welfare herself. In her view the costly program makes
harsh demands that drive troubled families away while enriching
social workers and subcontractors. ``The people we kicked off the
rolls are still out there, and they're not getting served.''
</P>
<P>
   Spying the surplus, she wanted more money for a long list of
causes, and she won most of them _ child care, drug treatment, job
training, youth services, and higher payments for relatives who
care for abandoned children. (Many of the new services had been
proposed by Thompson, who continues to talk of the need to invest.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moore's longtime adversary, Gard, is a north woods
Republican from a county with a caseload of one. What he wanted was
a tax cut. ``I just believe the average working family needs to see
some benefit,'' he said. Indeed, Gard argues that more money
actually harms the program, by encouraging too much social work and
too little self-reliance. ``The only way to keep the program from
getting out of control is to pull out money when you can,'' Gard
said.
</P>
<P>
   He backed a plan that uses $108 million in federal money to
replace previous state spending on wage supplements for the working
poor. The state money was then converted into a tax cut for
property owners. The deal, embraced by leaders of both parties,
awaits final ratification by the Legislature. ``We both left the
room smiling,'' Ms. Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional budget hawks will no doubt frown at the size of
the state's windfall. But Thompson said any reduction in the
state's grant would punish it for its success. ``We're getting
results,'' he said. ``Isn't that what the federal government
wanted?''

<P>
   New Mexico: Political Fights Yield Little Action
</P>
<P>
   While federal money soothed old fights in Wisconsin, it brought
new ones to New Mexico. And the poor have paid the price.
</P>
<P>
   Three years into the new welfare age, the state newly ranked as
the nation's poorest is still recovering from a constitutional
showdown between a defiant governor, who tried to seize control of
the program, and the state Supreme Court, which found him in
contempt of its order to relent.
</P>
<P>
   Welfare directors have come and gone, leaving the department
without direction. And millions of federal dollars have gone
unspent, while thousands of jobless New Mexicans have been dropped
from the rolls.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict began in the spring of 1997, when the Democratic
Legislature passed a welfare bill that contained an expansion of
employment services. Gary E. Johnson, the state's two-term
Republican governor, vetoed it and unilaterally imposed one of the
nation's most restrictive programs. It cut off thousands of
families already on the rolls _ not by helping them find jobs, but
by changing the formula used to determine their eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   Angry Democratic legislators sued, arguing that the governor
needed their vote to make such changes. The state Supreme Court
agreed in a unanimous decision, ordering him in September 1997 to
end the program. When Johnson defied their order, the justices
returned three months later and cited him with contempt.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson ended the program. But the rolls had already been cut in
half and surpluses were mounting _ though much of the state was
still lacking rudimentary employment services. The Legislature met
in the spring of 1998 and with the governor's help, designed yet a
third program.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, it is rich in new services. It extends job-placement
programs beyond the welfare population, to any poor New Mexican
family. It creates lucrative subsidies for employers who hire
welfare recipients. And it raised welfare benefits by offering a
$100 monthly increase to any family not receiving a housing
subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Department of Human Services now on its third
secretary in three years, bureaucratic progress has been painfully
slow. It took until last October just to hire a job-placement
agency along the state's southern border, where county unemployment
rates are as high as 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Legislature set aside $4.5 million for wage
subsidies, the department has scarcely tapped the fund, creating
just eight jobs. And it has yet to extend its job-placement
services to the nonwelfare poor, as the Legislature directed a year
and a half ago.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Valdez, the department's new secretary-designate, said the
idea remains under consideration. ``That has not been implemented
yet,'' he said, declining further explanation. ``That's as far as I
can go.''
</P>
<P>
   The state did use its federal money to expand its subsidized
child care program, raising the number of children covered to
20,000, from 7,000 just two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But by last spring, the department was facing new turmoil in the
form of escalating rolls. Many of those who had been pushed off
welfare were streaming back in. While the caseloads were still well
below their historic levels, the state suddenly forecast something
unheard of in the new age: a coming welfare deficit. The
Legislature then canceled most of the benefit increase it had
passed the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico finished last year with $67 million in unspend money
and a record of missed opportunity that few are eager to defend.
``The money's been available but no program's been implemented,''
said state Sen. Manny Aragon, a Democrat who serves as the
president pro tem. ``I don't think we've done a very responsible
job.''

<P>
   Texas : Modest Programs In Poverty Aid
</P>
<P>
   Welfare has not grabbed the kind of headlines in Texas that it
has in other states. Though Gov. George W. Bush broadcasts his
identity as a ``compassionate conservative,'' he has left less
personal imprint than other Republican governors on his state's
policies.
</P>
<P>
   The program was designed in 1995 by a Democratic Legislature,
which vested much of its control in 28 local boards, made up of
business leaders, educators and social workers appointed by elected
officials. Their development has been impeded by political fights,
and two are still being formed. As a result, the availability of
social services varies widely from place to place.
</P>
<P>
   Still, caseloads are plunging nearly everywhere. Like most of
the country, the program emphasizes a strict, ``work-first''
philosophy, seeking quick placements in low-skilled jobs as opposed
to education or training. And it makes an energetic effort to
dissuade new applicants from coming on the rolls. Would-be welfare
recipients must first attend an orientation talk _ often requiring
a second trip to another office _ before they can get benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The state actually has more families seeking aid each month than
it had four years ago. But with with welfare harder to get and
harder to keep, the rolls have fallen 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For state Rep. Rob Junell, the chairman of the House
appropriations committee, that has created the kind of problem an
appropriator loves to mull: a projected two-year welfare surplus of
nearly $600 million. Huddling with his committee, Junell, a
Democrat, spent the spring devising a something-for-everyone plan.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 percent of the money went to social programs previously
financed with state dollars. (Some of the freed-up state money was
then reinvested in health programs.) Another 20 percent got placed
in reserve, in case of economic downturn. That left about 40
percent _ or $200 million _ for new benefits and services.
</P>
<P>
   Some were of the kind that many states have emphasized _ more
child care (Texas has nearly doubled the number of children getting
subsidies) and counseling for especially troubled families. But the
package also contained a surprise: $62 million, over two years, to
finance the state's first increase in monthly benefits in 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, it was a modest one. The Legislature raised the
monthly benefits of a mother and two children to $201, from $188.
That is lower than any state but Alabama ($164), Mississippi
($170), Tennessee ($185), or Louisiana ($190). Texas also added an
annual back-to-school payment of $60 for every welfare child.
</P>
<P>
   Small as the raise in benefits was, Junell said, it survived
only by avoiding publicity in an anti-welfare state. ``It was very
quiet, which is how I like it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A windfall for the state, a modest expansion of aid to the poor
_ the Texas experience seems a telling example of the country's
experience as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Bresette, associate director of the Center for Public
Policy Priorities, a research and advocacy group based in Austin,
argues the state has missed a historic opportunity. ``I do want to
give them credit for some of the things they did,'' he said. ``But
they had the chance to dramatically fix things for low-income
families, including working families. In a state with as much
poverty as Texas, we could have done a lot more.''
</P>
<P>
   The new welfare law is doing wonders for the state budget but is
it also helping the poor?
</P>
<P>
   Junell, a Democrat who represents the rural area around San
Angelo, gives a refreshingly candid answer. ``I'm out here in sheep
and goat country _ I may not be the best person to ask,'' he said.
But with the state now getting $300 million a year more than it
would have under the old system, he is firm in one conviction: he
does not want Congress to take any of it back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're gonna fight 'em tooth and nail,'' he said. ``Out here in
Texas, a deal's a deal.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chancellor Rudy Crew's ability to lead the New York
City school system could be damaged by the news _ revealed less
than two weeks before the start of a new school year _ that he is
considering taking a job at the University of Washington in
Seattle, school officials and union leaders said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   As Crew ponders his decision, some members of the city's Board
of Education raised doubts Saturday about whether his contract
would be renewed in June, if the chancellor stays until then.
</P>
<P>
   Among school officials Saturday, reaction to the chancellor's
disclosure ranged from sympathy to a sense of betrayal. But
regardless of their reaction, school officials said they wanted to
know for certain whether Crew was staying or leaving, and what kind
of timetable he had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is this: it's never good for a chancellor to leave
in the middle of a school year,'' said Randi Weingarten, president
of the United Federation of Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Cammarata, the Staten Island board member, and Ninfa
Segarra, who is Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's appointee to the board,
said that until the board completed an evaluation of Crew's
performance in the last year, they could not predict whether they
would support extending his contract beyond June.
</P>
<P>
   Cammarata, chairman of the committee preparing the evaluation,
said it would be ``one of the most extensive and scrutinizing
ever.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Crew disclosed in an interview Friday that he was having serious
discussions with the University of Washington about leading a newly
established institute there. Contradicting previous statements from
a top aide, Crew said he could not promise to remain until the end
of his term.
</P>
<P>
   Board of Education President William Thompson said the board
would ask to talk with Crew about his intentions, to help avoid
disrupting the new school year. ``When you hint or even mention
that you're looking at another possibility, yes, I think it's
damaging,'' Thompson said. ``It does create a situation where
people may try and wait you out.''
</P>
<P>
   Crew, through a spokeswoman, declined comment Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, he said that although he hoped to stay until his
contract expires in June, or even until his five-year anniversary
in October 2000, when his pension will be vested, he was concerned
that the political climate in New York might prevent that.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Crew sparred repeatedly with Giuliani, until then a
close ally, over a series of policy decisions, from whether to
support an experimental school voucher program to how much money to
spend on school maintenance and repairs and where it should be
spent.
</P>
<P>
   Crew threatened to resign last March if Giuliani pressed a plan
to offer publicly financed vouchers for private school to children
in failing public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani later backed down. But the mayor engineered a 4-3
majority on the Board of Education, including Ms. Segarra and
Cammarata, to defeat the chancellor's capital spending plan.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent conflict, Giuliani sent a letter to Crew on
Aug. 3, chastising him for canceling their last six weekly meetings
on education. But both Crew and an aide to the mayor said that, at
their last two meetings, the relationship had been refreshingly
harmonious, as the two men agreed on programs like reducing the
number of children in special education programs and moving ahead
with efforts to end social promotion.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Crew sounded relaxed and optimistic, if torn, as he
discussed the job possibilities in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   University of Washington president Richard McCormick confirmed
Friday that the university was recruiting Crew and said that the
university administration had not set any deadline for Crew to
decide what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials close to the negotiations said Crew was exploring
the possibility of taking two jobs _ director of a new institute on
school leadership and replacement for the dean of the school of
education, who is retiring _ as a way of meeting his salary
requirements. He now makes $245,000 a year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Cammarata said that Crew's admission that he was seriously
considering a job in the Northwest was ``truly a great shock,'' in
part because until now he had had the support of the board most of
the time. He said he was distressed that Crew had not had a
``frank'' discussion about his job hunt with the board.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Weingarten said the uncertainty about Crew's future could
undermine his authority in the midst of huge hurdles _ among them
recruiting competent principals and teachers, turning around
failing schools and carrying out a mandatory summer school program
for as many as a third of the city's 1.1 million schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have this layered on, I think, is a setback,'' she said.
She added, however, that over the summer, she had repeatedly urged
him to stay and would continue to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Segarra said it was important for Crew to clarify his
intentions ``as soon as possible,'' so the board could make plans
for a transition, if necessary.

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ At some point this weekend, dozens of
Jets players probably thought back to that very first day they
joined the team.
</P>
<P>
   The young and the old, and the high-priced draft picks and the
free agents heard this question from coach Bill Parcells at that
first team meeting: ``What can you do so that I can take you to the
game?''
</P>
<P>
   What it meant for those who weren't starters _ and even some who
were _ was: Are you versatile enough to play at another position,
giving me one more reason to keep you? For most players that means
the ability to play special teams.
</P>
<P>
   Even Ray Lucas, who is trying to make it as a quarterback, was
scheduled to play special teams when the Jets played the Giants
Saturday night in the hope that it would keep him around if his
throwing arm failed him.
</P>
<P>
   Each year at this time, the pressure grows on those who aren't
quite sure where they stand. It is the weekend of the next-to-last
game of the exhibition season, and the first cuts will follow soon
after Saturday night's game against the Giants. Of the 79 players
on the roster, at least 14 will be gone by Tuesday when rosters
must be trimmed to 65.
</P>
<P>
   But players who can do something else well _ snap a ball, cover
punts, even hold the ball for the place-kicker _ have an advantage
over a one-dimensional player.
</P>
<P>
   There are two other factors: age and money. Thus, all things
being equal, Parcells goes with the younger and less expensive
player. That is why he did not bring Keith Byars to camp
originally. The 35-year-old F-back suddenly became needed when
Johnny Mitchell quit and Blake Spence was injured.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells also wanted a younger player to step forward as the
club's fourth receiver. He has first-year players Chris Brazzell
and Brian Musso. But neither is ready and now 34-year-old Quinn
Early has that role, while 35-year-old Dwight Stone is in a
backup-receiver/special-teams role.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, 32-year-old Ian Beckles was brought in at right guard
when the rookies did not take command.
</P>
<P>
   Other players have shown they can play on special teams while
trying to learn how to perform at their regular position in the
National Football League. Such is the case for Kevin Williams, a
backup cornerback, Scott Frost, a backup safety, Robert Farmer, a
running back, and Spence.
</P>
<P>
   There also are players who understand their roles will be
nothing more than backup players, and they had better star on
special teams. Defensive backs Corwin Brown and Chris Hayes have
made a living doing just that for Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, of all the players who are expected to perform on the
special teams, only one _ outside of the kickers _ does nothing
else. He is John Hudson, the snapper.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells makes an exception of him because Hudson's skill at his
arcane role is so high, and his mistakes so few. In fact, in his
two years under Parcells, Hudson has never sent a long snap over a
punter's head or past a holder during a field-goal attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old Hudson isn't even listed in the depth chart any
more. They used to call him the backup center, but he does little
actual work with the line. Instead, while the offensive linemen
practice stopping marauding defensive linemen, he is off to the
side throwing the ball between his legs.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells has looked at other players to snap the ball:
linebacker Casey Dailey and defensive end David Viger. But Dailey
got hurt and Viger is in the Navy. Parcells even admits he has told
Hudson that the Jets are looking for someone who can play a
position as well as snap.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson is a mere 270-pounder, standing 6 foot 2. But Hudson
prevails. He is going into his fourth Jets' season. In a career
that began in 1991 with the Eagles, he has played in 115 games _
and never started.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, center Kevin Mawae is the snapper behind Hudson.
Mawae hates that job, though. He claims it takes his attention away
from his primary role, which he does very well.
</P>
<P>
   So the only nonregular who knows he has a job next week will be
Hudson, a player most fans never see standing up to his full
height.

 SAILOR PREFERS OLD YACHT OVER THE NEW FOR RACES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAMESTOWN, R.I. _ One might think that Jim Bishop had struck it
rich from the names of his boats: Golddigger, Gold Dust, Nugget,
Prospector, Fool's Gold and Motherlode. But you would not know it
by the kind of sailboat he races.
</P>
<P>
   While other big-boat owners are coming up with newer and faster
custom-made grand prix yachts each season, the 66-year-old Bishop
continues to compete with his 44-foot, nine-year-old Golddigger. It
cost about $400,000 fully rigged, roughly half of what it would
cost to build and campaign a grand prix boat.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of Caithness Resources, an exploration and mining
company based in New York, Bishop could probably afford a newer
boat. He has homes in Saddle River, N.J., and West Palm Beach,
Fla., as well as in Jamestown. But he refuses to sink money into a
boat that will quickly become outdated.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bishop spends some of his money keeping a 70-foot
antique houseboat, the Coastal Queen, to use as a mothership for
the J/44 sailboat race series, of which he was one of the founders.
As many as 16 J/44s compete in a Northeast circuit that has
organized 36 races this season, from Long Island Sound to
Narragansett Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The J/44, sailing's boat of the year after being introduced in
1989, is the only one-design class that has had its own start in
the Newport to Bermuda Race. This year, the group's North American
championship is scheduled for Sept. 10-12 at the Larchmont Yacht
Club in Larchmont, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Golddigger, like other J/44s, is made to race across oceans as
well as around buoys. Its cruiser-racer pedigree gives it a longer
life than many of the new sailboats competing under grand prix or
club-level handicap rules. ``I won't race a boat I can't take to
Bermuda,'' Bishop said.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop has vivid memories of the time in 1984 when he sailed a
grand prix boat in the Newport to Bermuda Race. Rough seas started
to delaminate the boat's hull, which was built to be lightweight
and fast but not particularly safe. The composite construction did
not hold up as well as wood or solid fiberglass might have.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to shove boat fenders between the boat's longitudinal
stringers and its outer skin to keep it from breaking apart,''
Bishop said recently of the 42-footer.
</P>
<P>
   Composite boats can be built to stand up to those conditions
with today's technology, but they would be unlikely to beat grand
prix competition. At 33,000 pounds, Golddigger is nearly 18,000
pounds heavier for its size than many of the stripped-out,
high-tech yachts built solely for inshore races. It has a teak
interior, two fresh-water showers, a generous galley and enough
bunks to sleep eight comfortably.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I go out and spend $1 million to buy a new boat,'' Bishop
said, ``my chances of winning might be one in 20. Then the next
year, the boat is obsolete. The economics just don't make sense.
The sailing industry is chasing the wrong god, and forcing people
who can't keep up out of the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who do keep up, of course, spend the money at the grand
prix level. Eric Goetz, a boat builder from Bristol, R.I., has
constructed the New York Yacht Club's two new boats for the
1999-2000 America's Cup trials. He caters to boat owners who might
want a new yacht for a specific regatta or to keep up with changes
in sailing's handicap rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the Indianapolis 500,'' Goetz said. ``You don't race
in a 1998 car in the 1999 race. Whether it's a displacement hull or
a new Indy engine, it's basically the same thing. You try to win in
the forum you want to be in.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bishop and his cronies, racing among themselves offers the
best competition. Owners cannot make changes to their boats unless
the others agree to make the same improvement. And the unity does
not stop there. The group spent about $150,000 for 15 sets of new
sails and hired a manager to oversee the inventory. That includes
rotating the sails. If eight sets are used on a particularly
blustery day, the manager makes sure that the remaining seven are
used on a similar kind of day next time. With the sails wearing at
the same rate, no boat stands to have an advantage over another.

A PET SHOP MONKEY IS STOLEN (OR IS THAT LIBERATED?) 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To her owners at a squawking, growling, slithering jungle pet
shop in West Islip, N.Y., Annie, a 27-year-old Vietnamese
stump-tail macaque, had been almost a member of the family. She was
bottle fed as an infant, allowed to swim in the family pool, fed
and tended with loving care and, though caged like the pythons and
alligators, was never for sale.
</P>
<P>
   But to animal rights advocates, Annie was a victim of barbarous
cruelty, imprisoned for decades in isolation and squalor, fed an
improper diet that included pizza and Chinese takeout and denied
the opportunity to interact with members of her own species _ a
languishing, depressed primate who finally even lost interest in
her slide and tire swing.
</P>
<P>
   There were numerous complaints and denials and visits by
representatives of animal protection groups and government
inspectors, but no substantive action was taken _ until Friday,
when persons unknown broke into B.T.J.'s Jungle Pets in the dead of
night and made off with the 35-pound, rust-colored monkey.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing else was taken from the shop, which sells reptiles,
exotic birds and fish, prairie dogs and snakes as well as dogs,
cats and other pets.
</P>
<P>
   The Suffolk County police said they had no suspects in the
burglary, but a shadowy animal rights group was claiming
responsibility Saturday for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Annie is finally free from exploitation and humiliation,'' the
North American Animal Liberation Front said in a notice faxed to
news media. It called itself ``a worldwide underground organization
dedicated to strategic nonviolent direct action aimed at all forms
of the animal-abuse industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Stagno, the northeast director of another group called
In Defense of Animals, who had been a prominent voice recently in
complaining about the conditions in which Annie was kept, said
Saturday that she had received an anonymous call at about the time
of the burglary from a man who told her the monkey had been
liberated.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from Yonkers, N.Y., she said that,
because complaints had not led to ``the necessary steps to insure
Annie's health and safety,'' she fully supported Annie's theft. In
response to questions, she insisted that she did not know any
members of the front, had nothing to do with the theft and did not
know where, or how, Annie was being kept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever she is now, we are certain she is much better off
than when she was incarcerated in the pet store,'' Ms. Stagno said.
``The brave people who liberated Annie deserve our congratulations,
not our condemnation.''
</P>
<P>
   The proprietors of the store _ three brothers, Bill, Tom and
John Niehoff _ were not there Saturday, but Denise Coppola, 30, who
has worked there for 10 years, denied that Annie had been kept in
inadequate conditions.
</P>
<P>
   She said the animal had been bottle fed as an infant by the
mother of the store's owners, had been allowed to swim in the
family pool and had been kept in a clean cage and fed with
nutritious fruits and other appropriate foods.

SPORTS COLUMN: NEW PRESIDENT ALREADY HAS LEGACY AT ASHE STADIUM

clients. Non-subscribers may make individual purchase by calling
(888) 603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.) 
(jt) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Judy Levering sat in her hotel room in the middle of
the night and jotted down four or five pages' worth of notes.
</P>
<P>
   Her prep work was worth it. Levering's arguments the next day
finally convinced her colleagues that the new stadium at the
National Tennis Center should be named after the late Arthur Ashe.
</P>
<P>
   The name is now an ancient tradition, as American stadiums go
these days, heading for its third U.S. Open on Monday. Saturday,
the place was bustling with Arthur Ashe Kids' Day, for fun and
charity, and Levering promises that the name will stand, unblighted
by the name of some transient corporate sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   In her first Open as the first female president of the U.S.
Tennis Association, Levering now has another challenge _ filling
the ludicrously oversized 21,000-seat stadium with actual tennis
fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get more people in here,'' Levering said the
other day.
</P>
<P>
   She was standing on the floor of the handsome new stadium.
Workmen were bustling at the south end, installing a contraption
that will allow a television camera to zoom from one corner to
another (but not during points).
</P>
<P>
   Jim Courier was preparing for a workout on the main court.
Levering waved at him, a favorite for his devotion to Davis Cup
competition. Then she nodded at the seats just a few feet away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players love to have an audience,'' Levering said.
</P>
<P>
   That does not always happen. For the first eight or nine days of
the Open, thousands of fans flock to the downsized Louis Armstrong
Stadium, thousands flock to the intimate grandstand, and thousands
more flock to the outer courts to literally peer over the players'
shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   What is worse, thousands of wine-sippers and shrimp-ingesters
hide out in the air-conditioned sanctums of the luxury boxes to
watch the soaps, to check up on their flitting fortunes in the
market, anything to avoid sitting in the elements and watching
tennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put the stars in the stadium court, very often they
have easy matches in the early rounds,'' Levering said. ``People
might go to the hotly contested matches, and the stadium is
one-third empty.''
</P>
<P>
   Or one-third full. Like her friend and predecessor, Harry
Marmion, Levering seems genuinely committed to not doing what the
three other Grand Slam events have been doing, which is selling out
the secondary arenas, packing the grounds, and fairly forcing
people to stay in the main stadium.
</P>
<P>
   This is going to be hard to believe, given New York's
well-deserved reputation for venality and cacophony, but the Open
is now the most pleasant of Grand Slam events _ the courts more
accessible, the aisles less jammed, the services more available.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived in London from 1976 through 1979 and it was just
starting,'' Levering said, with all due respect. ``This year at
Wimbledon I wanted to go over to watch Alexandra Stevenson, but I
had some duties in the Royal Box, and I could not even get to the
reserved area at the second court.''
</P>
<P>
   This year the Open will make available 1,000 grounds tickets for
each of the first nine days, at prices from $25 to $35, on sale
that day, theoretically making it easier for locals to get a
glimpse.
</P>
<P>
   Levering reminds New Yorkers that the center, open year round,
``is the best public facility in the country.'' She thinks, as the
first female president, that she can make tennis more popular on
the grass-roots level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men and women approach issues differently,'' she said the
other day. ``Women generally don't have big egos. We generally
don't always have to be right. Now that will change as women get
into situations where men have been. But in general, women
understand how things work at the community level because that's
how we've lived it. We've looked at values differently, been
involved in the rearing of children.''
</P>
<P>
   For all her interest in the care and handling of young people,
Levering has not yet persuaded recalcitrant youths named Sampras
and Agassi to come out for all Davis Cup play. She has had better
success with her peers in the USTA, who nicknamed her The Velvet
Hammer for her perseverance.
</P>
<P>
   This mannered white-haired grandmother (from Kansas City, Mo.,
and Lancaster, Pa., now living with her husband in Stowe, Vt.)
pushed board members to think beyond the lucrative but grubby
practice of courting a corporate name. She was convinced it should
be named for the Open and Wimbledon champion who was activist,
scholar, businessman, Davis Cup captain and hero for the way he
faced his early death from AIDS, acquired from a blood transfusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have named it USTA Stadium or we could name it after
a person,'' Levering said. ``If it would be an outstanding player,
well, that is debatable, but Arthur was a champion who transcended
the sport. Every other sport would have loved to have Arthur Ashe
play that sport. We were lucky to have Arthur.''
</P>
<P>
   After writing down her thoughts, Levering convinced Marmion and
the others the next day. If she does nothing else, the name will be
a monument to her volunteer work with the USTA.
</P>
<P>
   During her two summers as president, Levering will search for a
method _ bribes or point of a gun or moral coercion _ to induce
denizens of the luxury boxes to emerge from the shadows to watch a
bit of tennis. They might even enjoy it.

AT 80, A KAYAKER SPENDS WEEKENDS GLIDING THROUGH THE REGION'S

<P>
   JERSEY CITY, N.J. _ In one easy motion, Leonard LeShay swung the
17-foot kayak off his car and onto his shoulder. ``I got her up,''
he called out, waving aside any help. He balanced the kayak at a
perilous angle and headed for the water.
</P>
<P>
   At 80, LeShay had several decades on the other kayakers who were
readying themselves at Liberty State Park early Saturday morning to
paddle around Manhattan _ a 33-mile trip _ in 10 hours. But don't
tell him that. ``If anyone says, `Pop,' I kill them,'' he said.
``I'm in there as an equal. I help them. They don't help me.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every weekend for the past 12 years, through sweltering
summers and shivering winters, LeShay has hauled a kayak from his
home in Fresh Meadows, Queens, to rivers and bays around the
Northeast. His adventures have filled 15 photo albums _ each
holding 300 snapshots.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, he'll even bring a date along. He keeps a spare kayak
_ which, he said, makes for a great opening line with the women _
just for those occasions. He bought it for a girlfriend, but took
it back after they broke up.
</P>
<P>
   Now anyone hoping to land LeShay has to do a mean paddle.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's it, or I dump them right away,'' he said only half
jokingly. ``No kayaking? Then goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   LeShay is an old hand in a thriving pastime around the New York
region. Last year, more than 6,000 people took out free kayaks at
the Downtown Boathouse in lower Manhattan compared with just over
100 in 1995, said Jim Wetteroth, the boathouse's president. At the
Peconic Paddler in Riverhead, Long Island, the owner, Jim Dreeben,
expects to sell about 900 kayaks this year, ranging from the $379
basic plastic model to the $4,000 Kevlar two-seater.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Ysaguirre, president of the 350-member Metropolitan
Association of Sea Kayakers, which organized Saturday's trip around
Manhattan, said LeShay has more than kept up in a club where the
average age is closer to 45. ``He never has a problem,'' said
Ysaguirre, who is 49. ``Most people have back problems and get
tired, but he can never get enough.''
</P>
<P>
   For LeShay, kayaking was a natural evolution in his life. He was
born in the Bronx to a family of ``water people.'' He said his
mother swam regularly in the Atlantic Ocean until she was 86. His
father was an avid fisherman.
</P>
<P>
   He bought his first boat _ a wood canoe for $15 _ when he was
18. He rigged a sheet to it and sailed off the shore of City Island
in the Bronx. His friends christened it the ``Plastic Wood''
because he patched it up so many times.
</P>
<P>
   But those days ended after he married a woman who could not swim
and did not care for boats. After she died in 1981, LeShay started
climbing into canoes again, but found them hard to manage alone.
When he spied a kayak at a boating show in 1988, he heard the
siren's call. He was 68 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, LeShay has spent countless hours exploring crevices
along Long Island Sound, and the Delaware and Connecticut rivers.
His favorite spot is Flax Pond, a tidal area between Stony Brook
and Port Jefferson, Long Island, which has crystal-clear water and
deserted beaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the thing that makes him happiest _ his boat and his love
of the ocean,'' said David LeShay, his son.
</P>
<P>
   The elder LeShay, who lives alone, still works 40 hours a week
selling shoulder pads and trimming in the Garment District. He
boasts that he has not taken a sick day in 20 years. He is not on
medication. He does not even feel the occasional pang of arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning, LeShay packed four water bottles, an
underwater camera and a radio into his one-man
white-and-red-trimmed Nordkapp Jubilee _ an 80th birthday present
from another kayaker. He has circled Manhattan three times before.
Saturday the group was headed up the East River, across to the
Harlem River and back down the Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I love, so why not do it while I can?'' he
said. ``It's part of me. I'll kayak until I can't kayak anymore.
That may be until I'm 100. Maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   As he pushed off in his kayak, he raised his paddle high over
his head in joy. ``I'll be in touch,'' he called out before
paddling away on another adventure.

 &HT;    Hurricane Dennis leaves Bahamas in his wake
 &HT;    w/ DENNIS-MAIN or CANE
 &HT;    BAHAMA REPAIRS STORM DAMAGE.
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ As Hurricane Dennis churned toward the southeastern
U.S. coast Saturday, residents of the northern Bahamas were
repairing the damage caused by a near direct hit from Dennis'
eyewall in the early hours of Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The winds were terrible, gusting to 115 miles an hour,'' said
Martin Havill(cq), general manager of the Bluff House Beach Hotel
on Green Turtle Cay, just off Great Abaco. ``It started about 10
p.m. last night (Friday) and about 5 a.m. this morning it reached
its apex. We have a lot of trees down and a couple of boats sunk,
but other than that we're okay. Thank God nobody was hurt,'' Havill
reported in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Weather officials said the center of Dennis passed within a few
miles of Great Abaco's eastern tip, pummeling the sparsely
populated island with sustained winds of 80 miles an hour and gusts
to 115 miles an hour. Huge seas thrashed the rocky Atlantic coast,
with waves to 20 feet pounding the outer reefs of several smaller
islands that lie just off Abaco's shores.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seas on the outer reef were unbelievable,'' Havill said.
``The waves were probably 20 feet plus.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the reefs along resort beaches, however, early reports
listed the damage as minor, with smaller waves pushed in by the
storm causing some erosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had one large boat who stayed in the sound all night,''
Havill said. ``He had to run his engines just to stay in place over
his anchor. He reported winds in excess of 100 miles an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Havill and other hotel workers reported little damage to
buildings other than some missing roof shingles. The worst damage
appeared to be to foliage, with trees toppled and downed limbs
littering the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are coconut trees down everywhere,'' said Avis Miller,
who works at Treasure Cay Beach Hotel about 20 miles northeast of
Marsh Harbour. ``But nobody was hurt and we had nothing
disastrous.''
</P>
<P>
   About 20 guests stayed in the hotel overnight, Miller said,
spending the night without electricity, listening to the winds
howl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The electricity is out and that's the worst of it, but
everybody is okay,'' she said. ``They're all taking coffee and
eating rice krispies. Everybody is quite safe and happy.''
</P>
<P>
   There were reports of damage to buildings in Marsh Harbour,
Great Abaco's largest town, with the walls of two buildings under
construction toppled by the gusting winds. There were no immediate
reports of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Bachewicz(cq), flew over to Great Abaco from his home in
Fort Lauderdale before the storm to secure his 50-foot sailboat,
which he keeps at the Treasure Cay Marina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through several hurricanes here and this was the
worst because the eyewall passed right over us,'' he said. ``My
wife was scared. Last night you had to hang onto stuff when you
were walking.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said that while the winds were powerful, the damage
remained surprisingly light.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could've been much worse,'' said Havill. ``We'll have
everything cleaned up in a day or two. Tell people who had plans to
visit that everything is fine.''

   BBN-BRAVES-CARDS _ ST. LOUIS _ Coverage of the Braves vs. St.
Louis Cardinals. (Rogers, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). EDS: First
pitch is at 1:15 p.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
   BBO-STADIUMS _ One by one in the 1960s or 1970s, their sacred
walls were rocked by wrecking balls instead of baseballs. Crosley,
Ebbets and Forbes fields. The Polo Grounds, Sportsman's Park and
the rest. They were replaced by multi-purpose flying-saucer
stadiums or domed facilities. Now, the trend is for new-old
ballparks that resemble their distant forefathers _ minus the bad
sight lines, sparse restrooms and lack of luxury boxes. Of
baseball's six oldest major-league ballparks, three will be gone
after this year: Tiger Stadium in Detroit, Milwaukee County Stadium
and San Francisco's 3Com Park, formerly known as Candlestick. In
Boston, Fenway Park is fading fast, and although New York's Yankee
Stadium and Chicago's Wrigley Field are safe now, both could vanish
in a flash. (Moore, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED.

   WITH
</P>
<P>
   BBO-STADIUMS-CANDLESTICK _ SAN FRANCISCO _ Mark Twain died
nearly five decades before the Giants moved from New York to San
Francisco. To paraphrase the noted humorist, however, the coldest
winter that anybody could spend would be to attend a baseball game
at Candlestick Point. No ballpark in the majors is more affected by
Mother Nature than Candlestick _ or 3Com, as it's been known since
1995 _ where games often are played in swirling winds, brutal
temperatures, blinding fog or all three. (Moore, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   BBO-STADIUMS-COUNTY _ MILWAUKEE _ It doesn't have Wrigley's ivy
or the legendary right-field porch of Tiger Stadium. A Green
Monster? The most striking thing involving that color inside County
Stadium was the Packers, but they eventually left to play all of
their games in Green Bay. Imagine an often chilly and an eternally
gray building in the middle of a parking lot. It's either one of
the city's abandoned breweries or County Stadium. (Moore, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   BBO-STADIUMS-FENWAY _ BOSTON _ One of baseball's myths is that
everybody loves Fenway Park. Many do, of course. In fact, most who
know the difference between Carl Yastrzemski and a bowl of clam
chowder tend to view this quaint home of the Red Sox as perfection
on earth. But more than a few New Englanders say it's time to rid
their historic landscape of a relic that is cramped and rickety.
(Moore, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   BBO-STADIUMS-TIGER _ DETROIT _ With apologies to Fenway Park,
Tiger Stadium is the most magical ballpark this side of Wrigley
Field. They have played baseball at the corner of Michigan and
Trumbull avenues for 103 years, including the last 88 seasons in
Tiger Stadium. (Moore, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   BBO-STADIUMS-WRIGLEY _ CHICAGO _ It's the All-Star Game in
Boston, and Ernie Banks loses his smile for the first time ever. A
guy from Atlanta just asked the Hall of Famer if he thinks somebody
will do the unthinkable some day by yanking the ivy _ and
everything else _ out of Wrigley Field. ``I don't think they'll
ever tear down Wrigley Field,'' Banks says. ``It will withstand the
test of time and the history of baseball.'' (Moore, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   BBO-STADIUMS-YANKEE _ NW YORK _ The new Yankee Stadium isn't the
old Yankee Stadium. For decades, the House that Ruth Built featured
a copper facade along its majestic roof. This was long before they
altered the ballpark in the mid-1970s, lowering the playing field,
shortening the home-run distances in all but right field and adding
escalator towers. What didn't change was the ghosts. Next to Notre
Dame Stadium, no American sports facility has more ghosts than
Yankee Stadium. (Moore, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED.

 &HT;    Mayor parallels civil rights struggle to current lawsuit
controversy at MLK stamp ceremony
 &HT;    By Rhonda Cook
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As the U.S. Postal Service unveiled a stamp featuring
Martin Luther King Jr. Saturday, Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell used
the event to link the slain civil rights leader's crusade to the
city's mission to protect its affirmative action program.
</P>
<P>
   The Southeastern Legal Foundation sued the city in federal court
Thursday, claiming the program is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us not let anyone, any organization or any movement stop
our struggle for justice,'' said Campbell, the second of six
speakers at the unveiling of the stamp of King, one of 15 images
the public selected as representing significant people and events
of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to fight like Dr. King. Affirmative action is
our Selma. It's our Edmund Pettus bridge,'' Campbell said of the
Alabama march from Montgomery to Selma, during which civil rights
demonstrators were trampled by police on horseback and beaten with
nightsticks.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said his campaign to keep the program intact would
resemble the ``shoot-out at the O.K. Corral.'' He vowed to ``fight
to the death'' to defend Atlanta's 25-year-old program that
requires businesses with city contracts to share as much as 34
percent of the work with firms that are minority- or female-owned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe as passionately in affirmative action. It's a
struggle for economic freedom,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   The imagery Campbell used in his brief comments contrasted
sharply with the scene in the hall at Atlanta's Martin Luther King
Jr. Historic Site. King's widow, Coretta Scott King, and a member
of the Postal Service board of governors released a royal blue
banner to uncover the first-class stamp as a recording echoed the
final words of King's ``I Have a Dream'' speech: ``Free at last.
Free at last. Thank God Almighty, I'm free at last.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the Celebrate the Century series, the stamp shows the
Rev. King looking heavenward. Behind him is the crowd of 250,000
that heard his speech during the Aug. 28, 1963, March on
Washington, in what has long been regarded as a defining moment in
the movement to win political, social and economic rights for
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``That speech is as relevant today as it was 36 years ago,''
said former Atlanta Mayor Andy Young, who was an aide to King along
with Congressman John Lewis, who was also in the audience Saturday.
``There are still people isolated on islands of poverty in an ocean
of wealth.''
</P>
<P>
   The stamp will go on sale at post offices in September.

REAL ESTATE: CONTRACTING FOR UPKEEP OF ELEVATORS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Negotiating a service contract for elevator maintenance, as many
co-op and condominium boards have discovered, can be nearly as
complicated as fixing the elevator itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with elevator maintenance contracts is that there
is no standard contract in the industry,'' said Mary Ann Rothman,
executive director of the Council of New York Cooperatives and
Condominiums. ``That means that it's difficult to impossible to
find a contract that covers everything. The standing joke in the
industry is that what isn't covered by the contract is whatever it
is that just went wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rothman explained that because of the strict laws governing
elevators in buildings, the complex nature of elevator equipment
itself and the need for the equipment to be maintained on a regular
basis, most co-ops and condominiums hired elevator service
companies to perform routine maintenance, make necessary repairs
and, in cases where the company is licensed, perform required
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   And in most cases, she said, the companies and boards enter into
fairly complicated monthly service contracts that presumably
enumerate in detail the services the company agrees to perform and
the monthly amount that the building agrees to pay for those
services.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, however, elevator experts and consultants say, what
often makes elevator maintenance contracts confusing and difficult
to negotiate is the fact that while what is covered is often
spelled out in excruciating technical detail, what is not covered
usually is not mentioned at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many moving parts to an elevator that most people
have no idea what they're looking for when they're looking at a
service contract,'' said George Johnson, president of Triboro
Technologies, an elevator consulting company based in Smithtown,
N.Y. ``Meanwhile, the elevator contractors are listing all the
things they're covering while leaving out all that aren't covered.
And some of those things are major components.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said that under the terms of most service contracts,
covered items must be repaired or replaced by the contractor for no
additional charge to the building above the set monthly fee. At the
same time, however, parts and repairs that are not specifically
detailed in the contract remain the responsibility of the building
owner.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Johnson said, while an elevator service contract
might say it covers a detailed list of parts that make up the
motor, it will at times leave out the parts that are most likely to
require repair or replacement. ``The problem is, most people on
co-op boards don't know much at all about elevator motors and even
less about what part is most likely to break,'' he said. Paul
Capotorto, a technician for the Mercury Elevator Corp. in the
Bronx, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing to do when reading over a proposed
maintenance contract is to really read the thing,'' Capotorto said.
``You can't just glance at these contracts and know what you're
getting. One missing word could end up costing you thousands of
dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, while nearly all service contracts for
hydraulic elevators will include coverage for the pump used to move
the hydraulic fluid that moves the elevators, some will quietly
fail to include coverage for the motor that moves the pump.
</P>
<P>
   Another common problem with elevator service contracts is that
while most include ``24-hour coverage for emergencies,'' what
constitutes and emergency is not always clearly defined. For
example, Capotorto said, almost all contractors would consider it
an emergency if an elevator gets stuck with someone inside. At the
same time, having an empty elevator get stuck might be an
emergency, depending on the circumstances and the terms of the
contract.
</P>
<P>
   An empty elevator that goes up and fails to come down at 3 a.m.
would probably not constitute an emergency in a building with
several elevators. In a building with one elevator and lots of
people who have to get out to work in the morning, however, the
same situation might be considered serious enough to demand
immediate attention.
</P>
<P>
   If the service contract defines an emergency only as a stuck
elevator with a person inside, however, that early morning service
call could cost a co-op or condominium several hundred dollars.
``You want to know precisely what's considered an emergency,''
Capotorto said. ``Otherwise you're going to be getting billed every
time the thing shuts down and there's nobody in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another thing boards should understand when negotiating elevator
service contracts is the concept of ``proration.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Coyne, the president of Mercury Elevator, said that most
service companies, before taking on a new customer, would inspect
the equipment for condition.
</P>
<P>
   Once that has been done, Coyne said, the contractor will
typically include a provision in the contract that makes the
building owner responsible for part of the cost of repairing or
replacing certain components that have been specified by the
contractor.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, if the contractor determines that the
cables used to hoist and lower the elevator show signs of wear and
may need to be replaced in a few years, he will usually put a
clause in the contract requiring the owner to pay part of the cost
of replacing the cables when necessary. The respective parts of the
cost that the owner and the contractor are to be responsible for,
Coyne said, are then prorated over a period of years.
</P>
<P>
   So, for example, a 10-year proration clause _ which is fairly
common for an item like elevator cables _ would make the owner
responsible for 90 percent of the cost of replacement during the
first year of the contract, 80 percent responsible during the
second year, 70 percent responsible during the third year, and so
on.
</P>
<P>
   Coyne pointed out that while boards could generally negotiate
proration clauses _ and even demand that they be eliminated
entirely _ they should be wary of elevator service contractors who
do not raise the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are companies out there that don't care what shape the
equipment is in,'' Coyne said. `They'll come in and take a job just
to get it. They figure that what happens after that is just a roll
of the dice.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the elevator consultant, said that there was a way that
a board could ensure that it got the best possible contract from an
elevator service contractor: hire its own consultant to prepare it.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, to ensure that his clients have the
ability to get out of a contract if they are not satisfied with the
performance of the contractor, he inserts a clause in the contracts
he prepares giving them the right to cancel the contract simply by
giving 30 days' written notice to the contractor.
</P>
<P>
   But why would a contractor agree to such a clause?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because there's lots of competition out there,'' Johnson said.
``These guys are cutting each other's throats to get contracts.''

   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Hurricane Dennis strengthened and slowed
Saturday on its path toward the southeastern United States, and
while vacationers enjoyed a day at the beach, officials were
preparing for the worst.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane Center in
Miami, predicted that the hurricane would intensify from a Category
1 storm into a Category 3 one, moving across the warm Gulf Stream
waters toward the Carolinas and making landfall late Monday or
early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it could hit anywhere in the Carolinas,'' Jarrell
said. ``The odds favor the North Carolina end.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrell said he thought there was a 75 percent chance that the
storm would make landfall in the United States, and a 25 percent
chance that it would turn out to sea.
</P>
<P>
   Tropical storm warnings and hurricane watches were in effect
Saturday along the Florida coast, but the storm was expected to
parallel the Florida shore through Sunday, with the center
remaining about 100 miles out to sea.
</P>
<P>
   At 2 p.m., the storm was centered 200 miles east-southeast of
Cape Canaveral in Florida. It had sustained winds of 100 mph, up
from 80 mph the night before. Earlier Saturday, the storm battered
Abaco, an island in the Bahamas, The Associated Press reported.
Just back from a morning drive around Abaco's Marsh Harbour, the
Rev. Carlton Dorsette said that about 70 percent of the walls had
collapsed on a commercial building under construction and that a
number of boats had sunk in the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we probably got a direct hit last night,'' Dorsette
said. ``There's real extensive damage, a lot of downed trees. It'll
take a lot of cleanup.''
</P>
<P>
   With the damage in the Bahamas in mind, state emergency
management agencies in Georgia, Florida, South Carolina and North
Carolina continued to prepare Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very much like planning for a party,'' said Tom Ditt,
spokesman for the North Carolina Emergency Management Division.
``We know we've got to do these things for the arrival of the
guest, and Dennis is not the best guest in the world. But certain
things have to be in place _ personnel, generators and equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   All along the southeastern coast Saturday, officials met to get
updates on the storm's progress and to prepare evacuation plans.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, emergency management officials had a morning
conference call with representatives from all the communities along
the coast to discuss the forecast. They decided to delay any
evacuation orders because of the uncertainty about the storm's
course and because any threat could be days away.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Charleston, the preparations were influenced by memories
of Hurricane Hugo, a Category 4 hurricane that killed 504 people in
the Caribbean and the Carolinas in 1989. The South Carolina coast
has been evacuated three times since Hugo, for Hurricanes Fran and
Bertha in 1996 and for Hurricane Bonnie last year.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Stith, chief of the Fire and Rescue Department on
Sullivans Island, a barrier island near Charleston that was hit
hard by Hugo, said workers there would spend the day handing out
re-entry stickers to island residents that will allow them back on
the island if it is evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned from Hugo that we want residents to be able to get
back easily,'' while keeping out sightseers or looters, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Gov. Jim Hodges of South Carolina ordered 1,000
National Guard troops and 500 state troopers to prepare for duty
Saturday. In Georgia and North Carolina emergency planners were
also placed on alert.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the emergency preparations continued, surfers and
vacationers all along the coast enjoyed another day of good beach
weather and high surf.
</P>
<P>
   But many residents here were preparing to evacuate if necessary.
At the Lowe's Home Improvement Store in the Mount Pleasant area of
Charleston, Aaron Dumford, the store manager, said business had
more than tripled since midweek.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are buying generators, flashlights, plywood, batteries,
power tools, hammers and nails, tape and gas cans to hold the gas
for the generators,'' Dumford said. ``Today is busier than
yesterday, and tomorrow will probably even be busier still.''
</P>
<P>
   The store is ordering more supplies to keep up, said Dumford. It
normally keeps about 500 sheets of plywood on hand, but has ordered
an additional 3,500 sheets for residents who want to board up their
homes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And at marinas, boats were being taken ashore. At Folly Marina
in Folly Beach, near Charleston, the owner, Cindy O'Rourke, said,
``We have 50 boats here normally, and so far only 18 are left. All
the others have been taken onto shore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping it doesn't come here,'' she added. ``But if it
does, I'm getting out.'' &QL;

REAL ESTATE: IN SAN FRANCISCO, DEVELOPERS BET ON HIGH-RISES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOHN McCLOUD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Traditionally, a home with a view here has meant
living on one of the many hills for which the city is celebrated.
But a group of developers hopes to convince at least a few thousand
residents that living on the upper floors of a contemporary glass
and steel high-rise is as romantic and sophisticated as living in
an Edwardian building atop Russian Hill or in Pacific Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the response to Avalon Towers, a 16-story, 226-unit
apartment complex that is the first high-rise apartment project to
open in San Francisco in a decade, the developers' prospects look
strong. According to Shelby Campbell, a development manager for the
project's developers, AvalonBay Communities Inc. of Alexandria,
Va., 146 units have rented since the two-building complex opened in
July, with new leases being signed daily.
</P>
<P>
   Five other residential high-rise complexes are in construction,
with more in discussion. Developers of four of the other projects
are from New York, which has led some observers to refer to the
trend as Manhattanization. So far, the residential complexes have
attracted minimal criticism, a rarity in this often-contentious
city.
</P>
<P>
   The projects with New York origins are a condominium complex,
with two 17-story towers and one 16-story tower by Reliance
Development Group; a 40-story mixed hotel and condominium project
by Millennium Partners; a 51-story mixed condominium and apartment
tower by Swig-Burris Equities, and a 39-story apartment tower by
Related Cos. All but the Related project are under construction.
</P>
<P>
   According to Kent Swig, a Swig-Burris partner and a former San
Franciscan whose family owned the landmark Fairmont Hotel atop Nob
Hill from the 1930s until last year, his company's $125 million
project will be the tallest residential building west of the
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining two projects have no New York connection. Monahan
Pacific Construction Corp. of San Rafael, Calif., has a 13-story
condominium building in construction, and Carpenter &AMP; Co. of
Cambridge, Mass., will build another 40-story combined hotel and
condominium tower a block from the Millennium Group's.
</P>
<P>
   All the new projects are clustered in the northeast section of
an area known as ``south of Market,'' which lies south of Market
Street, the city's main downtown commercial corridor.
</P>
<P>
   The burgeoning district is home to most of the software,
multimedia and Internet companies that have quickly become a major
force in the city's economy. One part of the district has earned
the nickname Multimedia Gulch.
</P>
<P>
   The area is also home to numerous shops, restaurants, clubs,
museums, performance spaces and, most recently, a
360,000-square-foot entertainment complex with a 15-screen cinema.
</P>
<P>
   A new stadium for the San Francisco Giants baseball team is in
construction at the district's southern edge, as is a second campus
for the University of California at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the area held mostly warehouses, light
industrial facilities and lower-rent office buildings left from the
days when San Francisco was a major port. These older buildings
became popular with startup high-technology ventures, which
appreciated their ostensibly anticorporate esthetic. The influx of
these companies has spurred conversion of substantially more than 1
million square feet of vacant or underutilized properties to
offices with annual rents of $40 a square foot.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Mark, president of Mark Co. and sales director for the
Reliance Group project, Brannan Place, calls the intense
concentration a major selling point for residential development.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are working 60 hours a week.'' he said. ``When
they get home, they want to walk to everything. This is the only
place in the city you can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark is confident that Brannan Place will sell quickly, despite
prices of $500 a square foot for units averaging 1,150 square feet.
San Francisco's homebuying market is extremely tight and buyers
appear willing to pay what it costs to get in.
</P>
<P>
   The rental market is equally tight. According to most real
estate companies, the city's apartment vacancy rate has hovered
around 1 percent for 18 months and rents have risen dramatically.
Rents at Avalon Towers range from $2,400 to $5,400 for one- and
two-bedroom units of 800 to 1,650 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   The residents of the new projects will not represent a typical
cross section of San Francisco. At Avalon Towers, Ms. Campbell
says, 85 percent of the tenants earn more than $100,000 a year.
Nearly three-quarters are single or divorced and 60 percent are
under 40. Two-thirds are new to the city.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Levy, a real estate developer who moved here following a
divorce, says he chose his two-bedroom unit because of its location
in the heart of the city and for the amenities and views. Avalon
Towers has a largely unobstructed view of San Francisco Bay from
three sides and of the city's western hills from the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Levy, who relocated to California from Stamford, Conn., a year
ago, says he likes the project's cosmopolitan image. ``I quickly
determined I didn't want old, didn't want ground floor, didn't want
walkup,'' he said, adding, ``It's simple, easy, free living.''
</P>
<P>
   Swig is counting on people like Levy for his project, which will
have 335 rental apartments and 174 condominiums. Though rents and
prices have not yet been set, he says the building, called the
Century and scheduled for completion in 2001, is aimed at the upper
end of the market.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dan Murphy, an AvalonBay vice president, most of
the projects represent a response to market demand rather than
explicit city policy, though the Millennium, Related and Carpenter
developments are in an official redevelopment zone and are partly
funded with tax-exempt bonds issued by the city's Redevelopment
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   City officials, however, have expressed support for all the
projects and are taking steps to encourage more of them. Susanna
Montana, a senior planner for the city, said that the Planning
Department wanted to raise height limits on Rincon Hill, a 12-block
area that includes Avalon Towers, to 350 feet from the current 250
to encourage development.
</P>

   ``We asked architects representing prospective buyers what they
want to build and we asked property owners, workers and current
residents what kind of area they would like to see,'' she said.
``By and large, the people who are there every day want a 24-hour
neighborhood. To get that, we need to get more people in there, and
that means going up.''

   Whether San Franciscans will take to high-rise living in numbers
sufficient to spur additional development remains to be seen, but
Murphy is confident that they will.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Francisco is a world-class city, and there's a lot of
people who would like to live here but haven't found the right type
of place,'' he said. ``I believe the market is pretty deep,''
</P>
<P>
   Swig agrees. ``I think the need is absolutely there,'' he said.
``With the right context and right design, high-rise living is a
wonderful way of life. It's not for everybody, but I think San
Francisco needs it to attract the kind of people who will keep the
economy moving forward in the 21st century.''

 &HT;    Keyes, Hatch show up, win Alabama's straw poll
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM _ It may not mean much so far as the campaign for the
GOP nomination goes, but Alabama Republicans showed Saturday that
it matters to show up when appealing for their support.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative radio commentator Alan Keyes, with 29 percent of
the vote, and Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, with 27 percent, finished
first and second in the Alabama GOP's first-ever straw poll after
appearing to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who campaigned during the week in
South Carolina and Georgia but skipped this event, came in third
with 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (Keyes and Hatch) were both very, very good speakers, and
I think this was a way of saying thank you very much for coming,''
said former Birmingham Mayor George Seibels.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes' victory came after a stirring speech in which he
encouraged the delegates to vote their true feelings and not go
with Bush just because he's popular. ``If you keep voting for
people who are vague on the issues important to this country, you
will be defeated and you deserve to be defeated,'' he told party
members.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the frenzy around the Iowa straw poll two
weekends ago, this poll as a Republican event with more elephants
than candidates.
</P>
<P>
   While the kids lined up for $3 rides on four elephants outside,
the Alabama Republicans got to hear three of their presidential
candidates: Keyes, Hatch and educator and motivational speaker
Angel Rocker, who had her microphone yanked earlier this year when
she crashed the stage at the Georgia GOP convention in Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker didn't fare as well as Keyes and Hatch. She finished last
among the 10 candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Steve Windom, who co-chairs Bush's Alabama campaign,
saw some silver lining in Bush's finishing far ahead of the other
contenders who didn't show up.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative activist Gary Bauer came in fourth with 7 percent,
followed by Elizabeth Dole, Steve Forbes, Pat Buchanan, Dan Quayle,
John McCain and Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   This state doesn't hold its presidential primary until June 6,
when the nomination will almost certainly be decided. That made it
an easy decision for the major candidates in the race, including
Bush, to skip the state party's first straw poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some folks were disappointed he didn't come in for this but he
will be in Alabama before the campaign is over,'' said Lt. Gov.
Steve Windom, the co-chair of Bush's Alabama campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes, a fiery speaker who has been critical of Bush in earlier
speeches, defended him regarding the recent spate of stories
questioning whether he ever used drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The media has been ``more willing to talk about something that
as far as I can tell, has no basis in a specific allegation . . .
than they care to examine the witnesses and facts and the evidence
against Bill Clinton,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Holding a ``skinny cat'' doll given him by a supporter, Hatch
warned against giving the nomination to Bush simply because he has
raised the most money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember President John Connally, President George Romney,
President Edwin Muskie and President Phil Gramm,'' Hatch said.
``They were all people deemed likely to win because they had
money.''

NITTANY LIONS SHOW FLASH OF THEIR OWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STATE COLLEGE, Pa. _ It was the earliest home opener in Penn
State history _ an August debut under the clear, sunny skies of
central Pennsylvania. And the third-largest crowd in Beaver Stadium
history needed barely six minutes to understand all this sweaty
talk about a national title returning to Happy Valley was more than
a hopeful forecast.
</P>
<P>
   The Nittany Lions rolled to a 41-6 victory over Arizona, a team
coming off a 12-1 season with 16 returning starters, a team that
was ranked in the top five in preseason polls, and was expected to
show these Eastern plodders some West Coast offensive pyrotechnics.
Instead, from the moment Penn State touched the ball, it was clear
that these weren't your father's _ or Papa Joe Paterno's _
predictable old Nittany Lions.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, some old standbys were employed _ a smothering defense,
running plays between the tackles and a blocked punt. But how about
wide receiver reverses, rotating quarterbacks and the return of the
effectively thrown, quick-strike forward pass?
</P>
<P>
   On the very first drive _ a comparatively eternal 80-yard, 2
minute 56-second march _ the Nittany Lions surprised the Wildcats,
as well as the 97,168 on hand, by running a reverse on
third-down-and-2. Chafie Fields danced it 20 yards to the Penn
State 40-yard line. Four plays later, quarterback Kevin Thompson
found him crossing the middle at the 22-yard line, delivered it and
the senior receiver shed Arizona linebacker Scooter Sprotte and
headed to the end zone for a 37-yard touchdown play.
</P>
<P>
   When the Wildcats got the ball for the first time, it looked as
if they were ready for a shootout. Quarterback Keith Smith needed
just three consecutive passes to drive Arizona 62 yards to the
Nittany Lions' 19.
</P>
<P>
   But after Penn State's all-America linebacker LaVar Arrington
dumped Trung Canidate for a 5-yard loss on third-and-2, Arizona
kicker Mark McDonald missed a 40-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   And from there the East-West shootout turned one-sided.
</P>
<P>
   On second-and-3 from the Penn State 30, Fields took an inside
reverse from quarterback Rashard Casey, turned it up the middle and
blurred 70 yards down the middle of the field. Two plays, 46
seconds, and the Nittany Lions were up 14-0.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Wildcats averaged 38 points a game. This year,
they brought back a 1,200-yard plus rusher, Canidate, who is a
Heisman Trophy hopeful and figured to be in the title hunt. But
none of that talent was on display Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Arrington and his fellow Butkus Award candidates, Mac Morrison
and Brandon Short, hounded the Wildcat quarterback duo of Smith and
Ortege Jenkins all day. The tandem combined for 182 yards passing,
and Canidate was held to 31 yards on 10 carries. The Wildcats
didn't score until Leo Mills' 1-yard plunge with 47 seconds
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, Penn State outgained Arizona, 361 to 183
yards, with Canidate rushing for just 30 yards. A Wildcat defense
that gave up only 18 points a game in 1998 was down 31-0 at the
half. Poor tackling and turnovers helped the much-maligned Nittany
Lion offense dominate the highlight reels.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Forney kicked a 31-yard field goal that was set up by
Eric Sturdifen's block of a punt by Arizona's Chris Palic, and Penn
State was off and passing.
</P>
<P>
   Starting quarterback Kevin Thompson, who was booed at a Penn
State basketball game last winter after a 9-3 season, swung a pass
into the flat for tailback Larry Johnson, and Johnson motored
70-untouched yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's second touchdown pass not only gave the Nittany Lions
a 24-0 second-quarter lead, but got him one-third of the way to his
touchdown total for 1998. Last year, Thompson threw just six
touchdowns against eight interceptions. He finished the day 5-for-8
for 135 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Casey, who pushed Thompson last year and again this summer, led
the Nittany Lions to 24 points. In the second quarter, he directed
a five-play, 61-yard drive that was capped by a 15-yard rumble on a
draw play by Aaron Harris.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, he led drives that set up a 47-yard field goal by
Forney to stretch the score to 34-0, as well as a 65-yard march
that was completed by Omar Easy's 1-yard run. Casey finished
6-for-10 for 107 yards.

called ``a multicultural, nihilistic hedonism that is inherently
destructive of a healthy society,'' and who blamed liberals for
Woody Allen's affair with his stepdaughter and for Susan Smith's
murder of her two children, can't expect much sympathy when the
chickens come to roost on his own bedpost. However, on the most
specific and damaging charge of hypocrisy _ that Gingrich was
bashing Bill Clinton for immorality even while he himself carried
on with a House employee _ the issue is a little more complicated.
Because even as other Republicans were calling Clinton everything
up to and including rapist, Gingrich largely refrained. The record

REAL ESTATE: LUMBER SHORTAGE RAISES COST OF BUILDING A HOUSE
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif., Fla., Conn., Hawaii, Ore., R.I., Wash.)  (rk) 
 By ELEANOR CHARLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   All set to sign that contract to build your new home? Don't be
surprised if your builder has inserted a clause saying that if the
price of lumber goes up during construction, so will the price of
your house.
</P>
<P>
   Shortages of lumber in the Northeast, caused in part by a
home-building boom that put demand far ahead of supply, resulted in
a 30 percent rise in prices from January to July of this year.
</P>
<P>
   For an average 2,000-square-foot home the increase in the cost
of lumber is about $4,000, according to Joanne Carroll, a director
of the Connecticut Home Builders' Association and president of JMC
Resources, a housing research firm. The increase for a trophy house
in a swank Connecticut suburb can spiral up by $10,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 6,000-square-foot house can take six months to build and
make the buyer a victim of the market,'' said Norton C. Wheeler,
lumber buyer for United Builders' Supply in Waterford and Niantic,
Conn., and in Richmond and Westerly, R.I. ``But at the lower end,
even though a small house goes up faster, a sharp rise in lumber
costs can knock a first-time buyer out of the box.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years shortages have been exacerbated by cutbacks in
Canadian lumber, the primary source for homes in the Northeastern
United States, that began in 1996 when a quota on importing
Canadian lumber was imposed to protect U.S. prices. Shipments fell
from 16.2 billion to 14.7 billion board feet annually, said Nsimba
Kinuani, chief economist for the Quebec Lumber Manufacturers'
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Other cutbacks resulted from a series of federal logging
restrictions that began in 1990, when 40 percent of American lumber
came from federal forests. Today the figure is down to 10.7
percent, said Butch Bernhardt, spokesman for the Western Wood
Products Association in Portland, Ore. ``Production in 1987 was
23.9 billion board feet,'' he said. ``Last year it was 16.8 billion
board feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasing volatility in the price of lumber has led developers
and builders to seek more stability in overall expenses by focusing
on eliminating waste and reducing labor costs. Labor has been a
problem anyway. What had been a large pool of skilled construction
workers has shrunk to a puddle. Builders believe that the men are
finding less stressful jobs in a robust economy that in Connecticut
has resulted in a 3 to 4 percent unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
   An enormous time and labor saver is the truss _ for floors and
roofs. Manufactured of middle- and lower-grade woods under extreme
pressure and delivered ready to install, it uses leftover wood and
is stronger than conventional framing lumber. Trusses do not pop
nails and they can be fabricated to lengths of as much as 80 feet.
Floor trusses render floors virtually squeak proof and they have no
need for supporting cellar beams and columns.
</P>
<P>
   Another improvement in construction efficiency is panelization _
in which complete sections of framing that can extend to a width of
22 feet and a height of 12 feet are delivered ready to install,
with exterior sheathing attached if desired. They require one or
two unskilled laborers to set in place, rather than half a dozen
experienced carpenters to build them from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   While these elements are more expensive than traditional lumber,
the extra cost is compensated for by savings in labor, construction
time and even paperwork. A few bills for completed trusses and
panels cover what hundreds of invoices for dozens of types and
sizes of lumber, nails and other hardware cover in conventional
construction.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Carl Kuehner, president of Building &AMP; Land Technologies in
Wilton, builders of subdivisions and custom homes, has been using
trusses for a few years, but just started panelization. He
enumerated some of the advantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Panels are numbered in sequence so you can't make a mistake,''
he said. ``You don't have deliveries of 2-by-4s that are wrong and
have to be returned, or wood that's cut wrong by a carpenter on
site. Every nail is in place so there are no worries about lazy
laborers skimping on nails. There is much less time for the
building to be exposed to the elements, and you don't have to pick
up leftover lumber.''
</P>
<P>
   A company in Shelton called BT Building Systems produces
trusses, panels and a complete line of components for houses. The
year-old firm describes itself as the only fully automated building
component manufacturer on the East Coast. Named for its owners,
Arnold Van H. Bernhard and Harold C. Thomas 3rd, it is also a home
builder.

   In executing what it calls its Fast Frame system, it can produce
the framing, roof and floor trusses for a home or apartment complex
to precise measurements in record time. The blueprints are entered
into a computer and the building is produced by the stroke of a
button that sets computerized saws and assembly machines in motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The factory can do from four to six 3,000-square-foot homes in
a single eight-hour shift,'' said Duffy Sasser, plant manager.
``Where a crew of five carpenters might take 20 minutes to make and
stand a wall, we can run 20 walls in that time. Framing is the
biggest time consumer,'' he said. The words wall or panel in this
context mean a ``wall'' of preassembled framing for a house.
</P>
<P>
   For some developers and builders, taking the sting out of
skyrocketing lumber prices can be accomplished by playing the
commodities market.
</P>
<P>
   William A. Ferrigno, owner-president of Sunlight Construction in
Avon, Conn., builder of homes priced from $250,000 to over $1
million, invests in lumber futures. ``We bought a 5-month lumber
futures contract in February and made about $20,000 when prices
peaked in July, but we spent $16,000 on product for three houses,''
he said, resulting in a modest $4,000 profit minus a $100 brokerage
fee. Better than nothing, or a total loss in a down market, he
said. While there is risk involved, most big builders have their
sources within the industry for predicting major price swings.
</P>
<P>
   Kuehner is also ``hedging the market,'' he said, ``either by
buying lumber futures or getting the vendors to lock in the price
for a certain period _ maybe six months. We don't sell any houses
beyond that. In five months we reset the price based on the
market.'' He noted that small builders don't have those options.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler believes that in the next few weeks distributors will
begin to ship lumber ordered at the lower price. And what that
means, he said, ``is that prices will trickle down to the builder
and home buyer in September.''
</P>
<P>
   A strong competitor for wood trusses, as well as an alternative
to conventional framing lumber, is steel. Popular in California,
Florida and Hawaii, it has not caught on in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a few custom homes in Connecticut and Long
Island, and it is being used in the Nehemiah projects _ subsidized
low cost housing in Brooklyn and the Bronx,'' said John Pugliese,
technical engineer at Super Stud Building Products in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   Its advantages are its light weight and strength that is as
great or greater than lumber. Greater truss spans can be produced
simply by changing the gauge. ``Steel doesn't burn, so insurance
costs are lower, and steel prices are a lot more stable than
lumber,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But builders resist having to train crews in steel, teaching
them to use screws instead of nails, eliminate saw cutting, and
builders face higher plumbing and electrical costs because those
trades won't work on steel-framed jobs at regular prices.
</P>
<P>
   Steel's acceptance in other regions, said Lisa Stevens,
marketing director for the North American Steel Framing Alliance in
Washington, is based on practical considerations. It is impervious
to Hawaii's hordes of termites, resistant to earthquake damage in
California and it withstands Florida hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricanes also have a more direct effect on the lumber market.
Lumberyards and construction companies in locations that are
susceptible to hurricanes stock up on half-inch plywood, which is
American made and now sells wholesale for about $2.88 for a
4-by-8-foot sheet. ``Hurricane season shoots up the price of
plywood,'' said Wheeler.

LOOKING FOR A BIG LEAP FROM BRIDGEPORT'S MINOR LEAGUE CLUB TO THE
MAJORS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)  (rk) 
 By ANDREW R. TRIPALDI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charlie Dowd knows what he wants in life and what it will take
to get there. But he also knows that achieving his lifelong dream
of becoming the general manager of a major league baseball team
will not be an easy task.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have an uncle or father who owns a major league
team,'' Dowd said. ``So I have to work my way up.''
</P>
<P>
   Dowd, 37, is the general manager of the Bridgeport (Conn.)
Bluefish, one of six teams in the independent Atlantic League.
Chiefly responsible for the daily business and baseball operations
of the team, Dowd hopes to enhance his organizational skills and
establish a reputation for himself as a capable executive.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year and a half, Dowd's Bluefish have established
their own reputation as the model franchise in the Atlantic League.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the first season of the Atlantic League, Bridgeport
finished with an overall record of 64-36 before losing to Atlantic
City, 3-2, in the League Championship Series. This season, the
Bluefish got off to a 68-32 start in a schedule that has been
expanded to 120 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody loves a winner,'' Dowd noted, and the Bluefish have
the attendance to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Fairfield County, interest in Bridgeport has soared.
Upward of 3,000 people flock to Harbor Yard, home of the Bluefish,
for every game. Dowd attributed the team's commercial success to
its reputation for providing a family atmosphere at a reasonable
cost, with tickets selling for $4 to $10.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made tremendous strides over the last year and a half
in attracting fans,'' Dowd said. ``We are not fully there yet,
because we get more people by word of mouth than by advertising,
but we still have been able to attract a lot of fans. Kids have a
good time here and businessmen can bring their clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Before being hired in Bridgeport by the team's founder and
president, Mikey Herbert, Dowd was the general manager of the New
Haven Ravens, the Double-A affiliate of the Colorado Rockies at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving a team that had a major league affiliation may seem
risky to some, but Dowd never wavered in his decision; he was
determined to elevate his status. But he knew that he was facing a
huge challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever thought that there would be professional baseball
in Bridgeport,'' Dowd said.
</P>
<P>
   The first task Dowd faced after becoming Bridgeport's general
manager was finding a field manager that could effectively run the
team and help promote the product to the Fairfield County
community.
</P>
<P>
   Already having a few candidates in mind, Dowd was introduced by
the ownership group to Willie Upshaw, a former major league player
and coach who lives in Fairfield, Conn. After meeting for only a
few minutes, Dowd realized he had found his man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Willie Upshaw will be a big league manager someday,'' Dowd
said. ``He is a quiet, unassuming man, but has an amazing ability
to teach the game of baseball. He has been an invaluable employee
to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Dowd has the final say on personnel decisions, he
consults Upshaw before making any decision. ``It's been a real
pleasure working with Charlie,'' Upshaw said. ``He's so personable,
he makes it real easy to work together. For the past two years,
we've gotten along like brothers. He's so knowledgeable about the
game, you respect everything he says.''
</P>
<P>
   Dowd is trying to establish a player-friendly organization that
helps the players achieve their goal of making or returning to the
major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Duncan, a former Yankee, spent time with the Bluefish
before signing with Edmonton, Florida's Triple-A affiliate. Kinnis
Pledger, a former first baseman, recently signed with Seattle's
Triple-A affiliate, Tacoma. This season, former major leaguer Alex
Cole is playing center field for Bridgeport.
</P>
<P>
   Dowd hopes that the former Bluefish players spread the word that
Bridgeport can help resurrect careers.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Staten Island, Dowd and his wife, Dawn, have three
children: Casey, Conor and Tristan. But Dowd's personal life would
not stop him from moving his family to another part of the country
if he was offered a job in the major leagues. ``None of us want to
be Bluefish all of our lives,'' Dowd said. ``I have always wanted a
championship ring.''

 &HT;    Residents from Florida to North Carolina not 'off the hook' as
Dennis strengthens
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COCOA BEACH, Fla. _ A strengthening Hurricane Dennis continued
its maddeningly slow and unpredictable trek toward the Southeast
Saturday as edgy coastal residents of Florida, Georgia and the
Carolinas scrambled to prepare for a landfall without having any
idea where it might occur.
</P>
<P>
   The storm added muscle Saturday while taking its own sweet time
moving through the northern Bahamas, where it knocked down trees
and sank a few boats but caused no apparent major injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The National Hurricane Center in Miami said Dennis' course was
uncertain, but it could affect the coast of the Carolinas late
Monday or Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, before they have to do evacuations and that sort of
thing, we'll be able to clear up things,'' said Jerry Jarrell,
director of the hurricane center. ``Right now I can't let anybody
from Georgia to North Carolina off the hook.''
</P>
<P>
   At 5 p.m. Dennis was centered about 180 miles east of Cape
Canaveral, Fla., with sustained winds of 105 mph. It was moving
northwest at 6 mph, and was expected to gradually turn toward the
north today.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane was expected to strengthen into a Category 3
storm, with winds of 111 mph to 130 mph. That would make Dennis
capable of major damage.
</P>
<P>
   Tropical storm warnings and a hurricane watch were in effect
Saturday for the Florida coast north to the Georgia state line, and
the hurricane center said the watches and warnings would be
extended northward as the storm moved. But Dennis appeared most
likely to brush past Florida and Georgia on its way to landfall
somewhere further north.
</P>
<P>
   A heavy surf advisory was posted for the coast of Georgia. Some
people called resorts to cancel their reservations while others
went to the beach to surf in the high waves.
</P>
<P>
   Predictions about the storm's path were complicated by its slow
movement, coupled with uncertainty over the impact of weak
upper-level weather systems that could even kick the hurricane out
to sea.
</P>
<P>
   Some hurricane center computer models suggested Dennis might
veer away from land.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some glimmer of hope,'' Jarrell said Saturday
afternoon. ``Some of the models are beginning to show that it may
miss the coast.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Jarrell and other storm trackers worried that
Dennis might stall again as it did Friday, giving it the chance to
grow even stronger while making its track even less predictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fear of a stall is that it makes the storm surge much
larger because it sits there and pushes water up onto the coast for
a long period of time,'' Jarrell said.
</P>
<P>
   As it moved northward off the coast of South Florida, Dennis
became more organized with a more defined eye.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane center said coastal Florida could have gale force
winds by this morning, and that by South Carolina could expect
tropical storm winds by Monday. If Dennis continues it's current
track, hurricane-force winds would belt the Carolinas by Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Woods-Flowers, the mayor of Mount Pleasant, S.C., just
east of Charleston, said people should at least get ready for
protective measures such as covering windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably not going to start putting my husband on a ladder
until tomorrow,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 South Carolina National Guardsmen were on alert
upstate and some 600 law enforcement officers were on the coast in
case they are needed to direct traffic in the event of an
evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jim Hodges met with emergency officials early Saturday to
be briefed on the storm. ``At this point we are still not talking
about any evacuation, we are simply taking the normal precautions
that should be taken,'' Hodges said.
</P>
<P>
   Winds along Central Florida beaches gusted to 40 mph Saturday
afternoon as Dennis' outer bands blew ever closer. Six-to-ten-foot
waves pounded the beaches, eroding sand dunes and keeping all but
adventurous surfers out of the water.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bahamas, many residents felt they dodged a bullet even
after taking a direct hit from Dennis, which toppled trees and
pounded beaches on the islands of Great Abaco and Grand Bahama, as
well as several smaller keys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seas were very bad,'' said Martin Havill, manager of the
Bluff House Beach Hotel on Green Turtle Cay just off Great Abaco.
``But it really was not a problem. We had a couple of roofs with
some shingles off, a lot of trees down and our pool is full of
leaves. But we had everybody up for breakfast.''
</P>
<P>
   Early reports indicated some damage to buildings in Marsh
Harbour, Great Abaco's largest town, where two buildings under
construction had collapsed walls. But there were no early reports
of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis packed sustained winds of about 80 mph when it roared
over Great Abaco, with gusts as high as 115 mph and huge waves
pounding the outer reefs of several smaller islands that lie just
off Abaco's shores.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seas on the outer reef were unbelievable,'' Havill said.
``The waves were probably 20 feet plus.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the storm reached the Bahamas, Allan Bachewicz flew to
Great Abaco from his home in Fort Lauderdale to secure his 50-foot
sailboat, which he keeps at the Treasure Cay Marina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through several hurricanes here and this was the
worst because the eyewall passed right over us,'' he said. ``My
wife was scared. Last night you had to hang onto stuff when you
were walking.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said that while the winds were powerful, the damage
remained surprisingly light.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could've been much worse,'' Havill said. ``We'll have
everything cleaned up in a day or two.''

EX-OFFICER ARRESTED ON EXPLOSIVES CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky.) (js) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A former New York City police officer who tried to
trade explosives over the Internet was arrested on federal firearms
charges late Friday after the authorities found disassembled guns
and explosives in his Brooklyn home, federal officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Maurice Brunet, 37, also known as Brunet Maurice,
spent 11 years on the police force before going on medical leave
last year. Police and federal officials said the leave stemmed from
an unspecified mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   Brunet had been on restricted duty in the police motor pool in
Woodside, Queens, since 1993 when he was ordered to give up his gun
after threatening a supervisor, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said Brunet drew their attention after he
tried to make a trade over the Internet with a Kentucky sheriff,
offering to swap two grenades for some blasting caps, small
firecrackerlike devices used to detonate explosives.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they started to talk and the law enforcement source
figured out what was happening, he led Brunet on and called us,''
said Joe Green, a spokesman for the federal Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms. ``The explosives could have leveled his
building and done extensive damage to the surrounding ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Brunet could also be indicted on federal charges that he
possessed explosives and sought to deal both them and the firearms
_ two machine pistols and an AR-15 rifle, a civilian version of the
M-16 assault rifle _ without a license, Green said. Noting that the
firearms charges were drawn up to get an arrest and search warrant
for Brunet's basement apartment at 182 E. 32nd St., in the Flatbush
section of Brooklyn, Green said, ``We now know the material found
in a shoe box are C-4 explosives and the grenades are live.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Police Department, Brunet spent four years in a
Marine Corps artillery unit before joining the police force in
1987.
</P>
<P>
   Brunet's lawyer, Michael Hardy, who is also representing him in
a civil suit against the Police Department, said Saturday that his
client was forced to retire from the department after police
officials claimed he was a paranoid schizophrenic.
</P>
<P>
   After a hearing on the firearms charges was postponed Saturday,
Hardy said he could not comment on Brunet's arrest other than to
say that his client, who is black, ``wasn't building a black
militia or anything out there in Brooklyn.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although it remains unclear what Brunet intended to do with the
blasting caps, federal officials said he seemed excited to make the
trade when he struck up a conversation last month with a sheriff in
Ashland, Ken., in a chat room for gun buffs.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff immediately contacted the firearms bureau, the
authorities said. Brunet continued to communicate with the sheriff
in Internet chat rooms and through e-mail, with the sheriff feeding
the information to federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   In one of their last Internet correspondences, Brunet gave the
sheriff his telephone number _ giving federal agents a way to find
out his address _ and tried to set up a meeting to do the trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the e-mails he told the sheriff that he was a retired
police officer and that he wanted to trade two hand grenades for 20
blasting caps and 250 feet of military fuse,'' said Capt. John
Murphy, the commanding officer of the New York City Police
Department's Organized Crime Investigative Division. He said that
Brunet complained of being short of money but said that he would
come up with enough to also purchase parts to make his guns fully
automatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then in the telephone conversation, he actually claimed to
have a small amount of C-4 plastic explosives and various amounts
of automatic weapons,'' said Murphy. ``Due to public safety
concerns, we decided to go ahead and move in.''
</P>
<P>
   Local and federal officers raided Brunet's apartment at 10:30
p.m. Friday, the police said. Two agents who had been conducting
surveillance grabbed him as he walked out to run an errand and then
dozens of other officers rushed inside.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said Brunet denied having any weapons. But the apartment
was strewn with magazines about guns, hunting and the lifestyle of
soldiers of fortune. No guns were seen until an agent noticed what
looked like a hidden compartment above a radiator.
</P>
<P>
   According to the police, the compartment was full of gun parts
and grenades, only one of which was active. They said another agent
searching a closet found a shoe box containing bricks of a white,
claylike substance that later turned out to be C-4, a powerful
military explosive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears all of the weapons were send through UPS,'' Murphy
said. ``We are now going though his computer, his bank statements
and correspondences we found from different firearms dealers.''

FOR THE GIANTS' RECEIVERS, PICKING A NUMBER IS AN ART
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was an unexpected and startling announcement when the Giants
cut venerable wide receiver Chris Calloway in February. A savvy
leader of the receiving corps, Calloway was esteemed and admired by
his peers, regarded as a helmsman for the team's younger receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Calloway's departure was like a thunderbolt for the five
remaining Giants receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Alford, a second-year receiver, immediately called the
team. He wanted Calloway's No. 80 for the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Calloway's veteran presence will not be missed
this season, but a favorite jersey number is important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your favorite number is like a good pair of house slippers,''
said Alford, who wore 80 at Purdue, in high school and on his first
pee-wee football team. ``I called the day Chris was let go because
I knew 80 was open. I didn't know the procedures for asking for a
number, so I asked.''
</P>
<P>
   David Patten wanted the number, too. ``But I thought I'd wait at
least a couple days before I called,'' he said. ``I kind of wanted
to let people get over Chris' exit.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad move.
</P>
<P>
   First come, first served. Alford, who wore No. 84 last season,
is wearing No. 80 this season.
</P>
<P>
   That did not stop Patten. He changed his number anyway, from 83
to 85. And there was a domino effect as Joe Jurevicius changed his
number from 86 to 84.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is one started by Amani Toomer a year ago. He went
from No. 89 to No. 81 and had a breakthrough 1998 season. Toomer is
now a starter with a new $11.2 million contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   Giants fans tuning in to watch their team for the first time
this season are going to need a scorecard to know who is who. It
can get confusing. A uniform number is more than two digits on a
synthetic jersey. It is a player's identity. Just ask Patten.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had family members and friends calling me after the two
preseason games asking me if I'm still on the team,'' said Patten,
who has four catches and a touchdown reception during the
preseason. ``They called and said, `I saw an 83 on TV, but that's
not you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Pete Mitchell, the Giants' new tight end is wearing No. 83, his
old number with the Jacksonville Jaguars. Mitchell is 6 foot 2, 245
pounds. Patten is 5-9, 190 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I hope that 83 doesn't look like me,''' Patten said.
</P>
<P>
   Family members had a role in Jurevicius' decision to switch
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family told me I looked too fat in 86,'' he said. ``They
said I looked like a big old tight end. So I went back to my glory
days. I wore 84 in high school.''
</P>
<P>
   The player who started this trend, Toomer, said he changed from
No. 89 to 81 last year because 81 was the reverse of his number at
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's makes you feel better, but let's be serious. It's still
you in there whatever the number,'' Toomer said. ``The thing is
they just hand you a number when you're a rookie. Guys feel like
changing.''
</P>
<P>
   But it takes a certain status.
</P>
<P>
   Patten did not think to complain about his No. 83 in his first
two years with the Giants. An undrafted free agent coming out of
the Arena League, Patten accepted whatever they gave him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so happy to be getting any number,'' Patten said.
</P>
<P>
   But he wore No. 5 at Western Carolina and when Alford beat him
to No. 80, Patten thought 85 would be at least a piece of his
college number. He sees the number change as a new beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story on me used to be that I was trying to stay on the
team,'' Patten said. ``That was 83. Now when people see 85,
hopefully they'll see a new person, a receiver who's taking it up a
level. I'm not just trying to stay with the team, I'm here to make
big plays.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, as comfy slippers or good-luck charms, jersey
numbers define the player in football, where helmets and face masks
make it harder to identify a player's face. But the changing
numbers had autograph-seeking fans at the Giants' training camp
this summer befuddled.
</P>
<P>
   Fans often come to camp with trading cards for players to sign.
The pictures are all from the past season, so this year, the fans
came with pictures of Patten in No. 83, Jurevicius in No. 86, and
so on.
</P>
<P>
   That meant that the rookie tight end Dan Campbell, the Giants'
new No. 86, was asked to sign Jurevicius' trading card. Campbell
would then have to send the fans over to Jurevicius, who fans
mistook for Alford, since he was wearing No. 84, Alford's old
number.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can take some explaining,'' Patten said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, quarterback Kent Graham has not thrown to the wrong
receiver, bewildered by all the number changes in his receiving
corps.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no way,'' Graham said, smiling. ``I study those things at
night: you know, go over the names, go over the numbers like flash
cards. You know, `Jurevicius, 84. Patten, 85. Alford 80.' I've got
that down cold.''

<HEADLINE>
REAL ESTATE: IN MANHATTAN'S WEST VILLAGE, A DEVELOPERS' GOLD RUSH 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID W. DUNLAP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A grove of feathery Chinese scholar trees took root
this year in what was once a realm of meathooks and stiletto heels
at Washington and Jane streets in the far West Village. A nearby
sign, ``Please keep out of fountain,'' does not wholly discourage
young waders.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, another sign hung at this intersection:
``Hookers and johns beware. We take your numbers.'' Overhead,
casting a perpetual shadow, was the abandoned freight railroad
viaduct known as the High Line.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Rockrose Development Corp. has dismantled the High
Line and built 265 apartments _ and the public plaza at 99 Jane St.
where the scholar trees stand _ along the viaduct route. ``The day
it was removed, it was like lifting a weight off the West
Village,'' said K. Thomas Elghanayan, the president of Rockrose.
</P>
<P>
   That the lid is off, there is no doubt. Besides 99 Jane St., at
least eight other apartment buildings and two hotels are newly
completed, under construction or being planned from Hudson Street
to the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether this physical transformation will
fundamentally alter the character of the West Village, a
rough-edged amalgam of 19th-century industry and 20th-century
artistry, of iconoclasm and neighborliness, of creative freedom and
sexual license. New Yorkers who fled there to escape crush and buzz
are distressed to see taxis full of fashionistas rumbling over the
Belgian block paving, with construction cranes on the horizon. What
Jane Jacobs called an ``intricate sidewalk ballet'' is turning into
a duel for the future of the Village waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole area, in theory, can look like New Jersey east,''
said Arthur W. Strickler, the district manager of Community Board 2
and a West Villager for two decades, referring to the
concrete-and-glass palisades on the opposite shore. ``My prediction
is that there's not going to be an empty lot anywhere on West
Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Not if the experience of Tamarkin Co. is any barometer. Buyers
have already claimed seven of the nine floor-through lofts in its
11-story condominium, which is still under construction at 495 West
St., near 12th Street. Among the quick sellers: two duplex
penthouses with 16-foot-high steel casement windows overlooking the
waterfront, priced at $4.2 million. For raw space.
</P>
<P>
   Now that it is possible to find boutiques in the meat market, a
boutique hotel seems the natural next step. Madison Equities and
Broadway Management are planning just that at Hudson and 13th
streets: the 16-story, 195-room, $52 million Greenwich Village
Hotel, which is to open in 2001. Designed by Frank Williams &AMP;
Associates, its two-story open arcades recall the voids in nearby
factories through which the High Line tracks once ran.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Meier, the architect who converted the Bell Telephone
Laboratories at West and Bethune streets into the Westbeth artists
housing complex, is returning to the West Village after 30 years.
He is designing a project for the restaurateurs Jean-Georges
Vongerichten, Phil Suarez and Bob Giraldi and the hoteliers Richard
Born and Ira Drukier. They plan a condominium of up to 15 stories
on the north corner of West and Perry streets and a two-story
restaurant on the south corner, connected to a six-story garage
that will be turned into a 75-room hotel and gain a six-story
addition with condos. The project could cost as much as $60 million
and take two years.
</P>
<P>
   One block east, the two-story garage at 132 Perry St. that has
housed the Cooper Classics automobile dealership since 1978 is to
make way for an 11-story condominium developed by Axel Stawski,
Anthony Paul Leichter and Estera Lisker and designed by Lee Harris
Pomeroy Architects.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a scarlet 1959 Cadillac convertible and a black 1960
Corvette were all that remained on the floor at Cooper. Elliot
Cuker, the founder, confessed that it was a poignant moment,
although Cooper will reopen across the street as a combination
showroom and art gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Cuker is indirectly fueling the transformation of the
neighborhood with the sale of his building, but he believes the
essence of the West Village _ what he called ``a ghetto of the
spirit'' _ will survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not going to change because the people aren't going to
change,'' he said. ``There's something about the West Village that
draws a certain kind of person.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Four of the seven purchasers at 495 West St. already live in the
West Village, said the broker, Jan Hashey, a senior vice president
of Douglas Elliman. Buyers are in the fine arts, publishing and
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Imagination helps. ``I'm creating blank, raw shells for people
to create their own vision,'' said Cary Tamarkin, the architect and
developer of the $13.5 million project, who took the same approach
in the renovation two years ago of 140 Perry St.
</P>
<P>
   That is also the plan for the 132 Perry St. project. Nine
full-floor units of 3,000 square feet will come largely unfinished,
to give buyers the greatest flexibility in layout. It will include
20,000 square feet of commercial space, ideally for ``arts-related
enterprises,'' Stawski said. Demolition is to begin next month,
with completion late next year. About the design of the brick
building, he said, ``I've always believed you fit into the
neighborhood and this will fit in.''
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, however, it is not required to fit into the
neighborhood, since the south side of Perry Street between
Washington and Greenwich Streets _ unlike the north side _ lies
outside the 30-year-old Greenwich Village Historic District.
Therefore, the design is not subject to review by the Landmarks
Preservation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The western boundary of the district, excluding everything
between Washington Street and the river, has long been a sore point
for preservationists and many Villagers. ``It's outrageous that the
Landmarks Commission, then and now, has refused to bring the
landmark district all the way over to the waterfront,'' Strickler
said.
</P>
<P>
   Most development is occurring outside the district.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll regret it in years to come when we see a waterfront that
becomes almost like a checkerboard of foreign pieces,'' warned Ben
Green, executive director of the Federation to Preserve the
Greenwich Village Waterfront and Great Port.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer J. Raab, the chairwoman of the commission, said the
boundaries had been drawn thoughtfully and that the ensemble of
riverfront blocks was not sufficiently coherent for historic
designation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A wholesale extension, with all of the vacant land and
noncontributing buildings, is not something we would be interested
in pursuing,'' she said. ``But we'd be very interested in looking
at pockets of historic properties that should be protected.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the Greenwich Village Society for Historic
Preservation, which conducted a building-by-building survey 10
years ago, will compile a list of exceptionally significant
buildings and blocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ideal is to protect as much as possible,'' said Kimberly
Stahlman Kearns, executive director of the society. ``But we're
trying to look at smaller pockets in response to the fact that we
haven't been getting anywhere. Time is of the essence here.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the obvious candidates are the tiny Charles Lane alleyway
and Weehawken Street, a one-block stretch of the 19th century with
a red-brick stable built in 1836 and a clapboard oyster house from
1849.
</P>
<P>
   The society will also be looking at the meat market, Ms. Kearns
said. The meat industry has shrunk drastically in recent years,
leaving behind its distinctive cold storage houses with their long,
deep canopies over sidewalk loading platforms.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh carcasses are no longer shipped to the market for cutting
and packing, so there is no need for much of that space, said Noel
L. Berk, an associate director of Cushman &AMP; Wakefield. She recently
sold a row of warehouses on 10th Avenue, between 13th and 14th
streets, to William Gottlieb, perhaps the largest landowner in the
West Village.
</P>
<P>
   Several big wholesalers are holding the fort. ``It's shrinking,
but there's still a lot of meat handled out of this market,'' said
Hank Guerra, vice president of Maggio Beef Corp., which has
operated at Washington and Gansevoort streets for 28 years.
</P>
<P>
   Maggio has 75 employees and offers a full line of meats and
poultry to supermarket chains, mom-and-pop stores, caterers,
restaurants and even individual shoppers with carts. Guerra said
the market is in a perfect spot from which to reach customers
around the metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing that galleries will pay higher rents, Guerra added, ``I
don't think an art exhibit is going to employ as many people as we
do or feed as many people.''
</P>
<P>
   Easily the highest-profile newcomer to the meat market will be
the Greenwich Village Hotel. One of the developers, Robert
Gladstone of Madison Equities, and the architect, Frank Williams,
are already collaborating on the Planet Hollywood Hotel under
construction in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   The Hudson Street hotel will have duplex suites with terraces
behind the open arcades, which resemble the buttresses atop Raymond
Hood's Tribune Tower in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Gladstone believes the offbeat location will be a draw itself.
``New York has been synthesized into a city more like London, Paris
and San Francisco, where people are going to stay in
neighborhoods,'' he said. ``To me, what's called the meat market is
a neighborhood that's becoming more neighborly every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The fashion photographer Albert Watson and his wife and agent,
Elizabeth, moved to the neighborhood in 1985, when the ``hookers
and johns'' warning was on display.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see them here anymore,'' Mrs. Watson said. ``Now I'm
seeing a lot of children, which is lovely. I see families with
young children and dogs going down to the river for skateboarding
and Rollerblading and all the stuff that goes on down there.''

 NEW YORK: down there.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A seven-lane boulevard, Route 9A, with planted medians and a
paved pathway for bicyclists, joggers, skaters and pedestrians, has
replaced the open scar left by the demolition of the West Side
Highway in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Another verdant patch is the public plaza known as Washington
Commons at 99 Jane St. It resulted from negotiations between
community leaders and Rockrose, which needed a variance to build a
parking garage on the site. ``My big joy is to see it used as I
envisioned it,'' said the designer of the plaza, Marie
Drews-D'Angelo. ``Children make a beeline to sit by the fountain
and play with the water.'' Or in it.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, there were almost no youngsters across the street
in the West Coast Apartments, said Sofia Estevez, director of
operations at Rockrose. Today, she said, half the families there
have children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm astonished just standing in the lobby and seeing all the
strollers, nannies and dogs,'' Ms. Estevez said. A children's play
area has been added on the rooftop.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, families in the West Village come in all varieties.
Richard Cantor of Cantor-Pecorella, who was the sales agent at 99
Jane St., said one gay and one lesbian couple had bought large
apartments because they planned to adopt children.
</P>
<P>
   Long a haven for gay men and lesbians, the West Village assumed
an even greater role with the arrival of the Lesbian and Gay
Community Services Center, which is operating at 1 Little West 12th
St. while its permanent home at 208 W. 13th St. is undergoing
extensive renovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five thousand people a week are coming through the doors,''
said Richard D. Burns, the executive director.
</P>
<P>
   The center's temporary home is in a corner property owned by
Gottlieb, around which Madison Equities will build its hotel.
Gottlieb, who declined to be interviewed for this article, has a
reputation as an owner more interested in acquiring property than
in selling or developing it. He has some 50 parcels in the West
Village.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can sell to him, but you can't buy from him,'' said
Elghanayan of Rockrose, which sold Gottlieb an entire blockfront
along Gansevoort Street, between Greenwich and Washington streets.
``I'm glad he's there. He keeps it gritty.''
</P>
<P>
   Grittiness is a prized quality in the West Village and a number
of the new projects consciously employ the idiom of 19th- and early
20th-century factories, warehouses and commercial buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Himmelstein has designed a six-story home at 399 West St.,
near 10th Street, for a family that wishes not to be named,
although Himmelstein said they had spent a long time in Hong Kong
and were accustomed to life on a busy waterway. He said his design
is meant to be a ``muscular maritime facade, an old building left
from a thriving commercial port.''
</P>
<P>
   The 495 West St. project bears a strong enough kinship to the
Starrett-Lehigh Building of 1931 that one has to look twice to
realize that it is a brand new condo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a rough and tough quality to the edge of the city,''
Tamarkin said. ``The piers. The smokestacks of the old sanitation
facility. There's something beautiful and monumental about that. I
wanted to capture something of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockrose, too, sought to emulate the past at 99 Jane St.,
designed by Fox &AMP; Fowle. ``We wanted it to look like a loft
building that had been converted into an apartment house,''
Elghanayan said. ``In this neighborhood, people prefer that
product.''
</P>
<P>
   And if anyone knows the neighborhood, it is Rockrose, having
built or renovated 1,333 housing units there since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Rockrose is a triumvirate of brothers: Thomas, 54, who was
trained as a businessman at Harvard; H. Henry, 59, who was trained
as a lawyer at New York University; and Frederick, 51, who was
trained as an engineer at Cornell University.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, Henry and Thomas formed an investment fund for wealthy
Iranians that put some money in Manhattan real estate. Needing a
name for the fledgling company, the Elghanayans borrowed the
``Rockrose'' from Rockrose Place in Forest Hills Gardens, Queens,
where their father lived.
</P>
<P>
   After an unhappy experience with a small-time renovator on the
Upper West Side, the Elghanayans decided to get into the renovation
and redevelopment business themselves. Frederick joined Rockrose,
as did a fourth brother, Jeffrey, an architect. (He has since moved
to California.)
</P>
<P>
   Their first projects were scattered through Manhattan and
Brooklyn, but in the late '70s, they began focusing on the West
Village. ``This was a grungy neighborhood adjacent to a very good
neighborhood,'' Thomas Elghanayan recalled. ``The buildings were
cheap. It was not zoned for residential but there were plans to
rezone it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, they bought a 12-story warehouse at Washington and 10th
streets and turned it into the Shepherd House apartments. It opened
in 1979, the same year that Rockrose paid $325,000 for the
blockfront parcel on which 99 Jane St. would later rise.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the last load of freight _ three boxcars of frozen
turkeys _ rolled down the High Line and into the meat market. The
southern end of the market was rezoned for residential development
in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   During the late '80s, Rockrose opened the West Coast, at 95-97
Horatio St.; the Archive, at 666 Greenwich St. and 110-14 Horatio
St. Then it bought a five-block stretch of the High Line from
Conrail and, in 1991, demolished it from Bank to Gansevoort
streets. Where the tracks had run through the West Coast, Rockrose
filled in the structure with 33 apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on the High Line, it built 100 Jane St. as an
``80-20'' project, with 20 percent of the apartments for
lower-income tenants, and 99 Jane St. as a condominium, selling for
about $600 a square foot. It sold out before it opened.
</P>
<P>
   The Elghanayans have now turned their attention to the
renovation of 252 Seventh Ave., between 24th and 25th Streets, as
the Chelsea Mercantile condominium.
</P>
<P>
   They are finished with development in the West Village. ``We
were all young men when we started this,'' Elghanayan said of their
adventures along Washington Street. ``Today, sitting where I am, I
wouldn't have started it. It was too ambitious. There were too many
risks and uncertainties.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he said he is proud of Rockrose's role. ``What we
did there was the equivalent of what a municipality would do as
urban redevelopment,'' Elghanayan said, ``and probably more
efficiently and artistically than government could do.''
</P>
<P>
   From the other side of the bargaining table, Green, of the
waterfront preservation group, offered this assessment of Rockrose:
``They were forthcoming. This didn't happen without a lot of
pressure but they certainly did keep channels open.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they wanted to disturb the context of the
neighborhood,'' he said. ``We didn't always agree on what that
was.''
</P>
<P>
   At Maggio Beef, Guerra has his own notion of context. ``They
build these very expensive condominiums and then complain that the
refrigeration on our trailer trucks keeps them awake,'' he said.
``We tell them, `Our trailer trucks were here before your
condominiums.' ''

 &HT;    Andretti agrees to extension
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRISTOL, Tenn. _John Andretti will be driving the famous No. 43
car for three more seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Andretti, 36, and Petty Enterprises announced an extension
through 2002 on Saturday at Bristol Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having John with us for at least the next three years
continues our work toward taking Petty Enterprises back to the top
of NASCAR racing,'' said Kyle Petty, who owns the team along with
his father, Richard Petty.
</P>
<P>
   Andretti is in his sixth full season of Cup racing, boasts two
career victories, and ranks 13th in the points standings this year.
</P>
<P>
   Musical chairs
</P>
<P>
   With Andretti agreeing to an extension, Robert Yates Racing has
one less driver to consider for the No. 28 car, which will be
vacated by Kenny Irwin after the season. Ricky Rudd, Wally
Dallenbach, and Joe Nemechek, among others, are candidates for the
car.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are several guys I'd like to work with, but I can't put
a percentage on how close we are with anybody,'' Yates said
Saturday. ``Probably the only percentage I could tell you is that
I'm going to go 100-percent crazy if I don't figure out something
soon.''
</P>
<P>
   2000 Monte Carlos
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 Chevy Monte Carlo will have its first extensive test
run Monday and Tuesday at Gateway International Raceway in Madison,
Ill. Bobby Hamilton, Sterling Marlin, Ken Schrader, David Green,
Jerry Nadeau, Geoffrey Bodine, Dale Earnhardt and Mike Skinner are
scheduled to drive the NASCAR-approved cars at the 1.25-mile track.
Chevy will have the cars tested again in late October.
</P>
<P>
   Another night race?
</P>
<P>
   Night races are the latest craze on the Cup circuit, and the
Southern 500 may start after sundown in the near future. Darlington
Raceway is studying the idea, and has received permission from its
parent company, International Speedway Corp., to use $3 million for
lights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to see if it makes fiscal sense,'' Darlington Raceway
president Jim Hunter said. ``But I'm the wrong person to ask
because I really want them here.''
</P>
<P>
   Bristol, Charlotte, Daytona and Richmond are the four tracks
that already play host to night races.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be wild (having the Southern 500 at night),'' Jeff
Gordon said. ``Seeing the walls is pretty important, and if we put
the Darlington stripes up on the walls at night, that would be
interesting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been amazed with the lighting systems. Most places we
go, (drivers) see better at night than we do in the day. I'm for
it, but I've also heard (others) say they'd rather see one pit row
(at Darlington) before we see lights, which I don't think is a bad
idea.''

8-28 -- Leonard LeShay, 80, and a fellow member of the Metropolitan
Association of Sea Kayakers, get ready for a 10 hour trip around
the island of Manhattan. As a senior Kayaker, LeShay has several
decades on other kayakers who paddle around Manhattan on the
33-mile trips. But don't tell him that. ``If anyone says, 'Pop,' I
kill them,'' he says. ``I'm in there as an equal. I help them. They

Leonard LeShay, 80, is an old hand in a thriving pastime of
kayaking around the New York region. Nearly every weekend for the
past 12 years, through sweltering summers and shivering winters,
LeShay has hauled a kayak from his home in Fresh Meadows, Queens,
to rivers and bays around the Northeast. For LeShay, kayaking was a
natural evolution in his life. He was born in the Bronx to a family
of ``water people.'' He says his mother swam regularly in the
Atlantic Ocean until she was 86. His father was an avid fisherman.

stadium at the National Tennis Center should be named after the
late Arthur Ashe. In her first Open as president of the USTA,
Levering now has another challenge -- filling the ludicrously
oversized 21,000-seat stadium with actual tennis fans. ``If you put
the stars in the stadium court, very often they have easy matches
in the early rounds,'' says Levering. ``People might go to the
hotly contested matches, and the stadium is one-third empty.''

HERNANDEZ LEADS WITH HIS FASTBALL AS YANKS DOWN MARINERS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pitchers are great imitators. If they see somebody
else having success with a certain pitch, a different approach,
they will quickly adopt and adapt. Orlando Hernandez, an off-speed
pitch artist, watched Roger Clemens bury the Seattle Mariners with
fastballs Friday night, and then Hernandez went out Saturday and
did the same.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez struck out 13 batters in eight innings, holding the
Mariners to one run. Scott Brosius' two-out single in the bottom of
the ninth inning scored Chad Curtis with the winning run as the New
York Yankees edged the Mariners, 2-1. Mariano Rivera, who pitched
the ninth inning, was the winning pitcher in a game played before
54,787 at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez led off the bottom of the ninth against Jose
Paniagua, and swung and missed for strike three. But the pitch
eluded catcher Tom Lampkin in the late afternoon shadows of Yankee
Stadium and Martinez took first base. Joe Torre, the Yankee
manager, had the option of using either Chad Curtis or Ricky Ledee
as a pinch-runner, but the slow-footed Martinez stayed in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Paniagua's first pitch to Chili Davis skittered about 10 feet
from Lampkin. Martinez tried to advance and was barely thrown out
by Lampkin for the first out of the inning. Davis eventually drew a
walk and was replaced at first by Curtis, who stole second on a
delayed steal. Jorge Posada lined out to center, and Curtis tagged
up and moved to third, with two outs.
</P>
<P>
   The left-handed hitting Ricky Ledee was announced as the
pinch-hitter for Shane Spencer, and Lou Piniella, the Seattle
manager, could have called for a left-handed reliever, Steve
Sinclair, who had warmed up. Paniagua remained in the game and
intentionally walked Ledee, bringing Brosius to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius smashed a liner to the left of second baseman David
Bell, and the ball glanced off the end of Bell's glove and rolled
far enough away that he had no play as Curtis scored.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez usually pitches backwards, to use the players'
terminology. He will throw breaking balls in situations when most
pitchers will throw fastballs, and throw fastballs when others will
throw breaking balls. Facing the Mariners Saturday, Hernandez in
the early innings, used a frontal attack _ fastball after fastball
after fastball _ and the Seattle hitters, probably assuming his
next pitch would be something slow or breaking, kept being
overpowered.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Hernandez faced the Mariners, on Aug. 6, he lasted
just a third of an inning, the shortest outing of his career, but
he pitched eight innings Saturday. He did not allow a hit to 16
consecutive batters, a streak that began in the third inning.
Hernandez struck out shortstop Alex Rodriguez three times, catcher
Dan Wilson twice and third baseman Russ Davis three times, and his
13 strikeouts matched his career high.
</P>
<P>
   But his teammates struggled to support him with runs. Martinez
singled leading off the second inning and eventually scored on
Spencer's run-scoring single, before Raul Ibanez slammed a hanging
curveball from Hernandez into the right-field stands in the third,
tying the game.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch led off the third inning with a double, and
after Derek Jeter had taken a big and aggressive swing at a pitch,
Piniella walked to the mound, gathered his infielders and began
barking angry words at Knoblauch _ apparently accusing him of
stealing signs.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams, the Yankees' cleanup hitter, had two singles.
He did not take regular batting practice Friday or Saturday, to
ease the burden on his left shoulder, which has bothered him since
June; his pain became even more acute during the off day on
Thursday, and it could be that the shoulder will need extensive
treatment in the off-season _ surgery is a possibility. Williams
can play, but it was evident Saturday that the ailment affects the
right-handed swing of Williams, a switch-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared to have difficulty Saturday swinging at any pitches
above his thigh, perhaps a reflection of the weakness in his
shoulder; in his first two right-handed at-bats, Williams hit
ground balls to the left side of the field, and in his last at-bat,
he reached out and poked a single through the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Williams has been a linchpin in the Yankees' batting order
because his prowess as a right-handed hitter gives Torre's lineup
balance. If Williams remains a greater threat as a left-handed
batter into the playoffs, managers will feel free to attack the
middle of the Yankees' lineup with left-handed relievers.

</P>
<P>
   _ While every state has seen its federal subsidy grw, the
politically volatile disparities between the states have grown as
well. That increases the likelihood of bitter new fights in 2002
when the current financing formula expires.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the states with the largest subsidy, New York and
Alaska, received about $5,000 per case, while the state with the
smallest subsidy, Mississippi, received about $1,460. That is a
ratio of just over 3-to-1. Federal financing at the time was based
on a complex formula that took into account how poor a state was
and how much of its own money it spent on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with each state's rolls declining at a different pace,
those differences have grown even more exaggerated. By last year
the state with the highest subsidy, Wisconsin, received $21,600 per
case. That is nearly six times the amount the government sends to
its neighbor, Illinois, which received the lowest payment, $3,400 a
case.
</P>
<P>
   Financing emerged as one of the most divisive issues during the
congressional debate over the 1996 law. States with lesser
subsidies brought the process to a halt when they demanded _ and
eventually received _ more money.
</P>
<P>
   _ Much of the windfall has failed to translate into new benefits
or services for the needy. Though federal subsidies for each family
have risen by 64 percent, the rise in actual spending has been much
more modest _ just 28 percent, when total spending is divided by
the caseload.
</P>
<P>
   That is because significant federal sums are going unspent, and
others are being used merely to replace previous state spending.
With federal financing fixed, states cut their own spending last
year by 21 percent or nearly $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Examine the math in Pennsylvania. Last year, the state received
$257 million more than it would have gotten under the old system.
But it left $158 million of the federal money unspent, and it
reduced its own welfare spending by $109 million. The state's
federal subsidy per family rose 56 percent. But its actual
spending, when divided by its caseload, rose much more modestly, by
23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ The states slowest to spend the anti-poverty dollars include
some of the neediest. By the end of last year, New Mexico, the
poorest state, had spent just 69 percent of the money awarded to
date. Mississippi and Louisiana, the next two poorest, spent 61
percent and 63 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   On average, by the end of last year, states had spent 78 percent
of the $34 billion awarded since the new law took hold. Wyoming and
Idaho are are, by far, the most reluctant to use the federal money,
spending 9 percent and 12 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen states had accumulated more than $100 million in
unspent anti-poverty money. They include Texas ($326 million),
Tennessee ($169 million) and Louisiana ($122 million) _ all home to
infamous stretches of entrenched poverty.
</P>
<P>
   At most these ledgers can offer a limited look at the poor. They
measure what states are spending _ not what states are spending on
or whether their spending is effective. They make no distinction
between the $14 million Mississippi spent to raise welfare payments
and the $35 million it spent on new computers for state officials.
(The Mississippi benefit is now $170 a month for a family of three,
a raise of $50.)
</P>
<P>
   No one knows whether new spending will reduce poverty, as
advocates hope, or increase waste and dependency, as critics of
social spending fear. And if states have more money per case, that
is only because the caseloads keep shrinking _ that is the the
central development of the new welfare age, and it can signal
either new progress (for those with jobs) or new distress (for
those merely dropped from the rolls).
</P>
<P>
   As of March, the nation's welfare rolls had dropped 47 percent
from the 1994 peak and in six states they dropped more than 70
percent. Eyeing such numbers, some members of Congress argue that
states now have more money than they need, and they are talking of
taking some back. Among them is House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill., who made a brief pass at reducing the state grants during
congressional budget deliberations last month.
</P>
<P>
   In response, a coalition of unlikely partners has emerged,
serenading the governors (31 Republicans, 17 Democrats, one
independent and Ventura) with a use-it, don't-lose-it refrain. That
group includes liberal advocates with long wish lists of programs
for the poor; Clinton administration officials, from the president
on down, who want to protect domestic spending; and some of the
congressional Republicans who wrote the 1996 law and are eager to
see it produce tangible benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time is rapidly approaching where it will not be possible
to protect these funds,'' wrote Rep. Nancy L. Johnson, R-Conn., in
a March letter to all 50 governors. ``Spend the money.''
</P>
<P>
   While last year's figures are the most recent available, some
analysts say spending has risen in recent months as states grasp
the size of the surpluses and the range of programs they can
create. ``States are recognizing there's money there and they can
do things they never imagined before,'' said Jack Tweedie, a
welfare specialist at the National Conference of State
Legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   But, paradoxically the exhortations to spend have made some
state officials even more reluctant to create new programs, for
fear they will be left to finance them alone. ``Everybody's afraid
the money will be taken away,'' said state Rep. Garnett Coleman of
Texas, a Democrat from Houston who sits on the appropriations
committee.
</P>
<P>
   When states do spend, they are much more likely to expand
services _ like job placement or especially child care _ than to
raise cash benefits. Many states have doubled or even tripled
spending on child care, often broadening eligibility to all
low-income families. Florida has gone even further, adding $66
million in other services for families not on welfare, including
drug and mental health treatment. ``It's a new way of thinking
about welfare _ getting into more of a preventive mode,'' said Don
Winstead, the state's director of welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
   While expanding services, Florida now spends only 30 percent of
its welfare money on monthly grants to the poor and it has not
raised the payment, $303 for a family of three, in seven years.
Nationally the average welfare grant for a mother with two children
has risen by about 5 percent since 1995, to $408 a month, about a
third of the amount the federal government says a family needs to
escape poverty.
</P>
<P>
   While states promised to do more with less, some are doing less
with more.
</P>
<P>
   Six states have cut grants, including Idaho, which now offers an
average payment of $3,300 a year. Meanwhile, its federal subsidy
per case soared to more than $17,000 last year, and more than
three-quarters of its money remained unspent.

</ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   In 50 state budgets reside 50 different stories. The bold
spending in Wisconsin, the paralysis in New Mexico, and the
deal-making in Texas offer a representative three.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin: A Windfall Provides Something for All
</P>
<P>
   No one would accuse Wisconsin of ending welfare on the cheap.
But even the state's famously expensive program finished last year
with an eye-popping surplus _ nearly $350 million in unspent
federal money.
</P>
<P>
   The moral of the story that followed is that surpluses can make
strange bedfellows. Inside the Legislature, the program's harshest
critic, state Sen. Gwen Moore, and one of authors, state Rep. John
Gard, went behind closed doors and divided the money in a deal that
delighted them both.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moore got nearly $100 million over the next two years for
new benefits and services for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Gard got just over $100 million for a cut in property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The agencies that run the largely privatized program got nearly
$65 million in profit. And still there was enough left over to keep
nearly $100 million in reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lovefest,'' Ms. Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, the program generating these surpluses, Wisconsin
Works or ``W-2,'' is known for its willingness to spend. Virtually
everyone receiving cash assistance is required to work. But the
state has expanded job-placement services, hired new counselors,
offered guarantees of child care, created thousands of community
service jobs, and raised benefits to $673 a month, higher than
anyplace outside Alaska or Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Costs per case have risen accordingly, to about $21,000 a family
last year, from $7,000 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin has also increased its spending on other needy
families, to reward them for staying off the rolls. It has doubled
the size of its child care program, in part by tapping its welfare
money. And using other pools of state and federal money, it offers
low-wage workers subsidized health care and annual wage
supplements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told Congress, and I've told taxpayers, you can't do this
cheaply,'' said Tommy G. Thompson, the state's four-term governor,
whose support for spending has often raised eyebrows among his
Republican colleagues. ``You have to spend more in the beginning to
save on the back end.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Thompson has been surprised by the caseload declines;
when forced to work for welfare, most recipients have chosen to
fend for themselves. By the end of last year, the state had spent
only 56 percent of the federal money awarded to date.
</P>
<P>
   Among those most alarmed by the falling rolls is Ms. Moore, a
Milwaukee Democrat who represents many former recipients and who
once was on welfare herself. In her view the costly program makes
harsh demands that drive troubled families away while enriching
social workers and subcontractors. ``The people we kicked off the
rolls are still out there, and they're not getting served.''
</P>
<P>
   Spying the surplus, she wanted more money for a long list of
causes, and she won most of them _ child care, drug treatment, job
training, youth services, and higher payments for relatives who
care for abandoned children. (Many of the new services had been
proposed by Thompson, who continues to talk of the need to invest.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moore's longtime adversary, Gard, is a north woods
Republican from a county with a caseload of one. What he wanted was
a tax cut. ``I just believe the average working family needs to see
some benefit,'' he said. Indeed, Gard argues that more money
actually harms the program, by encouraging too much social work and
too little self-reliance. ``The only way to keep the program from
getting out of control is to pull out money when you can,'' Gard
said.
</P>
<P>
   He backed a plan that uses $108 million in federal money to
replace previous state spending on wage supplements for the working
poor. The state money was then converted into a tax cut for
property owners. The deal, embraced by leaders of both parties,
awaits final ratification by the Legislature. ``We both left the
room smiling,'' Ms. Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional budget hawks will no doubt frown at the size of
the state's windfall. But Thompson said any reduction in the
state's grant would punish it for its success. ``We're getting
results,'' he said. ``Isn't that what the federal government
wanted?''

<P>
   New Mexico: Political Fights Yield Little Action
</P>
<P>
   While federal money soothed old fights in Wisconsin, it brought
new ones to New Mexico. And the poor have paid the price.
</P>
<P>
   Three years into the new welfare age, the state newly ranked as
the nation's poorest is still recovering from a constitutional
showdown between a defiant governor, who tried to seize control of
the program, and the state Supreme Court, which found him in
contempt of its order to relent.
</P>
<P>
   Welfare directors have come and gone, leaving the department
without direction. And millions of federal dollars have gone
unspent, while thousands of jobless New Mexicans have been dropped
from the rolls.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict began in the spring of 1997, when the Democratic
Legislature passed a welfare bill that contained an expansion of
employment services. Gary E. Johnson, the state's two-term
Republican governor, vetoed it and unilaterally imposed one of the
nation's most restrictive programs. It cut off thousands of
families already on the rolls _ not by helping them find jobs, but
by changing the formula used to determine their eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   Angry Democratic legislators sued, arguing that the governor
needed their vote to make such changes. The state Supreme Court
agreed in a unanimous decision, ordering him in September 1997 to
end the program. When Johnson defied their order, the justices
returned three months later and cited him with contempt.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson ended the program. But the rolls had already been cut in
half and surpluses were mounting _ though much of the state was
still lacking rudimentary employment services. The Legislature met
in the spring of 1998 and with the governor's help, designed yet a
third program.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, it is rich in new services. It extends job-placement
programs beyond the welfare population, to any poor New Mexican
family. It creates lucrative subsidies for employers who hire
welfare recipients. And it raised welfare benefits by offering a
$100 monthly increase to any family not receiving a housing
subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Department of Human Services now on its third
secretary in three years, bureaucratic progress has been painfully
slow. It took until last October just to hire a job-placement
agency along the state's southern border, where county unemployment
rates are as high as 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Legislature set aside $4.5 million for wage
subsidies, the department has scarcely tapped the fund, creating
just eight jobs. And it has yet to extend its job-placement
services to the nonwelfare poor, as the Legislature directed a year
and a half ago.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Valdez, the department's new secretary-designate, said the
idea remains under consideration. ``That has not been implemented
yet,'' he said, declining further explanation. ``That's as far as I
can go.''
</P>
<P>
   The state did use its federal money to expand its subsidized
child care program, raising the number of children covered to
20,000, from 7,000 just two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But by last spring, the department was facing new turmoil in the
form of escalating rolls. Many of those who had been pushed off
welfare were streaming back in. While the caseloads were still well
below their historic levels, the state suddenly forecast something
unheard of in the new age: a coming welfare deficit. The
Legislature then canceled most of the benefit increase it had
passed the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico finished last year with $67 million in unspend money
and a record of missed opportunity that few are eager to defend.
``The money's been available but no program's been implemented,''
said state Sen. Manny Aragon, a Democrat who serves as the
president pro tem. ``I don't think we've done a very responsible
job.''

<P>
   Texas : Modest Programs In Poverty Aid
</P>
<P>
   Welfare has not grabbed the kind of headlines in Texas that it
has in other states. Though Gov. George W. Bush broadcasts his
identity as a ``compassionate conservative,'' he has left less
personal imprint than other Republican governors on his state's
policies.
</P>
<P>
   The program was designed in 1995 by a Democratic Legislature,
which vested much of its control in 28 local boards, made up of
business leaders, educators and social workers appointed by elected
officials. Their development has been impeded by political fights,
and two are still being formed. As a result, the availability of
social services varies widely from place to place.
</P>
<P>
   Still, caseloads are plunging nearly everywhere. Like most of
the country, the program emphasizes a strict, ``work-first''
philosophy, seeking quick placements in low-skilled jobs as opposed
to education or training. And it makes an energetic effort to
dissuade new applicants from coming on the rolls. Would-be welfare
recipients must first attend an orientation talk _ often requiring
a second trip to another office _ before they can get benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The state actually has more families seeking aid each month than
it had four years ago. But with with welfare harder to get and
harder to keep, the rolls have fallen 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For state Rep. Rob Junell, the chairman of the House
appropriations committee, that has created the kind of problem an
appropriator loves to mull: a projected two-year welfare surplus of
nearly $600 million. Huddling with his committee, Junell, a
Democrat, spent the spring devising a something-for-everyone plan.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 percent of the money went to social programs previously
financed with state dollars. (Some of the freed-up state money was
then reinvested in health programs.) Another 20 percent got placed
in reserve, in case of economic downturn. That left about 40
percent _ or $200 million _ for new benefits and services.
</P>
<P>
   Some were of the kind that many states have emphasized _ more
child care (Texas has nearly doubled the number of children getting
subsidies) and counseling for especially troubled families. But the
package also contained a surprise: $62 million, over two years, to
finance the state's first increase in monthly benefits in 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, it was a modest one. The Legislature raised the
monthly benefits of a mother and two children to $201, from $188.
That is lower than any state but Alabama ($164), Mississippi
($170), Tennessee ($185), or Louisiana ($190). Texas also added an
annual back-to-school payment of $60 for every welfare child.
</P>
<P>
   Small as the raise in benefits was, Junell said, it survived
only by avoiding publicity in an anti-welfare state. ``It was very
quiet, which is how I like it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A windfall for the state, a modest expansion of aid to the poor
_ the Texas experience seems a telling example of the country's
experience as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Bresette, associate director of the Center for Public
Policy Priorities, a research and advocacy group based in Austin,
argues the state has missed a historic opportunity. ``I do want to
give them credit for some of the things they did,'' he said. ``But
they had the chance to dramatically fix things for low-income
families, including working families. In a state with as much
poverty as Texas, we could have done a lot more.''
</P>
<P>
   The new welfare law is doing wonders for the state budget but is
it also helping the poor?
</P>
<P>
   Junell, a Democrat who represents the rural area around San
Angelo, gives a refreshingly candid answer. ``I'm out here in sheep
and goat country _ I may not be the best person to ask,'' he said.
But with the state now getting $300 million a year more than it
would have under the old system, he is firm in one conviction: he
does not want Congress to take any of it back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're gonna fight 'em tooth and nail,'' he said. ``Out here in
Texas, a deal's a deal.''

CLAIMS AND COUNTERCLAIMS FLY IN MONEY LAUNDERING CASE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ What happened to our money? This is the question that
many Russians would like answered.
</P>
<P>
   Cynicism about public finances runs high in Russia, where state
employees like teachers and doctors, many of whom earn less that
$20 a month, go unpaid for months, and where currency devaluations
that wipe out the savings of ordinary citizens occur frequently.
</P>
<P>
   But as Boris N. Yeltsin's turbulent presidency enters its
twilight, questions about what really happened to Russia's public
purse over the past decade are finally finding answers _ sort of. A
series of Western media reports in the last 10 days have alleged
theft and graft on a shocking scale. Most notable are reports that
billions of dollars in pilfered public and corporate funds,
possibly including loans to Russia from the International Monetary
Fund, were laundered by Russian mob bosses through the Bank of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   But like most scandals reported in this country's opinionated
media, the Bank of New York money laundering case has become just
another weapon in the clan warfare here.
</P>
<P>
   Media loyal to Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, for example, are
spinning the scandal as another example of Kremlin corruption,
pointing the finger at Luzhkov's archrival, politically connected
tycoon and Yeltsin confidant Boris Berezovsky. Media loyal to
Berezovsky on the other hand, are reporting that the man behind the
money laundering is Luzhkov.
</P>
<P>
   The Moscow mayor and Berezovsky have been at each other's
throats for months.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov would like to become Russia's next president. He
recently assembled many of the country's powerful regional leaders
in a electoral bloc that could put him in the Kremlin when
Yeltsin's term expires next summer. That is a terrifying thought
for Berezovsky and a group of Kremlin insiders, darkly referred to
here as ``The Family,'' who fear the reckoning and possible
prosecutions that could result should forces hostile to them win
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, most major media are linked in some form to one or
the other of the country's competing political clans. ``Everybody
is trying to use this scandal to advance their own political
agendas,'' said Radik Batirsin, an adviser for the powerful
Media-Most company, which manages the popular NTV commercial
television station and the daily newspaper Segodnya, both widely
seen as sympathetic to Luzhkov.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal broke on Aug. 19, when The New York Times reported
that Russian organized crime groups had laundered as much as $10
billion through accounts in the Bank of New York. The report, which
cited unidentified law-enforcement officials, linked the accounts
to reputed Russian mobster Semyon Mogilevich and claimed the funds
were used for activities including contract murders, narcotics
trafficking, and prostitution. Saturday, Mogilevich denied
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   The bank has suspended one employee, Natasha
Gurfinkel-Kagalovsky of New York, and fired another, Lucy Edwards
of London. Both handled the bank's Eastern European accounts and
both are married to Russian businessmen. Gurfinkel-Kagalovsky is
the wife of Konstantin Kagalovsky, who from 1992 to 1995 was an
adviser to Russia's government and its representative to the IMF.
He now is vice president of Yukos, one of Russia's biggest oil
companies. The Kagalovskys have denied any wrongdoing, and called
the whole affair ``an anti-Russian campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal later reported that IMF loans to Russia
may have been among the laundered funds, a claim the IMF is
denying. Later reports in USA Sunday claimed that as much as $15
billion may have passed through the accounts, that food aid funds
to Russia may also have been pilfered, and that former and current
members of the Russian government were implicated.
</P>
<P>
   Federal lawmaker Vladimir Lukin, a former ambassador to the
United States, called the scandal ``the big one.'' Regarding how it
has been played in the Russian media, Lukin said, ``This is the
reality of our oligarchic semifeudal system where practically
everybody belongs to somebody else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very important that every one of these allegations be
investigated thoroughly by American and other law-enforcement
bodies,'' Lukin said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI will not say publicly whether it is investigating the
money laundering claims, although Britain's National Crime Squad
has confirmed that it is cooperating with the bureau on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Securities and Exchange Commission announced
Saturday it would investigate 33 Russian companies that deal with
Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is also getting into the act. A spokesman for Iowa
Republican Representative James Leach, chairman of the House
Banking Committee, said hearings on the money laundering scandal
will be held next month.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Berezovsky and Luzhkov exchanged public insults
Friday over an entirely different scandal. The Italian newspaper
Corriera della Sera reported last week that a Swiss company that
had won lucrative Kremlin renovation contracts had paid Yeltsin and
his two daughters an estimated $1 million. Berezovsky said that
``Luzhkov and his henchmen'' were behind that report. Luzhkov hit
back with a sarcastic statement saying he was happy to hear that he
was ``strong enough to run and command not only the Moscow press,
but foreign publications as well.''
</P>
<P>
   And Russians are still left wondering what happened to their
money.

EAST TIMOR TO VOTE ON INDEPENDENCE PLAN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, East Timor _ After centuries of colonial oppression
followed by years of civil war and unsettled peace, a single day at
the ballot box Monday will determine the future of this disputed
territory at the eastern edge of the Indonesian archipelago.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of East Timor's 800,000 residents are registered
to vote in a United Nations-sponsored referendum that will allow
self-determination for the first time _ a choice between autonomy
under Indonesia or independence.
</P>
<P>
   But if the tense and bloody seven-month lead-up to the ballot is
any indication, Monday's vote could well be disrupted or even
skewed by outbreaks of violence and intimidation at any of 200
polling stations.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, pro-Indonesia supporters fired shots in the air in one
tense suburb of Dili, prompting hundreds to flee their homes and
others to take up machetes, axes, and sticks.
</P>
<P>
   In clashes on Thursday and Friday, at least 10 people were
killed in a ``last attempt to destabilize the situation before we
go to the polls,'' said David Wimhurst, spokesman for the UN
mission here.
</P>
<P>
   But leaders of both sides, as well as the UN and international
observers, called for the balloting to go forward, saying a delay
would only exacerbate a precarious situation.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, many residents interviewed said that after being
deprived of a say for so long, they fully intend to exercise their
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Postponing the vote ``is not fair to East Timor because they've
been suffering for quite a long time,'' said a spokeswoman for the
Asian Network for Free Elections, one of numerous nongovernmental
groups that have deployed a total of 1,500 observers here from
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor was a distant and neglected Portuguese colony from
the early 18th century until 1975, when a socialist government in
Lisbon was making plans to withdraw. A civil war erupted between
independence seekers and those who wanted to join neighboring
Indonesia, a nation of more than 200 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia invaded in 1975 and annexed East Timor the next year,
triggering years of guerrilla war and abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, President B.J. Habibie of Indonesia pledged to
let East Timorese settle the question themselves. But since then,
violence has claimed scores of lives, most of the strife stoked by
those who want to remain part of Indonesia and fear a vote for
separation.
</P>
<P>
   Jakarta fears a vote to separate here could encourage three
other restive provinces _ Aceh, Irian Jaya, and Ambon _ to break
away.
</P>
<P>
   Delaying the ballot would ``not increase the safety and security
of East Timor people, because there are no guarantees from the
international community of better security in future,'' said Saskia
Kouwenberg of the International Federation for East Timor Observer
Project.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Kouwenberg said that violent incidents of the last week
``throw into question the legitimacy of the ballot.''
</P>
<P>
   International observers and the UN have condemned the Indonesian
military and police, who are responsible for keeping peace, for
failing to intervene to stop clashes, and, worse, aiding
pro-Indonesia civilian militias.
</P>
<P>
   Kouwenberg's group reported seeing Indonesian riot police
distributing automatic weapons to pro-autonomy militia members in
the town of Maubisse.
</P>
<P>
   In the town of Maliana, Indonesian military personnel are among
leaders of the local militias, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   Other groups reported police carrying pro-autonomy paraphernalia
at rallies, and failing to stop militias on rampages.
</P>
<P>
   Independence leaders called on the UN to send peacekeepers in
before the vote _ an impossibility at this stage, and a move that
Indonesia has consistently opposed. The UN has only 280 unarmed
police here.
</P>
<P>
   There were also reports of local authorities copying
registration lists and voter cards and telling people that
officials will know how they vote.
</P>
<P>
   An Indonesian government spokesman, Dino Djalal, defended the
security and secrecy of the vote, saying one Indonesian police
officer would be deployed for every 100 people, with three manning
each polling station.
</P>
<P>
   He also said it is the job of the UN Mission in East Timor to
convince people that ``no one will ever know how any person or any
village voted.''
</P>
<P>
   Djalal said he was optimistic that the vote will be ``a clean
and fair process. . . . The whole point about this process is to
let the vote kill the violence, not let the violence kill the
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If autonomy is rejected,'' he said, ``people will say, `You
had it coming.' If autonomy wins, people will say it's because of
intimidation. So it's a no-win situation'' for the Indonesian
government.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of families who fled deadly clashes in Dili neighborhoods
Thursday and Friday were sheltering Saturday in a school complex
adjoining the UN mission. But many insisted they could not be
deterred from voting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not scared by this,'' said Maria Soares, 47, a farmer
whose husband was shot during the Indonesian invasion in 1975. ``If
I die, that is God calling me to death. I feel it's my duty to
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Her neighbor, Antonio Dacosta, 30, was not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's this much violence, how can you expect us to be
brave enough to vote? People are fleeing one another. We need UN
security forces to guarantee our safety,'' Dacosta said.

 &HT;    Making 41-7 Penn State-ment
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STATE COLLEGE, Pa. _ They call it a ``statement'' game _ one of
those special afternoons where a team steps up and defines what it
is and what it ultimately hopes to be. No. 3 Penn State made an
emphatic statement about its national championship aspirations
Saturday by destroying No. 4 Arizona 41-7 before 97,168 happy but
somewhat disbelieving fans at Beaver Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State (1-0) gave every indication that it's a legitimate
contender by rolling up 361 yards in the first half and taking a
31-0 halftime lead. That made the second half a moot exercise
filled with the penalties and mistakes that come with a first game.
Arizona's only score came against Penn State's third-team defense
with 47 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told our guys to go out and have fun and let's just see
how good we are,'' said Joe Paterno, who got his 308th win as Penn
State's coach. ``We sort of fooled them a little bit by showing
them some things they hadn't seen. Then once they got down, it was
hard for them to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the things Arizona, or any other team, had not seen from
Penn State was Paterno's willingness to open up the offense and use
Chafie Fields as his primary weapon. A senior flanker, he scored
Penn State's first touchdown on a 37-yard reception and then three
minutes later took an inside reverse handoff around his left end
for a 70-yard score. Penn State also had a 60-yard touchdown catch
and run by reserve tailback Larry Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach just kind of took the reins off the offense so we could
really show what we could do,'' said Fields, who caught three
passes for 76 yards and ran three times for 110 yards. ``Man, this
definitely sets the tone for the season.''
</P>
<P>
   As impressive as Penn State was, the Nittany Lions were aided by
an Arizona team that failed to back up its credentials as a
national power. With countless missed tackles and missed
assignments, the Wildcats looked like anything but a prohibitive
favorite to win the Pac-10. Penn State took the opening possession
and drove 80 yards for a touchdown in seven plays. It was never a
game after that.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dick Tomey tried hard to put the best spin on what was an
ugly afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this was good for us,'' said Tomey, whose team had won
16 of its past 17 games. ``This doesn't have to be the death knell
for us. This needed to happen. And it's a helluva lot better that
this happen now than against Stanford in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this . . . is part of the development of our team during
the course of the year, it will be worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   For Penn State, the road ahead is promising. It should cruise in
its next two games with Akron and Pittsburgh. Then comes an
interesting trip to improved Miami on Sept. 18. The big ones, Ohio
State and Michigan, are both at home.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Joe Paterno's 50th year at Penn State has a chance to
be special. His team had that look Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one game and I really don't think it proves
anything,'' said Paterno, 72. ``If we keep getting better, then
maybe we have a chance to be pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   As Arizona began the long trek home, it was already persuaded.
Penn State is more than pretty good.

 &HT;    New utility laws could put money in your pocket
 &HT;    By Bruce Hight
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texans who make a lot of in-state long-distance
telephone calls should see prices coming down in the next few
months, thanks to a rewrite of the state's phone laws by the
Legislature this spring.
</P>
<P>
   And those who find themselves in a billing dispute with their
long-distance provider no longer will risk losing their local
telephone service for refusing to pay a long-distance bill.
</P>
<P>
   Many Texans, meanwhile, can expect to see big changes in how
they buy electricity when the market is opened up to competition
Jan. 1, 2002. The new electric law does not apply to Austin Energy,
Pedernales Electric Cooperative Inc. and other municipally owned
utilities and cooperatives. But their prices may decline if their
customers see electricity prices falling elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Utility law is not an exciting subject _ at least not until the
monthly electric bill arrives.
</P>
<P>
   But in its 1999 session, the Legislature made two landmark
changes: It lifted many government restrictions from Southwestern
Bell Telephone Co. and opened the electric utility industry to
competition.
</P>
<P>
   The new laws take effect Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers are still protected, but there's a recognition that
the market, in the next couple of years, will be a much more
effective protector of the customer than the regulatory state has
been so far,'' said Pat Wood, chairman of the Public Utility
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC will become more of a market cop _ taking complaints,
levying fines and, if necessary, revoking the certificates of
utility companies.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Bill 560 by Sen. David Sibley, R-Waco, capped
Southwestern Bell's prices for basic local residential telephone
service until 2005 but allowed it to change its prices for many
other services. Long-distance phone companies also will have to pay
less to access Southwestern Bell's networks.
</P>
<P>
   The changes were expected to result in more competition for
local phone service and lower prices for in-state, long-distance
calls.
</P>
<P>
   But the Consumers Union and other consumer advocates say
residential consumers won't necessarily benefit because there's
virtually no competition now for their business. Instead, the
consumer advocates said, competition will focus on business
customers.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also cleared the way for long-distance companies
such as AT&AMP;T Corp. and MCI Worldcom to slash the 12 cents a minute
they now must pay Southwestern Bell to complete their in-state,
long-distance calls.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC estimates that the cost of an in-state, long-distance
call should drop by about 5 cents a minute. It could drop by
another 2 cents a minute July 1, 2000, or whenever Southwestern
Bell gets into the long-distance business.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts will cost Southwestern Bell an estimated $200 million a
year _ savings that long-distance companies must pass on to their
customers.
</P>
<P>
   But Texans may not clearly see the changes on their bills,
because long-distance companies can apply the savings in a variety
of ways. The two biggest companies, AT&AMP;T and MCI Worldcom, have not
announced their intentions.
</P>
<P>
   The long-distance cut comes at a price. The access charge
subsidized expensive or specialized customer services, such as
those for rural communities and for deaf people.
</P>
<P>
   The Universal Service Fund, which will cover those costs, is
going up in September from the current 0.787 percent of a monthly
bill to 3.579 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line: People who make a lot of in-state,
long-distance telephone calls probably will save money, but for
those who make few such calls, the main difference might be a
slight increase in their monthly local bill.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC, under Senate Bill 86 by Sen. Jane Nelson, R-Flower
Mound, also will get much tougher enforcement powers on Sept. 1
against slamming and cramming. Slamming is changing a customer's
long-distance provider without permission; cramming is charging a
customer for a service neither ordered nor wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can move more quickly, and we have some new tools,'' said
Saralee Tiede, the PUC's chief of customer protection. ``And we
have an ability to deal with the scams we haven't seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting Jan. 1, local phone companies will not be able to cut
off service to customers who don't pay their long-distance charges.
Such cutoffs now can occur for long-distance companies that bill
through a local provider, such as Southwestern Bell.
</P>
<P>
   A study done several years ago indicated that two-thirds of
Texans who did not have telephones said the reason was previous
problems paying long-distance charges, Wood said. Breaking the link
between local and long-distance charges, he said, may help poor
Texans afford minimal telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   The monthly electric bill likely won't change much for a few
years.
</P>
<P>
   Rates for investor-owned electric utilities, including TXU
Electric, effectively have been frozen until Jan. 1, 2002, when
they will be cut 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, other companies can begin competing for the
utility's customers _ and presumably offer lower prices.

EFFORT TO BAN DDT FACING A FIGHT ON HOW TO COMBAT MALARIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (CORRECTS name to Roll Back Malaria in graf beginning: ``The debate
is occuring...'') 
(ATTN: Mexico, India)  (js) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It has been 27 years since the United States banned
the pesticide DDT, and the payoff is undeniable. The peregrine
falcon, once pushed to the brink of extinction, came off the
endangered species list this month, and the bald eagle may soon
follow. Brown pelicans are flourishing in Florida. On the shores of
Long Island, the ospreys are back.
</P>
<P>
   Now the United Nations is drafting a treaty that may lead to a
worldwide ban on DDT. But the international negotiations, set to
resume in Geneva next month, are drawing opposition from an
unlikely quarter: public health professionals, who say DDT is
necessary to stop the spread of malaria, a disease that kills as
many as 2.7 million people each year, mostly children in poor
undeveloped countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``A child dies of malaria every 12 seconds,'' said Dyann F.
Wirth, a malaria expert at the Harvard School of Public Health and
president of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.
``That could go up dramatically if we lose this important control
tool.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wirth is among more than 370 medical researchers in 57
countries who are urging that the treaty allow DDT to be sprayed in
small quantities on the interior walls of homes, where it acts as a
repellant to the disease-carrying insects. The scientists argue
that if the pesticide, which is cheap and effective, must be
eliminated, it should be phased out gradually and only if Western
countries conduct research on the more expensive alternatives and
help pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   Some type of public health exception is likely, said Jim Willis,
director of chemicals for the U.N. Environmental Program, which is
sponsoring the talks. But the specifics are engendering intense
acrimony between the public health experts and environmentalists
and have created some friction in the federal government, as it
tries to formulate its policy for the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This poses an unusual dilemma,'' said a State Department
official involved in the talks. ``Usually the dynamic is protection
versus economics. There, it is very easy for one side to paint the
other as the black hat. But here there is a peculiar tradeoff
between health and the environment, and those are both very
important civil society objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   Most countries no longer use DDT for agricultural purposes (or
do not admit to it if they do), but experts estimate that 23
nations still use it for malaria control. The biggest users are
China and India. Mexico has pledged to stop spraying DDT by 2007.
And the World Bank has loaned India $200 million to help devise
alternatives to DDT.
</P>
<P>
   The DDT dilemma stems from a U.N. plan to eliminate, or greatly
reduce, the use of 12 toxic chemicals classified as persistent
organic pollutants. The group _ the dirty dozen to
environmentalists _ consists of eight pesticides, including DDT, as
well as chemical byproducts and industrial chemicals. All
accumulate in the food chain and can travel thousands of miles
through air, water and bird migrations, causing lasting
contamination.
</P>
<P>
   In her 1962 book ``Silent Spring,'' Rachel Carson, a marine
biologist, chronicled DDT's poisonous effects, showing, for
example, how it killed the robins that ate the earthworms that
dined on the leaves of Dutch elm trees that had been sprayed with
the insecticide. The public outcry was tremendous; the book led to
the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970,
and the U.S. ban on DDT in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty negotiations on the group of pollutants began in 1998
and are scheduled to conclude by the end of next year. The Geneva
meeting, which runs from Sept. 6 to 11, is the third of five
scheduled sessions, but the first to examine each chemical in
detail. Willis of the United Nations predicted ``a rather thorough
discussion of the DDT issue.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Among advocacy groups hoping to influence the talks, that
discussion is already under way, and it is fraught with competing
studies and statistics. Experts are arguing about everything from
whether DDT is harmful to human health (the evidence is
inconclusive) to whether the recent rise in malaria rates in Mexico
is due to cutbacks in spraying or to last year's hurricanes, which
provided fertile breeding grounds for mosquitoes. (The answer is
probably both.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Positions have hardened,'' said Dr. Gerald T. Keusch, director
of the Fogarty International Center, the branch of the National
Institutes of Health devoted to promoting scientific research
overseas. ``In the heat it has not been possible to step back and
look at the light.''
</P>
<P>
   On one side is the nonprofit World Wildlife Fund and Physicians
for Social Responsibility, a doctors' group concerned with
environmental health. They argue that even small amounts of DDT
sprayed inside homes are harmful to the environment and cite
studies suggesting that the pesticide turns up in the breast milk
of nursing mothers and has other ``subtle effects on human
health.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking its cue from Mexico, the wildlife fund is pressing for a
ban on DDT by 2007. But the idea of a specific date is extremely
contentious, and the State Department official said the United
States will not ask for one.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side are two scientists' groups, the tropical
medicine society and the Malaria Foundation International, a
nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting research. Several
months ago, at the behest, curiously enough, of a Vancouver
environmental lawyer and cell biologist, Amir Attaran, the
foundation posted a letter about the negotiations on its Web site,
arguing that ``setting a firm deadline to ban DDT places an
unethical burden on the world's poorest countries.''
</P>
<P>
   As of Thursday, 371 scientists, including three Nobel laureates,
had signed. As the group's founder, Dr. Mary Galinski, a molecular
biologist at Emory University in Atlanta, explained: ``We don't
want a knee-jerk reaction to ban DDT.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate is occurring as malaria is making a deadly comeback,
re-emerging in regions where it was once under control and killing
many more people than it did decades ago, at least partly because
of a reduction in DDT use. The World Health Organization estimates
there are 300 million to 500 million new cases of the disease each
year and last year launched a new initiative, Roll Back Malaria, to
combat it.
</P>
<P>
   There are drugs to treat malaria, but some patients cannot
afford them and drug resistance is an increasing problem. So the
best means of prevention is to keep mosquitoes from biting people.
At least one expert, Dr. Donald R. Roberts of the Uniformed
Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md., argues
that ``DDT is the best insecticide we have today for controlling
malaria.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, Roberts, a medical zoologist, traveled to
Brazil to conduct experiments in malaria control. He built two
houses and sprayed the inside of one with DDT. Hundreds of
mosquitoes entered the unsprayed house, he said. None entered the
sprayed house. In the years since, Roberts has become an ardent
defender of the pesticide. ``We have got to stop pressuring
countries to stop using DDT,'' he said. ``It is immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, including Dr. Galinski, say they have no problem
eliminating the pesticide so long as alternatives are in place. But
that is a frightening thought to Dr. Wen Kilama, a Tanzanian
entomologist who in June presided over an expert panel, convened by
the World Health Organization, to debate the future of the
pesticide in malaria prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Kilama says that to get rid of DDT entirely, now or in the
future, would be a mistake, because one of the biggest challenges
in controlling the disease is that mosquitoes develop pesticide
resistance. ``It's like when you fight, you have a pocketful of
arrows and now you have only one arrow left,'' he said in a
telephone interview. ``If you pull it out and lose it, then you
have lost it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanzania no longer uses DDT; the country cannot afford it,
Kilama said. But with the economy improving, he added, ``I can see
a lot of hope coming up'' that government-sponsored spraying might
resume. In the meantime, some Tanzanians sleep under nets soaked in
pyrethroids, another chemical. But the nets cost $4 to $5 apiece,
too high a sum for many poor villagers, and Kilama said they work
only by ``mass effect,'' which means entire neighborhoods must use
them.
</P>
<P>
   Further south, in Botswana, health officials have also abandoned
DDT, but for a different reason. Only three countries _ China,
India and Mexico _ still manufacture the pesticide, and Thandie
Phindela, a malaria control officer in Botswana's Ministry of
Health, said the country could not get a reliable supply this year.
``The environmentalists are trying to put pressure on the use of
DDT,'' she said. ``We had to resort to pyrethroids.''
</P>
<P>
   But pyrethroids are more expensive. According to Kathleen
Walker, an entomologist with the EPA, the cost of treating one
house with DDT ranges from $1.60 to $8.50, compared with $4.20 to
$24 for pyrethroids. In the end, she said, some countries may have
to abandon house spraying altogether and begin research on other,
cheaper alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   That is the World Wildlife Fund's view: its contaminants expert,
Richard Liroff, urges ``more creative thinking about moving away
from DDT.'' He points to an experiment in India, where gambusia _ a
larvae-eating fish _ were deposited in bodies of water where
mosquitoes breed. But Kilama, of Tanzania, said such steps are not
practical in a country where a hippopotamus footprint after a heavy
rain can create an instant breeding ground.
</P>
<P>
   As the debate continues, the World Health Organization is
drafting its own plan to help countries cut back on DDT. But the
organization has no idea how much the effort will cost; the price
tag will vary from nation to nation. As to who will pay, said Jenny
Pronczuk, a chemical safety expert, ``Well, that's a problem.''

TRAINER GREENMAN ON TRACK TO RECOVERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If a gelding named Such Charisma scores a big
upset in the Pacific Classic at Del Mar today, don't expect trainer
Walter Greenman and his wife Jeannie to stay up late celebrating.
</P>
<P>
   Walter faces a heavy schedule Monday _ beginning radiation
treatment designed to destroy what's left of the brain tumor that
was partially removed in surgery Aug. 6 in La Jolla.
</P>
<P>
   The 1{ months of daily radiation will be interrupted so Greenman
can fly to Kentucky for a two-day thoroughbred auction in
mid-September, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Which should surprise nobody who saw Greenman, a 59-year-old
former jockey, go back to work at his Del Mar barn three days after
brain surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing great, the best I've felt in years,'' Greenman said
on the phone Friday morning. ``Ever since the operation, I've felt
better and better. I can't be riding around on a horse, but I can
do pretty much everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Including saddling winners. A victory by the 3-year-old filly
Kits Peak and jockey Alex Solis in the $80,025 Piedra Foundation
Handicap on Aug. 19 is the richest of four winners for Greenman at
Del Mar, tying him for a solid 16th in the trainer standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``My theory is to get up and go,'' Greenman said. ``I can't lay
in the bed. They (doctors) told me to stay in the hospital a little
longer. But I said, `I'm getting out of here.' I'm with my friends
(at the racetrack). My wife drives me around. I've got it made.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's taking it (the illness) like a trooper,'' said Richard
Mandella, who trains Pacific Classic favorite Malek.
</P>
<P>
   All that's missing, it seems, is a chunk of Greenman's mop of
white hair, shaved off before surgery. He jokes that people no
longer mistake him for Bob Baffert.
</P>
<P>
   The tumor was discovered in an MRI after Greenman, who'd noticed
some memory loss, nearly passed out following a driving trip to the
Santa Rosa fair in July, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor said, `I don't know how you were walking around,'''
Greenman recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The evening before the operation, he won the Del Mar nightcap
with a maiden named Bulls and Bears. In the winner's circle, an
emotional Greenman hugged his son and assistant, Dean.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the operation, Walter already felt better, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was exciting,'' he said. ``The next day I was remembering
things I hadn't thought about since I was a little kid.''
</P>
<P>
   A Kansas native, Greenman once rode five winners in a day at
Turf Paradise in Phoenix, trained five winners in a day at Bay
Meadows to equal the track record, and was the Bay Area's leading
trainer several times in the 1970s and '80s. His notable stakes
winners include Savinio, Pinfloron and Pacificbounty.
</P>
<P>
   Such Charisma will be Greenman's most shocking stakes winner if
the 5-year-old beats seven other horses in the $1 million Pacific
Classic over 1\ miles on the Del Mar main track. The son of Zilzal
has run all 13 of his races on turf and has been losing to
second-rate horses. The most recent of his four victories came in
an optional-claiming race at Santa Anita in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know if he'll run on the dirt, but he's (trained)
well on the dirt. He's a nice horse,'' said Greenman, adding that
there's a chance he and Biszantz will decide to scratch Such
Charisma from the Pacific Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Such Charisma is a 20-1 long shot on the morning line, but with
Greenman training and 52-year-old Laffit Pincay riding, he'd be the
sentimental favorite today.
</P>
<P>
   And if he wins, maybe Greenman will stay up late, and surprise
nobody once again.

 &HT;    Millwood lasts 10 as Braves streak goes to 9
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The lengths the Braves have gone to keep their
tentative hold on the NL East going are beginning to border on the
absurd.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, Saturday's 10 shutout innings from Kevin
Millwood and a 3-0 13-inning win over the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 1,500th victory of manager Bobby Cox's career, the
Braves' ninth consecutive win to match the longest winning streak
of last season, and most important, maintained at least a 1
1/2-game lead on the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, there's so much more.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood became the first pitcher in baseball this season to
throw 10 innings, the first Braves pitcher to throw 10 innings in a
game since Greg Maddux did in a 3-2 11-inning win over the
Cardinals on April 30, 1993 and the first Braves pitcher to throw
10 scoreless innings since Frank LaCorte on Sept. 17, 1976 in a 1-0
win over the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   He did it without getting a win.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could I'd give all six of mine to him, I would,'' said
Mike Remlinger, who took the win after working two scoreless
innings in relief. ``Guy pitches 10 shutout innings, he deserves a
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Millwood's problem was Cardinals pitcher Darren Oliver. Those
two duked it out to an 0-0 draw through nine innings by allowing a
total of seven men to reach base _ on two hits and a walk against
Millwood, four hits and a walk on Oliver, who bowed out after nine
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Not before Eddie Perez doubled past St. Louis third baseman
Fernando Tatis, Walt Weiss bunted the pinch-running Ozzie Guillen
to third, and Gerald Williams drove him in with a single to center
was there such a thing as a lead in this game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all tired, we had to do something,'' Perez said
afterward before pointing postgame buffet table. ``The
food's cold.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves padded the lead with two more runs on a couple of
Cardinal errors, and John Rocker collected his 30th save after
loading the bases in the 13th and leaving them that way on an Edgar
Renteria groundout. The game, which had flown for the first nine
innings, lasted 3 hours and 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Millwood) was out there for a minute, I was out there for
about two minutes,'' Oliver said. ``If somebody would have scored,
it would have been a two-hour game. You could have 1,000 starts and
never have that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals haven't scored on the Braves in the last 19
innings of this series and find themselves down 2-0 with one game
to play despite allowing only five runs in two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do writers always want to write it was the hitters'
fault?'' said Mark McGwire, who is now 1 for 9 in the series with
five strikeouts. ``Those guys over there are paid a lot of money to
get you out.''
</P>
<P>
   Millwood might give a little back for a couple runs here lately.
The Braves have scored Millwood only seven runs in his last three
starts, six of them in his win over Reds. Otherwise he's taken two
no-decisions after throwing a eight innings of one-run ball in
Colorado and his shutout work Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really nice to those guys,'' Millwood joked about his
teammates. ``I try to be a good guy, but I'm not going to be
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Millwood looked like he was going pitch on into the night as he
headed back out for the 10th inning, something he could afford to
do after using only 106 pitches to pitch the first nine innings.
</P>
<P>
   He threw 119 pitches in all, struck out nine, and walked one. He
allowed only two hits for the fifth time this season, including two
other no-hit bids against Boston and Houston, eight shutout innings
against the Mets, and his two-hit dandy in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   He saw this particular no-hit bid end on an Edgar Renteria
groundball that Chipper Jones had skip off the heel of his glove
with two outs in the sixth inning. Jones hopped up and threw to
first on a play the Braves in the field thought was an out. The
play was ruled a hit, though opinions varied in the clubhouse
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had it going there for a while,'' Millwood said. ``But
there's no reason for me to let up and lose concentration just
because I give up one hit.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't allow his first legitimate hit of the game until
giving up a hard single to center by pinch hitting Craig Paquette
in the ninth inning. After a failed attempt to advance Paquette on
a bunt, J.D. Drew and McGwire took Millwood deep in the outfield
for flyball outs. That was as much noise as the Cardinals would
make on him in a game that featured plenty of good defense for
Millwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, he was unbelievable,'' Perez said. ``His high cheese was
getting everybody out. That was the key.''

 &HT;    Falcons fret little things
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As the Falcons head into the final week of the
preseason, they ought to be fine-tuning a few things, tweaking the
roster and getting ready for bigger and better things.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, despite losing three starters from last year's NFC
Championship team, it's the little things _ a lot of them _ that
are irking the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries continue to be a giant pain.
</P>
<P>
   Starting quarterback Chris Chandler's sore right hamstring kept
him out of Friday night's 17-3 loss at Tennessee, although coach
Dan Reeves said Chandler should practice Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As the Falcons prepare to trim their roster from 70 to 65 by 4
p.m. Tuesday, here are other hang-ups:
</P>
<P>
   _ The competition between Danny Kanell and Tony Graziani for the
backup quarterback job has been fouled up. Injuries to Graziani,
who had an MRI exam on his hyperextended right knee Saturday, have
limited him to two quarters. Kanell has played about eight.
</P>
<P>
   _ There are still too many questions at wide receiver, where the
release of Tony Martin and the sprained ankle of Chris Calloway
have caused problems.
</P>
<P>
   _ Offensive execution has been poor _ the team has scored nine
points in the past two games _ and penalties have been plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   _ The defense has been fairly solid the past two games, giving
up 34 points, and 10 Tennessee points were set up by two of the
Falcons' five turnovers. Tennessee averaged 2.5 yards per rush
Friday, but the Falcons are getting beat in the passing game.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most alarming, Kanell and Graziani are behind where they
should be.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are 19-5 when Chandler starts and finishes games,
including the postseason, and 3-7 otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Kanell has completed 32 of 68 passes for 367 yards, one
touchdown and four interceptions for a 44.2 passer rating.
</P>
<P>
   Graziani has completed 8 of 16 for 139 yards and one
interception for a 53.9 passer rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony is throwing to the right people more, making the right
reads,'' Reeves said. ``Danny did some good things, too, but he
took three of the toughest shots I've seen in awhile.''
</P>
<P>
   Second-year wide receiver Tim Dwight, who started at split end
in place of Calloway, caught three passes for 48 yards Friday night
and threw a nice downfield block on O.J. Santiago's 22-yard
reception.
</P>
<P>
   But other teams are passing the ball better.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons gave up passing plays of 48 and 36 yards to set up
the Titans' two touchdowns. In last Saturday's 19-6 loss to
Baltimore, a 57-yard pass set up one Ravens touchdown, and the
other score came on an 81-yard pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the quarterback has enough time to throw it, he's going to
make plays,'' said Falcons cornerback Ray Buchanan, who was not
involved in any of those.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the ball is floating up there, we've got to go get it
like we did last year.''

BREWERS SEEK MINORITY HIRE
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Omar Minaya has friends in high places, but will
it be enough to get the general manager's job with the Milwaukee
Brewers?
</P>
<P>
   Minaya, the one-time Texas scout who signed fellow Dominican
Sammy Sosa back in 1986, is the assistant GM with the New York Mets
and was a finalist for the Dodgers job last summer.
</P>
<P>
   National League president Leonard Coleman is seeking to boost
minority representation in baseball's upper management and wants
Minaya for the job Sal Bando gave up when manager Phil Garner was
fired.
</P>
<P>
   Club president Wendy Selig-Prieb also is interested in a
minority hire for the job and is considering her farm director
Cecil Cooper, a member of the Brewers' only World Series team in
1982.
</P>
<P>
   Although former Dodgers GM Fred Claire recently appeared on a
list of 12 candidates, he is a long shot. Blue Jays assistant GM
Dave Stewart, however, is considered a front-runner. Other names
include Dan Evans of the White Sox, Dean Taylor of the Braves and
Dan O'Dowd, formerly of the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   High-yield Bonds: The Giants' Barry Bonds took Friday off after
one of the hottest stretches of his career. In the previous nine
games Bonds went 18 for 41 (.439) with nine homers and 18 RBI.
Included were three home runs in a doubleheader sweep of the Cubs
that ran the Giants' winning streak to seven games. Bonds, who
missed two months with a torn left bicep, entered Saturday with 25
homers and 68 RBI in just 72 games. This season he has homered
every 9.9 at-bats and collected an RBI every 3.6 at-bats, both
career bests.
</P>
<P>
   Money talks: Phillies first baseman Rico Brogna has been on fire
since signing a one-year, $4million contract extension last week.
In eight games since the deal was done, Brogna hit .571 with three
homers and 15 RBI. Now if Philadelphia can get something done with
right fielder Bobby Abreu, who is second in the league in hitting
to Colorado's Larry Walker. Abreu, traded two years ago by
expansion Tampa Bay before the Devil Rays even played a game, last
winter rejected a contract offer by the Phillies, who had just
signed third baseman Scott Rolen to a four-year, $10 million deal.
Abreu will be eligible for salary arbitration this winter.
</P>
<P>
   A.J. is back: Remember when Florida right-hander A.J. Burnett
was sent down after beating the Dodgers 11 days ago in his
major-league debut? Well, after getting roughed up in a Double-A
start, he returned to the big leagues Saturday and started against
the Astros. His biggest problem so far has been getting out
minor-league batters. Burnett entered his start against the Dodgers
6-12 with a 5.52 ERA at Double-A Portland. When he returned he
allowed 10 hits. ``He's a guy we think is in the mix for next
year,'' said Marlins manager John Boles, who could start Burnett
next week against the Dodgers in Miami. ``So we'll give him the
ball and get him out of that tough Eastern League.''
</P>
<P>
   Great matchups: Last week's series between the Reds and Braves
and Mets and Astros will be repeated beginning Monday in Cincinnati
and Houston. The Reds, baseball's best road team at 40-20, were
swept by the Braves and went 0-5 this season at Turner Field. They
hit .123 and averaged two runs a game. The Braves, however, could
be without starter Greg Maddux for a couple of starts with a bone
chip in his right wrist. Atlanta also lost valuable setup man Rudy
Seanez this past week with elbow problems that might require
surgery. The Braves already have lost Andres Galarraga and Javy
Lopez. The underrated Seanez was the bridge between the starters
and closer John Rocker. A weak bullpen has hurt the Braves in the
postseason the past few years.

 &HT;    This week, 'one for the road' gets riskier
 &HT;    By Scott Greenberger

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Don't tell Peggy Floyd that lowering the
blood-alcohol levels for drunken driving to 0.08 percent from 0.10
percent won't make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Almost two years ago, Floyd's 24-year-old daughter Kayla was
killed when a drunken teen-ager in a pickup ran a red light and
plowed into her Pontiac Firebird.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager had a blood-alcohol level of 0.08 percent when he
was tested about 90 minutes after the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Sept. 1, Texas will join 16 other states in enforcing
a 0.08 standard. Critics of the new law point to a recent federal
study that questioned the effects of lowering the blood-alcohol
limit alone. But Floyd and other supporters cite medical research
showing that alcohol begins to impair coordination and vision at
levels less than 0.08 _ and she knows better than most that in an
accident, inches and split-seconds count.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drinking even one beer can make us less alert and less
responsive to any problems,'' said Floyd, who is featured in radio
spots publicizing the new law. She said witnesses testified that
the teen-ager who killed her daughter ``didn't tap the brake; he
didn't turn. If he had tilted his wheel just a little bit, just
jerked a little bit, she would have been out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   The new 0.08 rule is just one of about 900 new laws that will
take effect Wednesday, but few of them have the potential to affect
as many Texans: About half of Texas' adults are regular drinkers,
according to a recent Texas Poll. And about 40 percent of those
regular drinkers admitted there have been times they might have
failed a sobriety test if they had been stopped after drinking.
</P>
<P>
   On average, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, a 170-pound man reaches a 0.08 blood-alcohol level
after five drinks (one drink equals one 12-ounce can of beer, a
5-ounce glass of wine or a shot of liquor)over two hours. A
120-pound woman reaches that level after consuming three drinks in
the same time period. The difference between 0.08 and 0.10 is one
drink over two hours for a 170-pound man and half a drink over two
hours for a 120-pound woman.But individuals metabolize alcohol
differently, and the agency's formula also doesn't account for
factors such as age.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the 0.08 standard say it will net social drinkers who
aren't a danger on the roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a spate of news stories about 0.08, and it will
frighten some people. But the effect is not long-lasting, and the
alcohol abusers aren't the ones who are going to be cutting back on
drinking,'' said John Doyle of the American Beverage Institute, a
Washington-based group that lobbies for restaurants on
alcohol-related issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millions of people drive responsibly and reach levels of
0.08,'' Doyle said. ``You're destroying people's lives by arresting
them for behavior which is not contributing to the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Doyle and other opponents use a recent report by the General
Accounting Office, the research arm of Congress, to buttress their
case.
</P>
<P>
   When Texas lawmakers debated the change last spring, supporters
pointed to a half-dozen studies showing a reduction in
drunken-driving accidents in states with the 0.08 standard. But
about a month after the Legislature approved the lower limit, GAO's
review of the data concluded that ``the evidence does not
conclusively establish that 0.08 BAC (blood-alcohol content) laws,
by themselves, result in reductions in the number and severity of
alcohol-related crashes.''
</P>
<P>
   GAO investigators said some of the studies were flawed because
additional anti-drunken-driving laws went into effect about the
same time as the 0.08 limit, and the researchers didn't isolate the
effects of the tougher blood-alcohol standard. Other studies used
time frames that were too short to determine trends or yielded
mixed results.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also say few drinkers will know what the new standard
means in terms of their own consumption.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can only drink about three an hour, right?'' said Yogi
Patel, 22, as she sipped a Dos Equis at a bar in downtown Austin.
The Southwest Texas State University student said she heard about
the new law on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to change the way I drink _ it's not going to
change the way anyone drinks. They know how much they can handle,
so I don't see why they'd change,'' Patel said.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Rodriguez, 41, a Dell employee who was drinking a Bass a few
feet away, described 0.08 as ``an abstract concept.'' He, too,
questioned the impact of the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know when I need to stop _ usually, three's the limit. I
don't know what that is on the scale they're talking about,''
Rodriguez said. ``I think that for anyone who's conscientious about
their drinking, the new law won't make any difference. And people
who don't give a crap will continue to do their thing, too.''
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of the change note that the GAO review also said
there are ``strong indications'' that if the 0.08 standard is
combined with other measures such as strict license revocation laws
and public education campaigns, lives will be saved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because the law is changed doesn't mean that crashes and
fatalities go down if the public is not made aware, if enforcement
is not maintained _ or increased _ and if people's general behavior
and attitude are not changed,'' said Sue Bryant, traffic safety
director at the Texas Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the most recent year for which statistics are
available, Texas led the nation in alcohol-related traffic
fatalities with 1,748, according to the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration. About half of Texas' traffic fatalities were
alcohol-related, compared with the national average of 39 percent.
Only Alaska, Rhode Island and the District of Columbia had a higher
rate.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the radio spots featuring Floyd, the
transportation agency is hanging 0.08 signs in stores that sell
liquor and putting stickers on cases of beer to get the message
out. The department still is working on signs for bars and
restaurants, Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Lewis, the legislative liaison for the Texas chapter of
Mothers Against Drunk Driving, said public awareness of a tougher
standard _ even if it's fuzzy _ is ``probably the main rationale
for lowering the BAC to 0.08.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most folks don't have any idea what 0.08 means. What they do
know is that it's lower, so people who may be tempted to drink too
much before they drive may cut themselves off sooner because they
know there's some tough, new law out there,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Heather Sentell, who tends bar at The Gingerman a few doors down
from Fado, said she hopes the new law will make people nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm terrified of drinking and driving myself. Anything they
have to do to crack down on it is fine with me,'' said Sentell, 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it makes people one ounce more paranoid to get in a car
drunk, it's worth it.''

WEAVER ADJUSTING TO BIG-LEAGUE LIFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HEATHER GRIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jeff Weaver isn't used to seeing himself on
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's strange when you go home and sit in bed and turn on
SportsCenter, the highlights of the game and there you are,'' said
the Simi Valley High graduate, who has received plenty of air time
since being called up to the Detroit Tigers in April. ``It's
definitely a change. Hopefully you only catch the good highlights.
It is pretty strange.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver's professional career spans a little more than a year.
He's adjusted to the travel, attention and what he calls an overall
``pretty cool'' life of a major-leaguer, a life remarkable for
someone who failed to be drafted out of high school yet became the
14th pick overall in 1998 out of Fresno State.
</P>
<P>
   How far he's come hit Weaver when he turned 23 last weekend and
he couldn't think of anything to ask for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've pretty much got everything I could want,'' said Weaver,
who was in town for a series against the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about some wins,'' suggested a teammate.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver hopes for better results soon _ ``I definitely want to be
part of a winning team,'' he said _ but not even playing for the
team with the worst record in the American League can ruin the
6-foot-5, 200-pound right-hander's first experience in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it tough to come to the yard sometimes,'' Weaver
said, ``not feeling like you want to go through another big loss.
But you've got to remember you're still pitching in the big leagues
and you're still at the top of the levels. Sometimes it just makes
it a longer season being on a losing team, but they're making
changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it really matters where you're pitching. The
first time you're still kind of nervous, how you're going to fit
in, how well you'll do. I don't think it would have mattered if I
was pitching for Cleveland or pitching for Detroit, it still would
have felt the same, I think.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really thought I'd be in this position, so every time
I go out there it's a great feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Returning to Southern California and seeing his friends and
family for the first time since his major-league debut was another
great feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being home was a big boost,'' Weaver said. ``Just getting off
the plane, getting on the bus, getting on to a familiar highway,
seeing familiar places, it made you feel like you're back home and
you have your feet on the ground ... It gives you an attitude you
want to perform at your best and thank God it went that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver gave up three hits in seven innings and had a season-high
seven strikeouts in the win against the Angels, his first victory
since May 27.
</P>
<P>
   His fast start _ a 6-3 record and 2.89 ERA through May _ put him
in early contention for Rookie of the Year honors. Then he went 13
starts without a win.
</P>
<P>
   A longer season than he's ever experienced could be one reason
for Weaver's slump. The mental aspect of playing so many games is a
bigger factor than fatigue, according to Weaver. However, his
coaches noticed a slight change in his delivery as the season
progressed. He began using a higher release point, forced pitches
and wasn't able to work the outside edge the way that made him
effective early in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about this is you can lose just a little bit, you
won't even hardly feel it,'' Tigers manager Larry Parrish said,
``but at this level they let you know. A good hitting club will
just wear you out.''
</P>
<P>
   On a team with a better record, Weaver's spot in the rotation _
and in the majors _ could have been in jeopardy. The Tigers never
considered sending him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think he's got a bright future,'' Parrish said. ``Sometimes
you've got to test a guy to see how he handles things. Anybody can
handle things when they go good. You want to see what a guy does
when he struggles a little bit. It really shows what kind of
character he has.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tested him a little bit. That's a long dry spell. For a
young kid, that's like eternity.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how long it could take Weaver to think of himself any
differently than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of spring training they said you'll have five or six
starts at Double-A and get reevaluated,'' Weaver said. ``I had one
start and they were like, `Uh, we're calling you up.' I was really
surprised, everything happened so fast. I mean, I played with guys
in the minor leagues that had been at that level for three or four
years, so it's something you don't take for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to remember where you came from. That's what everyone
says, but it's true. It keeps you grounded.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Five weeks after pitching his perfect game, David
Cone is a big part of a big problem with the New York Yankees'
starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Since shutting down Montreal on July 18, Cone is just 1-3 with
three no-decisions. Last week against Kansas City, his fastball was
clocked at 83 mph. It improved to 87 on Tuesday in Texas, but he
was ripped for six runs and seven hits in 12/3 innings, his
second-shortest outing since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   All this comes at a time when the Yankees have the league's best
record, but remain uncertain who will pitch in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Although Roger Clemens pitched eight scoreless innings Friday
against Seattle, the five-time Cy Young Award winner has won two
straight only once. Hideki Irabu hadn't lost since May 25 before
getting routed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   No chance: Mike Mussina's bid to win 20 games for the first time
in his career ended last Sunday when he took a Brook Fordyce line
drive off his pitching shoulder. He has eight starts to win five
more games, but there is enough discomfort in the shoulder to
wonder about future problems. ``At this point in the season,
considering where we are, there's no reason to push it,'' Mussina
said of his team, which is 21{ games back after losing its third
straight Friday night. Mussina, who said Wednesday he would miss
one and maybe two starts, has flirted with 20 two other times. He
had 16 victories in 1994 when a strike wiped out the final two
months of the season. In 1996, Mussina whiffed on four chances to
win his 20th.
</P>
<P>
   Staying healthy: Oakland's feel-good run at the AL wild-card
spot is happening despite a very busy trainers' room. John Jaha
(sore ribs) and Matt Stairs (knee) couldn't play earlier this week.
Veteran leaders Tony Phillips and Tim Raines already are gone for
the year. Perhaps most worrisome is right-hander Kevin Appier, who
pitched so well after coming over from Kansas City. Appier is
expected to make today's start against the White Sox in Chicago,
but he lasted just 32/3 innings last time out due to a sore right
leg. Any leg injury can throw off Appier's delicate mechanics,
which is troublesome for his surgically repaired right shoulder.
Appier was outstanding in his first two starts with the A's. But in
the past three he is 1-2 with an 8.34 ERA. He has allowed eight
homers in 301/3 innings after giving up 19 in 167 innings with the
Royals.
</P>
<P>
   Reborn Ranger: The Texas Rangers ran away with the Western
Division, but they never seem to have enough pitching to move
beyond the first round of the playoffs. But the resurgence of
right-hander Esteban Loaiza gives them a third solid starter after
Rick Helling. After a dreadful first half that included a stint on
the disabled list and a move to the bullpen, Loaiza is back in the
rotation and 6-0 with a 2.82 ERA in seven starts, including a 7-3
victory over the Yankees on Wednesday. The Rangers, who could face
the Yankees in the playoffs, have gotten 12 victories out of former
Dodger Mike Morgan, but he is 1-2 with a 10.80 ERA in his last five
starts.
</P>
<P>
   Twins hurting: The Minnesota Twins rebounded for two straight
wins late last week, but using 17 rookies this season often has
left manager Tom Kelly angry and frustrated. The Boston Red Sox did
not arrive in Minneapolis on Monday until 5 a.m. after experiencing
plane trouble. They had a four-game losing streak and canceled
batting practice. Then they went out and beat the Twins, who struck
out 11 times and stranded 12 baserunners, nine in scoring position.
``I hope the fans don't take it too personally, but it was awful,''
Kelly said. ``They ought to get their money back.''

DON'T PANIC, COWBOYS, SEASON STARTS SEPT. 12
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not yet. It's not time. Stay calm. Don't join the panic.
</P>
<P>
   As pathetic as the Cowboys have looked in the exhibition season,
it doesn't matter. Why? Because it doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   Never allow yourself to be mistaken for someone who actually
cares about preseason football. It's uncool.
</P>
<P>
   On your schedule, circle Sept. 12 in Washington. Anything that
happens on that date, and the 15 games beyond that date, feel free
to react accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   If it's consistently bad for the Cowboys, panic is OK. If it's
real bad, then go ahead and take advantage of the new open-flame
policy for tailgating on the Texas Stadium parking lots. Throw
yourself into a fire.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, be relaxed. Be like Jerry Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be a lot of concern about our team, but I don't
share that,'' the owner said Friday at Valley Ranch. ``I look more
at what's gone right for us than what's gone wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't exactly be un-Jerry-like for him to ignore football
reality, but Jones has a point here.
</P>
<P>
   In the three exhibition losses thus far, the highlights have
been, well, brief. And coach Chan Gailey is hoping all that changes
tonight when Denver visits Texas Stadium. The first half, and maybe
part of the third quarter, will be a full dress rehearsal for the
regular season opener, Sept. 12. This is the only exhibition game
where meaningful applies.
</P>
<P>
   But thus far, the Cowboys' messy preseason has had more to do
with who doesn't play as who does. Injuries have caused a multitude
of loose ends that remain untied. Gailey keeps saying, ``we're not
where we want to be, but we've still got time to get there.''
Maybe, maybe not. The answer, however, won't come for another
couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the team's medical staff is more important than the
coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, the Cowboys have added eight veteran
newcomers, hoping they could overcome those three draft wipeouts of
the mid-'90s. For example, Jones said Friday, ``Alonzo Spellman, if
he works out like we think he will, can be what we wanted Shante
\RCarver\S to be.''
</P>
<P>
   But the three key free agents from last season _ Ernie Mills,
Chris Warren and Everett McIver _ all were sidelined with injuries
in '98. McIver finally returns to the field tonight at offensive
guard, but Warren is once again a major health worry. As as
nickel-package back and Emmitt Smith's caddie, Warren figured
prominently in Gailey's offensive plans. For now, that's on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Jones outdid himself for this season in bringing in experienced
help. But one of those players, free-agent linebacker Quentin
Coryatt, might never play a down here due to yet another injury
(''I'm worried,'' Jones acknowledged). On the plus side, receiver
Rocket Ismail finally finds the field tonight after missing the
first three games with a training camp injury.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys traded for receiver James McKnight, planning to twin
his speed with Ismail's, but McKnight blew a knee early in training
camp. He will be back in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree that injuries have caused question marks,'' said
Jones, ``but we have offset our negatives with the positives. Many
of our positives are just starting to surface.''
</P>
<P>
   Such as?
</P>
<P>
   Tight end David LaFleur, who figures into the offensive package
much more than Gailey admits, is back on schedule for the regular
season. LaFleur broke his ankle in a May minicamp.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the continuing recovery of Nine-Toed Deion. ``He's
another one right on schedule, maybe even for the opener,'' added
Jones, although he did admit Kevin Smith's ailing back leaves an
uncertainty in the cornerback rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``McIver is returning at the right time, and maybe Chan won't
agree, but I'm not sure Ismail missing the first three
\Rpreseason\S games doesn't work to our advantage,'' said Jones.
``Rocket is fresh, and ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   To hear Jones tell it, all those loose ends will be tied down by
Sept. 12.
</P>
<P>
   And although Jerry wouldn't and couldn't comment, there is also
new Valley Ranch speculation that Leon Lett might be receiving a
break from commissioner Paul Tagliabue. It seems very far-fetched
that Tags won't suspend Lett for any regular season games, but
that's the speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, however, Lett remains absent while the Cowboys juggle
bodies in the middle of the defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've very optimistic over how everything is coming together,''
added Jones.
</P>
<P>
   It would be best not to join Jerry on the edge of that
particular cliff. But the time is also not right for any panic
plunges. Not yet.

COWBOYS FACE BRONCOS AS PRESEASON TESTS CONTINUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What better scenario for the Cowboys' dress rehearsal for the
1999 season than a preseason meeting against the two-time defending
champion Denver Broncos at Texas Stadium tonight?
</P>
<P>
   Here are the last two teams to win back-to-back Super Bowls and
leading candidates for Team of the '90s, who are now set to meet in
a nationally televised, next-to-last preseason game for both teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are 0-3; the Broncos are 2-1. Kickoff is 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important for us to have a good showing against
Denver,'' said Cowboys fullback Daryl Johnston, a member of all
three Super Bowl teams of the '90s for the Cowboys. ``We really
haven't put together anything consistently. We need something to
build on \Rnow\S ... it's time to start building some postive
momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   It's time indeed. The Sept. 12 season opener at Washington is
two weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   In three preseason starts so far, Troy Aikman and the Cowboys'
first-team offense have been on the field for the first quarter of
each game. They've had the ball for nine full possessions, and have
managed 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   They've had three turnovers (two Aikman interceptions and one
fumbled center exchange), and Johnston spared them a would-be
fourth when he recovered an Emmitt Smith fumble against New
England.
</P>
<P>
   They've had four penalties (two false starts, two holding), and
two more penalties were declined.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries are part of football. But the Cowboys have yet to have
their starting offense on the field for one snap. This week will be
different.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Raghib ``Rocket'' Ismail and right guard Everett
McIver make their first preseason appearances, but now the Cowboys
will be without veteran Ernie Mills (strained hamstring) in the
four-wide receiver set.
</P>
<P>
   Ismail is coming off a slightly separated shoulder, which he
injured diving for a pass in practice Aug. 4, and McIver hasn't
suited up for a game since he underwent knee surgery last November.
</P>
<P>
   Mills' left hamstring bothered him early in camp, quieted down,
then flared up again during last weekend's loss at New England. The
nine-year veteran knows the importance of this game for a
struggling Cowboys offense, but he won't allow a dress rehearsal
pressure him into putting his season in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Mills battled a similar hamstring injury to the same leg while
with Pittsburgh in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I missed only one game that season,'' said Mills, ``but the
\Rinjury\S never completely healed until after the season. That
just makes me more conscious of the fact that I need to get it
right.''
</P>
<P>
   With Mills out, rookie Wane McGarity and vastly improved
second-year player Jeff Ogden will get more playing time with the
first team.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to take advantage of every opportunity,'' said
McGarity, who leads all Cowboys receivers with six receptions.
``Denver will have its first defense out there probably the whole
first half. We have to be ready to go against that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Tucker, MarTay Jenkins and John Washington will continue
to get long looks. All three have distinguished themselves, but
Tucker is the hot receiver. The former TCU player is trying to
force the coaches into keeping six receivers, not just five.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' starting offensive line is intact for the first
time. McIver returns to right guard and will play 12 plays. Rookie
Solomon Page started at right guard in each of the first three
games.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Warren is still nursing a recurring groin injury that took
the 10-year running back away from camp for a week] to see a
specialist for treatment in Colorado Springs, Colo. Warren returned
to practice this week, but isn't sure how much he will play against
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Plans to get Warren in the same backfield with Smith, so far
only shown in practice, are predicated on Warren's health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of guys missing \R with injuries\S, we really haven't
been able tell much about where we are,'' Aikman said. ``Hopefully,
we can keep everybody healthy during the season. I think if we're
able to do that, we'll have a pretty good football team offensively
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman said that continuity and timing are important elements to
attain in preseason, although coach Chan Gailey's offense doesn't
have the timing routes that the offense had when Ernie Zampese was
Cowboys offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Timing is alway important with the receivers,'' Aikman said,
``but probably not as important in this offense as what it was in
the previous offense. So getting out on the field and spending time
with the receivers probably isn't quite as critical, but it's
always important.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman has been enthusiastic about the young receivers in camp,
saying that McGarity ``just needs to keep doing what he has been
doing ... and do it in games,'' and that Tucker ``has done
everything possible to make this team'' although that still may not
be enough when it comes down to numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``\RTucker\S has made a lot of plays over the last six or seven
practices ... \Rand\S shown a real ability to make the tough
catches,'' said Aikman of Cincinnati's 1998 sixth-round pick (167th
overall) who was released on injury settlement last August, then
later cut from Green Bay's practice squad.
</P>
<P>
   What better scenario for so much to be determined than in the
Cowboys' first home preseason game, dress rehearsal, against the
two-time defending Super Bowl champs.
</P>
<P>
   Does this provide added pressure on the Cowboys in '99?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' said Aikman, ``there's enough pressure on us
every year.''
</P>
<P>
   And it starts up again at Texas Stadium tonight.

BRUINS OK DESPITE THIN, YOUNG LINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Few things make offensive-line coach Mark Weber
happier than the new blocking sleds dotting the northeast corner of
Spaulding Field. But the play of UCLA's young linemen has Weber
smiling like a proud papa.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Bruins lack depth and experience, Weber believes
this is the most athletic group he's coached in three seasons at
UCLA. Yes, more athletic than last year's group, which featured
three All-Pacific-10 performers.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore center Troy Danoff is more mobile than his
predecessor, Shawn Stuart. Freshman right guard Mike Saffer has the
quick feet, fluid stride and knee bend not found in Andy Meyers.
And freshman Blake Worley, from what he's shown so far, appears
worthy of succeeding Outland Trophy winners Jonathan Ogden and Kris
Farris at left tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blake has excellent pass-blocking skills,'' Weber said. ``He's
ahead of most redshirt freshmen, but he has a ways to go. All the
young guys do, and that's why we're giving them so many repetitions
in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Weber has no choice. In the last year, he's lost seven linemen:
Stuart and Meyers graduated; Farris bolted for the NFL; Jeff Wright
and Scott Wiegand quit; David Wilford failed out; and Steve Morgan
switched to defense.
</P>
<P>
   Add the season-ending shoulder injury to reserve Josh Webb and
the two-game suspensions of Oscar Cabrera and Jim Ghezzi, and the
Bruins have just eight healthy linemen. They're one injury _ or
heat-related illness _ from using true freshman Bryce Bohlander,
who was expected to redshirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked about it,'' Saffer said. ``Coach Weber told us
not to worry about who we've lost and just do what we can to get
ready for the opener. If we can get through the first two games,
then we get Oscar and Jim back and we'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   His turn, finally: Danoff played just 60 snaps as Stuart's
backup last season, but the coaches were impressed enough to hand
him the starting job for the next three seasons. So far, he's
everything they expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stuart said many times that Troy was going to be much better
than he ever was,'' Weber said. ``Troy spent a lot of time with
Stu, trying to emulate him. In fact, he spent so much time with
Stu, the guys used to joke with him about it.''
</P>
<P>
   How they stand: The Bruins will face Boise State with Worley at
left tackle, senior Matt Phelan replacing Cabrera at left guard,
Danoff at center, Saffer at right guard and steady junior Brian
Polak at right tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Anderson is the third guard. Tony Ippolito is the backup
center and, if needed, the fourth guard.
</P>
<P>
   Micah Webb is the third tackle. If needed, Bohlander's ready as
the No. 4 tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd be nice to be able to redshirt both freshmen,'' Weber
said of Bohlander and guard Shane Lehmann. ``But we're getting them
ready like we'll need them to play. It's such a big adjustment from
high school, not only physically but mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   Change of pace: The Bruins gathered Saturday at 10 a.m. for a
pre-practice film session. When it ended, UCLA coach Bob Toledo
canceled practice and let the players watch the Arizona-Penn State
game. There's no practice today, either. Toledo hopes the relaxing
weekend will energize his weary players, who don't have a bye until
Nov. 6.

ALABAMA REPUBLICANS REWARD KEYES FOR SHOWING UP AT STRAW POLL THAT
MOST CANDIDATES SKIPPED
<TEXT>
<P>
   By CRAGG HINES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   C. 1999 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ Hell hath no fury like a straw poll scorned.
</P>
<P>
   None of the major Republican presidential contenders bothered to
come Saturday for a nonbinding preference vote sponsored by the
Alabama GOP, so more than half the 1,700 party faithful, who paid
$35 a person to participate, cast their ballots for two lagging
candidates who did show up.
</P>
<P>
   Former diplomat Alan Keyes, a fiery conservative orator, won
with 29 percent of the vote, edging Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who
had 27 percent. Neither is seen as a major force in the Republican
race.
</P>
<P>
   Among the absent candidates, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas ran
far ahead of the pack. His 25 percent of the vote was more than
three times that for the next nearest no-show.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the voting continued at the Birmingham-Jefferson
Convention Complex, Alabama Republican Chairman Winton Blount III
guessed that Bush would win. Blount might not have voiced that view
if he had talked with voters as they filed out of the curtained-off
polling area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted for Orrin Hatch because of his respect for Alabama by
coming,'' said Betty Botts, a Pike County housewife in a sequined
stars-and-stripes vest. Botts said she was not firmly committed in
the race for the Republican presidential nomination but liked Bush
a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Even Ginger Austin, who was wearing two Bush buttons, said she
voted for Hatch ``just because he came. People who came today ought
to have a little boost.''
</P>
<P>
   But Austin, a long-time Republican activist from Union Springs,
expressed confidence that Bush, the national polling leader,
ultimately will be the GOP nominee: ``I'm not worried about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some Bush backers in Alabama, who had been confident of
winning the straw poll even without their candidate present, were
stung by the result, with one complaining the campaign's high
command ``didn't want to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   After Keyes, Hatch and Bush, the order of finish was
conservative activist Gary Bauer, 7.26 percent; former Cabinet
official Elizabeth Dole, 4.16 percent; magazine publisher Steve
Forbes, 2.52 percent; conservative commentator Pat Buchanan, 2.46
percent; former Vice President Dan Quayle, 1.29 percent; Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., 1.23 percent; and Angel Rocker, an education
reform advocate from Florida who also spoke to the GOP session,
0.35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama Republicans, looking for a little national attention,
whipped up the straw poll after the state's Democrat-dominated
Legislature refused to move the presidential primary from June to a
date earlier in the campaign calendar. Most candidates, however,
refused to play along with the upstart Southern contest, preferring
to concentrate their organizing and funding on the hard-fought Iowa
straw poll two weeks ago _ which Bush won.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Neeley, executive director of the Alabama GOP, sought to
invest the outcome of his state's exercise with some significance,
arguing: ``It shows we've got a competitive race.'' But even local
media have made light of the homegrown GOP effort. The Birmingham
Post-Herald on Friday set the stage for the event by calling it a
Republican ``pep rally'' and offering this headline: ``Analysts:
Results not significant.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaigns of Keyes and Hatch are so thin on the ground that
they apparently did not have aides present after the vote to
inflate any significance of the result. The Bush folks, however,
were omnipresent and ready to spin out a tale of ``victory.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one candidate who did nothing and still got a great
vote,'' said Alabama Lt. Gov. Steve Windom, a state Bush campaign
co-chairman. ``This doesn't change the fact that all the polling in
Alabama shows Governor Bush is in a commanding lead.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent scientific sampling of political sentiment in
the state, conducted last month for the Mobile Register by the
University of South Alabama, found that among Republicans, Bush
held a 65 percentage point lead (71-6 percent) over his nearest
opponent, Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
   In that survey, Bush led Vice President Al Gore, the leading
Democratic contender, among the general electorate in Alabama by
61-32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch's campaign had phoned delegates and mailed them
literature, said Ragan Ingram, a Windom aide.
</P>
<P>
   R.C. Cox, a Republican activist from suburban Birmingham, said
Keyes' appeal was based on both the fact that he showed up and his
strong conservative message.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes was introduced by Roy Moore, the Etowah County circuit
judge who became a hero of the religious right-wing after posting
the Ten Commandments in his courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes repeatedly had the conservative audience hooting approval
of his attacks on abortion, the federal income tax and ``educrats''
whom he seemed to link to the ``soul-less evil that is stalking our
schools.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather be elected to nothing than stand for nothing,''
Keyes declared as he urged delegates from the state's 67 counties
to ``vote your conscience as God would have you vote.''
</P>
<P>
   In the great tradition of political orators, Keyes raised one of
his opponents' problems by questioning why it had become an issue.
Keyes brought up the recent attention paid to Bush's refusal to say
if he used illegal drugs as a young man _ but turned to the issue
by chiding the news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been more willing to talk about something, as far as
I can tell, that (has) no basis in a specific allegation or
credible allegation,'' Keyes said. ``They've been more willing to
spread that all over the newspapers about G.W. Bush than they were
to examine the witnesses and facts and the evidence against Bill
Clinton.''

SE ARIZONA POPULATION RISE THREATENING SAN PEDRO'S EXISTENCE

<P>
   SIERRA VISTA, Ariz._ One of the last free-flowing rivers in the
Southwest, the San Pedro, with its rare stands of cottonwoods and
willows, could be sucked dry.
</P>
<P>
   The growing population of southeastern Arizona is pumping out
groundwater faster than snow and rain can replace it. As the water
table falls, the river may no longer run year-round.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is they're using more water than nature is
providing, and the river is going to go dry,'' said Robert MacNish,
a hydrology professor at the University of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The lush corridor of the San Pedro runs north like a green
ribbon from its headwaters in Mexico until it empties 140 miles
later into the Gila River. An oasis in an arid land, it is among
the biological treasures of North America, with one of the largest
varieties of creatures on Earth. Millions of migrating birds depend
on the San Pedro for food and shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby Fort Huachuca and Sierra Vista are trying to take the
pressure off the river with everything from flushless urinals to
putting treated wastewater back into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to balance our economic growth with protecting the
river, recognizing it is part of the reason people come here,''
said Chuck Potucek, Sierra Vista city manager.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say that the tactics are too little too late, and
they argue that unfettered development in Cochise County is
undermining the gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look through the smoke screen, you see the guaranteed
demise of the river,'' said Robin Silver, a Phoenix doctor and
environmentalist who owns property along the San Pedro.
</P>
<P>
   On a summer morning, as thunderheads piled higher and higher on
the horizon, Holly Richter walked gingerly along the slick, muddy
banks of the river, near Sierra Vista. A spate of rain had sent tan
water swirling through bulrushes, carrying the new sediment crucial
for cottonwoods and willows to sprout.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like cappuccino,'' observed Richter, a biologist with
the Nature Conservancy, an environmental group that buys land for
conservation.
</P>
<P>
   A frog hopped past her feet, grebes paddled upstream and
countless other birds, hidden in the trees, twittered and trilled.
</P>
<P>
   The key to keeping this complex world alive, said Richter, is
maintaining the stream flow at the driest times of the year, from
April through June.
</P>
<P>
   If the underground water table near the San Pedro drops too low,
the river will cease to flow above the surface and, like other
depleted rivers in Arizona, will flow only beneath a dry riverbed,
if at all.
</P>
<P>
   And competition for the river's water is increasing.
</P>
<P>
   On the Mexican side of the border, people are pumping water for
household use, farming and mining.
</P>
<P>
   There's less agriculture on the U.S. side, but the population is
growing faster. Cochise County, through which the San Pedro runs,
has 120,000 people, a 22 percent jump from 1990. All their water
comes from wells.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a bit like starting off with a fat checking
account. You deposit money every month, but write checks for more
than you put in. You can operate in the red for years, but someday,
your checks will bounce.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say the river's bank statement is looking
ominous. Gauges on the San Pedro show that flows during the dry
season have declined steadily since 1940.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, by one estimate, wells around the river are pumping
7,000 more acre-feet of water out of the ground than nature puts
back in, enough to fill 3,000 Olympic-size swimming pools.
</P>
<P>
   Hydrologist MacNish predicts that in the next three or four
years, the river will flow intermittently rather than year-round in
the stretch around Arizona 90.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean all the faucets will go dry in Cochise County.
Paradoxically, there's a huge supply of underground water.
</P>
<P>
   The problem comes from a complex bit of hydrology. As a well
uses up more water than nature can replenish, the entire water
table doesn't drop at once. Instead, a ``cone of depression''
forms: The water disappears across a wide area near the surface,
tapering down to a small point by the base of the well.
</P>
<P>
   Think of drinking a flavored Sno-Cone drink through a straw.
You'll notice that the colored liquid disappears from the ice at
the top, while you're still sipping plenty from the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   As the cones of depression spread out, they'll intercept the
river's water long before any consumers run short.
</P>
<P>
   The push to keep the San Pedro alive is spurring a dizzying
number of studies, conferences, reports and partnerships. Many
questions remain about how the river system works, especially in
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   But there are basically just two approaches to saving the San
Pedro: Use less water or put water back into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Under those simple headings, there are dozens of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Congress took a big step in 1988 by establishing the San Pedro
Riparian National Conservation Area, which protects a 40-mile
stretch of river from near the Mexican border, north to St. David.
</P>
<P>
   There's no more farming or grazing in the area. That means less
groundwater pumping and more native plants, which reduce runoff and
allow more rain to seep into the earth.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the federal government announced a push to buy more
land and water rights in the area, plus a partnership with Mexico
to study and protect the San Pedro.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Vista, the largest city in the area, and Fort Huachuca,
the mainstay of employment, are both promoting conservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It costs a whole lot less not to use it in the first place,''
said Gretchen Kent, environmental policy coordinator at the Army
fort.
</P>
<P>
   Tactics there range from strict irrigation limits at base
housing to low-flow plumbing fixtures. Many of the men's rooms have
waterless urinals, which use a chemical trap in the drain.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a gallon and a half a flush, it adds up,'' Kent said.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Vista has an aggressive public education program called
``Waterwise,'' City Manager Potucek said. It's been effective
enough for one local water company to notice usage has gone down,
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Voters there also passed a referendum authorizing the city to
buy the two private companies, both owned by developers, that
provide most of the city's water. If that happened, Potucek says
the city would get a better handle on water use, including the
possibility of mandatory conservation.
</P>
<P>
   For now, when the two developers want to build, ``they just
extend their own waterlines,'' Potucek said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city's not really a player,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the supply side, the main strategy is recharge _ finding ways
to get treated wastewater and more storm water to sink into the
aquifer.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Huachuca, for instance, is putting wire baskets filled with
rocks, known as gabions, into washes to slow down and capture storm
water.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Vista is planning a big project to recharge wastewater,
although a hang-up in federal funding has delayed it.
</P>
<P>
   Potucek also sees promise in an ambitious proposal for recharge
projects at the base of the Huachuca Mountains, with the goal of
capturing more storm runoff. For now, though, it's unclear how much
such a project would accomplish and who would pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   Silver, the environmentalist, sees one fatal flaw in all the
conservation and recharge projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do nothing in terms of solving the big picture,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The culprit is excess, uncontrolled growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Ane, he added, the main force driving it is Fort Huachuca.
</P>
<P>
   As conservation chairman of the Center for Biological Diversity
of Tucson, Silver has helped file a series of lawsuits seeking to
force the base to do a full environmental impact statement showing
the cumulative effects of its operations.
</P>
<P>
   His biggest complaint: Although Fort Huachuca has cut staff on
base, it has let out local contracts that employ hundreds of
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if they're conserving some water on the
base,'' Silver said, ``if all these folks go home and water their
lawns.''
</P>
<P>
   A review of the base's impact would show that it should either
shrink its operations dramatically, Silver argues, or the local
authorities should control water pumping.
</P>
<P>
   Other environmental groups take a less militant view. Richter,
of the Nature Conservancy, figures that even if Fort Huachuca
closed today, ``the water budget would not be balanced.''
</P>
<P>
   People are drawn to southeastern Arizona to retire and to take
jobs unrelated to the military. Tourism, much of it focused on bird
watching, is a $6 million-a-year local business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growth is not going to go away,'' Richter said. ``We need to
use our best sicence and our best technology to allow the growth
the community desires.''
</P>
<P>
   She sees hope in cooperative efforts among government, citizens
and advocacy groups.
</P>
<P>
   Richter also duels with growth advocates, who object that the
plants along the San Pedro guzzle more water than any development,
accounting for half of local water use.
</P>
<P>
   That may be true, Richter said, but it's circular logic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be silly to cut down the trees to save the water,''
she said, ``if the reason we're saving the water is the trees.''
</P>
<P>
   Local officials complain that other parts of Arizona are growing
faster, using more water and getting less criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amount of water used in the San Pedro Valley is about what
is used on the golf courses in Scottsdale,'' said Rick Koehler, a
hydrologist for Cochise County.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he doesn't think the river is in peril. But Koehler is
optimistic about a combination of tactics that local governments
agree on: water recharge, promoting or requiring water-efficient
development and planning open space.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there's little appetite for putting tight reins on
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Cochise County's Board of Supervisors ``has taken a posture that
responsible development for the area should occur,'' county
Administrator Jody Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Sierra Vista's City Council approved a land annexation
and a controversial 6,400-home project to be built there. Opponents
last week turned in petitions to put the issue to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   City spokeswoman Marie Hansen said the development would have
gone ahead with yet more homes and fewer conditions if the property
had remained in the county. The subdivision won't be built out for
years, she added, because Sierra Vista, with 40,000 people, is
growing more slowly than most Arizona cities. Nevertheless, it has
grown 21 percent since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Southeastern Arizona is home to some staunch advocates of
private property rights, who are skeptical about whether the San
Pedro has a problem at all.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Thomas, president of Arizona People for the USA, has
lived in the area for 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it rains, that river's got water in it,'' she said.
``When it doesn't, it doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Harold Vangilder, a Sierra Vista councilman, contends that the
steps taken so far to mend the San Pedro are already succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The river is in the best state it's ever been since the
riparian area was established in 1988,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the talk about water in southeastern Arizona, the
state has not declared it an Active Management Area, where pumping
of groundwater is restricted.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmentalists say the state is shirking its duty.
</P>
<P>
   But Steve Olson, spokesman for the Arizona Department of Water
Resources, said an AMA isn't justified because there's no evidence
of regionwide declines in the water table.
</P>
<P>
   And he argues that the AMA authority is too broad to help the
San Pedro.
</P>
<P>
   ``To maintain the flow in the river,'' Olson said, ``you're
going to need some very targeted controls on groundwater pumping.''
The spacing and location of wells could be critical, while the AMA
is aimed at ensuring an overall water supply.
</P>
<P>
   The threat to the San Pedro is no phantom to Jack Pfister,
former chief of the Salt River Project water and electric utility.
He was co-chairman of a panel that looked at the river for the
Commission for Environmental Cooperation, a group that's an
outgrowth of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can peer into the future by looking at what's happened in
Arizona's past,'' he said. ``Every time we have let development
occur near a riparian area or a free-flowing stream, we end up
drying it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Cochise County must find ways to offset or reduce water use,
Pfister said.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, he can show what's ahead: Just look at the barren bed
of the Salt River in Phoenix. &QL;

PACIFIC CLASSIC COULD BE BIG BOOST FOR GENERAL CHALLENGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Will the Pacific Classic be remembered for the
horse who wins or the horses who didn't run?
</P>
<P>
   That's up to General Challenge and jockey David Flores.
</P>
<P>
   If any excitement remains in Del Mar's $1 million race, weakened
by injuries to a succession of favorites, it resides in the
muscular body of General Challenge, the flashy but flighty gelding
who faces older horses for the first time today.
</P>
<P>
   A victory would _ if it's done in style _ revive the
``rising-star'' talk that followed his Santa Anita Derby victory in
April.
</P>
<P>
   A victory would make him the first 3-year-old to win the Pacific
Classic _ or even finish in the money _ since Best Pal won the
first running in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   And a victory would be very popular at Del Mar, since he is bred
and owned by track chairman John Mabee and his wife Betty, who also
bred and owned Best Pal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Best Pal was a little ahead of General Challenge in
development at the same point in their careers,'' John Mabee said
this week. ``(But) General Challenge has greater potential.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, it's unfulfilled potential.
</P>
<P>
   After winning the Santa Anita Derby by 3{ lengths, he joined the
Mabees' filly Excellent Meeting in the Kentucky Derby, and together
they were favored on the morning line. General Challenge ran into
severe traffic in the first turn and finished 11th.
</P>
<P>
   Skipping the rest of the Triple Crown, he came home and stepped
down in class to win the Affirmed Handicap at Hollywood Park. Back
in the big leagues in Hollywood's Swaps Stakes, he was out-gamed at
1-2 odds by habitual runner-up Cat Thief.
</P>
<P>
   Handicappers who'd questioned General Challenge's brain power _
he's easily rattled by crowds and on-track adversity _ started to
doubt his heart as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still got something to prove in that department to me,''
Mabee said.
</P>
<P>
   Today he'll start from the potentially troublesome post 1 as he
tries 1\ miles for the second time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not happy with the post position,'' Flores said.
</P>
<P>
   To stay in the clear early, Flores might have to shoot for the
lead. That would mean out-breaking Malek and Alex Solis, who start
from post 7.
</P>
<P>
   But trainer Bob Baffert said he'll tell Flores to ``let him lope
away from (the gate).''
</P>
<P>
   Malek is an 8-5 morning-line favorite over 2-1 General
Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   When the Pacific Classic was made the climactic event in the
inaugural, 11-race ``NTRA Champions on Fox'' series for 3-year-olds
and up, Del Mar salivated at the thought of hosting Horse of the
Year contenders from across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But series leader Behrens stayed in the East to prep for the
$4million Breeders' Cup Classic Nov. 6 at Gulfstream Park near
Miami, his connections passing up a chance to pocket a $330,000
bonus by winning the Pacific Classic. And injuries sent 1998
Belmont Stakes winner Victory Gallop and record-setting speedster
Mazel Trick into retirement and '98 Kentucky Derby and Preakness
winner Real Quiet to the sidelines for the rest of '99.
</P>
<P>
   Remaining is a field of California-based horses, with only
General Challenge, Malek and Baffert-trained River Keen having won
stakes on U.S. dirt tracks. Unbelievably, Malek is the only NTRA
series points-earner in the race.
</P>
<P>
   If Malek wins, he'll receive a series bonus of $140,000 as well
as $600,000 of the Pacific Classic purse, pushing his season total
to $2,005,570 and trailing only Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner
Charismatic in '99 earnings.
</P>
<P>
   But none of that would thrill a crowd expected to top 25,000.
Six-year-old Malek's frequent second- and third-place finishes _ in
races as prestigious as the Dubai World Cup _ have given him a
reputation as a high-priced trial horse.
</P>
<P>
   Malek's big victory came in the '98 Santa Anita Handicap
remembered for barnmate Gentlemen's shocking last-place finish and
Silver Charm's race-eve injury. A win today might get the same
``yeah, but...'' reaction.
</P>
<P>
   It's up to younger, more promising General Challenge to save the
day for Del Mar.

THE BELMONT STAKES WINNER AND RUNNER-UP DUEL ANEW IN THE SUMMERTIME
DERBY  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ Lemon Drop Kid supplied a smashing
encore to his victory in the Belmont Stakes Saturday when he won
the 130th running of the Travers and raced to the head of this
season's class of 3-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   The bay son of Kingmambo actually rewrote the climax to his June
script in which he held off the long shot Vision and Verse by a
head before a record Belmont crowd of 85,818. This time, running
against three of his Triple Crown rivals and four other colts with
championship ambitions, he finished three-quarters of a length in
front of Vision and Verse before a record Travers crowd of 51,371.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the warriors: Menifee, the 9-5 favorite, got trapped
on the inside and ran third in front of his stablemate, Ecton Park,
while the star of the D. Wayne Lukas barn, Cat Thief, finished
seventh with breathing problems.
</P>
<P>
   So, in million-dollar landmark races less than three months
apart, Lemon Drop Kid staked his claim to the leadership of the
class. It was once held by Charismatic, who won the Kentucky Derby
and the Preakness before running third in the Belmont, which he
finished with a fractured leg that forced his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   And Lemon Drop Kid's jockey, Jose Santos, was quick to assert
the claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is one of the best, if not the best 3-year-old,'' Santos
said. ``He won the Belmont, beat Charismatic, and now he's won the
Travers. Maybe now he'll get the respect he deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   Scotty Schulhofer, who trains Lemon Drop Kid for Jeanne Vance
and her husband, Laddie, remembered that his horse had run second
to Ecton Park in the mud in the Jim Dandy Stakes earlier this month
and said he had been sweating out the weather here all week. But
the rain left, the sun returned and the track was rated fast by
post time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't like running on a sloppy track,'' Schulhofer said,
``and I was afraid for a while this morning that we might have an
off track. But he still has a lot to do. We'll see how he does the
next two or three races. He'll have to beat Behrens and some of
those older horses.''
</P>
<P>
   The race, celebrated as ``the summertime Kentucky Derby,''
provides a second chance for horses who do not win the Kentucky
Derby. It also sets up a ranking for 3-year-olds as they head into
the homestretch of a season that ends in November with the $4
million Breeders' Cup Classic.
</P>
<P>
   And it prompts expressions of regret by the losing trainers and
jockeys.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Bailey, the rider on Unbridled Jet and the nation's
leading jockey, finished last in all three stakes on Saturday's
program, then said after the Travers, ``I had good position, but
when I pulled the trigger, Unbridled Jet didn't shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott Walden, who trains Menifee and Ecton Park _ who won the
Haskell and Jim Dandy at different tracks on the same day earlier
this month _ lamented the slow pace of the Travers. ``When they go
that slow, it's hard to make up ground,'' he said. ``Lemon Drop Kid
ran a great race, and we just didn't get lucky. Menifee ran well,
but he just couldn't get out from the inside, and that might have
cost him the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemon Drop Kid stalked the slow pace set by Cat Thief, running
third for the first mile. Then, as they turned for home, Santos
nudged him up to second place behind Vision and Verse and they
dueled the rest of the way while Menifee and Ecton Park gave their
finishing kicks, too little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon Drop Kid ran the mile and a quarter in 2:02, paid $9.30
for a $2 bet to win and earned $600,000 for the second time in
three months.
</P>
<P>
   The stage for the Travers was set by two other stakes with
all-star casts, the King's Bishop and the Fourstardave. And
Forestry, who ran third behind Menifee and Cat Thief in the
Haskell, won the $200,000 King's Bishop by a length and a half
after a dazzling speed duel with Five Star Day, with Successful
Appeal and Vicar next.
</P>
<P>
   The winner, owned by Marie and Aaron Jones and trained by Bob
Baffert with Chris Antley riding, ran the seven furlongs in 1:21,
record time for the stakes, and returned $5.60 to win for a $2 bet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to run him in the Travers,'' Baffert said.
``He's not ready for that. But that was world-class speed you saw
today.''
</P>
<P>
   In the $150,000 Fourstardave, a mile and one-sixteenth on the
grass, Neil Howard's Commic Strip scored by 2{ lengths over Divide
and Conquer with Bomfim third.

Comets put home superiority to the test
<TEXT>
<P>
   By W.H. STICKNEY JR.
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Comets coach Van Chancellor isn't known for his reticence.
Thrust a microphone near his mouth or turn on the TV camera lights,
and he's liable to talk into the wee hours of the morning.
</P>
<P>
   But Chancellor was succinct Saturday describing the plight of
the Comets, who trail the Los Angeles Sparks 1-0 entering today's
Game 2 of the best-of-three WNBA Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole season is tomorrow,'' he said. ``We're going to put
it all on the line. Every bit of it.''
</P>
<P>
   For three years, the Comets have defined what it means to be the
best in the WNBA. Just mention ``two-time defending champion,'' and
the subject is clear.
</P>
<P>
   But for the second time in as many summers, the Comets are
facing a backs-to-the-wall situation in the playoffs. Lose to the
Sparks for the fourth time this summer, and there is no tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Comets, there couldn't be better walls to be pressed
against than those of Compaq Center, site of today's game and, if
necessary, Game 3 on Monday night. Over the last two years, the
Comets have posted a 32-2 record at home (including the playoffs),
by far the best in the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really?'' forward Tina Thompson, said. ``That's pretty
impressive, huh? I didn't know that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you find, I guess, a state of comfort at home. It's
definitely fun being at home. You get to sleep in your own bed;
you're in a relaxed and familiar situation. We have our fans behind
us, and they're great.''
</P>
<P>
   It was by virtue of their 26-6 regular-season record that the
Comets earned home-court advantage throughout the playoffs. It was
clearly the difference last year when the Comets ran up a 27-3
mark, opened at Phoenix in the WNBA Finals and fell behind 1-0 to
the Mercury. Upon coming home, they staged a comeback and repeated
as champs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we understand the situation we're in,'' forward Sheryl
Swoopes said. ``We know if we lose we're finished, and there's no
chance for the three-peat.
</P>
<P>
   ``And right now, that's not even what we're really focusing on.
We just want to come out and play hard and win the game. I think if
we win, we will be very confident in feeling like we can win again
on Monday. But the most important thing is that we stay focused
(today) and play really well, tough and hard for 40 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   In finishing 15-1 at Compaq Center this year, the Comets won
their last 12 regular-season games at home, a league record, and
are 5-0 all-time there in postseason games.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion Orlando Miracle planted the only blemish on this
year's home record with a 68-64 win June 18 that kept the Comets
from an 8-0 start, which would have been an all-time WNBA best.
</P>
<P>
   But playing in Compaq Center never has been a pleasant task for
the Sparks. In eight visits, including two this season, LA never
has beaten the Comets here.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a first time for everything. And Los Angeles coach
Orlando Woolridge will lead a confident, loose group onto the court
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nothing to lose,'' said center Lisa Leslie, who
torched the Comets for 23 points in the Sparks' 75-60 victory at
Los Angeles on Thursday night. ``They're the defending champions.
Nobody expects us to win anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But on three occasions in LA this season, the Sparks
have proved the Comets aren't invincible.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Chancellor says it won't be for lack of confidence if the
Comets fall a fourth time to LA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll always believe we're going to win,'' he said. ``I think
what we did Thursday night was give LA a big boost of confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The Comets were ineffective in all phases of the game. The
Comets shot poorly (41.2 percent), were outrebounded 30-21,
committed 18 turnovers and twice fell behind by as many as 17
points in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was the one game that everyone was just
emotionally drained,'' said guard Cynthia Cooper, who was 4-for-16
from the floor and scored 12 points, 10 below her average. ``We
were emotionally drained from everything that had been going on all
season, and certainly in the last couple of weeks (surrounding the
death of Kim Perrot).
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just flat. Mentally and physically, we were not there.
That coupled with the fact that they (the Sparks) played well.''
</P>
<P>
   Woolridge is bracing for a potential haymaker from the Comets in
response.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the type team that takes it personally when you beat
them,'' he said. ``We know we're going to face their best effort.
And we have to raise the bar. We have to play twice, three times as
good as we did in LA, because they're tough to beat here.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, said Leslie, if there's pressure, it's on the Comets.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the defending champion. We're just here to win a
ballgame,'' she said. ``Simple as that.''

CLINTONS HUNT FOR A HOUSE AND CAMPAIGN FUNDS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)
<TEXT>
<P>
   By NANCY MATHIS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1999
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HAUPPAGE, N.Y. _ At President Clinton's urging, New Yorkers
opened their checkbooks Saturday for first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton and Democrats as a vacation gave way to campaign fund
raising in the Hamptons.
</P>
<P>
   The president joined top Democrats in making the most direct
appeals yet on behalf of his wife's unannounced, and unprecedented,
candidacy as the first lady herself maintained there is still work
to be done in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want somebody that's thought about this stuff (issues)
and worked hard and always tried to do it for other people for 30
years, who has more heart, more intelligence, more ability and more
commitment than any person I have ever known ... then you ought to
send her to the Senate and give her a chance to serve,'' Clinton
told 300 well-heeled New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hillary Clinton has yet to declare her candidacy, her
Senate exploratory committee was sharing in the $300,000
fund-raising event at the East Hampton home of Washington lobbyist
Liz Robbins. The Democratic Party and the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee also were each receiving a third of the
proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first fund-raising event held for the first lady in
which reporters were allowed to hear the remarks. Hillary Clinton
has held fund-raising events in New York, Texas and Massachusetts.
Today, the fashion designer Vera Wang will hold another
money-raising luncheon for her in the Hamptons. The president
intended to raise money for the Democratic Party at a late evening
event and at a dinner Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., chairman of the DSCC, said, ``We
need this woman in the United States Senate. We need her strength,
we need her intellect, we need her convictions.''
</P>
<P>
   There was little pretense that her ``exploration'' was still
under way. However, there still is no date for her formal
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm considering this because I really believe in public
service,'' the first lady said, adding that ``even after, yes, the
last six and a half years I still believe in public service.'' She
said she had long supported other people's campaigns ``and now I'm
stepping forth and asking you for your support and your help.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the progress we've made in the last six and a half
years and I want to be a part of continuing that,'' Hillary Clinton
said. But she also added there was still work to be done to spread
the economic prosperity to even the poorest Americans, to provide a
first-class education for all children and to ensure health care
for those who can't afford it.
</P>
<P>
   The president told the New Yorkers that he and Hillary Clinton
are still debating the policy issues of the day, just as they did
when the first met in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   He told them about a walk he and the first lady took Friday,
their last full day of vacation in Martha's Vineyard. ``I said, you
know, I hope you're not tired of this after all these years and she
said, `No, it's still very interesting to me.' She said, `You may
be a lot of things but you're not boring.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd howled at the last line. Only months ago Clinton
survived an attempt to remove him from office, impeached for
denying a sexual affair with a young White House intern that he
eventually admitted. It was during the year-long sex scandal that
the first lady's popularity, enhanced perhaps by the image of a
suffering spouse, hit new highs and helped inspire her quest for
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The president also championed the cause of all Democratic office
seekers. ``I'm not running for anything, but I don't want to see
all this work we've done derailed. And I don't want to see all the
progress my country has made sacrificed. And believe me, there is
still a war going out there for the conscience, the soul and the
future of this country,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons will continue their vacation when they leave Monday
for the Skaneateles, Finger Lakes resort near Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the first family resumed their hunt for a house in
Westchester County where the first lady wants to establish her
official residency. The Clintons own no property, accept for a
share of the first lady's mother's home in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   The family spent two hours looking over one four-story home in
Chappaqua, a five-bedroom, $1.7-million Georgian colonial. Bill
Clinton told reporters there had been no decision on a home
purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what kind of home they were looking for, he said, ``some
place nice and airy that will make Hillary happy _ that's all I
want.''

RANGERS FIND POP IN CLUTCH TO BEAT BLUE JAYS
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Two-out, run-scoring base hits will demoralize an
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   See Blue Jays, Toronto, for the nearest Canadian example.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers _ thanks to a barrage of clutch, two-out hits _
moved 26 games above .500 for only the second time in the
franchise's 28-year history with yesterday's 9-7 victory at
Skydome.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers lowered the boom on left-hander David ``Boomer''
Wells by scoring seven runs in his four-inning appearance, and five
of those crossed the plate with two outs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are big hits,'' said first baseman Rafael Palmeiro, who
drove in the Rangers' first-inning run with a two-out single that
scored second baseman Luis Alicea. ``It just demoralizes a team. I
know. I've been there when it's been done to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers kept doing it, and right-hander Aaron Sele
benefited. Sele (15-7) pitched six effective innings for the
victory and improved to 62-10 for his career when given five or
more runs of support.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers scored their fourth and Sele's magical fifth runs on
a two-out, second-inning home run by designated hitter Juan
Gonzalez, who deposited an 0-2 delivery from Wells into the Blue
Jays' left-field bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Johnny Oates turned to pitching coach Dick Bosman in the
visitors' first-base dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Boz, the odds are in our favor,' '' Oates recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's two-run homer wrapped up the Rangers' four-run second
inning, but perhaps the most significant at-bat belonged to Rusty
Greer earlier in the frame. Ivan Rodriguez stranded Tom Goodwin and
Alicea at second and third base, respectively, with his second
strikeout in as many at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   That brought Greer to the plate in search of a momentum-changing
hit. Wells (12-9) worked the count in his favor and then lost his
advantage when Greer stroked a two-strike pitch into center field
for a two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   Those two-out, run-scoring base hits discourage opponents, who
are on the verge of escaping an inning unscathed with one more
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are big for your ballclub, and it might take a little
air out of them,'' Greer said. ``I know I don't like to see two-out
base hits when I'm on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Sele departed after the sixth inning with an 8-4 lead intact,
but the Blue Jays put a mild scare into the Rangers with their
ninth-inning uprising. Left-hander Jeff Fassero, acquired Friday
from the Seattle Mariners, surrendered three consecutive hits
without recording an out after pitching a scoreless eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Johnny Oates summoned closer John Wetteland from the
bullpen after a run-scoring single by right fielder Shawn Green
pulled the Blue Jays within four runs.
</P>
<P>
   The first two batters Wetteland faced were first baseman Carlos
Delgado and third baseman Tony Fernandez, two of the American
League's more dangerous hitters. However, neither Delgado (0-for-6)
nor Fernandez (0-for-7) have a career base hit against Wetteland,
``and they still don't have a hit off of him,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado, though, drove in a run with a sacrifice fly, and Darrin
Fletcher drove in another with his two-out double before Wetteland
retired Tony Batista on strikes for his 35th save.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's triumph provided the Rangers an opportunity to
finish this 13-game stretch against Cleveland, Boston, New York and
Toronto with a 10-3 record if they win today.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ballclub,'' Oates said, ``has responded to the challenge
very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Two-out base hits always help.

PENN STATE CLOBBERS ARIZONA
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   STATE COLLEGE, Pa. _ The Pigskin Classic was supposed to
showcase a team that wins with two quarterbacks sharing the load.
It did. But the successful, share-the-wealth quarterbacks played
for Penn State, not Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The third-ranked Nittany Lions started their national
championship chase with yesterday's 41-7 shellacking of
fourth-ranked Arizona, which plays at TCU next Sunday. Penn State
had 504 yards in offense (its highest total since 1997), with
senior Kevin Thompson and junior Rashard Casey each playing six
possessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd heard all about Arizona and their two-headed monster at
quarterback,'' Casey said. ``We wanted to show that we've got two
pretty good quarterbacks, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Paterno's system rewards seniors, and he had named Thompson the
starter even though the fans are behind Casey, who has a strong arm
and can scramble for big plays. Before the game, he gave no
indication that he would play Casey. But after Thompson drove the
Nittany Lions to a touchdown on their first drive, Casey came in
for the next two series.
</P>
<P>
   Both Penn State quarterbacks ran an offense that was a bit more
freewheeling. The Nittany Lions even confused Arizona, which had
six months to prepare for the game. Cornerback Kelvin Hunter said
the Wildcats had prepared for most of Penn State's plays _ like
Chafie Fields' reverses (three times for 110 yards). But linebacker
Scotter Sprotte said the Nittany Lions surprised Arizona with their
single-back, spread-the-field sets.
</P>
<P>
   The wide(r)-open offense allowed Penn State to breeze to a 31-0
halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to see those offensive guys out there running
free,'' said Penn State junior linebacker LaVar Arrington, who had
seven tackles, three for losses, and broke up a pass. ``We feed off
each other. To have an offense like that, it's a new dimension for
our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson and Casey, who combined to complete 11-of-19 passes for
242 yards and two touchdowns, overshadowed their Arizona
counterparts. The Wildcats' Keith Smith and Ortege Jenkins combined
to complete 25-of-35 passes for 232 yards, but Arizona's only
points were from a touchdown with 47 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Penn State gave us a reality check; they handed it to us,''
Smith said. ``They beat us every which way.''

LONG BLAST SHOULD SERVE AS REMINDER OF JUAN GONZALEZ'S VALUE TO
RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Twenty-four hours after the event, Johnny Oates was
still talking about it yesterday afternoon at Skydome.
</P>
<P>
   A professional stadium tour director couldn't have done a better
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you see where Juan hit that ball?'' the Rangers' manager
said to anyone who would listen in the Rangers' dugout.
</P>
<P>
   He was pointing to a red tarpaulin-covered section of seats in
the third deck, high above the two lower decks ``and'' the
double-decked luxury suites in left field.
</P>
<P>
   Any closer to the Skydome Hotel, with its rooms overlooking the
playing field, and you'd need a major credit card.
</P>
<P>
   This was one of those flights that normally comes with two
meals, a movie and four-digit frequent-flier miles.
</P>
<P>
   It landed halfway up the third-deck seating area, a full section
to the right and five or six rows higher than the spot marked with
the No. 29, where Joe Carter smashed a 483-foot home run two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The list of those who have had their passports stamped for trips
to that remote area _ Carter, Jose Canseco, Mark McGwire _ is a
short one.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least 500 feet, probably more,'' a Blue Jays' official said
of Gonzalez's prodigious rocket launch.
</P>
<P>
   Only the giants walk there, proving yet again that Gonzalez is
the rock upon which this team should be built, now and far into the
future.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, Oates will happily take yesterday's far more
pedestrian 378-foot line drive into the Blue Jays' bullpen in the
second inning.
</P>
<P>
   The monster blast Friday _ and another just like it yesterday _
came during batting practice and, while awe-inspiring, means
absolutely nothing in the grand scheme of things. Nobody will be
rushing out to paint Gonzalez's No. 19 at the distant spot where it
landed.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's two-run blow, however, broke Toronto starter David
Wells' back and helped carry the Rangers to a
closer-than-it-should-have-been 9-7 victory over the Blue Jays,
their 10th win in their past 13 games as they sprint toward
September's pennant-race stretch run.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's game-breaking home run was a reminder that while the
two-time MVP may be taking a backseat to the grand seasons being
enjoyed by teammates Rafael Palmeiro and Pudge Rodriguez, he is
still a mighty force in the middle of the Rangers' batting order.
</P>
<P>
   How many players can hit .310 with 29 homers and 106 runs batted
in with 32 games to go and say they're having an ``off year?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm waiting for my month,'' Gonzalez said. ``Maybe
September.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe September ``and'' October, a sobering thought for American
League pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's getting ready,'' Oates said. ``You can see it
coming. You can see that power stroke coming around.''
</P>
<P>
   All the more reason for the Rangers to recommit themselves _
both on the field and off _ to this powerful, talented and
enigmatic slugger.
</P>
<P>
   His brief ``misunderstanding'' with Oates a few weeks ago has
faded away and didn't amount to much of anything in the first
place. It did, however, bring Gonzalez to general manager Doug
Melvin's office for a very beneficial face-to-face meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that was something he needed,'' Melvin said. ``Not so
much to be talked to as it was having someone to listen. He wanted
assurance from the general manager that he wasn't being perceived
as a bad guy or some sort of malcontent.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he wanted to let me know how much he enjoys playing in
Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   The feeling should be mutual.
</P>
<P>
   Since the meeting, Gonzalez has hustled and worked hard on
defense. He has smiled. He has accepted the Rangers' team-first
concept, never seeming to be concerned that Palmeiro and Rodriguez
are enjoying the attention he usually commands at this time of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems happier and he looks like he's having more fun,''
Melvin said. ``At one point he looked like it was bothering him
that he wasn't hitting more home runs, but I don't think that's the
case any more. That was one of the things I told him, not to worry
about home runs and to just go out and be a good hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   No problem there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been much more consistent with what I expect of him since
the meeting,'' Oates said. ``It's rubbing off on the players, too.
Everyone around him feels more at ease. I know I do.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Rangers and their expanding marketing staff contemplate
new strategies for the future, they should build their campaign
around the team's key players, starting first and foremost with
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   And please, don't give me the language barrier as an excuse.
We've learned enough by now to understand that there doesn't have
to be a lot of chit chat to make an effective and dramatic
television spot. The one with Gonzalez swinging a bat in his
bathrobe on the front porch is a perfect example.
</P>
<P>
   The next step, since he can become a free agent after the 2000
season, is to get Gonzalez's signature on a new long-term contract.
He should never, ever play a single day in another uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the season's over, we'll sit down and talk,'' Melvin
said. ``We have some other free-agent questions to address first,
but we'll put together a timetable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all comes down to trying to put a good team on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a thought: Build it on your biggest, strongest rock.

NORTHRIDGE DEFENSE STRIKES BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After watching the Cal State Northridge
quarterbacks and receivers dominate most of the last week of fall
camp, the defense struck back.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors offense managed just two touchdowns in Saturday's
final scrimmage before the season opener next weekend against
Western Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were getting after them a little bit,'' said linebackers
coach Terrance Johnson. ``I think our defense responded.''
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Aaron Arnold caught Marcus Brady's quick slant
pass and raced 65 yards for a touchdown on the offense's second
series. Last Tuesday, the quarterbacks and receivers damaged the
defense, completing 19 of 22 passes in a 7-on-7 drill.
</P>
<P>
   With pride at stake, the CSUN defense forced fumbles and picked
up sacks. The offense didn't score until late in the scrimmage on a
25-yard pass from Mitch Ryerson to Ryan Beckwith.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense, to me, has been as solid this camp as any since
I've been here,'' said CSUN interim head coach Jeff Kearin, who had
been a Matadors assistant since 1995 before taking the head job in
July. ``They got after us (today). They got it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Working for a Cos: Saturday's opener at North Campus Stadium
will mark sophomore linebacker Cos Abercrombie's first start in
almost a year. He broke his jaw in the fourth quarter of the
Matadors' 41-10 win over Northern Arizona last September and never
returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been hungry,'' said Abercrombie, speaking of his desire
but also remembering how he lost 15 pounds when his jaw was wired
shot. ``They've had to put a muzzle on me. I know I worked extra
hard to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Abercrombie had 17 tackles, including eight solo, in just 1{
games last year before getting hurt. He was one of the best
performers in camp, which ended Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cos adds a lot of life to the defense,'' Johnson said. ``He's
young, but he's a proven veteran. He's aggressive. I know he's
excited. It's been a long time coming for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Waiting game: Senior linebacker Kaleon Green, whom CSUN coaches
are counting upon as an important contributor, still hasn't gotten
approval from the NCAA for a rare sixth year of eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   Green said he talked to Tom Shannon, CSUN's interim compliance
director, last Thursday about his appeal. He said he's ``nervous''
about not being eligible to play in the season opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should have been done five or six months ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the punt: Freshman walk-on Scott Talamantes punted in
Saturday's scrimmage, but incumbent punter Ethan Beck said he
expects to be back in action this week.
</P>
<P>
   Beck, a first-team All-Big Sky Conference selection last year,
has been nursing a sore groin muscle. He hasn't practiced in almost
two weeks.

anthrax.Birns is part of a small and stubborn minority of troops
alarmed by the anthrax inoculation, the first vaccine ever given to
outfit a fighting force against germ warfare. They are so worried,
they're willing to forfeit military careers rather than submit to

   MILLIONAIRE-SHOW (Undated) In the 14 days since the premiere of
``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' the ABC-TV game show has turned
into a ratings phenomenon. The program comes to an end at 7 p.m.
Sunday. ``Millionaire'' may also have single-handedly revived the
genre of prime-time game shows. Networks avoided them for decades
after the 1959 congressional investigation into cheating on
``Dotto,'' ``Twenty-One,'' and other big-money quiz shows of that
era. But now other networks are planning to imitate ABC's example.

WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE?' CASHES IN ON '50S GAME SHOW
FORMULA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON BARNHART  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At this point, Regis Philbin ought to be saying: Who doesn't
want to be a millionaire?
</P>
<P>
   In the 14 days since the game show ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire?'' made its premiere, with Philbin hosting nightly, it
has turned into a ratings phenomenon for ABC.
</P>
<P>
   With its garish special effects and graphics, suspense-building
tricks and unprecedented cash payout of $1 million, ``Who Wants to
Be a Millionaire?'' instantly cut through the late-summer clutter
of reruns. It has been TV's most-watched program nearly every night
for the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The program comes to an end with an hourlong finale at 8 tonight
on KMBC, Channel 9. ABC already has promised that the show will be
back, possibly in November, for another short run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millionaire,'' patterned on the 1950s hit ``The $64,000
Question,'' may have single-handedly revived the genre of
prime-time game shows. Networks avoided them for decades after the
1959 congressional investigation into cheating on ``Dotto,''
``Twenty-One'' and other big-money quiz shows.
</P>
<P>
   But now other networks are planning to imitate ABC's example,
and the ``Millionaire'' format, already a smash in Great Britain,
is being exported to more than 120 countries, according to its
executive producer, Michael Davies.
</P>
<P>
   So far, ``Millionaire'' hasn't made anyone a millionaire, and
the tapings have not been glitch-free. But nothing has stemmed the
growing enthusiasm for the show.
</P>
<P>
   On tonight's finale _ expected to draw as many as 20 million
viewers _ a contestant who was wrongly eliminated will be invited
back to resume his game at the $125,000 level. On the show that
aired Aug. 19, David Honea correctly identified Lake Huron as the
second-largest of the Great Lakes; the answer used on the show was
Lake Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Two other contestants have stopped just short of the $1 million
summit, taking home prizes of $500,000 (the biggest single payout
in TV history) and $250,000. Each player must answer 15 questions
to reach $1 million, roughly doubling their money with each right
guess. A single miss ends the game, though players are allowed
three ``lifelines,'' or requests for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millionaire's'' popularity and the traditional low production
costs of game shows have created a hugely profitable hit _ the
``Blair Witch Project'' of this summer's TV schedule.
</P>
<P>
   And the show has another revenue stream: a nationwide 900 number
that viewers call to qualify to be on it. The preliminary phone
game, which cost $1.50 a play, featured three sets of items that
had to be placed in order using the telephone keypad. Call-in
players who correctly arranged the items fastest then competed in a
telephone playoff against other callers. The 10 finalists, plus two
alternates, were flown to New York for the taping.
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Roberts of Paola, Kan., went to Monday's taping as an
alternate and was named a contestant after a finalist had to drop
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened so fast,'' Roberts recalled. ``I wasn't nervous
during the taping. It was like a carnival, it was so unreal.''
</P>
<P>
   That day Roberts competed against other finalists in one last
round of ``the fastest finger.'' Asked to arrange four dolls in the
order in which they came on the market, Roberts was correct but
wasn't the fastest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a great time and I was really glad I went, but then in
the last 24 hours it's begun to sink in. I didn't get a shot at the
money,'' said Roberts with a laugh. ``All those things I could've
done, even with $32,000.''  &LR; brk:Unbeatable formula
</P>
<P>
   Describing what made ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?''
profitable is easier than explaining why audiences have been so
taken by it.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly ABC's nonstop promotion campaign helped, as did the
lack of competition on other networks.
</P>
<P>
   Others say that for sheer drama, ``Millionaire'' is in a league
by itself: the music, the lighting, the moment of indecision
brought on each time Philbin asks the contestant, ``Is that your
final answer?''
</P>
<P>
   ``This show is light years above any other format of this kind
that has been even remotely attempted over the past 30 years,''
said Steve Beverly, a broadcast professor at Union University in
Jackson, Tenn., and historian of game shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The college professors here where I teach, normally when you
talk about something like this show, they hold their nose. They're
watching this show.''
</P>
<P>
   The origins of ``Millionaire'' are found in the quiz show craze
that started 44 summers ago when ``The $64,000 Question'' became an
immediate hit. That fall it bumped Edward R. Murrow's news program,
``See It Now,'' off the air and went on to be the No. 1 rated show
of the 1955-56 season.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers tuned in to see familiar personalities struggle with the
questions _ usually no more than four or five per broadcast _ as
they climbed the tortuous money ladder.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best-known ``$64,000 Question'' winners was Teddy
Nadler, an eccentric $50-a-week postal clerk with an eighth-grade
education. Nadler made four appearances on ``Question'' and its
companion show, ``The $64,000 Challenge,'' winning big all four
times.
</P>
<P>
   Nadler walked away with $264,000 and never worked another day in
his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He grew up in a shelter home, an orphanage, as did all the
males of his family,'' said Teddy's nephew Rich Nadler, publisher
of KC Jones. ``He was a voracious reader, particularly in history
but a variety of subjects as well. He had a romantic attachment to
books, possibly to relieve the grimness of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Teddy Nadler kept getting asked back because the Revson brothers
_ who not only were the show's sole sponsor (Revlon lipstick) but
controlled every aspect of its production _ considered him a
``proletarian hero.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People were coming on the show with master's degrees,'' said
Rich Nadler. ``Teddy was this little postal clerk from nowhere who
didn't know how to pronounce any of the names because he'd never
heard them pronounced. But he was always right, and he'd always say
the answers fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the contestants on this summer's ``Millionaire,''
however, don't exactly inspire memories of Nadler's run. One could
not remember the capital of Iraq. Another, a man, did not know
which article of clothing used French cuffs. A stock trader missed
his first question, which is always easy.
</P>
<P>
   There have been other problems. Nearly all of the finalists have
been men. Many finalists have come from the nine states where it is
illegal to dial a 900 number to play a game of chance. In those
states, callers are referred to a toll-free 888 number. On some
nights, eight of the 10 finalists on ``Millionaire'' have come from
the nine toll-free states; one state, Florida, turns up two
finalists practically every night.
</P>
<P>
   A source at the program acknowledged the problem Friday, saying
more viewers probably were competing in states where the calls were
free than in those where they had to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, ABC and the staff of ``Millionaire'' have kept
security tight behind the scenes, according to several familiar
with the show's production.
</P>
<P>
   Historian Jeff Kisseloff, who interviewed most of the principals
in the quiz show scandals, says that he admires ``Millionaire'' but
that the events of the '50s have made him suspicious of any
big-money quiz show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't trust these people,'' Kisseloff said.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly teaches the history of the early quiz shows in his
broadcast ethics course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of my students have never heard it before. I tell them,
`You think it's an innocuous little game, but it almost brought
down an entire industry.'''

SOME IN THE MILITARY REFUSE TO GET REQUIRED ANTHRAX VACCINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Armed with government research, filled with suspicion about
military medicine, convinced her health is at risk, Air Force Capt.
Cyd Birns is disobeying orders.
</P>
<P>
   She refuses to take a vaccine, even though the Pentagon insists
it could save her life against the most likely of biological
weapons _ anthrax.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Department of Defense) has a history of lying to
people,'' said the grounded reconnaissance jet pilot based near
Omaha, Neb. ``I'm a very healthy person. ... I'd like to stay that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Birns is part of a small and stubborn minority of troops alarmed
by the anthrax inoculation, the first vaccine ever given to protect
a fighting force against germ warfare. These troops are so worried,
they're willing to forfeit military careers rather than submit to
the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, America's military command characterizes the
resistance as so much Internet-driven hysteria about a vaccine used
safely and effectively for almost 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who has an open mind to the science and the evidence
reaches the conclusion that we've reached,'' said Lt. Col. John
Grabenstein, a pharmacist, epidemiologist and the deputy director
of the Army Surgeon General's anthrax vaccine immunization program.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is safe.''
</P>
<P>
   By the hundreds of thousands, America's military personnel have
rolled up their sleeves for yet another needle poke. They've
submitted to anthrax vaccinations because the Pentagon insists the
threat of germ warfare is grave and growing. Military doctors have
assured them that the vaccine will work and work safely. Besides,
it's an order.
</P>
<P>
   By the hundreds _ estimates range from less than 200 to more
than 400 depending on who is asked _ rebellious troops see the
vaccine as dangerously untested and probably harmful. Birns, for
instance, thinks the myriad symptoms of Gulf War syndrome all can
be traced to anthrax inoculations.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the conflict stems from the military's spotty record of
looking out for the long-term health of its forces.
</P>
<P>
   At the dawn of the atomic age, the government conducted human
radiation testing later linked to cancer. During the Vietnam War,
the military used the defoliant Agent Orange and created various
maladies among its troops. And Gulf War veterans complaining of a
range of sickness remain at odds with Pentagon brass over whether
there is a connection between their service and their poor health.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a group of people that doesn't trust the
government,'' Grabenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict also partly stems from the glimpse it reveals of
the battlefield of the future. Before the anthrax vaccine, no
military ever tried to immunize itself against biological attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are having a hard time adjusting to this new threat,''
said Mayer Nudell, a former diplomat and counterterrorism
consultant to corporations and various government agencies. ``It's
difficult because it's something you can't reach out and touch.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacillus anthracis exists among livestock around the world,
although it is most common in the least developed areas of Central
and South America, Southern and Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa, the
Caribbean and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Infection from the bacteria causes anthrax. If the infection
comes through a cut or scrape of the skin, there's a 20 percent
chance of death. Cases of intestinal infection, usually by way of
contaminated meat, are fatal 25 to 60 percent of the time. Anthrax
infection of the lungs has a death rate of 95 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The bacteria, which can survive years in the soil in its
protective spore form, are durable little things. They can
withstand relatively high temperatures and are not easily damaged
in something like a bomb detonation.
</P>
<P>
   They come in a compact package. The death caused by chemical
weapons measured in tons could be matched in anthrax weighed in
kilograms.
</P>
<P>
   Anthrax could be dumped on a city or battlefield with anything
that would suspend it in the air _ a bomb that detonates before
hitting the ground, a cruise-type missile, a low-flying aircraft
with crop-dusting equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Testing of a vaccine for anthrax began in the 1950s. The
substance, licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in
1970, is created by nurturing cultures of the bacteria and then
killing them with formaldehyde. The process produces an ostensibly
harmless remnant of the microscopic organism. Introducing that into
the body gives birth to antibodies that can fight off otherwise
lethal forms of anthrax.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be better if we didn't have to take any vaccines _
measles, whooping cough, polio _ because you're injecting a foreign
substance into the body,'' said David Huxsoll, the former commander
of the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases.
``But it's important to protect ourselves from these diseases.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, the vaccine was given mostly to civilians. Some
veterinarians used it for protection, and it was given to mill
workers handling the carcasses of imported animals.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1900s, about 130 cases of anthrax were reported in
the United States each year. By the 1990s, entire years passed
without an American anthrax infection.
</P>
<P>
   For those without vaccination, treatment can prove nearly
impossible. Doctors can fight the disease if they know about the
infection within 48 hours by hooking the patient up to intravenous
antibiotics coupled with doses of vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   But the first signs of anthrax appear much like the common cold.
Only after several days _ when treatment would be too late _ do
acute symptoms such as severe breathing problems provide a clue of
how serious the illness is.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon contends that treating large numbers of
nonvaccinated troops exposed to anthrax spores would be a
logistical nightmare with horrifying casualty rates.
</P>
<P>
   It also asserts that countries and terrorists operating in the
Persian Gulf region and on the Korean Peninsula pose a real threat
to use anthrax weapons against American troops.
</P>
<P>
   More than 150,000 military personnel received the anthrax
vaccine _ a treatment of six shots over 18 months _ during the Gulf
War. In late 1997, Defense Secretary William Cohen ordered the
inoculation of any troops deployed to Korea or the Middle East. So
far more than 326,000 have started inoculation. By 2005, all new
recruits will receive the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   The side effects of vaccination are a point of fierce debate.
The Defense Department says most people feel the sort of temporary
tenderness in their arm typical of most vaccines. Small numbers of
people have swelling in their arms and, Defense officials say, 0.2
percent complain of flulike symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics, however, suggest that adverse reactions come far more
often. Troops who take the vaccine, they say, often suffer tremors,
fever, sleepiness, exhaustion and serious muscle pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people talk about getting grayouts, where they feel
fuzzy-headed,'' said Mark Zaid, a Washington lawyer who has
represented about two dozen persons who refused the vaccine.
``That's the last thing a reserve officer whose day job is flying a
727 or a 737 or 747 wants to experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those nuisances will pass, Zaid said, but a greater threat
looms from the unknown long-term effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows the long-term effects because nobody has followed
up the people who have taken the vaccine over the years,'' the
lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters note that vaccines have existed since a prevention
for smallpox was discovered in 1796, yet not one has been proved to
cause birth defects, sterility, cancer or other fears raised in
various quarters about anthrax vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're saying,'' said the Army's Grabenstein, ``isn't
even biologically plausible.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics also suggest the stuff might not work.
</P>
<P>
   Medical ethics prevent intentionally exposing a vaccinated
person to anthrax. So the tests of the vaccine have all been on
animals.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Russians scientists in the city of Sverdlovsk
created an artificial strain of anthrax. That has prompted
speculation that even vaccinated troops might be defenseless
against designer germs.
</P>
<P>
   Birns, the Air Force captain, has heard these worries and more.
Researching congressional reports and government agency reports on
the Internet, she has filled one loose-leaf binder five inches
thick and is about an inch deep into a second.
</P>
<P>
   She is primarily concerned that the vaccine can cause serious
damage to her immune system, something she's not willing to risk in
return for protection against a threat she sees as remote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who are pushing this just want you to be ready for
battle,'' she said. ``They don't care about what happens to you
after you retire.''
</P>
<P>
   Birns is waiting for the final disposition of her case, but she
fully expects to be kicked out of the Air Force. Everyone else who
has refused anthrax vaccination _ a private in Georgia went AWOL
when his sergeant threatened to hold him down for a shot _ has seen
his or her military career ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't think the vaccine is worth their risk,'' said Zaid,
the vaccine-battling lawyer. ``They're scared.''

MILO, MO., POWWOW UNLOCKS THE RHYTHM OF THE EARTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM FISHER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILO, Mo. _ Last weekend, east of here at the end of a rough
gravel road that traverses ripening fields but only an occasional
dwelling, there was a singular sight.
</P>
<P>
   Indians.
</P>
<P>
   And tepees, headdresses and the sound of drums.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 500 American Indians were on hand, some from as far away
as Florida and Arizona. All were here for the 37th annual Clear
Creek All Nations Indian Powwow, the biggest and oldest such event
in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   A thousand or more non-Indians each day found their way to a hay
field turned parking lot, then made their way into a grove of oaks
and firs where booths and tepees were set up, Indian-made goods
were sold, and the aroma of barbecued pork, hominy, and beans
wafted amid the trees.
</P>
<P>
   The big attraction, of course, were the twice-daily gourd dances
with their beating drums, cadenced steps and chanting dancers _ the
keystone of any Indian powwow.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what made the event unique was its location near, of all
places, Milo, Mo., one of 17 so-named places in the United States,
a designation that could be a surrogate for rural life. Seven of
the eight states abutting Missouri _ Nebraska is the exception _
have Milos of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Milo conjures up visions of russet grain atop dark green plants;
combines sweeping through autumnal fields; and a feed that, oddly,
is still sold by the hundredweight, not the bushel.
</P>
<P>
   That reverie, somehow, never even hints at Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, on the surface, does surrounding Vernon County. Nevada was
burned to cinders during the Civil War, a college for women has
thrived, an insane asylum was once one of the largest employers, a
four-lane highway now splits the county, and a handful of farmers
now manage fields with the aid of ground positioning satellites.
</P>
<P>
   But look closer, said Ed Woodington, owner of the land and the
spark plug behind the powwow for its entire existence, and this
place is absolutely perfect for a gathering of Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``Osages,'' Woodington said.
</P>
<P>
   Until almost 200 years ago, this small part of Missouri was
literally the land of milk and honey as the hereditary home of the
Great and Little Osage tribes, an intensely spiritual people who
hunted and cultivated crops, believed in selective breeding (6 feet
6 inches was not an uncommon height for an Osage male), and utterly
controlled most of what is now Kansas, Missouri, Arkansas and
Oklahoma through their ``Arabic fervency in their military
aggression.''
</P>
<P>
   Those last words were written by John Joseph Mathews, a
quarter-blood Osage himself and author of the 1961 classic, The
Osages, Children of the Middle Waters.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Middle Waters'' were the present day Osage River and its
tributaries, the Marmiton, the Little Osage and the Marais des
Cygnes. Meaning Vernon and southern Bates counties.
</P>
<P>
   Among those streams dwelt the Osages, finding, as Mathews put
it, that ``they lived in a region that had long periods of lush
tranquility, and that water fowl and water animals abounded; that
they lived at the contact line between the prairie-plains and the
woodland.
</P>
<P>
   ``For food they had abundant white-tail deer, wild turkeys,
prairie chickens, wapati (elk), buffalo, skunk, fish, lotus,
pawpaws, grapes, persimmons, hickory nuts, walnuts, hackberries,
pecans, and acorns, beside their cultivated crops of varicolored
maize, squashes, beans, pumpkins and the wild potato.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all the regions of the Western Hemisphere where there were
indigenous peoples, there could not be found a more fortunate tribe
than ... the Children of the Middle Waters.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodington, 72, himself part Ottawa Indian, said the Osage
connection wasn't lost on him when he established the first powwow
in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to dance down in Oklahoma at lot,'' he said. ``People
there were always saying we should have dances up here with all the
history. So we started this one. Used to be at the fairgrounds in
Nevada, but the people there talked about charging. We don't
charge. It's all free.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simple. It keeps our traditions and culture alive. It's
friends getting together. And what better place. This was Indian
land.''
</P>
<P>
   But not for a long time. From here the Osage were first moved,
by treaty, to southeast Kansas, then given what the government
considered wasteland in northern Oklahoma. Under that soil,
however, were vast pools of oil and subsequent riches for the
tribe.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years ago the state put in a little park up near
Harwood, where the Osage villages were,'' Woodington said. ``They
had a ceremony, invited some Osage leaders for the dedication. But
they don't come to this powwow often. Or any other. They pretty
much stay down home.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Red Bear, 52, a Lakota-Cherokee artist who came to the
powwow from his home in Poteau, Okla., said Indian history in
Missouri, while a mystery to most white people, was real to a lot
of Indians. It's fitting, he said, that there should be a powwow
here.
</P>
<P>
   Tribes are important, he said. But a powwow _ which you can hold
anywhere if you have Indians _ puts the brotherhood of all Indians
out for people to see.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, he said, they're fun to attend, to get away for a weekend.
The idea, he said, is to sell enough to cover expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what Red Bear especially enjoys is the irony he sees all
around him _ buyers of Indian goods demanding absolute assurance
that their purchase isn't some Asian knockoff, the fact that the
heads of some of the tomahawks being sold are made by pacific
Mennonites, and the profusion of signs accepting credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indians are learning,'' Red Bear said. ``They're taking what
they need from the white man's world, using it to their advantage
and not worrying about the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take me. I sell my art all over the world. How? Easy. I've got
a 26-page Web site. I also pull a 1959 trailer to these things.
It's all a matter of priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   John Cornsilk of Tahlequah, Okla., went along with Red Bear.
Cornsilk represents 20 Indian artisans, one of whom designs sweat
shirts with Cherokee, Choctaw and Comanche on their fronts. The
lettering makes them appear, from a distance, like the distinctive
script of a well-known soft drink.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a powwow in Oklahoma City, Coke came down and looked them
up one side and down the other,'' Cornsilk said. ``But what could
they do? They didn't say Coca-Cola. They spelled out an Indian
tribe.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the essence of the powwow was the dancing, in the hot
afternoon and the falling dusk, and where spectators sat
transfixed, not unlike all those years ago, nearby, when the Osages
danced. Mathews wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``The rhythm was the rhythm of the earth as if the drum beats
were heart beats, and the songs the drummers sang all seemed to
have an (oratorical) quality, as if the centuries-old prayer songs
had colored their voices.''

<P>
   In 1904, when America was raring to claim the new century as its
very own, Edward V.P. Schneiderhahn saw the future at the world's
fair in St. Louis _ and blinked in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ``The picture is grand. The scale immense,'' he wrote in his
diary. ``Illumination at night was wonderful. ... It is difficult
to select adequate terms.''
</P>
<P>
   For seven months Schneiderhahn, a young Missouri lawyer,
recorded the ``unthinkable magnificence'' of the 1904 Louisiana
Purchase Exposition. He gawked at its automobiles, aircraft,
electric lights, moving pictures, turbine engines, sewing machines
and wireless telegraphy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Words fail. ... Never expect to see anything so grand again.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, but he would. The 20th century had just begun. And many
Americans believed their nation now had the brains, the government
and the moral authority to redefine the world.
</P>
<P>
   Two songs that year captured the spirit: ``The Yankee Doodle
Boy,'' by George M. Cohan, and ``Meet Me in St. Louis, Louis,'' in
which a restless wife leaves her husband so she can frolic at the
fair. Indeed, the fair signaled to ancient powers in Europe that
the United States had come of age and would not be slowed.
</P>
<P>
   But where were we headed, exactly?
</P>
<P>
   As fairgoers strode the grounds, they munched on ice-cream cones
and hot dogs _ two new snacks that later gave rise to the fast-food
culture.
</P>
<P>
   A vaudeville act featured ``Dancing Girls'' in risque attire.
``What a shame,'' Schneiderhahn wrote. Impressionist paintings left
him wondering ``why an artist should delight to choose mean
topics.'' As for the motor cars, the diarist mused: ``A whole city
of these puffing, mad and stinking ugly things would not look very
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Cars. Mass media. Movies. The urge to ``Americanize'' foreign
cultures. So many aspects of today's national persona were
conceived in that first decade of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   It's been called America's century.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, its beginning and end hardly seem compatible.
But the story in between is linear. Events of one decade forge
attitudes in the next. The American psyche in 1999 _ how we today
think and dream and view our role in the world _ is but the logical
result of it all.
</P>
<P>
   If there's one lesson of the century, it's that awesome
achievements almost always produce results good and bad.
Schneiderhahn sensed this; Americans have witnessed it to this day.
</P>
<P>
   Their government went from progressive reformer to mid-century
warrior to what some regard as a big, fat meddler. Technology, once
thought to benefit everyone, became a threat to some livelihoods
and life itself. Conveniences exploded but community eroded.
</P>
<P>
   A Kansas City Star poll suggests that optimism so evident at the
start of the century is still there, but it's strapped with
caveats. Respondents were far more likely to say technology in the
near future would have a positive rather than negative influence,
but they express only marginal faith in government, corporations
and the news media.
</P>
<P>
   About four in 10 said federal programs aimed at correcting
social problems are ``ineffective.'' They disagreed on another
issue that hearkens back to the turn of the century _ immigration.
Forty-six percent said America's ``melting pot'' image has been
good for the country, 20 percent said it has been bad.
</P>
<P>
   As author David McCullough sees it, we are the nation we dreamed
of being in 1900. ``We wanted wealth. We wanted power,
conveniences, personal liberties, public education for anyone _ and
we got it,'' the historian said. ``But I think they'd be
disappointed at how we've used those things. For every gain,
there's been loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Time travelers from 1900 would be thrilled by what we now take
for granted: Social Security, paved highways, straight teeth,
painkillers, even Kleenex.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not sure they'd be impressed with us as people,'' said
McCullough. ``They'd wonder why so many families break up (and) why
we don't work as much with each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they'd find us rather soft and spoiled, not very
colorful...We can run our personal computers, but can we milk a
cow? Can we deliver a baby? They'd be amazed how easy we have it,
physically.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1900 the nation was only five generations old, 76 million
strong and bursting out all over.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants had helped fatten the population 20 percent in just
the past decade. And the century arrived with as many Americans
living west of Indiana as east.
</P>
<P>
   Our democratic experiment struck Indiana's U.S. Sen. Albert
Beveridge as positively divine. ``God has marked the American
people as His chosen nation,'' he gushed.
</P>
<P>
   History stamped two faces onto that first decade.
</P>
<P>
   One was Theodore Roosevelt's _ rugged and grinning, hero of the
Spanish-American War, lover of jujitsu, still the youngest
president ever.
</P>
<P>
   The other face belonged to the fictitious Gibson Girl, whose
porcelain skin and demure expressions epitomized the woman of the
leisure class. She was the antithesis of today's working mother.
Drawn by Charles Dana Gibson, she was stately but delicate and she
kept her ruby lips closed.
</P>
<P>
   These were ``The Good Years,'' as Walter Lord titled his 1960
book on the era. Good years, that is, if you were male, Anglo-Saxon
and Protestant (those were the men whom, in Beveridge's view, ``God
has been preparing to govern savages and senile peoples.'')
</P>
<P>
   If you were a child lucky enough to survive infancy _ one in
seven did not _ grueling work lay just ahead. In 1910, 20 percent
of children aged 10 to 15 were ``gainfully occupied'' in full-time
jobs. Many worked 60-hour weeks.
</P>
<P>
   When a boy in a Georgia mill was asked if he'd rather spend his
summer playing, he said, ``I don't know how.''
</P>
<P>
   Child labor. Filthy factories. Uneducated immigrants jammed into
flats. Huge corporate profits. Excesses of the Gilded Age spurred
demands to improve life for ``the common man.''
</P>
<P>
   Reformers grabbed the torch of a new generation. And Roosevelt
slung it with the gusto of a big-game hunter, which he was.
</P>
<P>
   Sworn in after the 1901 assassination of William McKinley,
Roosevelt followed a bland parade of post-Civil War presidents
whose inaction allowed John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie and
other industrial titans to set the national agenda.
</P>
<P>
   But that was the 19th century. This was the 20th.
</P>
<P>
   ``New political fashions had come together,'' writes Paul
Johnson in A History of the American People. They included causes
alive today: trustbusting, conservationism, better schools for the
underclass and, as Johnson puts it, ``the notion of educated
purposeful elites as `guardians' of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the Republican Roosevelt who set that big ball of
government rolling, though it started small. He called for federal
inspections of meat. He put legal teeth in antitrust laws. He
embraced national parks. He even unfurled Old Glory beyond its own
shores, not only as a Rough Rider on San Juan Hill but also as the
political engineer of the Panama Canal _ a project no other country
could or wanted to complete.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks after taking office, Roosevelt made clear he was unlike
any president before him. He outraged Southern newspapers by
inviting a black man, Booker T. Washington, to dine at the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   In no way were these good years for black Americans.
</P>
<P>
   McClure's Magazine reported in 1904 that the status of blacks in
the South had gone nowhere since the Civil War. Nine in 10 inmates
at Southern penitentiaries were black. Strangled by poverty, poor
schooling and Jim Crow segregation, most black males died before
they were 35. Something had to be done, urged McClure's, a leader
in the new art of muckraking.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Star chimed in with an editorial urging
patience, though its reasoning was abominable. Back then, the
racial attitudes of The Star _ one of the nation's most progressive
papers and a Roosevelt booster _ reflected those of many white
intellectuals:
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a long time for the social inheritance of
civilization to accumulate. This social inheritance is almost
wholly lacking in the negro. Four or five generations ago he was a
savage, not greatly different, mentally or morally, from the jungle
animals about him ... .''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the decade also brought forth the more learned
insights of W.E.B. Du Bois, the first African-American to receive a
doctorate from Harvard University. He prophesied that our biggest
domestic struggle of the century would be ``the problem of the
color line.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1904 America's all-male electorate, white and black,
supported Roosevelt for another term. Although his victory
surprised nobody, one aspect was stunning. The state of Missouri
broke from the Old South's political ranks and backed a Republican
for the first time.

<P>
   This new century had far bigger surprises in store.
</P>
<P>
   American ingenuity had already performed miracles: lighting the
night with incandescent bulbs, linking voices by telephone,
connecting all corners of the nation with 193,000 miles of railway.
</P>
<P>
   When the century turned, author Jack London penned an essay on
``The Shrinkage of the Planet.'' How wondrous it was, the
Californian wrote, to live in a world where ``every part knows what
every other part is thinking or doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Anything looked possible. Pundits predicted that science by the
year 2000 would eradicate cancer, hunger, poverty and even
differences in skin color. All warring would cease. ``Man will see
around the world,'' the Ladies' Home Journal forecast in 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the wildest notion of all came true quicker than anyone
expected, on Dec. 17, 1903.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed so ludicrous, The Associated Press report wound up in
the trash in most newsrooms. The Star was one of a few papers
nationwide that carried it on the front page, below a small
headline: ``A Machine That Flies.''
</P>
<P>
   Bicycle mechanics Wilbur and Orville Wright had their
contraption aloft for 59 seconds _ the first human-carrying ascent
of a motorized, heavier-than-air craft. It was just one of several
innovations from the first decade that altered life for the rest of
the century.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Albert Einstein published his theory of
relativity. Two years after that, David Kenney patented the
electric vacuum cleaner. Two years after that, Leo Baekeland
invented the first plastic and Lee De Forest patented a triode
vacuum tube that amplified radio signals, spurring the arrival of
widespread broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   Automobiles provided yet another link between once-isolated
communities. The elite's toy became a working-class option in 1908,
when Henry Ford unveiled his ``car for the great multitude,'' the
$850 Model T.
</P>
<P>
   Every achievement heralded the promise of a perfect society to
come. Beneath optimism, however, stirred anxieties that this
shrinking planet just might disturb the sanctum of our homes.
</P>
<P>
   Telephones, for example, ``allowed strange men to court your
daughter without stepping into your house,'' said Carolyn Marvin, a
professor at the Annenburg School of Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Even the $1 Kodak Brownie camera, which in 1900 brought simple
photography to average families, carried the risk of letting others
in on your clownish behavior and beach poses.
</P>
<P>
   Moving pictures triggered other concerns. By 1909, when
filmmakers produced fuzzy features lasting 15 minutes, one in four
Americans visited a movie house every week. Crime, mayhem and
slapstick dominated the screens.
</P>
<P>
   Crusaders argued that 15 minutes was ample time to warp young
minds or encourage who-knows-what. The Independent, a society
magazine, urged calm: ``The fad will die out in the next few
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, movie-going enjoyed the longevity of telephoning,
motoring, snapping pictures and reading sensational newspapers _
all of which captivated the middle class by decade's end.
</P>
<P>
   And, eventually, it all merged into a single concept.
</P>
<P>
   Popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   Today the term needs no definition. After all, what shapes
America more than popular culture? What dictates the marketplace,
leisure time, work habits, criminal habits and elections? What most
threatens our moral fiber? Popular culture, right?
</P>
<P>
   Funny, but that term didn't exist when America's century began.

WHIPPED ARIZONA TURNS ITS ATTENTION TO HORNED FROGS

<P>
   STATE COLLEGE, Pa. _ Arizona woke up Saturday morning in Happy
Valley, ranked No. 4. The Wildcats arrived home Saturday night in
Tearful Tucson hoping to still be ranked in the top 10 when they
play at TCU next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   All you needed to know about the Pigskin Classic] the 97,618 at
Beaver Stadium told you with 5:13 remaining in the first half.
After Penn State scored to take a 31-0 lead, the fans started
chanting: ``Over-rated, over-rated. Arizona got the message. After
yesterday's 41-7 embarrassment, the Wildcats hope to make a
rebuttal statement at Amon Carter Stadium in eight days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel disgusted, violated and what we've got to do is take
this whipping and learn from it,'' said Arizona linebacker DaShon
Polk, who talked better than he tackled \Rthree, total\S .''We've
got to take the hurt that's built up in us and bring it to the next
game. I hope this will make us stronger, because right now, we're
not a good team.
</P>
<P>
   ``TCU is no pushover. That's a big game. We're really going to
have to show the character of this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Are the Wildcats as bad as they appeared? Probably not. But they
might not be as good as they were expected to be. Arizona had
pointed to and prepared for the Penn State game, a game it
volunteered to play. Because the Wildcats appeared so overmatched,
it will be difficult to convince the poll voters any different.
Arizona's season goal has changed from ``Sugar Bowl'' to ``Rose
Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   But even a first trip to Pasadena might rest on a trip to Fort
Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at TCU now,'' Arizona junior quarterback Ortege
Jenkins said. ``It will be a huge test for us mentally. Hopefully
this team will bounce back next week. If not, we're in a load of
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The third-ranked Nittany Lions might be the nation's best team.
They looked that way razing Arizona, which had that
``deer-in-the-headlights'' look about them. The Wildcats are
celebrating their 100th year of football and an Arizona team had
never ventured this far East. They probably won't make a similar
trip for another 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   The preseason hype generated by a 12-1 season that ended with a
Holiday Bowl victory over Nebraska disappeared quicker than Penn
State could score. And that was fast. The Nittany Lions' longest
scoring drive was their first, a plain-as-their uniforms 80-yard
effort in seven plays. Penn State's other first-half scores
required possessions of 12 seconds, 46 seconds, 1:32 and 2:17.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona started the game with four linebackers. The Wildcats
needed 11 tacklers. The Wildcats perpetuated the image of the
Pacific-10 as a touch-football conference. Chafie Fields' first
touchdown, a 37-yard reception, came when he broke a Pee Wee
Herman-like tackle by Arizona cornerback Kelvin Hunter. Two
possessions later, Penn State's Aaron Harris ran through another
Hunter arm tackle. And on Harris' 15-yard touchdown run, he blasted
past and through three Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got our butts kicked. We got beat as bad as we could get
beat,'' Arizona coach Dick Tomey said. ``It was one of those games
that was a nightmare. We were poor in the kicking game, poor in
tackling, they outhit us, they were tougher than we were, more
physical. Everything you want to be in football, they were better
than us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to find out who we are. Right now, we don't like
what we see. We need to take the hurt and the pain from this game
and transfer that into positive energy.''
</P>
<P>
   And that New Age form of football preparation will be aimed full
force at TCU.

DISTRESS IS IN THE AIR AROUND NFL CAMPS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Soundcheck 1: ``Anytime you bring in a lot of new people, your
execution is going to be bad. ...every time we got going, we were
set back by something we did wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Soundcheck 2: ``We stink. It was horrible. I'm sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Soundcheck 3: ``We have to step it up. If we don't, it's going
to be a long year. We really stunk it up. It's not a good
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Soundcheck 4: ``We didn't do anything well out there. We just
have to come out and regroup. We have to get our focus back. We
didn't look like a team that's supposed to be in the playoffs. We
didn't look like a team that would even have a winning record.''
</P>
<P>
   Soundcheck 5: ``Right now, this team is like a dark comedy. Just
when you think it can't get worse, it gets worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The mood of those quotes from the past week could certainly come
from Camp Cowboys, for this has been a summer they would like to
forget. They have had enough injuries to merit team trainer Jim
Maurer a bigger office. The first-team offense has scored but one
touchdown, and the first-team defense was bombed last week in New
England.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, however, the poor-mouthing did not come from the
Cowboys. In the first soundcheck, Dan Reeves bemoans the fate of
his defending NFC champion Falcons, who can't seem to get it going
consistently this summer with so many rookies. In a preseason game
against the Ravens a few days earlier, the Falcons lost, 19-6, when
two rookie cornerbacks were beaten on long touchdown passes.
</P>
<P>
   In the second soundcheck, Bill Parcells, coach of a Jets team
that lost in the AFC Championship Game last season, sounds as if he
needs to see a doctor. Parcells' special teams were anything but
special in a one-point victory against the lowly Philadelphia
Eagles last week.
</P>
<P>
   In the third soundcheck, Broncos running back Terrell Davis,
whose club is trying to become the first team to win three
consecutive Super Bowls, can't stand the smell of his team after
the Broncos were blown out by the Green Bay Packers on Monday Night
Football.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth soundcheck, Jaguars cornerback Aaron Beasley
worries that his team won't make the playoffs. A few days earlier,
Jacksonville had dropped a 27-20 decision to the New York Giants,
who didn't make the playoffs in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   And in the fifth soundcheck, Cardinals offensive lineman Matt
Joyce curses the luck of his club, which this summer has seen
injuries on the offensive line and quarterback Jake Plummer, three
players injured in a near fatal car accident and three players who
remain holdouts.
</P>
<P>
   The point is this: Nobody is looking good in the preseason. Not
even the so-called ``elite'' or the ``up-and-coming'' teams.
Rookies still don't know the plays. Veterans are injured or out of
shape. A new coaching staff hasn't had time to adapt. The
temperature is too hot.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey has been around this game too long to
get too low about a preseason loss, or too high about a preseason
win. (OK. In two years, Gailey has never had a preseason victory.
But you get the point). Broncos coach Mike Shanahan, whose club
faces the Cowboys tonight in an exhibition game at Texas Stadium,
is also keeping things in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through it a number of years, and preseason never
changes,'' Shanahan said. ``If you win, it was a preseason game. If
you lose, that's the end of the world. That's just the nature of
this business.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Cowboys will be terrible in 1999. But if we use only
the preseason to make such an assumption, then there will be a lot
of disappointment for a bunch of good teams this year.
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:SPOTLIGHT: 49ers defensive end Charles Haley
Bob Galbraith Charles Haley, center, is showing a change of
attitude, and the 49ers hope it will help them when they face Brett
Favre and the Packers this season.
</P>
<P>
   Haley's behaving well, helping 49ers defense
Since he resumed his career by re-signing with the San Francisco
49ers, defensive end Charles Haley, 35, has been a model citizen.
According to his coaches and teammates, Haley's attitude this
summer has been a 180-degree turnaround from the one thatsaw him
have emotional outbreaks, and wild mood swings when he played with
the 49ers (1986-1991) and Cowboys (1992-1996).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's gotten a lot more mature. I think he's a lot more
in control of his emotions and his composure,'' 49ers linebacker
Ken Norton told the San Francisco Chronicle last week. Norton was a
teammate of Haley's in Dallas from 1992-1994. ``I think in the
past, \RHaley\S was a little more out of control. But truly, I
think life has brought these experiences to him, and he's
undoubtedly matured a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Haley was forced to retire from the Cowboys following the 1996
season because of back problems. While out of football, he led the
search for a compatible marrow donor for his daughter,
five-year-old Brianna, who has leukemia. Haley's fourth child,
Madison, born last October, was a perfect match and the leukemia is
in remission.
</P>
<P>
   Haley signed with the 49ers after the 1998 regular season and
was active for their two playoff games. This summer, his back has
held up. And he has taken the time to pass on his supreme
pass-rushing skills to younger players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any question, Charles makes our
defensive line better,'' Norton said. ``Just his presence, and I
think everybody really respects the way he plays. Everybody knows
that off the field, you've got to have this tolerance and patience
with him, but everybody also knows that once he straps it up on the
field, you're getting everything he's got.''
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:Quick hits
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:Nice draft, Jerry Remember the April draft? The
Cowboys seriously considered trading up to get Louisiana Tech wide
receiver Troy Edwards before picking North Carolina defensive end
Ebenezer Ekuban with the 20th pick. Right now, it's a good thing
the Cowboys stuck with Ekuban. Word out of Pittsburgh, where
Edwards was drafted at No. 13, is that Edwards has been slow to
pick up the pro passing game and won't beat out Courtney Hawkins or
Hines Ward for either of the starting wide receiver spots. Ward, in
his second season out of Georgia, caught 15 passes last season.
Hawkins caught 66 for 751 yards and 1 touchdown. If Edwards
couldn't beat out Hawkins and Ward, how could he have played much
for a Cowboys team with Michael Irvin, Raghib Ismail, and Ernie
Mills.
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:QB or not QB Even though Doug Flutie came off the
bench to lead the Bills to the playoffs last season, head coach
Wade Phillips is not ready to name Flutie as his starting
quarterback for 1999. This summer, Flutie has been sharing snaps
with Rob Johnson, who was the club's starting quarterback before he
injured his ribs last year. Johnson and Flutie, both of whom make
about $5 million a year, have played so well this summer that
Phillips has thought about rotating them during the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are all kinds of possibilities,'' Phillips said. ``I
think we have to wait until the preseason is over, see where we are
and how they fit in.''
</P>
<P>
   While Phillips is noncommittal, Johnson has an opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had to start a game tomorrow, Doug would start,''
Johnson said Friday. ``Like I've said a million times, Doug played
well last year and nothing's changed. So I wouldn't figure they
would make a change right now in the preseason.''

   Location: Giants Stadium, East Rutherford, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   What you need to know: This is the 17th annual Kickoff Classic.
The Buckeyes are coming off an 11-1 season, while the Hurricanes
were 9-3 last season. Both teams won their bowl games. The teams
have met once before, with Ohio State winning, 10-0, in 1977. Each
team will receive $650,000 or 30 percent of the gross revenues for
playing the game.
</P>
<P>
   Keep an eye on: Miami _ QB Kenny Kelly, RB James Jackson, LB Dan
Morgan. Ohio State _ QB Austin Moherman, RB Michael Wiley, LB Na'il
Diggs.
</P>
<P>
   Miami update: The Hurricanes will start an inexperienced
backfield. Kelly takes over for Scott Covington while Jackson will
start in place of Edgerrin James at tailback. ... This will be the
15th time Miami will open against a ranked opponent. The last time
that happened was 1992, when the Hurricanes won at 23rd-ranked
Iowa. ... Of the 99 players on the roster, 60 are freshmen or
sophomores.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State update: The Buckeyes won a coin toss and are the home
team. ... Moherman (pronounced: MAH-ker-man) is making his first
start. The California native has attempted just one pass. ... The
Buckeyes have won 12 consecutive season openers. Their last loss in
the opener came to Alabama in the 1986 Kickoff Classic.

HARRY KAHN, 82, A COLLECTOR OF ART  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Harry Kahn, a retired New York investment adviser,
art collector and philanthropist, died on Aug. 20 at Lenox Hill
Hospital. A resident of Manhattan's Upper East Side and Truro,
Mass., he was 82.
</P>
<P>
   The causes were pneumonia and congestive heart failure, his
family said.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn retired in 1990 as a partner in the brokerage firm of
Neuberger &AMP; Berman. He joined the firm in 1963 after 10 years as a
researcher and partner in Bache &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Long a supporter of the Brooklyn Museum of Art, he served on its
board until 1997. He was a founder of its Contemporary Arts Council
and, at his death, was a member of the Acquisitions Committee.
</P>
<P>
   As an art collector in his own right he was widely known for the
self-portraits by 20th-century American artists he gathered with
his companion, Ruth Bowman, an art historian.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Manhattan, Harry Kahn graduated from Harvard College in
1937 and earned a master's in public administration from Harvard
University in 1948. In between, he served in the Army and held
posts in the Treasury Department and the Office of Strategic
Services. After the war, he was on the staff of the Marshall Plan
Administration in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Ms. Bowman, a resident of Manhattan, Kahn is survived by
a daughter, Dr. Jenny Elizabeth Kaufmann of Manhattan; two
stepdaughters, Susan and Evelyn London of Cambridge, Mass.; and two
granddaughters. His wife, Margery Guiterman Kahn, died several
years ago.

DEVERS WINS 100-METER HURDLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KIRBY LEE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEVILLE, Spain _ Gail Devers' prayers were answered in the
100-meter-hurdles final in the World Track and Field Championships
on Saturday night. Not only for herself but for Ludmila Engquist of
Sweden, who competed despite breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Devers has been saying prayers for Engquist, the 1997 World
champion, since she was diagnosed. Devers, 32, has also been
praying for own well-being after overcoming Graves Disease and
missing last season because of a hamstring injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``People keep asking me why I keep coming back,'' Devers said.
``My reason was that track was part of my life and I had to regain
control of my life again.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, Devers regained control of the world
100-meter-hurdles title.
</P>
<P>
   Devers clocked a championship-record 12.37 seconds for her third
world title in the event. The mark was the fastest time in the
world this year, a North American record and a dip under her
previous national record of 12.46 set in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Glory Alozi of Nigeria was second in an African-record 12.44 and
Engquist was third in a national-record 12.47. Devers, winner of
the 1993 and 1995 world titles, and Engquist embraced at the finish
as they watched the replay on the video board and Devers told
Engquist how proud she was of her courage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the fact that she came back and accomplished what she did
lets everybody know that if you keep believing in yourself, dreams
come true,'' said Devers, who came close to having her foot
amputated while suffering from Graves disease from 1988-91.
</P>
<P>
   ``She makes me think back to what I had to overcome and what I
had to go through, and it's a tough road. She's not done yet but
she's already 15,000 miles ahead of where she should be and it's
only going to get better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as people should take her as an example when times get hard
to reach down inside ourselves and find that inner strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Devers, the 1992 and 1996 Olympic 100-meter champion from UCLA,
needed to find that strength after finishing fifth in the 100-meter
final Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In the 100-meter-hurdles final, Devers, who said the Lord's
Prayer while in the blocks, dodged another heartbreak after banging
her trail leg heavily on the last hurdle. Devers was knocked off
stride but maintained her balance to avoid a repeat of the 1992
Olympic final in Barcelona when she led but fell into the final
barrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of bumped it but I was determined to stay on my feet,''
Devers said. ``I didn't want `92 to come up again. Prayers do get
answered.''
</P>
<P>
   Devers, along with Inger Miller, winner of the 200 meters in a
world-leading 21.77 on Friday, will be after their second gold
medals in the 400-meter relay today. Devers anchored the U.S.
400-meter-relay team of Cheryl Taplin, Nanceen Perry and Inger
Miller to victory in their preliminary heat to advance to today's
final. Despite the absence of Marion Jones, who withdrew from the
meet because of back spasms in the 200-meter semifinals, the
quartet clocked 42.28 for the fastest time in the world this year.
</P>
<P>
   Jones returned to the United States on Saturday morning to be
examined by her personal doctor. She is still experiencing pain and
has not made a decision regarding the remainder of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Greene, who became the first man to win the 100 and 200
championships, will be after his third gold medal in the 400-meter
relay. In the preliminaries, Greene anchored the team of Jon
Drummond, Tim Montgomery and Brian Lewis to a world-leading 38.06.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team will be heavily favored for their first gold medal
in the sprint relay since 1993. Canada, the two-time defending
champion, was disqualified for passing out of the exchange zone.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Johnson, who set a world record of 43.18 in the 400
final Thursday, will be seeking his record ninth gold medal in the
1,600-meter relay. USC senior Jerome Davis, the 1999 World
University Games champion, ran the opening leg for the U.S. team of
Joey Woody, Danny McCray and Angelo Taylor to a heat victory
3:00.79 for the No. 2 qualifying mark.

SPARKS GET TWO CHANCES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Now comes the tricky part for the Los Angeles
Sparks. They've had no problem handling the Houston Comets in the
comforts of the Forum, where they have won all three games against
the two-time WNBA champions, including the opener of the Western
Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   But can they win just one before an emotional, capacity crowd of
16,285 in Houston's Compaq Center?
</P>
<P>
   That is the challenge the Sparks will have to answer today or
Monday as the Western Conference finals continue. The Sparks and
Comets square off at 1 p.m. in Game 2 of the three-game series. If
they lose, the series will be decided Monday at 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets don't give up too much at home, where they are 39-7
and 5-0 in the playoffs after three years. They lost only one of
their 16 home games this season, a 68-66 decision to Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Then consider the Comets haven't played at home since Aug. 18 _
the day before their point guard, Kim Perrot, died from lung cancer
_ and one has to figure they will be backed by an emotionally
charged home crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an 0-6 record at Compaq, the Sparks feel extremely
confident, especially after their front court of Lisa Leslie,
DeLisha Milton and La'Keisha Frett combined for 50 points in the
team's 75-60 series-opening victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we would have lost that game it would have been very
difficult going into Houston needing two (wins),'' Sparks coach
Orlando Woolridge said. ``We feel like we have a very good
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Mwadi Mabika's defensive work on Houston leader Cynthia
Cooper and Frett's denial defense on Sheryl Swoopes that made the
difference. Cooper, the three-time league scoring champ, was held
to her lowest output of the season, 12 points on 4-of-16 shooting.
Frett, who has become known for her defensive prowess, had the
primary job of guarding of Swoopes, holding her to only 10
field-goal attempts. Although Swoopes scored 17 points, she shot
five below her average.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to have the same defensive effort that we had
(Thursday), and come aggressive from the beginning,'' Mabika said.
``I think that we can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment is shared by the Sparks, but they know it will
take their very best effort to pull if off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to go in there and fight for our lives,'' backup point
guard Penny Toler said. ``We have a golden opportunity here. We
have to get them now. They have to have a little pressure being
down 0-1, but I still say that they have the heart of a champion.
When we come out, we just have to play like there is no tomorrow.
We have to play like the series is 1-1.''

WALLACE ROSENWACH, 77, BUILDER OF WATER TANKS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wallace Rosenwach, a master builder of the rooftop
water tanks that decorate the skyline of New York City, died last
Monday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 77 and
lived on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   He died after a brief illness, said his son, Andrew.
</P>
<P>
   The Rosenwach Tank Co. was founded in 1896 by Wallace
Rosenwach's grandfather, and has been building water tanks that
look like the Tin Man's hat ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Rosenwach said that one of his father's achievements was
in devising a way to construct a rooftop water tank in just 10
hours. Previously, Rosenwach explained, it would take weeks to
replace a water tank, and to go without water for that long was not
just an inconvenience affecting things like drinking water and
toilets, but also a serious fire hazard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had 15 or 20 competitors when he reduced the time to 10
hours, and pretty soon he had almost none,'' Andrew Rosenwach
added.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rosenwach company, which has its headquarters in Long
Island City, N.Y., in the borough of Queens, does not have the
field to itself; its main competition, Isseks Brothers in
Manhattan, has been in business since the 1890s and the two are the
Hatfields and McCoys of the business.
</P>
<P>
   However, Scott Hochhauser, a co-owner of Isseks Brothers, said
the elder Rosenwach had been ``an honorable competitor,'' and
praised him as having helped to transform the industry ``from just
answering calls to urging customers to do preventive maintenance
rather than wait for their tank to break and flood their
building.''
</P>
<P>
   Water tanks are not cheap. A standard tank for a residential
building six or more stories tall must hold at least 8,500 gallons
and may cost about $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   But they are often long lived. In an interview in 1975,
Rosenwach said, ``Half the tanks put up by my father in the 1920s
are still there.'' More recently, he told another interviewer that
he had ``probably walked into every building in New York at one
time or another so I feel very much a part of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenwach explained that the material of choice for water tanks
is wood rather than metal because the wooden tanks are more durable
and substantially cheaper to build and maintain.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put up a wooden tank and forget about it,'' he said. ``Put
on a steel tank and there's continual, costly maintenance.''
</P>
<P>
   Rooftop water tanks are necessary in taller buildings to provide
water for hallway standpipe reserves, emergency sprinkler systems
and a regular water supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Croton reservoir can't pump water with enough pressure to
these high buildings,'' Rosenwach continued. ``So you store water
on the roof and release it down from there.''
</P>
<P>
   The standpipe reserve and sprinkler systems of a building are
designed to provide water during emergencies, like fires or water
main breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Born on Oct. 17, 1921, Rosenwach grew up in Brooklyn, earned a
degree from New York University's School of Engineering and
attended the Small Business Program of the Harvard Business School.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son, Andrew, Rosenwach is survived by his
wife, Alice; his daughter, Barbara; and two grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   While most of Rosenwach's customers were in the market for
rooftop water tanks, he liked to recall that over the years there
had been some interesting exceptions. At one time, New York state
winemakers used his tanks for wine storage. One client bought
several tanks for storing lipstick pigments. Others used them for
keeping photo-processing chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Some years ago, a customer asked Rosenwach to build a tank he
could live in. The result was a huge two-story tank, 34 feet in
diameter and 18 feet high, with a spiral staircase in its center.
Three men assembled it in three days. It still stands, his family
says.

IRISH TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HISTORY AND TURNOVERS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW BLUTH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BEND, Ind. _ The historians among the Notre Dame faithful
_ which is almost all of them _ have been looking forward to the
1999 season for a long time. Not because this year's version of
their beloved Irish football team is particularly loaded with
talent, and not because the team is coming off an extraordinarily
satisfying 1998 season. But because the history books tell them
that this is their year.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with those history books, these fans point out that Notre
Dame has won a national championship in 1966, 1977 and 1988. They
expect nothing less in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Still on track for that championship, Notre Dame opened the 1999
season Saturday at home in the Eddie Robinson Classic, beating
Kansas, 48-13, on a hot, humid and hazy day, in a game named after
the legendary Grambling coach.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Davie, beginning his third season as Notre Dame coach, has
been quick to calm the perhaps unrealistic expectations, pointing
out that this year's team is a young one, and that it must face a
difficult schedule, traveling to Michigan next week and to
Tennessee, the defending national champion, later in the season.
</P>
<P>
   However, despite a periodically shaky offensive performance
before the 142nd consecutive sellout at Notre Dame Stadium, a
bruising Irish defense overwhelmed Kansas. The defense wasted no
time flexing its muscle, causing a Kansas fumble in the first
series of the game, the first of four Jayhawk turnovers. The fumble
recovery led to a 38-yard touchdown scramble by the senior
quarterback Jarious Jackson just three plays later and a 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some big hits out there,'' Davie said after the game,
acknowledging his team looked sloppy on occasion. ``As the game
went on I think we got a little bit stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Jayhawks' first play from scrimmage following the
touchdown, Irish cornerback Deveron Harper intercepted a Zac Wegner
pass and returned it 22 yards for a touchdown. By the time the
first quarter ended, Notre Dame had built a 20-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Irish kickers missed two field goals and an extra point in
the first half, and the offense could not put Kansas away. Notre
Dame did not score in the second quarter, giving up two touchdowns,
and Kansas pulled within 20-13. The second Kansas touchdown came
after a Jackson interception, helping to set up a 30-yard touchdown
pass from Wegner to Termaine Fulton with two seconds left in the
half.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish graduated almost all of their offensive line from last
season and lost both starting running backs. Jackson is returning
after limping through the end of the 1998 season. He looked more
comfortable running out of the option, exploding for several long
runs and rushing for 85 yards on the day, but he threw for only 89
yards and 3 interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully it's out of my system,'' Jackson said of his
turnovers. ``But we won the game, and to me that's all that
matters.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those interceptions came on just the third play of the
second half, giving Kansas the ball on Notre Dame's 33-yard line
trailing by 20-13. But a blocked field goal by Irish cornerback
Clifford Jefferson led to a short touchdown run by Tony Fisher to
give Notre Dame a 27-13 lead. Fisher gained a game-high 111 yards
on 13 rushes.
</P>
<P>
   On the Jayhawks' next possession, Irish lineman Andy Wisne
knocked the ball loose from Wegner, allowing linebacker Anthony
Denman to pick up the loose ball and scamper 31 yards for a
touchdown and a 34-13 lead. Fisher broke free for a 46-yard
touchdown run in the fourth quarter, and the sophomore backup
quarterback Arnaz Battle added a 74-yard touchdown run late in the
game to extend the lead to 48-13.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot afford to spot Notre Dame a 20-point lead and be
successful,'' Kansas Coach Terry Allen said. ``They are too good.''

national office, Saturday night received a lavishly supportive
reception from the nation's largest organization of homosexual
Republicans, the Log Cabin Republicans, at the group's annual
convention in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   But while the mayor was cheered on in a ballroom at the
Roosevelt Hotel in Midtown Manhattan, a melee broke out afterward
in the hotel's elegant lobby when a small group of protesters
entered to criticize the mayor and the Log Cabin group.
</P>
<P>
   Before the protest ended shortly before 10 p.m., the police had
arrested five demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, the mayor sought to cast his administration's
success in reducing crime, cutting taxes and reducing the welfare
rolls as the result of a personal political philosophy that would
be well-suited to national politics.
</P>
<P>
   He also praised those at the meeting as representing a bold
cutting edge in national politics that has successfully undermined
popular stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your presence in the Republican Party keeps pushing us all to
be the very best we can,'' said Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Log Cabin Republicans, which was formed in 1978
in California, said in interviews that their group overwhelmingly
supported Giuliani in his expected bid for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Frank Ricchiazzi, who is one of the founders of
the group, which says it has 10,000 members, said he expected at
least part of the money raised to be set aside for Giuliani's
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The small group of protesters who gathered outside the hotel
Saturday night sought stridently to make a point that Giuliani was
not supported by all homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find this whole event repulsive,'' said Sue King, a
spokesman for the protesters, who she said belonged to a group
called Fed Up Queers. ``Giuliani is not a friend of gays and
lesbians,'' Ms. King said.
</P>
<P>
   After the mayor had finished his remarks, a small group of other
protesters, who apparently had bypassed a phalanx of police
outside, screamed obscenities as the police tried to remove them
from the hotel lobby.

STATE SCHOOLS' BACKS MOVE TO THE FRONT 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arizonans are accustomed to seeing the unusual. We have watched
governors be impeached and convicted, the Cardinals make the
playoffs and cotton fields transform seemingly overnight into
neighborhoods of stucco and red-tiled roofs.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps it's fitting that this college football season also
brings us something unique: Three premier running backs at three
different schools, separated only by a few hundred miles of
interstate, not by talent and potential.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe no other state can boast that each of its football-playing
universities has an electrifying running back capable of dominating
a game.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona has Trung Canidate, who rushed for 1,220 yards last year
as a junior. His 15 career rushing touchdowns have come from an
astounding average of almost 52 yards out.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State has J.R. Redmond, who can break open a game
running, receiving or returning punts and kicks.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Arizona has Ronney Jenkins, a transfer from Brigham
Young University who could put up silly numbers at the Division
I-AA level.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' said Arizona Coach Dick Tomey, who hasn't seen
a more talented trio in his 12 years in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ASU Coach Bruce Snyder agreed. He knows first-hand what the
running backs can do.
</P>
<P>
   He's coached Redmond, a senior. Last season he watched as
Canidate shredded ASU for 288 rushing yards, including touchdown
runs of 80, 66 and 48 yards. And he knew of Jenkins, a junior, even
before he gained 171 yards against ASU in Brigham Young's 26-6
victory last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recruited Ronney Jenkins out of high school (in Oxnard,
Calif.) and watched him gain 600 yards in a game,'' Snyder said.
``It was against nobody, but do you know how much 600 yards is? So
I know just how good he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the three schools, Arizona State has the best reputation for
turning out running backs, dating back to the Frank Kush era, when
the likes of Art and Ben Malone and Woody Green ran wild. Arizona
has a less illustrious history of producing runners. Its all-time
leading rusher is Ontiwaun Carter (3,501) followed by the ``Cactus
Comet,'' Art Luppino, who played in the mid-'50s.
</P>
<P>
   NAU, a member of the pass-happy Big Sky Conference, had Archie
Amerson, who gained nearly 3,200 yards in the 1995 and '96 seasons,
and Allan Clark, who finished with 2,723 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Canidate, Jenkins and Redmond each has a resume that keeps
opposing defensive coordinators in the office late at night.
Canidate is a threat to score each time he gets the ball. Redmond
might be the best multipurpose back in the college game. And
Jenkins has sprinter's speed and a receiver's hands.
</P>
<P>
   But what should really scare defensive coordinators is that none
of the three running backs has been healthy for an entire
collegiate season in which they've been a starter.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins gained 1,307 yards and scored 12 touchdowns at BYU last
season, even though he never felt in shape after sitting out the
previous season because of violating the school's honor code.
</P>
<P>
   Canidate missed the first game of last season while recovering
from a broken foot and wasn't 100 percent until the end of the
year. Still, he gained 1,220 yards to lead the Pac-10 and set a UA
single-season rushing record.
</P>
<P>
   And Redmond missed one game last year and was limited in at
least two others by toe and ankle injuries. &QL; 
One wise guy &QL; 
Canidate needs 1,280 yards rushing to break the school's career
record, which shouldn't be a problem if he stays healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Foot and ankle injuries have hampered him the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trung is healthier than he's been the last couple years,''
Tomey said in preseason camp. ``He played at less than 100 percent
for most of the last year and a half.''
</P>
<P>
   Canidate, from Central High, said he was in agony when last
season started. He's not preoccupied, how ever, with the statistics
he could compile if he stays healthy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess some people might be curious, but I just know I can do
more,'' he said. ``You have to remember where you came from and I
know where I cam from. I came from a lot of hard work. There are
many days I thought `This just isn't right and it might not happen
for me.' But I kept working hard and kept believing in myself and
took advantage of the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Canidate has been mentioned as a Heisman candidate, partially
because of his big-play capability and, of course, his last name.
</P>
<P>
   Tomey doesn't think that will bother the 5-foot-11, 199-pound
senior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Understand this, there are not a lot of people like him,''
Tomey said. ``He understands that a lot of this is catchy because
of his last name. I promise you, if there is anybody who can handle
something like that, he can. He has more wisdom in his little
finger than most people do in their entire body.''
</P>
<P>
   Pro scouts love Canidate's penchant for big plays, but there are
concerns about his durability.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid has an uncanny ability to break long runs for
touchdowns,'' said Joel Buchsbaum of ``Pro Football Weekly.''
``He's the type of runner who when he gets the ball, you hold your
breath.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The War Room,'' a respected scouting publication, said
Canidate is an athletic back but a bit undersized. It projects him
as a top third-down back at the NFL level.
</P>
<P>
   Canidate could change that with a big year.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats love to use Canidate on runs inside the tackles
because he hits the line so quickly and has the entire field to
maneuver once he clears traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not an outside runner; he's an inside runner,'' Tomey
said. ``He's one of those runners that people always say, `What are
you running up the middle for?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Because if you keep going there with a guy like that, you're
going to break it. You're liable to make one (yard), make none,
make two and then make 50.'' &QL; 
Zoning out &QL; 
When Redmond talks of being in ``the zone,'' he's not referring to
the end zone, although that's where he would like to end up.
</P>
<P>
   No, Redmond is talking about reaching that magical place where
every move he makes is the right one.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it is, is when your body reacts quicker than your mind,''
he said. ``Like sometimes, you'll see something and move toward it.
In my case, I move toward it before I see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Redmond has only been in the zone once in college, he said,
against Stanford last season. He scored three touchdowns in just
over one quarter before suffering toe and ankle injuries. He missed
most of the next two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a patient runner, waits for blocks to develop and shows
good field vision,'' according to ``The War Room.'' ``He doesn't
have great burst or breakaway speed, but his quickness and feel for
the game make up for it. He's also proven himself as a quality
return man and a blocking back, which makes him a more interesting
player on the NFL draft boards.''
</P>
<P>
   Redmond, 6-foot and 210, reminds Snyder of Ahmad Rashad, whom he
coached at Oregon. Like Rashad, Redmond has an infectious appetite
for the game.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond would abhor becoming strictly a running back. In his
perfect world, he would play running back, wide receiver and return
kicks and punts.
</P>
<P>
   But he plays in Snyder's world. Redmond likely won't play
defense this year, and Snyder is thinking of limiting his kick
return duties.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond understands, but he never wants to be just a running
back, not even in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes away your spirit for the game,'' he said. ``And it
takes away from your drive. Everyone should strive to play more,
get more snaps.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes that if a team has a dominating player, it shouldn't
try to limit him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like the game of checkers,'' he said. ``You have
the king, the most powerful piece on the board. When you get your
king in a power position, you have to use it. Or else you really
don't want to win.'' &QL; 
Give him the ball
</P>
<P>
   They will hand it, pitch it and pass it to him and maybe use him
on kickoff returns.
</P>
<P>
   And if the NAU Lumberjacks can figure out another way for
Jenkins to touch the ball, they'll try that, too. Coach Jerome
Souers joked that his staff might set an NCAA record for creative
ways to put the ball in Jenkins' hands.
</P>
<P>
   NAU coaches would like opponents to be uneasy about where
Jenkins might line up.
</P>
<P>
   NAU, has a new offensive coordinator, Brent Pease, who spent
time looking at tape of Jenkins playing at BYU.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to put him situations he feels comfortable in and in
other things that fit into our schemes,'' Pease said. ``He has so
much talent and so much ability. But it also comes down to 10 other
people doing their jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Few running backs in the country face the expectations that
Jenkins does at Northern Arizona. He is one of the most talented
backs to ever play in the Big Sky Conference, and longtime NAU
observers haven't seen his kind of ability in Flagstaff since Pete
Mandley played in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Coming out of high school, Jenkins was recruited by Arizona
State and Southern California, among others, but chose BYU, in part
because his grandmother liked the family atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   But Jenkins was suspended after his freshman year for violating
the honor code and was expelled after the 1998 regular season for a
second violation. Both transgressions were for engaging in sexual
relations outside of marriage, which is forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   By transferring to a Division I-AA school, Jenkins was
immediately eligible.
</P>
<P>
   The quiet and modest Jenkins doesn't necessarily buy into the
high expectations. There are good players in the Big Sky, he said,
and football is full of uncontrollable variables.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect a lot out of myself, regardless of what people expect
out of me,'' he said. ``That's why I've worked so hard in the
off-season.''
</P>
<P>
   The 5-11 Jenkins is listed at 175 pounds, but he said he bulked
up to 190 pounds without losing speed. He has been timed in the
40-yard dash in under 4.4 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   He's in far better shape today than he was a year ago at BYU, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt horrible,'' he said. ``I'm much better now. Totally
different. I had 1,300 yards for the season, and I don't know how I
did it. I felt out of shape, sluggish and I had little nagging
injuries throughout the season. I was never at my best. Never.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people are assuming that Jenkins will leave for the NFL
after this season. But he said he plans to stay for his final two
years, which is a good move, according to Buchsbaum.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably better off staying, maturing and growing,''
Buchsbaum said.

DEVILS ARE BACK FROM NEAR DEATH  
 KEALY IS STILL READY WITH PADDLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beep. Beep. Beep. Beeeeeeeeeeeeee . . .
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the 1998 season, the Arizona State football team
flat-lined. Back-to-back losses to Southern California and Notre
Dame put the Sun Devils at 2-4, an unlikely predicament for a
program projected to finish in the Top 10.
</P>
<P>
   But a team on the verge of spinning out of control never did,
and that final surge is the foundation on which the 1999 Sun Devils
are built.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Kealy was the defibrillator. The pulse of the program
returned when the young quarterback began playing as he did as a
freshman: relaxed, poised and confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks great,'' ASU Coach Bruce Snyder said. ``When Ryan
remembers why he's out there, to have fun and play football, he's
just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Kealy's potential is a big reason the Sun Devils find themselves
back in most Top 25 polls, despite last season's 5-6 record.
</P>
<P>
   In his final four games of 1998, he completed 72 of 110 passes
for 1,100 yards, 11 touchdowns and two interceptions. When
confident and healthy, he is arguably the Pac-10's best
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   But as Kealy goes, so does the team. The offense's chemistry
last season was affected, in part, by the quarterback's brief exits
from the lineup because of a concussion, a sprained right knee and
a mid-season slump.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys were getting frustrated,'' he said. ``There was a little
bit of finger-pointing. I think this team has really come together
over the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite last season's crash, there's every reason to believe the
Sun Devils are close to returning to pre-1998 form (the 1996 and
1997 teams were a combined 20-4).
</P>
<P>
   Tailback J.R. Redmond is a big reason. The Heisman Trophy
candidate can take over a game when healthy, with ``when'' being
the operative word. He was slowed for part of the season with ankle
injuries but still managed to rush for 883 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a mistake not to design our running game around
him,'' offensive coordinator Dan Cozzetto said. ``When you have
that type of a player on your team, you have to take advantage of
the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils have never led the Pac-10 in rushing. Could this
be the season?
</P>
<P>
   ASU is also optimistic about 1999 because of an offensive line
that features tackles Marvel Smith and Victor Leyva and freshman
All-America Scott Peters, who likely will start at center. The trio
will help provide ample protection for Kealy.
</P>
<P>
   Cozzetto wants to see the group open more lanes for runs. He
believes if the Sun Devils had done that better last season, ``we
would have won more games.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU will need a strong running game while it tries to determine
how effective its wide receivers can be.
</P>
<P>
   The season-long suspensions of Justin Taplin and Joey Graves as
well as an assortment of injuries have left the Sun Devils
depleted. Snyder knows what junior Tariq McDonald can do, but how
will junior college transfers Ryan Dennard, Richard Williams and
Royce Coachman perform in front of crowds of 60,000?
</P>
<P>
   None have the connection with Kealy that McDonald does. The two
have played together since Pop Warner days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not concerned,'' Kealy said. ``We brought in some really
talented players who will get the job done. I'm not worried at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows that Todd Heap, as well as several other talented tight
ends, will be in the lineup on a regular basis. When Heap got the
ball last season, he performed magic, and the Sun Devils need
someone in the lineup with big-play capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Big plays are something the defense lacked last season. Only two
Pac-10 teams had fewer interceptions than ASU's 12. Only two
recovered fewer fumbles than the Sun Devils' 9. Only one team had
fewer quarterback sacks than ASU's 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see a difference in how guys perform this year because
they know what they are doing,'' defensive coordinator Phil Snow
said. ``There were a lot of question marks last year because of the
new people we had in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of those question marks were linemen Junior Ioane and Erik
Flowers, who blossomed as the season progressed.
</P>
<P>
   Although the secondary is inexperienced, the Sun Devils aren't
worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny, because I think the perception of that part of our
team is that it's a concern,'' Snyder said. ``But I don't see it
that way at all. I think it's something we addressed in the
off-season, and I feel very comfortable with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong safety Willie Daniel was thrown into the fire last
season, and his two starts will benefit him this year. Redshirt
freshman Alfred Williams may be the best-kept secret on the team.
</P>
<P>
   A former linebacker, Williams emerged in the spring as the top
candidate to start at free safety. The two will rotate with junior
college transfers Craig Koontz and Monte' Franks and possibly
redshirt freshman Brandon Falkner.
</P>
<P>
   Like their wide receivers, the Sun Devils have some serious
questions about their linebackers. Stephen Trejo has returned to
the outside. Eric Fields is in the middle, a position he has never
played before. Adam Archuleta is back at the other outside spot,
but he has missed the majority of practices the last few weeks with
a hamstring injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not where we need to be,'' Snyder said. ``And we're not
very deep.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not the case with the kicking game. Stephen Baker's
45.7-yard punting average set an ASU record. The Sun Devils also
have place kicker Mike Barth and punter Nick Murphy on scholarship,
giving Snyder choices in both areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to have options,'' he said. &QL;

USC DOES SOME POSITION SHUFFLING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The addition of JC transfer Markus Steele at
linebacker has caused some position shuffling, most notably the
move of true freshman Troy Polamalu, who switched from safety to
linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Polamalu was a star in USC's first scrimmage, recording eight
tackles and forcing two fumbles. He also scored a touchdown on a
fumble recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Polamalu was switched to weakside linebacker, where he and
sophomore Darryl Knight will back up Steele. Sophomore Henry
Wallace, who was playing weakside linebacker, is now playing the
middle and strongside positions.
</P>
<P>
   USC needs someone to back up strongside linebacker Sultan
Abdul-Malik because junior Jason Steen will miss the Hawaii game
with a neck injury. True freshman Chris Prosser was his only backup
before Wallace switched positions.
</P>
<P>
   The much-heralded Steele needed less than two days of practice
after arriving late to training camp to claim the starting weakside
position.
</P>
<P>
   MacKenzie improving: Tailback Malaefou MacKenzie has been
brought along slowly in his recovery from season-ending knee
surgery, but USC coach Paul Hackett believes the sophomore made
significant strides this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had by far his best days,'' Hackett said. ``I might say
by game time he'll be in there. He's a little behind the others
still.''
</P>
<P>
   Penalty problems: Although the offensive line has struggled with
penalties in USC's two scrimmages, assistant coach Steve Greatwood
said the first team showed improvement in the Trojans' second
scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first unit was much better than (in the first
scrimmage),'' Greatwood said. ``The second unit still had some
problems. The situation is never as bad as it looks or good as it
looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we're trying to address. We somewhat revert.
The defense knows us like a book. I'm not concerned about that.
It's our own mistakes that are concerning me and all the offensive
coaches. If I'm disappointed in anything, it's in the lack of poise
when a guy flinches because a linebacker is coming at him.''
</P>
<P>
   Number changes: Freshman tight end Norman Katnik has switched
from No. 62 to 96. Fullback Chad Pierson is wearing 34 instead of
47 and tackle Matt Welch will wear 98 in addition to his regular
72, when he is a tackle-eligible in goal-line situations.
</P>
<P>
   Rest day: USC took Saturday off. The Trojans will hold a night
practice today, then take Monday off before holding heavy practices
Tuesday and Wednesday. The team leaves for Hawaii on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   School starts: USC begins classes Monday, something Hackett
expects will affect the team as it returns from training camp and
begins preparing for Saturday's game against Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we go through a re-entry process,'' Hackett said. ``The
ability to manage time and be successful is the key. Notoriously,
the first week a team starts school they don't play very well.''

NO ONE COULD STEP INTO SNYDER'S SHOES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Kevin, say Bruce came to you at the end of the
season and said he wanted to retire.
</P>
<P>
   If he quit, what would you do?
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Snyder is under contract through 2004. The Sun Devils
football coach hasn't even hinted that he might give up his labor
of love before age 65. But to humor me, Athletic Director Kevin
White considered the hypothetical question.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin, what would you do after a search committee _ which sounds
like three guys with flashlights and a fourth with a divining rod _
met and drew up a list of qualifications (winning record,
experience, name recognition, West Coast ties, etc.) and a wish
list of candidates?
</P>
<P>
   Who would ASU hire?
</P>
<P>
   Joe Paterno? Bobby Bowden? Steve Spurrier? They wouldn't come to
ASU. Mack Brown wouldn't leave Texas, not with that school's money
and facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Would the Sun Devils take a chance on a former NFL head coach or
pro assistant or some rising star at a smaller school?
</P>
<P>
   Kevin, who ``would'' you hire? &QL; 
Hard at work
</P>
<P>
   ASU's athletic director gazed out at the field where his
59-year-old coach was directing a spirited practice. The Sun Devils
open at home Sept. 6 against Texas Tech. Since the end of last
year's 5-6 season, Snyder has eagerly awaited the day when he can
return to the field and begin again. His resolve is not unlike a
clench-jawed prizefighter who gets knocked down and then hops to
his feet and impatiently takes a mandatory standing eight count.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer Snyder met twice a week with his seniors and
selected underclassmen. They discussed the importance of
leadership, a missing ingredient last year. Snyder thought about
the opening game. He knows (remember Washington?) that the opener
can set the tone for the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm reading everything I can about Texas Tech on the
internet,'' Snyder said before the workout. The ASU coach sat
behind the wheel of a cart, smiling into the morning sunshine. ``I
figure half of it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   Always organized, the clock always ticking in his head, Snyder
can't stop wondering what other coaches are up to. ``I check
(Tech's) practice schedule. I see they're scrimmaging on Tuesdays
and Saturdays. I'm thinking, `Why are they doing ``that''?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin, who would you hire?
</P>
<P>
   Coach and athletic director share a mutual admiration and
respect. They were together that night in Houston when Snyder won
the 1996 national Coach of the Year award. The Devils had gone 11-0
and were headed to the Rose Bowl. White heard the pride and
conviction in his coach's voice as Snyder, dressed in a tuxedo,
told the audience that coaching is ``the single-best profession in
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In the what-have-you-done-for-me-lately world of sports, fans
have short memories. Some ASU supporters grouse to White about last
season. Some question Snyder's coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like he never knew Xs and Os,'' White said. ``It borders
on the comical to me.''
</P>
<P>
   So who would fill Snyder's shoes? &QL; 
Kind words
</P>
<P>
   White answered not with a name but a glowing testimonial. ``I
don't think Bruce ``is'' replaceable,'' he said. ``We've won 25
games the last three years. That puts us tied (in the Pac 10) with
UCLA. . . . With Bruce I believe we have a chance to finally turn
the corner and have a lot of fun in the next decade and make a lot
of noise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bruce is at the top of his game right now. He is
task-oriented. Steady. Unflappable. Experienced. I appreciate his
vision. He is proud. Thoughtful.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does things his way, but he's also flexible. . . . He
relates to every generation and every situation. And I don't know
anyone more passionate about the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Work ethic? ``Check our parking lot,'' White said. ``His is the
first car in and the last car out. I'm impressed with what he has
created the last six months. If you're around him you know he has
strong focus, and a sense of urgency.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin White will tell anyone who asks that his man is the right
man for the job, now and for a long, long time. But
``irreplaceabl''e? Goodness, how often does a college athletic
director say that, for the record, about his coach?
</P>
<P>
   If I were Bruce, I would clip out the quote.
</P>
<P>
   And save it. &QL;

FOOTBALL AT UA FIGHTS FAMILIAR FOE  
 BASKETBALL IS STILL KING IN TUCSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON - In various preseason polls, Arizona was ranked high
enough to believe it has a shot at being No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But in Tucson?
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats' chances at being No. 1 in the football nation
might be a lot less daunting than their hopes of ever being tops in
Pima County, basketball country.
</P>
<P>
   Fair or not, Tucson is labeled a basketball town. Arizona
Athletic Director Jim Livengood argues that the label isn't
incorrect so much as it is incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Tucson is a basketball town,'' he said before
the fourth-ranked Wildcats tested their preseason credentials at
third-ranked Penn State on Saturday in the Pigskin Classic. ``It's
a success town.''
</P>
<P>
   The city got hooked on basketball simply because of consistent
brilliance under Coach Lute Olson. The Wildcats won the national
title in 1997. They've been to the Final Four three times. The
school and the town have taken on the basketball identity because a
tradition is firmly in place.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Livengood and others are convinced there is room
for more than one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the great run of success with Coach Olson, Tucson was
always a football town,'' said Don Harris, a former Maricopa County
Attorney who holds undergraduate and law degrees from Arizona.
``When I was down there in the early 1960s, football was the going
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The bet is that football can equal basketball's popularity with
a 1999 season that would build on last year's surprising 12-1
record, including a Holiday Bowl victory over Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Livengood says he detects that the city is poised to
embrace Arizona football as it has basketball for more than a
decade. Season-ticket sales are reported to be good by UA
standards: more than 24,000.
</P>
<P>
   The record is 27,700, which was set in 1994 when the Wildcats
graced ``Sports Illustrate''d's cover as the magazine's No. 1
preseason pick. Arizona officials hope to surpass the 1994 mark by
the Sept. 11 home opener against lightly regarded Middle Tennessee
State.
</P>
<P>
   Average attendance last year _ Arizona's finest football season
ever _ was 50,206, which ranks fifth on the school's all-time list.
The top four: 56,562 in 1994, 54,074 in 1990, 51,749 in 1995 and
50,761 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The optimism is not without caution. A couple of losses against
Penn State and then Texas Christian on Sept. 5 would probably blow
a hole in attendance projections. Unlike the basketball
congregation, Arizona football is followed by the hopeful, yet
skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   There was disappointment in 1994 when the Wildcats did not live
up to impossible expectations. And there is still that elusive Rose
Bowl. Arizona is the only Pacific-10 Conference school that hasn't
made the postseason trip to Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   There is no magic marketing that can dispel the lingering
skepticism, according to junior quarterback Ortege Jenkins, who
spent a couple of seasons on the basketball roster. Jenkins agrees
that the basketball aura is hard to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true,'' he said. ``We had a great football season last
year, but it was kind of overshadowed because of the national
championship and then the Pacific-10 Conference titles in
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucson's ambivalence toward football was unmistakable after the
Wildcats fell to UCLA in their lone loss before a sold-out Arizona
Stadium crowd of 58,738.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a quick turnaround the next week at Oregon State, empty
seats became the norm at Arizona Stadium. There were more than
12,000 empties for an impressive victory over Oregon, then
nationally ranked, in a battle for second place in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Oregon game happened to coincide with Halloween. Arizona
Coach Dick Tomey, pragmatic as ever, said he wasn't surprised at
the crowd. He said he would have watched the game on television and
taken his kids trick-or-treating, too.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's hard to imagine empty seats at McKale Center for a
basketball game on any day. Tomey bristles at attendance
comparisons. Arizona Stadium has between four and five times as
many seats as McKale Center.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Livengood is convinced the larger number of
football seats can become as valuable as the ones for basketball.
On the one hand, Livengood says, there's an increase in interest
because Arizona has discovered an offense with Jenkins, fellow
quarterback Keith Smith and running back Trung Canidate.
</P>
<P>
   Defense might win games, but points on the scoreboard win at the
box office. It's no coincidence, perhaps, that ads in Arizona's
sales pitch this summer have featured one defensive player,
linebacker Marcus Bell, alongside Jenkins, Smith and Canidate.
</P>
<P>
   Livengood also is borrowing from professional sports, which have
turned to a variety of ways to sell the product. The game is just
part of a package that includes music, fireworks, food and a
variety of other bells and whistles.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this day and age of discretionary income, people want to be
entertained,'' said Livengood, who is looking forward to the
unveiling of a $2.9-million, state-of-the-art scoreboard at the
Sept. 11 home opener.
</P>
<P>
   But Jenkins remains convinced that, in the end, only one formula
works:
</P>
<P>
   Win, and they will come.
</P>
<P>
   ``From this point on, I really believe we will be a
well-balanced school between football and basketball,'' he said.
``In football, we've got a lot of young guys who are just getting
started. Coach Tomey and this team are on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to set a standard. In Tucson, people are just
used to winning in basketball. It's something that's been a pattern
for so many years. But for as long as I'm here and Keith is here,
we're going to try to set the standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``By doing that, we can let our friends, younger players and
recruits know that something is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   By doing that, more than just something goes on. It becomes
tradition. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAGSTAFF, ARiz. - If imitation is the best form of flattery,
then the football officials at Montana might blush when they look
at NAU.
</P>
<P>
   Much of NAU's coaching staff has ties to the Big Sky perennial
power. NAU second-year Coach Jerome Souers, offensive coordinator
Brent Pease and co-defensive coordinator Corey Batoon spent a total
of 21 years in Missoula. Running backs coach Josh Branen didn't
coach there but starred in the Grizzlies' backfield as the school's
third all-time leading rusher.
</P>
<P>
   Souers will be the first to admit that he isn't trying to turn
NAU into Montana but he does want to bring its winning tradition to
Flagstaff.
</P>
<P>
   He appears to have the Lumberjacks poised to make a
full-throttle run at the Grizzlies, the preseason favorite to win
the conference for a second straight year. The Lumberjacks were
projected to finish second in the same media/coaches poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're excited about this season for a lot of reasons,'' Souers
said. ``We're looking forward to having some fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The fun began for Souers and the Lumberjacks when running back
Ronney Jenkins transferred to NAU from Brigham Young. Jenkins was
Flagstaff-bound after he got kicked off BYU's team for violating
the school's honor code.
</P>
<P>
   With new scenery and a fresh start, Jenkins should make a
significant impact in the backfield alongside Marcus King. In his
last year at BYU, Jenkins rushed for 1,307 yards. It was the second
highest output in school history.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins, a soft-spoken 22-year-old whom Souers describes as a
silent leader, said he hasn't noticed the change in level of play
from Division I-A to I-AA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that big of a difference,'' Jenkins said. ``They have
good athletes on both ends. I see the same ability on this team as
I did at BYU. (The lineman) are just as big as the linemen I played
with at BYU.''
</P>
<P>
   Conference defensive coordinators will have their targets locked
on Jenkins. This should free up senior quarterback Travis Brown, a
four-year starter and one of 17 returning starters. In his freshman
and sophomore seasons, Brown threw for a combined 6,793 yards,
breaking Steve McNair's record for combined passing yardage in his
freshman and sophomore seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But last year's coaching change from Steve Axman to Souers and
an elbow injury took their toll. Brown threw for a career-low 1,550
yards and 12 touchdowns as NAU fell to a tie for seventh in the Big
Sky (3-5, 6-5 overall).
</P>
<P>
   Souers said the onus will fall on Brown to rebound in order to
free up some running room for Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   Although the offense will get most of the headlines, Souers
wants his defense to personify the team's overall blue-collar
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   That attitude begins with the team's new uniforms. The
Lumberjacks changed their traditional yellow helmets to a solid
dark blue with a black trim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black and blue, that's how we want to leave them,'' said
defensive end Lynne Ray Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The defense has nicknamed themselves ``The Family.'' Their
familial resolve was displayed at NAU's football media day. When
asked who the head of the clan was, Smith replied, ``No one, it's a
family.''
</P>
<P>
   While Smith did most of the talking, the unit's de facto
patriarch may have been one of its quietest members, senior
linebacker Afa Faraimo. After posting a team-high 118 tackles, 6{
sacks, five fumble recoveries and an interception last year, he was
being touted as a Buchanan Award candidate, given to I-AA's best
defensive player.
</P>
<P>
   But Faraimo's play this season will reflect his quiet mood at
media day. The Lumberjacks lost their best defensive player for the
entire season when Faraimo tore his anterior cruciate ligament at
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Souers said, ``We expect Afa to contribute to our program in
other ways, such as serving in a mentorship capacity with our young
linebackers, and I know he will be well-received in that role.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lumberjacks, who last qualified for the playoffs in 1996,
garnered a No. 22 ranking in the preseason Sports Network Top 25
poll for I-AA teams, but Souers isn't interested in the ranking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just as soon have our pads do the talking,'' he said.

TIME FOR PAC-10 TO PROVE WORTH  
 CHANCE TO MAKE NATIONAL SPLASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - It has been victimized by an East Coast bias and
its own competitive balance. But the Pac-10 Conference hasn't done
itself any favors recently in the quest for national respect.
</P>
<P>
   It's a put-up-or-shut-up year for the league.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's meeting with Penn State isn't the only opportunity for
the Pac-10 to test its mettle nationally. Arizona State and
Southern California get a shot at Notre Dame; UCLA visits Ohio
State; Washington hosts Colorado; and California travels to
Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   In 21 years, the league has had just one national champion, the
1991 Washington Huskies. The Trojans alone won five titles from
1962 to 1978. And the Pac-10 has lost six of the past nine Rose
Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   The last Heisman Trophy winner was  &UR; Marcus Allen in 1981. In the
two previous decades, the conference contributed seven: &UR; O.J.
Simpson, &UR; 
 &UR; Charles White,  &UR; Mike Garrett,  &UR; Jim Plunkett,  &UR; Gary Beban,  &UR; Terry
Baker and Allen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important for the conference to keep putting
itself in a situation to win games against nationally recognized
opponents,'' Golden Bears Coach  &UR; Tom Holmoe said. ``It's doesn't
make any sense to shy away from the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The expectations have been there. ASU made the top 10 of several
preseason polls in 1998 but couldn't even break .500. The Wildcats
were ``Sports Illustrated's'' No. 1 team in 1994 yet finished 8-4.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins blew their chance last season by wiping out everyone
on their schedule except Miami in the regular-season finale.
</P>
<P>
   ``No excuses,'' UCLA Coach  &UR; Bob Toledo said. ``We could have won
the game and didn't. Although our priority was our team and our
fans, it reflected on the conference.'' &QL; 
He looks familiar . . .
</P>
<P>
   Quick, name the starting quarterbacks for Oregon, UCLA,
California and Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   What? Having trouble? You're not alone. All are new starters and
most weren't named until this week.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest surprises is the Golden Bears'  &UR; Samuel
Clemons, who didn't allow freshman prodigy  &UR; Kyle Boller to unseat
him. It probably will happen in the future, but for California's
opener against Rutgers on Saturday, Clemons will start.
</P>
<P>
   The hype surrounding Boller, who was ranked as the No. 1 high
school player by several recruiting services, proved to be too much
for the Bears' other scholarship quarterbacks _ freshman  &UR; Ryan
Sorahan and redshirt freshman  &UR; David Page _ and they left the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Clemons felt it was worth sticking around. Although he passed
for just 2 yards in his college career, he is beginning his third
year with the program and is comfortable with the system, even
though new coordinator  &UR; Steve Hagen has abandoned the West Coast
offense.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's Toledo said he has settled on junior &UR; Drew Bennett for the
Bruins' Saturday opener against Boise State.  &UR; Cory Paus was named
the backup although he is expected to play in UCLA's first two
games.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett came to Westwood as a walk-on who had been recruited by
Princeton and a handful of Division III schools. Although he threw
only 11 passes as &UR; Cade McNown's backup, his athleticism and
knowledge of the offense made the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon's  &UR; Mike Belotti named junior &UR; A.J. Feeley as his starter
for Friday's game at Michigan State but said sophomore  &UR; Joey
Harrington will take snaps as well.
</P>
<P>
   And Washington State has settled on  &UR; Steve Birnbaum, who shared
time with  &UR; Paul Mencke last season, but word is Coach  &UR; Mike Price
has not discounted the more mobile  &UR; Jason Gesser, a redshirt
freshman. &QL; 
DeShaun's de man &QL; 
Remember all that talk about  &UR; DeShaun Foster being the Bruins' No.
3 tailback? Forget about it.
</P>
<P>
   The move was an obvious attempt by Toledo to take pressure off
his sophomore sensation. But the coach recently gave in and named
him the starter. With good reason.
</P>
<P>
   Remember what he did as a freshman in Tucson last season? He
rushed for 118 yards, including a 37-yard scoring run, and returned
a kickoff 45 yards that set up the drive that won the game.
</P>
<P>
   Quick hits
</P>
<P>
   The Pac-10 has four candidates for the Jim Thorpe Award, which
recognizes the nation's premier defensive back: ASU's  &UR; Courtney
 &UR; Jackson, USC's &UR; Antuan Simmons, Stanford's  &UR; Tim Smith and Washington
State's  &UR; Lamont Thompson. The league has had two winners: Arizona's
 &UR; Darryl Lewis in 1990 and USC's  &UR; Mark Carrier in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The league returns 64 percent of last season's starters. It
averaged 58 percent the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   New Washington Coach &UR; Rick Neuheisel still holds the NCAA
single-game record for highest percentage of passes completed: 25
of 27 for UCLA in 1983.

<P>
   Team-by-team look at the Pac-10, in predicted order of finish: &QL; 
 &UR; Arizona Wildcats
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COACH:  &UR; Dick Tomey
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1998 RECORD: 12-1 overall, 7-1 Pac-10
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STARTERS RETURNING: Six offense, nine defense.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE GOOD: The Wildcats return the heart of their offense:
quarterbacks  &UR; Ortege Jenkins and  &UR; Keith Smith, wide receiver
 &UR; Dennis
 &UR; Northcutt and running back  &UR; Trung Candidate, the Pac-10's leading
rusher with 1,220 yards. Nine starters return from a defense that
ranked second in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BAD: He's just one player, but All-America cornerback
 &UR; Chris
 &UR; McAlister will be missed. The Wildcats start a new left tackle and
lack depth at wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE UNKNOWN: Can returning place kicker  &UR; Mark McDonald improve
on his 8-of-17 success rate on field goals? How will Arizona handle
all the preseason hype that seemed to undo its neighbor to the
north a season ago? &QL; 
 &UR; USC Trojans
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COACH:  &UR; Paul Hackett
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1998 RECORD: 8-5 overall, 5-3 Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STARTERS RETURNING: Nine offense, six defense.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE GOOD: The entire offensive line returns. The Trojans have
the depth at tailback for which they're known;  &UR; Chad Morton and
 &UR; Sultan
 &UR; McCullough are a dangerous one-two punch. All Pac-10 pick  &UR; Ennis
Davis is back at defensive tackle.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BAD: Lack of depth at wide receiver. The loss of  &UR; Chris
Claiborne at middle linebacker will hurt more than most think. The
secondary features three new starters.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE UNKNOWN: How will the Trojans respond to Hackett's plan to
open up the offense? If quarterback  &UR; Carson Palmer plays to his
potential, USC will be dangerous. But if he makes some of the
mistakes he did as a true freshman last season, he could cost the
Trojans a game.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; UCLA Bruins
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COACH:  &UR; Bob Toledo
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1998 RECORD: 10-2 overall, 8-0 Pac-10
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STARTERS RETURNING: six offense, eight defense.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE GOOD: UCLA's receivers are among the best in the nation,
and senior flanker  &UR; Danny Farmer is as sure-handed as they come.
The Bruins are deep at tailback. Their top three are back, with
hotshot sophomore
 &UR; DeShaun Foster jumping from No. 3 to starter.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BAD: The Bruins must fill the big shoes left by
quarterback &UR; Cade
 &UR; McNown. An inexperienced offensive line will not make it any easier
for the new starter. UCLA will miss  &UR; Chris Sailer, who was a
standout punter and place kicker.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE UNKNOWN: Eleven players are suspended for the first two
games. How much will this set back the team against Boise State and
Ohio State? UCLA's defense struggled often last season. Is new
coordinator
 &UR; Bob Field the answer?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Arizona State Sun Devils
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COACH:  &UR; Bruce Snyder
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1998 RECORD: 5-6 overall, 4-4 Pac-10
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STARTERS RETURNING: Seven offense, eight defense.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE GOOD: The Sun Devils return one of the league's best
quarterbacks,  &UR; Ryan Kealy, and running backs,  &UR; J.R. Redmond.
Experience on the defensive front should make ASU more effective
rushing the passer. The Sun Devils seem confident, but without the
swagger of last season.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BAD: Injuries and suspensions have depleted the team at
wide receiver. Questions remain about how effective the linebackers
can be.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE UNKNOWN: How quickly can ASU's junior college transfers
make an impact? Have the Sun Devils shaken off the effects of last
season's disappointing finish? &QL; 
 &UR; Oregon Ducks
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COACH:  &UR; Mike Bellotti
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1998 RECORD: 8-4 overall, 5-3 Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STARTERS RETURNING: Six offense, seven defense.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE GOOD: The Ducks return seven starters (all juniors and
seniors) on defense. Tailback  &UR; Reuben Droughns is back after
missing the last six games of 1998 because of a broken leg.  &UR; Nathan
Villegas came out of nowhere to be one of the nation's top kickers
last season.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BAD: Quarterback  &UR; Akili Smith is long gone, and his
replacement was up for grabs until junior  &UR; A.J. Feeley got the nod
late in camp. It's not a good sign when you're closing in on your
opener and you're not sure who your top tight end and one of your
two receivers are going to be. Valley product  &UR; Rashad Bauman went
down with a knee injury during spring practice and is expected to
miss the season, making the Ducks suddenly inexperienced at
cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE UNKNOWN: The Ducks have a killer stretch of
back-to-back-to-back road games at Washington, UCLA and Arizona.
How they fare during that stretch could determine whether they
attend a bowl game again.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Washington Huskies
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COACH:  &UR; Rick Neuheisel
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1998 RECORD: 6-6 overall, 4-4 Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STARTERS RETURNING: five on offense, eight on defense
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE GOOD:  &UR; Jabari Issa and  &UR; Mac Tuiaea, two of the better
tackles in the league, anchor the Huskies' new 3-4 defensive front.
Three returning defensive backs should make this group better than
the one that managed only five interceptions last season.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BAD: The offense will be loaded with new faces. The biggest
concern is the offensive line, where three new starters must be
replaced. Most of the backfield, including the quarterback, is new
as well.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE UNKNOWN: Neuheisel is a big fan of quarterback &UR; Marques
 &UR; Tuiasosopo. If the junior plays to his potential, the coach likes
their chances. How will Neuheisel and his team respond to playing
Colorado, the school he left for Washington, three weeks into the
season?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; COACH:  &UR; Tom Holmoe
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1998 RECORD: 5-6 overall, 3-5 Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STARTERS RETURNING: Seven offense, seven defense.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE GOOD: The Bears may have one of the best defenses in the
conference. They get a lot of mileage out of linebackers  &UR; Sekou
Sanyika and  &UR; Matt Beck. Three starters return on the offensive
line, which should be improved. The players seem to believe in
Holmoe.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BAD: Cal scored an average of only 16.6 points last season
and with a rookie quarterback set to take over, it's hard to
believe much will change early on. The Bears also need to replace
standout receiver
 &UR; Dameane Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE UNKNOWN: The impact new offensive coordinator  &UR; Steve Hagen
has on this team could go a long way in determining its success. If
freshman quarterback sensation  &UR; Kyle Boller blossoms early, the
Bears could be in great shape.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Stanford Cardinal
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COACH:  &UR; Tyrone Willingham
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1998 RECORD: 3-8 overall, 2-6 Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STARTERS RETURNING: Nine offense, 10 defense.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE GOOD: With 19 starters returning, the Cardinal will win
games because of its experience. Willingham is encouraged by the
improvements senior quarterback  &UR; Todd Husak made in the off-season.
Stanford's arsenal of receivers, led by &UR; Troy Walters, who caught 52
passes in only six full games last year, heads a top-flight
receiving corps, will be hard to defend.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BAD: There is no convincing argument that the Pac-10's
worst running team will be any more effective this season. The 19
returning starters led Stanford to a 3-8 record last season. The
schedule is a killer, especially three of the first four games: at
Texas, Washington State, at Arizona and UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE UNKNOWN: Will the defensive changes that the Cardinal made
be for the better?  &UR; Riall Johnson, the top pass rusher last season,
has moved from defensive end to outside linebacker. Standout &UR; Tim
Smith moves from free to strong safety. Willingham has managed just
eight wins the past two seasons. Is his job in danger?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Oregon State Beavers
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COACH:  &UR; Dennis Erickson
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1998 RECORD: 5-6 overall, 2-6 Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STARTERS RETURNING: Six offense, five defense.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE GOOD: &UR; Ken Simonton came out of nowhere last season to be
one of the Pac-10's top rushers. A strong group of junior college
transfers will help plug some holes. Free safety  &UR; Terrence Carroll
is one of the better defensive backs in the conference. Erickson's
presence has been a boost for team morale.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BAD: The defense needs to replace its starting ends and two
linebackers. Depth is a concern on the offensive line and at
cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE UNKNOWN: What will starting the season against Nevada,
Fresno State and Georgia Southern do for the team's confidence?
Help it? Give it a false sense of security? How will sophomore
 &UR; Jonathan Smith, who stepped in late last season, fare now that
he's been handed the reins?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COACH:  &UR; Mike Price
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1998 RECORD: 3-8 overall, 0-8 Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STARTERS RETURNING: Seven offense, nine defense.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE GOOD: It's hard to find a better group of receivers in the
league.  &UR; Nian Taylor and  &UR; Leaford Hackett combined for 99
receptions and 1,527 yards last season. JC transfer  &UR; Milton Wynn is
expected to find his way into the lineup as well. Junior free
safety  &UR; Lamont Thompson had four interceptions last year.
Linebacker  &UR; Steve Gleason, who had 70 tackles last season, has
lived through this team's highs and lows.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BAD: The Cougars will start the season with quarterback
 &UR; Steve
 &UR; Birnbaum, who wasn't particularly convincing in that spot last
season, throwing 11 interceptions vs. six touchdowns. The team
lacks depth at cornerback. Keeping players eligible and out of
trouble may prove the coach's biggest challenge.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE UNKNOWN: The difference this season could be two young
players: redshirt freshman quarterback  &UR; Jason Gesser and freshman
tailback  &UR; Dion
 &UR; Burnett. If both manage to work their way into the lineup, the
Cougars' chances improve. Washington State needs to take advantage
of seven home games.

QB OR NOT QB: COACHES ARE SCRAMBLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   From Los Angeles to Ann Arbor, Mich., to Manhattan, Kan., so
many coaches spent this preseason searching for starting
quarterbacks that they could have formed a support group.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA is trying to replace &UR; Cade McNown. Michigan Coach &UR; Lloyd Carr
is deciding between veteran  &UR; Tom Brady and sophomore hotshot  &UR; Drew
 &UR; Henson. Kansas State Coach  &UR; Bill Snyder is evaluating four
contenders to replace  &UR; Michael Bishop. Oregon is trying to survive
life without
 &UR; Akili Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches' decisions could well determine the outcome of the
season. Get a guy with a little magic, like Tennessee's  &UR; Tee
Martin, McNown or Bishop, and he can make up for a lot of other
weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   Pick someone whose knees start knocking in the fourth quarter,
and the alumni are handing you Realtors' business cards. But just
because a quarterback starts the season doesn't mean he'll be there
for every game. At Penn State, Alabama and Texas, phenoms wait just
off stage. Sophomore  &UR; Austin Moherman will start at quarterback
today for Ohio State when it meets Miami, but that doesn't mean
Coach  &UR; John Cooper will hesitate using  &UR; Steve Bellisari, another
sophomore, if the need arises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot tell you right now in my mind who I think the best
quarterback is, but we think the one who deserves to start in this
first ballgame is Austin,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper has played two quarterbacks before.  &UR; Joe Germaine and
 &UR; Stanley Wilson shared the job for the two seasons prior to last
year. Cooper is not entering the season thinking the pair will
share the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it will be based on feel, a gut decision that you
make during the ballgame,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder hasn't picked a replace ment for Bishop, although junior
 &UR; Jonathan Beasley from Glendale Cactus High is regarded as the
front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   Four players are auditioning for the job, but Beasley doesn't
sound worried about the possibility of replacing Bishop, a junior
college transfer who led the Wildcats to the Big 12 championship
game last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael was a great athlete, what can I say?'' he said. ``He
could run and throw and do it all. But he wasn't here in the
program as long as we've been. We've got a better feel for the
offense.'' &QL; 
No fashion sense
</P>
<P>
   BYU has redesigned its uniforms and altered the school colors,
upsetting some fans. Gone is the white helmet and the blue decal.
The school has gone to a deeper shade of blue, accented by tan.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker  &UR; Rob Morris was listening to fans complain on a radio
talk show and was irritated. He did an interview with the station
later that day and said fans should realize times have changed.
</P>
<P>
   `` &UR; Jim McMahon's not coming back. &UR; Steve Young's not coming back.
Get over it,'' he said. &QL; 
Strange bedfellows
</P>
<P>
   Washington Coach  &UR; Rick Neuheisel is a free thinker, but it still
seems strange that the two college coaches he admires most are Penn
State's  &UR; Joe Paterno and Florida's  &UR; Steve Spurrier. Those two
couldn't be more different, but Neuheisel has his reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paterno is like royalty,'' Neuheisel said. ``Maybe it's the
way he embraced me the first time I met him. He made me feel such a
part of the game. It validated me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spurrier . . . I love his bravado. I love the way he trusts
himself. If there is one thing that sets him apart from most
coaches is that he doesn't worry about what anyone else thinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at his offensive schemes, they weren't a product of a
lot of staff time. They are a product of him saying, `I'm going to
do this,' and cutting through all the red tape.'' &QL; 
Quiet life
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin running back  &UR; Ron Dayne needs 1,717 yards to become
college football's all-time leading rusher, surpassing &UR; Ricky
Williams' mark of 6,279 yards. But that's not the reason Dayne
decided to stay for his senior year.
</P>
<P>
   Dayne, who is from the southern part of New Jersey, stayed
because he likes Madison, Wis., and is no hurry to join the
high-pressure world of the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``My freshman year, my friends from Jersey stopped at a light to
ask for directions,'' Dayne told the ``Philadelphia Inquirer.''
``They had tinted windows on their car. There was an old lady
walking by. They let the windows down, and she came right up to the
car and said, `Hey, guys, how ya doing?'
</P>
<P>
   ``They came to me and said, `Yo, this lady told us where you
stayed, where you were at, how to get there.' That shocked me. In
Philly, you don't walk up to a car with tinted windows. You walk
backwards.'' &QL;

THROW IN THE TOWEL ON PARK? NOT JUST YET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ So he hit two batters in the first four innings
and occasionally looked as lost as he has at any time during this
difficult season.
</P>
<P>
   Chan Ho Park won a game at Dodger Stadium on Saturday. That is
big news around here.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did he come in with an 0-6 record and a 5.86 ERA at
home, Park was doing it in a climate where no one's job is safe for
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Park, who won 29 games the past two years, could be traded for a
Jeromy Burnitz or for part of a bigger deal that could include
Florida's Cliff Floyd. Park so often has suffered from
inconsistency and self-doubt that many think he has gone from star
to fourth starter overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The offers will be good this winter and a fresh start might be
helpful to both sides.
</P>
<P>
   That's a trigger the Los Angeles Dodgers shouldn't pull.
</P>
<P>
   When he retired Jeff Reed and struck out Jose Nieves with the
bases loaded to end the eighth inning, he made that point. For all
his problems this year, Park's 4-3 victory over the Chicago Cubs
proved he is a keeper.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody wants Eric Young or Davon White. There is minimal
interest in Eric Karros. Gary Sheffield has a contract laced with
concrete. Raul Mondesi needs a wakeup call before he gets on with
his career.
</P>
<P>
   As poorly as Park has pitched, he represents an anchor for the
Dodgers. When you think about how bad the club's starters have done
this season, remember that the 4.54 team ERA is only
middle-of-the-road in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were spoiled by great pitching over the years. They
had a big ballpark with distant power allies and vast foul
territory. And at night, when the air gets heavy, a team of Sammy
Sosas couldn't hit one out.
</P>
<P>
   If someone has to go it needs to be Ismael Valdes, who has
improved his standing this year even though he went seven starts
without a victory before Friday.
</P>
<P>
   When you are dealing with Park you aren't talking about
potential. You are looking at an established pitcher who has
stumbled. Some think his throwing during last January's Asian Games
after a long season was damaging.
</P>
<P>
   He came back this year a different pitcher, rarely trusting his
95 mph fastball. He often seemed timid in tight spots.
</P>
<P>
   And though he bristles at every mention of the four-year, $32
million contract he turned down last spring, Park left an obscene
amount of money on the table that could take years to recoup.
</P>
<P>
   He is making $2.3 million this season and probably won't do
better than $4 million next February in arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   But it should never come to that.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of GM Kevin Malone's long to-do list should be
repairing the damage Park did to himself and the team this year.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, who has a good rapport with players and agents, should
not punish Park by letting the contract talks get to arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, despite all the Fox resources, was wise not to bite at
Park's outrageous contract proposal of four years for $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   But now comes the hard part.
</P>
<P>
   It is still hard to imagine Park, the same pitcher who went 8-1
last July and August, could be available. But teams were asking
about him at the trade deadline and they will be asking again in
the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Any team that is 10 games under .500 and didn't compete all
season has to return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Malone cannot afford to let Park's fragile psyche reach next
season.
</P>
<P>
   But he can't afford to lose him, either.

THE ARIZONA REPUBLIC'S TOP 25 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Florida State
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Coach  &UR; Bobby Bowden has more NFL prospects than
anyone. Unfortunately, they don't hand out championship rings for
that. It gnaws at Bowden that he's had all that talent and only one
dad gum national title to show for it. That will change this season
if the Seminoles don't have their usual slip-up.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Florida State lost early (N.C. State) and late
(Tennessee in the Fiesta Bowl). The common thread was that
quarterback &UR; 
 &UR; Chris Weinke didn't play well (N.C. State) or at all (Tennessee).
If Weinke can successfully come back from a neck injury, and if the
'Noles find some corners who don't get beat deep, Bowden will get
his other ring. &QL; 
 &UR; Tennessee
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Coach  &UR; Philip Fulmer sold the Vols on the belief that
no one outside the state thought they had a chance to win the
national title. The Vols bought into it like a hot mutual fund and
beat Florida State in the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback  &UR; Tee Martin and tailback  &UR; Jamal Lewis return.
 &UR; Peerless
 &UR; Price is gone, but Tennessee has a factory out back where it
produces big-play receivers. What really hurts, however, is the
loss of middle linebacker &UR; Al Wilson, their spiritual leader.
National title hopes, again, will rest largely on the ability to
beat Florida and win the SEC. &QL; 
 &UR; Florida
</P>
<P>
   The Gators weren't good enough to play ball the way Coach &UR; Steve
 &UR; Spurrier wanted last year. The passing game didn't scare anyone,
and word is that some of the defensive starters were saving
themselves for the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for this to happen again. Spurrier has tightened his
visor, and with games against Tennessee and Florida State at home,
the Gators could be primed for another national title run. &QL; 
 &UR; Penn State
</P>
<P>
   They say you win championships with defense, and  &UR; Joe Paterno
has the country's best this season: Nine seniors starting on that
side of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   But can the Nittany Lions score enough to contend for a title?
Somewhere along the line, the quarterback usually has to win a game
late. Senior  &UR; Kevin Thompson hasn't inspired confidence in Penn
State followers. &QL; 
 &UR; Texas A&AMP;M
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies lost the opener last year to Florida State and
quietly were shoved out of the national championship picture. But
they salvaged the season, finishing 11-3 and winning the Big 12
title.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker  &UR; Dat Nguyen, who played college ball for what seemed
like 24 years, is gone. But 18 other starters are back, including
QB  &UR; Randy
 &UR; McCown, who has a knack for making big plays. &QL; 
 &UR; Arizona
</P>
<P>
   Coach  &UR; Dick Tomey was adamant that the Wildcats didn't schedule
Penn State in the opener with an eye toward a national title run.
Maybe not, but this was a win-win situation for the Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   Win and the Wildcats could move into the top 2 in the polls.
Lose and you still have 11 more games to play, plenty of time to
recover. Tomey has his best offensive team in years, with QBs
 &UR; Keith Smith and
 &UR; Ortege Jenkins, running back  &UR; Trung Canidate and receivers  &UR; Dennis
 &UR; Northcutt and  &UR; Brad Brennan. The key will be avoiding injuries and
having the corners hold up. &QL; 
 &UR; Nebraska
</P>
<P>
   The temptation is to blame injuries for last season's 9-4
record, and there is some validity to that. Quarterback  &UR; Bobby
Newcombe and I-back  &UR; DeAngelo Evans were healthy for all of about
five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But some long-time Husker observers think the talent level in
the program has dropped over the past few years. By midseason last
year, no one was afraid of Nebraska. Newcombe and Evans are back,
and the Cornhuskers have something to prove. We'll see if they're
good enough to do it. &QL; 
 &UR; Ohio State
</P>
<P>
   Winning 11 games last season wasn't good enough for the
Buckeyes, who failed once again to win a national title under
Coach &UR; John Cooper. They spent more than two months ranked No. 1
before blowing a lead, and their title hopes, against Michigan
State.
</P>
<P>
   The losses were heavy. Gone are quarterback  &UR; Joe Germaine and
receiver  &UR; David Boston. But no team in the country has replaced
talent as successfully as the Buckeyes, so don't look for them to
slip out of the top 10. They will be tested today by Miami. &QL; 
 &UR; Wisconsin
</P>
<P>
   Give Coach  &UR; Barry Alvarez a devastating running game and a
veteran defense and he'll give you double-digit victories. That's
what the Badgers have this year with running back  &UR; Ron Dayne, who
stayed for his senior year, and a defense that returns eight
starters.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin has to figure out a way to replace quarterback  &UR; Mike
 &UR; Samuel, who never put up great numbers but was efficient. If  &UR; Scott
 &UR; Kavanagh or  &UR; Brooks Bollinger comes through, the Badgers could
contend for a Sugar Bowl berth. &QL; 
 &UR; Virginia Tech
</P>
<P>
   The Hokies are perennially one of the nation's best-kept
secrets. Coach  &UR; Frank Beamer continually turns out exceptional
teams, and this year's model could be his best.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen starters return from a club that went 9-3 last season.
Miami is expected to make a resurgence in the Big East, but the
Hokies have to be favored to win the league and earn a BCS berth. &QL; 
 &UR; Michigan
</P>
<P>
   The Wolverines, still giddy from their share of the 1997
national title, lost their first two games last season. They did a
nice salvage job, finishing 10-3, and are vowing to start this
season differently. Senior  &UR; Tom Brady and phenom &UR; Drew Henson, a
sophomore, are battling for the quarterback job. Eight starters are
back on defense. &QL; 
 &UR; Georgia Tech
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback  &UR; Joe Hamilton enters his fourth year as a starter
and is a legitimate Heisman candidate. But if Georgia Tech is to
make any noise this year, it has to find a way to improve
defensively. The secondary has been porous, and Coach &UR; George
O'Leary is relying on several young players at key spots. &QL; 
 &UR; Southern California
</P>
<P>
   Last year, USC had one of the Pac-10's best defenses but
struggled offensively. The opposite could be true this year as the
Trojans return nine starters on offense but only six on defense.
Coach  &UR; Paul
 &UR; Hackett thinks sophomore QB  &UR; Carson Palmer is special. He'll have
to be if the Trojans are to make a run for the league title. &QL; 
 &UR; Georgia
</P>
<P>
   QB  &UR; Quincy Carter was sensational last season, setting nearly
every freshman record for passing at the school. He doesn't have
much experience around him, however, so Coach &UR; Jim Donnan's highly
rated recruiting classes had better produce. &QL; 
 &UR; Colorado
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Rick Neuheisel packed up his guitar and split town, accepting a
$1 million offer at Washington. He didn't leave the program void of
talent, however, and new Coach  &UR; Gary Barnett should have a decent
first year in Boulder. &QL; 
 &UR; Alabama
</P>
<P>
   The Crimson Tide has a talented running back ( &UR; Shaun Alexander),
an exciting quarterback ( &UR; Andrew Zow) and a beleaguered head coach
( &UR; Mike
 &UR; DuBose) who spent the off-season dealing with sexual-harassment
charges. The talent is there for a big improvement over last year's
7-5 mark. &QL; 
 &UR; Miami
</P>
<P>
   It's popular to predict this as the year of the Hurricanes'
resurgence. Seventeen starters return and Coach  &UR; Butch Davis
finally some depth. Still, this was the team that gave up 111
points in its last two regular-season games, and quarterback  &UR; Kenny
Kelly has never started a game. &QL; 
 &UR; Notre Dame
</P>
<P>
   Coach  &UR; Bob Davie is entering his third year, which is a
milestone for Notre Dame coaches.  &UR; Frank Leahy,  &UR; Ara Parseghian,
 &UR; Dan Devine and &UR; Lou
 &UR; Holtz each won a share of a national title in his third season as
head coach of the Irish. QB  &UR; Jarious Jackson is dangerous, but the
Irish still lack big-play threats. The defense should be solid,
though. &QL; 
 &UR; UCLA
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback &UR; Cade McNown is gone and so are those nifty
handicapped parking passes. Life will be a little tougher in
Westwood this season, especially if the Bruins don't improve
defensively. Sophomore RB
 &UR; DeShaun Foster should be a star, and receivers  &UR; Danny Farmer,
 &UR; Brian
 &UR; Poli-Dixon and  &UR; Freddie Mitchell are dangerous, provided someone
can get them the ball. &QL; 
 &UR; Virginia
</P>
<P>
   This is usually a safe place to pick the Cavaliers, who have
underachieved the past few seasons. Coach  &UR; George Welsh has a nice
core of players back, but they aren't good enough to challenge
Florida State for the ACC title. &QL; 
 &UR; Texas
</P>
<P>
   Running back  &UR; Ricky Williams is gone, pushing the Longhorns into
the post-dreadlocks era. Only 11 starters return. Quarterback
 &UR; Major
 &UR; Applewhite will have to carry more of a load, but if he struggles,
fans will be calling for freshman  &UR; Chris Simms to play. &QL; 
 &UR; Marshall
</P>
<P>
   Don't laugh. The Thundering Herd has won 22 games since moving
to Division 1-A two years ago. All but one starter is back, and
quarterback  &UR; Chad Pennington could be one of the best in the
country. &QL; 
 &UR; Purdue
</P>
<P>
   The Boilermakers are pumping quarterback  &UR; Drew Brees for the
Heisman, and it's not just hype. Brees threw for 3,983 yards and 39
touchdowns last season. But life will be tougher this year with
Ohio State and Michigan back on the schedule after a hiatus. &QL; 
 &UR; Louisville
</P>
<P>
   Coach  &UR; John L. Smith worked wonders in his first season last
year, guiding a team that had gone 1-10 to a 7-5 record.
Quarterback &UR; Chris
 &UR; Redman is a potential first-round draft choice, and 10 defensive
starters are back. &QL; 
 &UR; Arkansas
</P>
<P>
   The Razorbacks were one of the major surprises in the country
last season, narrowly missing a chance to play for the national
title. The offensive skill positions are stocked, but Coach
 &UR; Houston Nutt has a rebuilding job on defense.

FIESTA REMAINS A BIG BOWL PARTY  
 NO TITLE GAME, BUT ATTRACTIVE OPTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Scouting college football games has never been
tough duty for bowl officials. After choosing a tie to match their
loud sports coats, the toughest remaining decision is whether to
skip breakfast and gamble that there will be a nice buffet in the
press box.
</P>
<P>
   Fiesta Bowl officials had it even easier last season. They
played host to the first national championship game under the new
Bowl Championship Series. While other bowls worried about
entertainment value, ticket sales and how many fans a team would
bring, Fiesta officials only had to wait and watch.
</P>
<P>
   Its matchup was determined by the final BCS poll. That ended up
being Tennessee and Florida State, with the Volunteers beating the
Seminoles, 23-16, for the national title.
</P>
<P>
   Things have changed dramatically this year, however, and
although Fiesta officials won't be breaking their backs on scouting
trips, they have more to do than last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Sugar Bowl has the national title game, while the Fiesta
falls back into a tier with two other BCS bowls: the Orange and the
Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Many fans are assuming, wrongly, that because the Fiesta had the
national championship game last year, it will fall to the back of
the BCS line and have the final two choices of the four bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Bowl officials answer the selection question wherever they go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have some work to do,'' said John Junker, the
bowl's executive director. ``I think people had just grown used to
the old system. When we present them with what the situation is,
they are always excited about it. While there might be some
education, the punch line is always a good one.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but it's one that's not easy to explain or understand.
</P>
<P>
   Under the simplest scenario, the Fiesta Bowl will have an anchor
team, the Big 12 champion. Five other conference champions are
guaranteed places in the BCS. That leaves two at-large teams, of
which the Fiesta Bowl gets first pick, by virtue of its high bid
when the BCS was formed.
</P>
<P>
   But the situation can be much more complicated than that given
the myriad possibilities. What if, say, the Big 12 champion plays
for the national championship in the Sugar Bowl? The Fiesta Bowl
would then get first pick of a replacement team, after the other
bowls took their anchor teams, and then the first at-large choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone through lots of yellow pads (predicting
scenarios),'' Junker said. ``We couldn't pay for all the
mathematicians or anything. We've run it many, many ways and we
come up with a good game the vast majority of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities are intriguing to the bowl's officials. They
could end up with Nebraska, bouncing back from a disappointing
season, or Texas A&AMP;M, predicted by many to make a run for the
national title.
</P>
<P>
   For an at-large pick, they could select Wisconsin, if the
Badgers don't play for the national title or in the Rose Bowl.
Wisconsin has running back Ron Dayne, who could break the NCAA's
all-time rushing mark and a huge fan following willing to travel
and spend money.
</P>
<P>
   Those possibilities don't hold the interest that a national
title game has, but bowl officials aren't complaining.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it's expected that within the next year the BCS
agreement will be extended through the 2005 bowl games. That
probably will give the Fiesta Bowl the top two teams again in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   For this year, however, the bowl is worried about having an
entertaining game and selling out Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket prices have been lowered for this season. A majority of
the seats are $75, with premium seats ranging from $100 to $125 and
loge seats from $160 to $180. Last year, a majority of the tickets
cost $135, while prime seats went for up to $195.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year is a different kind of excitement because of
flexibility we'll have,'' Junker said. ``It's quite a difference to
our people on the road. We're emphasizing to them that it's a much,
much different deal.''

WILL ABC EGOS UPSTAGE THE GAMES? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GINTONIO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The biggest battle of the college football season won't be
taking place on the football field. Who's the best team? Who cares?
</P>
<P>
   No, the real fight will be the clash of egos at ABC.
</P>
<P>
   In an ideal world _ that's one where  &UR; Brent Musburger never
meets a camera _ ABC would have named  &UR; Brad Nessler its No. 1
football broadcaster the day after  &UR; Keith Jackson retired. But in
an odd twist of events, Jackson returned, and Nessler and Musburger
share the highest rung, according to  &UR; John Filippelli, the vice
president for ABC Sports.
</P>
<P>
   Filippelli failed to mention where Jackson, who will do only
West Coast games, falls in the ratings game, so we'll help him out:
Jackson should have stayed retired, but since he's back, there's no
doubt in the mind of any college football fans about the identity
of the star of the trio.
</P>
<P>
   Nessler and Musburger, however, will be getting the top games
throughout the season, and with ABC's regionalized concept, having
a different top dog on different weeks makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   Nessler is an underrated play-by-play man who seems to appeal to
a wide audience. Musburger offers no middle ground. Fans hate him,
management loves him.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent conference call, everyone was sticking to the
script. In fact, one of Nessler's remarks could have come from
central casting: ``Keith is in the Hall of Fame, and Brent will be,
so I'm in good company.''
</P>
<P>
   Nessler said he was disappointed when Jackson decided to curtail
his duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was his biggest fan,'' he said. ``There's not a competition
among the three of us, but we are pretty competitive people.''
</P>
<P>
   Musburger seemed a bit subdued during the call; the bombastic
style that people have come to expect was missing. Perhaps he's
decided that he's not bigger than the sport, and if so, it will be
a welcome change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was lucky to have  &UR; Dan Fouts with me for two years,'' he
said. ``It was a great two years. I hope I continue being lucky. In
many cases, you're no better than the game you're broadcasting. If
we get a good game, fine. There's plenty of good games for Brad and
me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to have Keith back. I told him he'd never retire.
It's ideal for us to have him in the Pac-10.''
</P>
<P>
   Filippelli said he would leave it to others to overanalyze the
No. 1 scenario.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is what it is,'' he said. ``We have fabulous people and a
great schedule of games.''
</P>
<P>
   Musburger will again work with Fouts, and Nessler teams with
 &UR; Gary
 &UR; Danielson. &QL; 
Double-edged tube
</P>
<P>
   While television exposure has been a tremendous ally of college
football, two high-profile coaches,  &UR; Joe Paterno of Penn State and
 &UR; Butch Davis of Miami, discussed another side of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a little more hoopla than some kids can handle,''
Paterno said. ``And their families might have more of a problem
than the kids. Parents envision their kids getting this and that.
</P>
<P>
   ``And some of the comments made by some people (commentators) on
how coaches do things, when they get critical of coaches, I don't
think they're doing much good. I think sometimes coaches get blamed
more than they should. I think overall we're doing a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   Paterno and Davis agreed that they want to give players the
opportunities to enjoy college life, and Paterno said, ``I don't
think any coach has complete control over 120 kids who are normal,
young adults. Some are going to slip at times.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said living in the college football fishbowl can be
hazardous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exposure today is enormous,'' he said. ``It's very
difficult when you have 110, 115 kids in a program to monitor them
24 hours a day, seven days a week. That's ridiculous. I do think
kids need to learn some respect and responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think a whole lot more coaches are doing the right things
than the other way.'' &QL;

SEMINOLES EVENTUALLY TO TOUGH FOR TEACH  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ By opting not to turn professional in April,
Peter Warrick passed up riches to be an impact player at Florida
State this season.
</P>
<P>
   He is 1 for 1.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick Saturday helped turn a close game into a rout, as the
No.1 ranked Seminoles rolled over spunky Louisiana Tech, 41-7,
before 72,702 at Doak Campbell Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The flanker caught 9 passes for 121 yards and rushed twice for
41 yards, including a 20-yard touchdown that will be a highlight
film clip.
</P>
<P>
   With the game tied at 7-7 late in the first half, Warrick,
heading right, took a handoff from quarterback Chris Weinke but
found his path blocked. He cut left and kept zigzagging as several
defenders flailed at him. Suddenly, he bolted back to the right,
evading all defenders. He was so open that he trotted into the end
zone with 39 seconds left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   ``That even surprised me,'' Warrick said. ``I thought I'd get
some yards, but I didn't expect to get to the house.''
</P>
<P>
   FSU Coach Bobby Bowden said with a chuckle, ``I'd hate to have
to draw that thing up and run it again.''
</P>
<P>
   The marquee matchup in this game had been two quarterbacks _
Louisiana Tech's Tim Rattay, the two-time national total offense
leader, and Weinke, FSU's strong-armed 27-year-old who is
rebounding from a neck injury last season.
</P>
<P>
   Weinke went on the field Saturday with a titanium plate, four
screws and some cable wire in his neck. That didn't seem to faze
him as he completed 20 of 32 passes for 242 yards and 2 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt at times like I was rushing the ball and didn't need
to,'' said Weinke, who came out of the game early in the fourth
quarter when his team had a big lead. ``This was about what I
expected after being out.''
</P>
<P>
   Rattay didn't fare as well, though Weinke clearly had the
superior supporting cast. The senior from Phoenix, completed 28 of
48 passes for 240 yards, with a touchdown and two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   And he left FSU's defense panting.
</P>
<P>
   ``For sure, they run you,'' Florida State nose guard Corey Simon
said. ``But I thought we improved as the game went on. Everybody's
not like Penn State _ coming out like they did. We had some things
to work out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles' talent edge became more pronounced as the day
wore on. Rattay often was under siege from their pass rush,
particularly early in the fourth quarter when linebacker Theon
Rackley returned an interception 10 yards for a touchdown and a
38-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Louisiana Tech left Bowden shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I saw the final score, I'd take that,'' he said. ``Now if I
look at the way we did it, I was very disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Bulldogs' first series, Rattay connected on four of his
five passes for 44 yards. And later in the first half, he led an
impressive drive that took 12 plays, went 89 yards and consumed 4
minutes 57 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Rattay's first two passes fell incomplete, but the third was a
laser to Sean Cangelosi for 15 yards. Rattay went on to complete
six of his next seven passes, the finale a beauty between two
Seminole defenders in the end zone's right corner for a 13-yard
touchdown to tailback John Simon.
</P>
<P>
   A season ago, when the Seminoles were in contention for the
national title, they allowed opponents to convert third down plays
just 33 times in 173 tries, a 19.1 success rate that was among the
country's best.
</P>
<P>
   By halftime, Rattay had converted five of eight third-down
attempts. He finished with 7 seven of 15.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs, 7-5 last season, were in good position to take the
lead in this game late in the second quarter. Weinke had just
thrown his first interception after a string of 237 completions
over two seasons _ beating the Atlantic Coast Conference record of
Virginia's Matt Blundin. After rover Bobby Gray cradled the errant
ball at the FSU 25, Louisiana Tech promptly moved inside the host's
10, on 9- and 12-yard completions to Cangelosi. But on the second
completion, Cangelosi was hit by cornerback Clevan Thomas and
fumbled. It was scooped up by free safety Sean Key, who was tackled
at his 5.
</P>
<P>
   With just 2:56 remaining before halftime, it was soon to be
Warrick's time. His 21-yard run gave FSU life, and Weinke found
split end Talman Gardner for 33 yards to the Bulldogs' 20.
</P>
<P>
   That was where Warrick unleashed his highlight play, and it
enabled the Seminoles to take a 14-7 lead into intermission.

CLINTONS TAKE LONG LOOK AT 1889 HOUSE IN CHAPPAQUA  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. _ Continuing their search for a house after the
White House, President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton spent two
hours Saturday inspecting a 110-year-old home on a secluded
cul-de-sac here before flying to the Hamptons for a fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons spent far more time at the white, two-story
wood-frame home at 15 Old House Lane than they have at other homes
they have visited since beginning their search for a house in
Westchester County. But they did not indicate if they were
seriously considering buying it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very nice house, but we don't have an announcement to
make,'' Clinton said after the visit, as he emerged from a gray
Chevrolet Silverado to shake hands with local residents a few yards
from the house. ``Nice people,'' he added. ``Nice neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   The 5,200-square-foot home, shrouded from easy view by towering
fir and maple trees, sits on 1.1 acres set off from the cul-de-sac,
and is listed for $1,695,000, according to real-estate brokers. The
house, which has a master bedroom with a wrap-around deck that
overlooks a pool and a wooded backyard, has been on the market
since Aug. 16, said Wayne Crosby, an agent with Houlihan/Lawrence
Inc., the real-estate agency that is listing the house.
</P>
<P>
   The house is an 11-room Dutch Colonial that was built in 1889,
he said. It has five bedrooms, four bathrooms and a separate barn
that serves as a two-car garage, Crosby said. A white picket fence
encloses the backyard.
</P>
<P>
   The house's owners, Dr. Jeffrey Weisberg and his wife, Cheryl,
have lived there for more than a decade, the neighbors said. Its
property taxes last year were $25,900, Crosby said.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's three-hour trip to Westchester was the Clintons'
second visit in two weeks. After their arrival at Westchester
County Airport at 12:40 p.m., the Clintons climbed into the back of
the Silverado and, trailed by nine vehicles carrying staff members,
Secret Service agents and reporters, drove up Route 120, past IBM's
headquarters in Armonk, to Chappaqua.
</P>
<P>
   On Old House Lane, the motorcade waited as the Clintons visited
with the Weisbergs for two hours and inspected their home. Along
the 200-yard-long lane, lined with large homes surrounded by
manicured lawns and weedless shrubbery, neighbors emerged and stood
along the road in curious clumps, waiting for a peek at the
Clintons and mulling the prospect of having a retired president as
a neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better to have the president than someone else,'' said
one neighbor, Osman Osmani, 53, who immigrated from Kosovo 11 years
ago and works as a real-estate agent in the Bronx. ``I like him now
more than ever before. He saved my people.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the street stood Curt Stewart, 54, a close friend of the
Weisbergs, who had just arrived on his sleek racing bicycle to
visit them but found hordes of reporters and Secret Service agents
blocking his way.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, a corporate consultant, called the Weisbergs' home
``one of the most beautiful houses you'll ever see.'' He said he
recently went out to dinner with the Weisbergs and, mindful of the
Clintons' house search, asked if they would consider showing their
house to the president. ``They joked about it and said, `No, no,'''
he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Some neighbors seemed more uneasy about what would happen if the
Clintons moved in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little exciting that they would want to live here, but
I'm not sure,'' said Michele Neufeld, who, along with her husband,
Todd, an investment banker, moved into a house nearby three months
ago. ``This is the busiest I've ever seen this neighborhood,''
Neufeld said, looking slightly concerned.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons lived in the Arkansas Governor's Mansion before
moving to Washington. They have no home to return to when the
president leaves the White House in early 2001, and they intend to
find a house in affluent Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   If Mrs. Clinton is to run for the U.S. Senate next year, she
must live in New York state by Election Day. After the house visit
and five minutes of shaking hands with neighbors and their
children, the Clintons left, returning to Westchester County
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   By 3:35 p.m., their plane was en route to an airport in West
Hampton, where a helicopter was scheduled to fly the Clintons to a
Democratic fund-raiser Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Clintons will go about deciding whether they want the
house, said Kathy Sloane, a Westchester County real-estate agent
who is aiding the Clintons in their home search.
</P>
<P>
   She would not speculate on how much the Clintons liked the house
they saw Saturday. But Crosby said two hours was an exceptional
amount of time for any home buyer to spend at one dwelling. ``Most
people are in a house for 20 minutes if they're not interested,''
he said in a telephone interview Saturday afternoon. ``I'd say they
are interested in the house.''

   After playing guardedly to a draw on Friday night, Alexander
Khalifman of Russia and Vladimir Akopian of Armenia no doubt spent
most of Saturday deep in private strategy sessions for what could
be the finish of their tense, six-game match for the International
Chess Federation's World Championship. Khalifman retained a
one-point lead, at 3-2, and needed only a draw to win the title.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the match alive, Akopian had to win Saturday. He was
facing a dilemma familiar to boxers: to land a decisive blow he
would have to leave himself open to a decisive counterblow.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 5 on Friday, he tried to win without taking any risk and
found that those two objectives don't mix very well. With the
conservative formation he put on the board, he was not able to gain
any advantage. Khalifman met caution with caution, and the point
was halved after 49 moves.
</P>
<P>
   As White, Akopian has a marked preference for queenside
openings, but he won the second game with 1 e4 and decided to give
it another whirl here. He was very likely looking forward to facing
a Sicilian Defense again, which he had confronted in good style in
Game 2. But Khalifman crossed him up by using 1 ... e5.
</P>
<P>
   Akopian's quiet, inoffensive 5 d3 indicates that he probably did
not want to be tested by one of the sharp defenses to the Ruy
Lopez, like the Open Defense with 5 O-O Ne4 or the Marshall Gambit.
</P>
<P>
   With 10 ... c5, the Chigorin Defense appeared; it is designed to
diminish the effect of aggression in the center by White.
</P>
<P>
   After 14 ... Bf8, Akopian played 15 d4, even though it brought
about a well-known position in which White is a tempo down, the
pawn having taken two moves to reach d4.
</P>
<P>
   After 18 Qd4, the previous exchanges gave White a preponderance
of central space and Black a vulnerable d6 pawn. But Khalifman's
free development of pieces nullified that to a considerable extent.
</P>
<P>
   After 22 ... Re6, attempting aggression with 23 e5 would only
have dissipated Akopian's strength when Khalifman replied 23 ...
Qe8! Moreover, 23 Nf5 is rebuffed by 23 ... Rc4.
</P>
<P>
   After 35 ... Qb3, the game was equal, but Akopian, desperate to
catch up in the series, tried a last hope, 36 f5, to open lines
against the black king. Khalifman, not willing to risk anything,
forced a technically drawn ending by sacrificing a pawn with 36 ...
Qe3 37 Kh2 Qc5.
</P>
<P>
   After 49 Rb3, a dead draw arises from 49 ... Rh7 50 Kg3 Kf6,
which the players acknowledged by shaking hands.

BASEBALL BRINGS BACK BOYHOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Little League World Series championship game was
under way. Seated at his desk, Buck looked at the TV screen and
smiled.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment he forgot about the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   For a few sweet seconds Saturday afternoon, Buck Showalter _ age
43, manager, husband, father _ became a kid again.
</P>
<P>
   He was Bill Showalter's boy.
</P>
<P>
   Little League second baseman.
</P>
<P>
   Buck's memories took him home. He was back in Century, Fla., a
10-year-old gazing beyond his back yard at the local ball field
glowing under the lights on a warm summer night.
</P>
<P>
   That field was his whole world. Worse than any whipping was the
threat from his mom or dad. ``Nat, if you don't . . . you're
``not'' playing tonight!''
</P>
<P>
   What else do you remember?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything,'' Buck said.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter remembers the joy of winning and how much losing hurt.
When his Little League team won, each player earned a hot dog and a
Coke. When they came up short, the post-game treat was a snow cone.
</P>
<P>
   Buck remembers trudging home, walking in the house, glove in
hand. He remembers his sister looking at the telltale blue syrup
stains circling his mouth and announcing, ``Y'all lost, didn't
you?''
</P>
<P>
   He remembers the first time he struck out.
</P>
<P>
   That awful sound of the ball hitting the catcher's mitt. Strike
three! The umpire, Mr. Leahy, who went to the Baptist church,
called him out.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers the pitcher. Ronnie Wedgworth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronnie,'' Buck said, ``had facial hair.''
</P>
<P>
   He remembers feeling like the whole world was staring as he
returned to the dugout. He sat there, embarrassed and angry. ``I
cried my eyes out.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, he heard his name announced as the league's Most
Valuable Player. He felt better, but to this day he can see Ronnie
Wedgworth on the mount, triumphant.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers his new bat, a 28-inch Eddie Mathews model .
</P>
<P>
   He remembers how good it felt in his hands the night he swung
and hit the ball flush. Dropping the bat, he lifted his eyes,
watching the ball rise and sail into deep center field.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers the magical moment when he hit his first home run
at age 10. In his mind's eye, he can see the man beyond the fence
rising from his lawn chair. He reached out and caught the ball with
his bare hand.
</P>
<P>
   The man was his father.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers being 12, and the pride he felt wearing the gray
flannel pinstripes of the Tri City All-Stars.
</P>
<P>
   His mother still has his cap.
</P>
<P>
   The kids from Florida went to the playoffs. If they beat a team
from Miami, they were going to the Little League World Series in
Williamsport, Pa. Buck got his team's only hits, three of them. ``I
had a snow cone that night.''
</P>
<P>
   He remembers the field behind the house where his mother lives.
It is still there. So is the billboard honoring his team, state
champions.
</P>
<P>
   He still can see his teammates, Jim Mathis and the others, their
faces frozen in time, smiling, forever young. Their names _ and his
_ are listed on the sign.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers it all. The fun. The excitement. The cheers. The
bond he felt when he played catch with the man who years later told
him he wanted him to have something he had put away for
safekeeping. He produced a Little League baseball. On it he had
written, ``Nat's first home run, 1966.''
</P>
<P>
   He remembers the joy of being a boy playing a game he loves. The
memories are forever, as dear to him as the abiding love for a man
who, two weeks before he died, learned that his boy, the Little
Leaguer, was the new manager of the New York Yankees. &QL;

   EAT THE RICH. By P.J. O'Rourke. Atlantic Monthly, $13.
</P>
<P>
   A political satirist and free-market enthusiast finds much to
zing in this animated tour of the global economy, from Sweden's
welfare wonderland to Albania's disastrous flirtation with
capitalism. The result is ``a delightful collection of anecdotes
and one-liners,'' Peter Passell wrote here in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   COLLECTED FICTIONS. By Jorge Luis Borges. Translated by Andrew
Hurley. Penguin, $16.95.
</P>
<P>
   The Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges (1899-1986) was renowned
for his strange, knotty fiction; his jewel-like stories _ ripe with
labyrinthine imagery, arcane knowledge and mythological overtones _
often resemble cruel fairy tales in which magic is evil and bad
deeds routinely go unpunished. This collection, the first complete
translation into English of his work in a single voice (that of
Andrew Hurley, an English professor at the University of Puerto
Rico), ``is testimony to hard labor and devotion,'' Mavis Gallant
wrote in the Book Review last year.
</P>
<P>
   THREE CONTINENTS. By Ruth Prawer Jhabvala. Counterpoint, $14.
</P>
<P>
   In this dark novel, wealthy American twins relinquish their
freedom and fortune when they come under the thrall of a
quasi-religious group called the Fourth World Movement and its
leader, a minor Indian king with grand ambitions. ``As a meditation
on the twin themes of inheritance and family, `Three Continents' is
a significant achievement,'' Peter Ackroyd wrote here in 1987. The
same publisher has reissued one of Jhabvala's earlier novels,
TRAVELERS ($14), which tracks the lives of four wanderers _ two
English, two Indian _ who meet, judge and fall in and out of love
with one another in India. In 1973 our reviewer, Dorothy
Rabinowitz, admired the author's ``grace of mind'' and said the
book ``compares well with the best social novels in contemporary
fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   LIFE: A NATURAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST FOUR BILLION YEARS OF LIFE
ON EARTH. By Richard Fortey. Vintage, $15.
</P>
<P>
   A British paleontologist combines his own experience with a
sweeping knowledge of the facts of life in the first popular but
scholarly account of life's history written by a professional. His
narrative, selected as one of the best books of 1998 by the editors
of the Book Review, ``is not a boring slog through the strata, but
an eclectic waltz among organisms at once extraordinary and
extinct,'' Jerry A. Coyne wrote here. AT THE WATER'S EDGE: FISH
WITH FINGERS, WHALES WITH LEGS, AND HOW LIFE CAME ASHORE BUT THEN
WENT BACK TO SEA, by Carl Zimmer (Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster,
$14), discusses the origin of tetrapods and whales, evolutionary
events involving creatures with backbones. ``Zimmer does a good job
of explaining how profoundly different are the physiological and
structural requirements of life in water compared to life on
land,'' Philip Gingerich wrote here last year.
</P>
<P>
   THE MOURNERS' BENCH. By Susan Dodd. Morrow, $13.
</P>
<P>
   This novel explores the tangled fortunes of two working-class
Southern women and the New England teacher with whom they become
involved; stung hard by misfortune, the characters rely on courage,
irony and humor to pull them through. ``The book finds its
considerable power in Dodd's patient excavation of the complex
aftereffects of tragedy on the lives of the people who emerge ...
on the other side,'' Elizabeth Graver said here in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   LINDBERGH. By A. Scott Berg. Berkley, $16.
</P>
<P>
   This Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of Charles Lindbergh,
drawing on newly accessible private papers, ``provides enough fresh
detail to trace the roots of Lindbergh's personality, its strengths
as well as its maddening flaws, all the way back to his turbulent
boyhood,'' Geoffrey C. Ward wrote here in 1998. IN UNDER A WING: A
MEMOIR, by Reeve Lindbergh (Delta, $12.95), Lindbergh's sixth and
youngest child recalls a loving, active father who sought a rigidly
ordered life and absolute control over events and people. Last year
in these pages, Ward called this a ``wonderful family memoir.''
</P>
<P>
   ZARAFA: A GIRAFFE'S TRUE STORY, FROM DEEP IN AFRICA TO THE HEART
OF PARIS. By Michael Allin. Delta, $9.95.
</P>
<P>
   In 1826 the Ottoman viceroy of Egypt sent a 12-foot giraffe to
King Charles X of France, and the beast's 550-mile trip from
Marseilles to Paris captivated the nation. ``Allin does a terrific
job of chronicling the giraffe's remarkable pilgrimage ... as well
as analyzing the profound effect the animal had on the French
people,'' Carolyn T. Hughes wrote here in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   MY SISTER FROM THE BLACK LAGOON: A NOVEL OF MY LIFE. By Laurie
Fox. Scribner, $13.
</P>
<P>
   The narrator of this unusual coming-of-age story is forced to
grow up in the shadow of her mentally ill older sister, whose
ravings torment her family. ``The novel is honest, entertaining
and, in parts, downright wacky,'' Valerie Frankel wrote here last
year.
</P>
<P>
   THE EXTRA MAN. By Jonathan Ames. Washington Square/Pocket Books,
$12.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Ives is an aspiring gentleman about town with a troubled
past who befriends a debonair but eccentric elderly playwright.
Last year our reviewer, Stephanie Zacharek, called this novel ``a
sure-footed exploration of sexual confusion and a loopily elegant,
surprisingly moving urban comedy of manners.''

ZIP - ARIZONA PRODUCES NOTHING IN LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STATE COLLEGE, Pa. _ Penn State Coach Joe Paterno said he would
have preferred Akron. He didn't get the school. But he got the
nickname right.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona was a collection of Zips.
</P>
<P>
   In an embarrassing 41-7 loss Saturday to the Nittany Lions in
the Pigskin Classic, the Wildcats had no zip and were left with zip
as they now sift through the rubble in an attempt to restore all
the promise that they seemed to possess.
</P>
<P>
   If anything was proven by the rout, it is simply that preseason
pollsters don't know zip. Just 48 hours ago, the Wildcats were
ranked among the nation's top five teams in virtually every poll.
</P>
<P>
   According to the rankings that are supposed to serve as the
season's road map, the Wildcats were going to challenge Penn State
en route to a Pac-10 championship.
</P>
<P>
   But these particular mapmakers might as well be the same people
who thought the world was flat. Penn State simply pushed the
Wildcats over the edge. During 11 games over the next three months,
the Wildcats will discover whether oblivion is their fate.
</P>
<P>
   Within a subdued dressing room after a very long afternoon at
Beaver Stadium, the Wildcats already were talking resurrection.
Miracles do happen. But they also had to confront the fact that on
this day, they were overwhelmed and overrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not the best in the Pac-10,'' Arizona quarterback Ortege
Jenkins said to a circle of reporters. ``We're not No. 3. Their
fans said we were overrated. That's a fact. It's true, and you guys
know it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad no points are given for honesty. The Wildcats would
have scored plenty of them in the locker room after the game. Other
than a meaningless touchdown in the closing moments, they couldn't
score from anywhere else or at any other time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They beat us as bad as a team can be beat,'' said Arizona
Coach Dick Tomey, whose team was ranked No. 4 by the Associated
Press and No. 3 by the coaches who vote in the ESPN/USA Today
version. ``It was one of those games. It was a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Signs of a rout were abundant when Penn State took the opening
kickoff and marched 80 yards in seven plays. The Nittany Lions'
initial score summed up the game. On the drive, at least three
tackles were missed by an Arizona defense that has no replacement
for last year's All-America cornerback, Chris McAlister.
</P>
<P>
   On the touchdown itself, Arizona cornerback Kelvin Hunter didn't
pursue Penn State flanker Chafie Fields so much as bump into him.
Fields had just caught a pass from Kevin Thompson at about
Arizona's 25-yard line. He bounced off Hunter and raced, untouched,
for the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a poor tackling team,'' said Tomey, who endured more
of the same until the half ended with Penn State leading, 31-0.
``They outhit us. They were tougher, more physical.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn State's defense was expected to be tough. On that one, at
least, the prognostication crowd was right on the mark. With
linebacker LaVar Arrington setting the tone, the Nittany Lions shut
the door on Arizona. It was as if last year's explosive offense had
imploded.
</P>
<P>
   Trung Canidate, an explosive runner most of last season, was
virtually stopped by a swarming defense that probably stopped his
Heisman Trophy campaign as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their defense did a lot of talking coming into this game,''
said Canidate, who was held to 31 yards on 10 carries. ``Give them
credit. They did what they said they were going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the Nittany Lions made an important defensive
adjustment in the early going. The surprise was an inability to
counter by an Arizona offense that suddenly looked dull. For the
most part, this is the same Arizona offense that was so dynamic
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats had some success moving the ball on their first
possession. Keith Smith, the starter at quarterback, found Dennis
Northcutt for consecutive completions of 29 and 26 yards.
</P>
<P>
   They drove 63 yards to the Penn State 18 when the offense
stalled. Canidate couldn't find an opening behind an offensive line
that was overmatched. Then Tomey ordered a 40-yard field goal
attempt. Mark McDonald's kick went awry, and the rest of the
offense soon followed.
</P>
<P>
   A key, Jenkins said, was Penn State's decision to double-team
Northcutt.
</P>
<P>
   ``They dropped in a safety on Dennis and that took away our best
option,'' he said. ``We didn't create anything after that. They
made us play their game.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn State's game might prove to be its very best this season.
If the polls were so woefully wrong about Arizona, they might be
absolutely right about the Nittany Lions, who were ranked No. 3 by
the Associated Press and No. 1 by ``Sports Illustrated''.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they're a great team,'' said Tomey, whose team really
is in for a nightmare if the pollsters are as wrong about Penn
State as they were about the Wildcats. &QL;

LIONS EXPOSE ARIZONA AS PAC-10 WIMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STATE COLLEGE, Pa. - What a lovely display of cotton candy
football.
</P>
<P>
   What a terrible way to meet the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State 41, Arizona 7.
</P>
<P>
   Pffffft.
</P>
<P>
   So the Wildcats came to Linebacker U. hoping to make a lasting
impression, and boy, did they ever. In the same manner that
Limburger cheese adds presence to a refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Arizona only strengthened the perceptions that the
Pac-10 is all tofu, no steak. A conference for sissies.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats may recover from their trip to the shed, but their
image will not. No matter what they accomplish this season, most of
the nation will scoff. This sorry afternoon in the spotlight will
be a reference point that will not go away.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's not fair. But it's the way things work.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Big Ten, we try to get it done by bullying people,''
Penn State linebacker LaVar Arrington said. ``The West Coast uses a
lot of trickery.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is a nice way of saying the Lack-10 is soft. And when the
league's overwhelming favorite simply rolls over, who's to argue?
</P>
<P>
   Field goals were missed. A punt was blocked. In the first half,
Penn State averaged 11.6 yards every time it snapped the ball. And
in a massive show of disrespect, Arrington was signing autographs
for the Penn State faithful with three minutes left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I'm embarrassed,'' receiver Dennis Northcutt said. ``It
hurts. All this talk about Arizona is going to do this, Arizona is
ranked here . . . We didn't show up, and the whole country was
watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you don't give Joe Paterno eight months to prepare
for a home game and expect things to go smoothly. But Arizona boss
Dick Tomey had time as well, only to emerge as an overmatched
pretender.
</P>
<P>
   The play calling was both terrible and tentative in a few clutch
situations during the opening quarter. And the way the Wildcats
reacted on defense, you wonder whether they practiced tackling in
training camp. In fact, you wonder whether they practiced at all.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State functioned like a machine. Arizona's performance was
ragged and rough. Both are reflections of the men in charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just better prepared,'' quarterback Ortege Jenkins
said. ``They came out and punished us like we were a Pop Warner
team.''
</P>
<P>
   While admitting that he and his staff did a bad job, Tomey tried
to put a positive spin on the horrific effort. He claimed that the
pain will serve as a valuable lesson, that character will emerge
from the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   The temptation is to think that Penn State is in a class by
itself, but it won't be long before Paterno's crew is winning games
21-10 and 17-3. The offense is still suspect . . . an offense that
gained more than 500 yards against the Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   So Arizona has many holes to address, and this platoon system at
quarterback is still a bad idea. Jenkins is a wonderful athlete and
adds a different dimension to the offense, but Keith Smith is too
good to spend time on the sidelines. Especially in big games.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: On Saturday, Smith was yanked after starting the
game with nine consecutive completions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys may turn on us,'' Smith said. ``But we're going to do
the job. I think this is a good check for us. To see who will come
with us and who won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely, Arizona State fans had a wonderful time watching the
debacle. But before the gloating gets out of control, give Tomey
credit for pursuing this game. It was a risk that took courage, and
a contrast to ASU's decision to duck an invitation from Florida
State last season.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, a huge opportunity was squandered. The previous
